Translocation Tag directory Homework Problems Literature Learning Module Sphingomyelinase Activity Causes Transbilayer Lipid Translocation This page contains assessmentexam questions using data figures and graphs from research journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry which allow their use or from journals such as from PLOS that are completely open access The papers and topics chosen were selected to assess student understanding of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ASBMB foundational concepts and learning objectives as well as MCAT foundational concepts and objectives These two sets of standards broadly overlap Both ASBMB and the MCAT strongly emphasis scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are perhaps best assessed by openended questions derived from the literature in which students must employ higher level Bloom skills of application and analysis These questions can also be used by students who seek more opportunities to practice interpreting research literature results The ability to apply analyze and evaluate information and concepts are at the heart of scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are central to the new ASBMB and MCAT competency standards The questions in this learning module are designed to assess these competencies using openended responses instead of multiplechoice questions Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper Sphingomyelinase Activity Causes Transbilayer Lipid Translocation in Model and Cell Membranes F Xabier Contreras AnaVictoria Villar Alicia Alonso Richard N Kolesnick and Félix M Goñi The Journal of Biological Chemistry doi jbcM Sphingomyelin SM is a phospholipid localized mainly at the outer leaflet in microdomains or rafts of cell membranes It can be cleaved by the protein enzyme sphingomyelinase a phosphdiesterase resulting in the generation of ceramide in the membrane This enzyme cleaves SM in bilayer membranes This reaction is a hydrolysis catalyzed by the enzyme Draw a mechanism showing the hydrolysis in the absence of the enzyme which would alter the mechanism that would give ceramide Draw the Lewis structure of the other product as well Finally draw a cartoon of the enyzme with reactant in the active site Sphingomyelinase SMase can be activated when an external signal such as Vitamin D binds to a membrane receptor initiating a signal transduction activation of the cell One signal in the pathway would be alteration in the SM raft leading to changes in membrane protein arrangement and activity The study below was designed to address how SM hydrolysis alters lipid organization in bilayers LUVs were made with a lipid ratio of SMPECholesterol molar ratio and in the presence of a water soluble protein neuraminidase MW Note that these are artificial liposomes not biological membranes As such the SM would be expected to be equally distributed between the two leaflets Devise a method to remove free unencapsulated neuraminidase from the LUVs To study the properties of the LUVs they were treated with GM ganglioside in methanol in a volume of the LUV preparation A ganglioside is a glycolipid contains a nonpolar lipid and polar sugar head group usually found in membranes The sugar head group of GM consists of neuraminic acid galactose and glucose as shown in the structure below Note that the encapsulated neuraminidase cleaves the terminal glycoylneuraminic acid from GM The most common types of gangliosides are glycosphingolipids Since the final solution was MeOH an amount insufficient to alter liposome structure significantly LUVs remained intact Circle the polar head group Draw a cartoon diagram showing both layers of the LUV before and after addition of GM Use simple geometric representations for the lipid and the protein neuramindiase Dont use Lewis structures as cartoon representations for the lipids The water soluble enzyme sphingomyelinaseSMase was added to a suspension of these vesicles The extent of hydrolysis of as a function of time from to minutes and the effect on hydrolysis of excess amounts of the nonionic detergent Triton X with time minutes are shown below in Figure A Previous experiments hadshown that this Triton X concentration did not inhibit sphingomyelinase or neuraminidase Figure A Sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase Average values SE n Average values SE n Explain using a cartoon and words the changes in the LUV on addition of SMase and of TX The same experiment was repeated addition of SMase to the LUVs but instead of monitoring SM hydrolysis glycoylneuraminic acid cleavage from the added GM was studied Aliquots of the vesicle suspension were removed at fixed timesafter the addition of sphingomyelinase and analyzed for theGM product of neuraminidase activity The results are shown in Figure B below Figure B GM ganglioside hydrolysis by entrapped neuraminidase Average values SE n Describe the main difference in the results shown in graph b compared to A Explain using a cartoon and words the changes in the LUV on addition of SMase and of TX How was added GM which is found in the outer leaflet cleaved by neuramidase which is encapsulated One explanation was that some encapsulated neuramidase leaked from the inside to the outside and the GM cleaved in the above experiment was in the outer leaftletTo determine if neuraminidase was present on the outside of the LUVs its activity against SMase treated vesicles as describe above was determined The LUVs were filtered through membrane with small pores allowing free neuramidase to pass through but not encapsulated LUV They assayed the neuramidase using a soluble substrate of the enzyme NacetylneuraminylGalGlu The results are shown in Figure A Figure A Fraction of released neuraminidase in the time course of sphingomyelinase action Free neuraminidase was separated from the vesicles by filtration Average values SE n Does the constant presence of neuramindase present from minutes suggest constant leakage from the LUVs or an leakage arising from the filtration method Note that the value at minutes the moment of SMase addition is the same at later times Explain Are the results consistent with the cleavage of GM shown in figure B from leaked neuramindase Vesiclescontaining GM but not sphingomyelinase or internal neuraminidasewere treated with neuraminidase at the concentration found inthe filtrates above Figure B hydrolyzed GM ganglioside when LUVs not containing neuraminidase were treated with the same amount of neuraminidase that was released in the experiment in A Average values of two closely similar experiments O data of Figure B SMase added to LUVs with encapsulated neuraminidase replotted for comparison Compare the times course of GM hydrolysisis totally different from the one depending on sphingomyelinaseactivity Suggest a hypothesis to account for the enhanced hydrolysis of GM in the presence of SMase Draw a cartoon diagram in your explanation In another experiment antibody that binds and neutralizes the activity of neuraminidase was added to preformed LUVs and experiment repeated The graphs below the two cases Figure C GM ganglioside hydrolysis by LUVs with encapsulated neuraminidase with and without antineuraminidase antibody added to the LUV suspension Average values SE n The paper did not define the symbols but one is in the absence of added antibody and the other in the presence of added antibody The curves differ little Using the data presented in Graphs draw a cartoon and explain the sequence of events in the cleavage of GM by neuraminidase LUVs identical to those made above but with the added fluorophore NBDPE were prepared The structure of NBDPE is shown below After the LUVs were made the liposomes were treated with the membraneimpermeant sodium dithionite which reduces NBD fluorescence Excess dithionitewas removed immediately by gel filtration Note any remaining flourescence is from inner leaflet NBDPE LUVs were then treated withsphingomyelinase Enzyme activity was the same as describedin Figure A Aliquots were removed from the reaction mixtureat regular intervals and mixed with an impermeant nonspecific antibody IgG labeled with another fluorophore rhodamine When NBD is excited with UV light it fluorescence emission wavelength overlaps the excitation wavelength of rhodamine If the two fluorphores are close enough excitation of NBD can lead to rhodamine fluorescence emission in a process called fluorescence resonance energy transfer Figure Excitation Emission ___Spectra of NBD green and rhodamine blue Results are shown in the Figure below Control experiments also shown in the figureindicated that in the absence of sphingomyelinase NBDPE fluorescenceremained invariant with time Figure Sphingomyelin hydrolysis as in Figure A time course of NBDPE fluorescence intensity O time course of RhoIgG fluorescence intensity triangles are the respective controls in the absence of sphingomyelinase Compare the relative changes see in the presence of SMase with the relative lack of change in its absence Are these results consistent with the results from the other experiments above Answers Literature Learning Module Lipids
