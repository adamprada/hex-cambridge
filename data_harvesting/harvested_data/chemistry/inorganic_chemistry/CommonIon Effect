various salts acids and bases Calculate concentrations involving common ions Calculate ion concentrations involving chemical equilibrium The commonion effect is used to describe the effect on an equilibrium involving a substance that adds an ion that is a part of the equilibrium Introduction The solubility products Ksps are equilibrium constants in hetergeneous equilibria ie between two different phases If several salts are present in a system they all ionize in the solution If the salts contain a common cation or anion these salts contribute to the concentration of the common ion Contributions from all salts must be included in the calculation of concentration of the common ion For example a solution containing sodium chloride and potassium chloride will have the following relationship Consideration of charge balance or mass balance or both leads to the same conclusion Common Ions When and are dissolved in the same solution the ions are common to both salts In a system containing and the ions are common ions For example when is dissolved into a solution already containing actually and ions the ions come from the ionization of both and Thus differs from The following examples show how the concentration of the common ion is calculated Example What are and in a solution containing M each of and Solution Due to the conservation of ions we have but beginalignat ceCl textrm due to NaCl mathrm due to CaCl_ mathrm due to HCl mathrm M endalignat Exercise John poured mL of M mL of M and mL of M solutions together and then he made the total volume to be mL What is in the final solution Le Châteliers Principle states that if an equilibrium becomes unbalanced the reaction will shift to restore the balance If a common ion is added to a weak acid or weak base equilibrium then the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants in this case the weak acid or base Example Consider the leadII ion concentration in this saturated solution of PbCl The balanced reaction is Defining as the concentration of dissolved leadII chloride then These values can be substituted into the solubility product expression which can be solved for The concentration of leadII ions in the solution is x M Consider what happens if sodium chloride is added to this saturated solution Sodium chloride shares an ion with leadII chloride The chloride ion is common to both of them this is the origin of the term common ion effect Look at the original equilibrium expression again What happens to that equilibrium if extra chloride ions are added According to Le Châtelier the position of equilibrium will shift to counter the change in this case by removing the chloride ions by making extra solid leadII chloride Of course the concentration of leadII ions in the solution is so small that only a tiny proportion of the extra chloride ions can be converted into solid leadII chloride The leadII chloride becomes even less soluble and the concentration of leadII ions in the solution decreases This type of response occurs with any sparingly soluble substance it is less soluble in a solution which contains any ion which it has in common This is the common ion effect A Simple Example If an attempt is made to dissolve some leadII chloride in some M sodium chloride solution instead of in water what is the equilibrium concentration of the leadII ions this time As before define s to be the concentration of the leadII ions The calculations are different from before This time the concentration of the chloride ions is governed by the concentration of the sodium chloride solution The number of ions coming from the leadII chloride is going to be tiny compared with the M coming from the sodium chloride solution In calculations like this it can be assumed that the concentration of the common ion is entirely due to the other solution This simplifies the calculation So we assume The rest of the mathematics looks like this beginequation beginsplit K_sp PbCl s times times s times endsplit endequation therefore beginequation beginsplit s dfrac times times textM endsplit label endequation Finally compare that value with the simple saturated solution Original solution Solution in M NaCl solution The concentration of the leadII ions has decreased by a factor of about If more concentrated solutions of sodium chloride are used the solubility decreases further Adding a common ion to a system at equilibrium affects the equilibrium composition but not the ionization constant Common Ion Effect with Weak Acids and Bases Adding a common ion prevents the weak acid or weak base from ionizing as much as it would without the added common ion The common ion effect suppresses the ionization of a weak acid by adding more of an ion that is a product of this equilibrium Example The common ion effect of HO on the ionization of acetic acid The common ion effect suppresses the ionization of a weak base by adding more of an ion that is a product of this equilibrium Example Consider the common ion effect of OH on the ionization of ammonia Adding the common ion of hydroxide shifts the reaction towards the left to decrease the stress in accordance with Le Châteliers Principle forming more reactants This decreases the reaction quotient because the reaction is being pushed towards the left to reach equilibrium The equilibrium constant Kb does not change The reaction is put out of balance or equilibrium At first when more hydroxide is added the quotient is greater than the equilibrium constant The reaction then shifts right causing the denominator to increase decreasing the reaction quotient and pulling towards equilibrium and causing Q to decrease towards K Common Ion Effect on Solubility Adding a common ion decreases solubility as the reaction shifts toward the left to relieve the stress of the excess product Adding a common ion to a dissociation reaction causes the equilibrium to shift left toward the reactants causing precipitation Example Consider the reaction What happens to the solubility of PbCls when M NaCl is added Solution Identify the common ion Cl Notice Qsp Ksp The addition of NaCl has caused the reaction to shift out of equilibrium because there are more dissociated ions Typically solving for the molarities requires the assumption that the solubility of PbCl is equivalent to the concentration of Pb produced because they are in a ratio Because Ksp for the reaction is the overall reaction would be ss Solving the equation for s gives s M The coefficient on Cl is so it is assumed that twice as much Cl is produced as Pb hence the s The solubility equilibrium constant can be used to solve for the molarities of the ions at equilibrium The molarity of Cl added would be M because Na and Cl are in a ration in the ionic salt NaCl Therefore the overall molarity of Cl would be s with s referring to the contribution of the chloride ion from the dissociation of lead chloride Notice that the molarity of Pb is lower when NaCl is added The equilibrium constant remains the same because of the increased concentration of the chloride ion To simplify the reaction it can be assumed that Cl is approximately M since the formation of the chloride ion from the dissociation of lead chloride is so small The reaction quotient for PbCl is greater than the equilibrium constant because of the added Cl This therefore shift the reaction left towards equilibrium causing precipitation and lowering the current solubility of the reaction Overall the solubility of the reaction decreases with the added sodium chloride References Harwood William S F G Herring Jeffry D Madura and Ralph H Petrucci General Chemistry Principles and Modern Applications th ed New Jersey Prentice Hall Contributors and
