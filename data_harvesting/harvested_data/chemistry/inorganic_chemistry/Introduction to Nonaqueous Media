No headers The Brønsted theory encompasses any type of solvent that can donate and accept ions not just aqueous solutions The strength of an acid or a base varies depending on the solvent Nonaqueous acidbase chemistry follows similar rules to those developed for acids and bases in water For example in liquid ammonia the solvent autodissociates in the reaction This equilibrium is analogous to the autodissociation of water but has a smaller equilibrium constant K It follows by analogy to water that NH is the strongest acid and NH is the strongest base that can exist in liquid ammonia Because ammonia is a basic solvent it enhances the acidity and suppresses the basicity of substances dissolved in it For example the ammonium ion NH is a weak acid in water Ka x but it is a strong acid in ammonia Similarly acetic acid is weak in water but strong in ammonia Solvent leveling in fact makes CHCOOH and NHCl both strong acids in ammonia where they have equivalent acid strength Strong acids that are leveled in water have different acid strengths in acidic solvents such as HF or anhydrous acetic acid For example acid dissociation of HX in acetic acid CHCOOH involves protonating the solvent to make its conjugate acid CHCOOH and the X anion Because CHCOOH is a stronger acid that HO the anion X which is a spectator in water can become a weak base in CHCOOH It follows that acidic solvents magnify the Brønsted basicities of substances that cannot accept protons in water Conversely basic solvents magnify the acidity of substances that cannot donate a proton to The acidity and basicity of nonaqueous solvents is difficult to quantify precisely but one good relative measure is the Hammett acidity function which is defined analogously to pH according to the HendersonHasselbach equation For nonaqueous solvents or for acidic or basic compounds in dissolved in solvents that do not themselves dissociate Ho is a rough measure of the pH of the solvent or compound in question Anhydrous HF and HSO have Ho values of approximately and respectively
