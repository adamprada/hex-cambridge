IntroductionZincblende SphaleriteThermal stabilityWurtziteCalculating density of a crystal structureContributors ZnS has a unique structure type compared to other molecules having different types of unique structures ZnS can have a zinc blende structure which is a diamondtype network and at a different temperature ZnS can become the wurtzite structure type which has a hexagonal type symmetry Structurewise the zinc blende structure is more thermodynamically favored however because of the wurtzite structures slow construction both forms of ZnS can be found Summary Zinc blend is a compound that comes in two forms sphalerite and wurtzite These are characterized by a stoichiometric ratio of Zinc to Sulfur It maintains a tetrahedral arrangement in both forms Introduction Zinc sulfide ZnS is a unique compound that forms two types of crystalline structures These two polymorphs are wurtzite and zincblende also known as sphalerite Wurtzite has a hexagonal structure while zincblende is cubic It is characterized by single bonds between each atom and maintenance of a zinc to sulfur ratio sphalerite Site Zn S Central Face Corner Total Since the number of atoms in a single unit cell of Zn and S is the same it is consistent with the formula ZnS The ionic radius for Zn is pm and for S is pm Therefore the ratio between cationic and anionic radii in zinc blend is pm pm This suggests a tetrahedral ion arrangement and four nearest neighbors from standard crystal structure prediction tables Therefore four sulfur atoms surround each zinc atom and four zinc atoms surround each sulfur atom The coordination number the number of of electron pairs donated to a metal by its ligands for both zinc an sulfur is four The difference between wurtzite and zincblende lies in the different arrangements of layers of ions Zincblende Sphalerite Zincblende is characterized as a cubic closet packing ccp also known as facecentered cubic structure This crystal lattice structure is shown in Figures below Fig A break down of cubic closest packing Author Magh√©mite Date May Licensed under the Creative Commons AttributionShare Alike Unported Generic Generic and Generic license Fig A representation of ccp structure from Public Domain Notice how only half of the tetrahedral sites are occupied Thermal stability Density tends to decrease as temperature increases In this case since ccp structures are more dense than hcp structures so a conversion from sphalerite to wurtzite occurs naturally over time at a rate similar to that of diamond to graphite The sphalerite structure is favored at k by kJmol but at K the transition to wurtzite occurs Wurtzite Wurtzite has a hexagonal closest packing structure hcp which is characterized by ions in the corners of each unit that create a hexagonal prism seen in Fig As discussed previously zincblende slowly transforms to wurtzite due to thermodynamic stability Fig HCP structure of wurtzite Creator Alexander Mann Date Licensed under the Creative Commons AttributionShare Alike Germany license Calculating density of a crystal structure Density Mass of unit cell volume of unit cell where Mass of unit cell Number of atoms in a unit cell x the mass of each atom volume of unit cell a x Contributors Emma Mele UC Davis Animal Biology
