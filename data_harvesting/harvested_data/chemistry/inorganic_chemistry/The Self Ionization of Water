Solvated H ionsWater Solvated H ions The hydron a completely free or naked hydrogen atomic nucleus is far too reactive to exist in isolation and readily hydrates in aqueous solution The simplest hydrated form of the hydrogen cation the hydronium hydroxonium ion HO aq is a key object of Arrhenius definition of acid Other simple hydrated forms include the Zundel cation HO which is formed from a hydron and two water molecules and the Eigen cation HO formed from a hydronium ion and three water molecules The hydron itself is crucial in the more general Br√∏nstedLowry acidbase theory which extends the concept of acidbase chemistry beyond aqueous solutions Both of these complexes represent ideal structures in a more general hydrogen bonded network defect A freezingpoint depression study determined that the mean hydration ion in cold water is on average approximately HOHO where each hydronium ion is solvated by water molecules Some hydration structures are quite large the HOHO magic ion number structure called magic because of its increased stability with respect to hydration structures involving a comparable number of water molecules Structure from Lancaster site In Theodor Grotthuss proposed a theory of water conductivity He envisioned the electrolytic reaction as a sort of bucket line where each oxygen atom simultaneously passes and receives a single hydrogen atom It was an astonishing theory to propose at the time since the water molecule was thought to be OH not HO and the existence of ions was not fully understood The theory became known as the Grotthuss mechanism The transport mechanism is now thought to involve the interconversion between the Eigen and Zundel solvation structures Eigen to Zundel to Eigen EZE Water
