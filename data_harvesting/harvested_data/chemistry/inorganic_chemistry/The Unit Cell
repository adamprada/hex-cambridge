lattice a repetitive unit of solid bricklike structures with opposite faces and equivalent edge points In Auguste Bravais proved that crystals could be split into fourteen unit cells Although there are several types of unit cells found in cubic lattices we will be discussing the basic ones Simple Cubic Bodycentered Cubic and Facecentered Cubic If any atom recrystalizes it will eventually become the original lattice Crystallization refers the purification processes of molecular or structures Introduction The Unit Cell contains seven crystal systems and fourteen crystal lattices These unit cells are given types and titles of symmetries but we will be focusing on cubic unit cells One of the most commonly known unit cells is rock salt NaCl Sodium Chloride an octahedral geometric unit cell The whole lattice can be reproduced when the unit cell is duplicated in a three dimensional structure These unit cells are imperative for quite a few metals and ionic solids crystallize into these cubic structures Calculating with unit cells is a simple task because edgelengths of the cell are equal along with all ‚Å∞ angles Simple Cubic Unit Cells Simple Cubic unit cells indicate when lattice points are only at the corners They are the simplest hence the title repetitive unit cell The lattice points at the corners make it easier for metals ions or molecules to be found within the crystalline structure This phenomena is rare due to the low packing of density but the closed packed directions give the cube shape Since the edges of each unit cell are equidistant each unit cell is identical In order to be labeled as a Simple Cubic unit cell each eight cornered same particle must at each of the eight corners This unit cell only contains one atom Its packing efficiency is about To packing efficiency we multiply eight corners by oneeighth for only oneeighth of the atom is part of each unit cell giving us one atom Corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell atom To calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows r An example of a Simple Cubic unit cell is Polonium Bodycentered Cubic Unit Cells Bodycentered Cubic BCC unit cells indicate where the lattice points appear not only at the corners but in the center of the unit cell as well The atoms touch one another along the cubes diagonal crossing but the atoms dont touch the edge of the cube All atoms are identical This type of unit cell is more common than that of the Simple Cubic unit cell due to tightly packed atoms Its packing efficiency is about compared to the Simple Cubic unit cells This unit cells contains two atoms To determine this we multiply the previous eight corners by oneeighth and add one for the additional lattice point in the center Corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell additional lattice point atoms To calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows Some examples of BCCs are Iron Chromium and Potassium It is a common mistake for CsCl to be considered bcc but it is not Instead it is nonclosed packed Facecentered Cubic Unit Cells Facecentered Cubic FCC unit cells indicate where the lattice points are at both corners and on each face of the cell This is a more common type of unit cell since the atoms are more tightly packed than that of a Simple Cubic unit cell Like the BCC the atoms dont touch the edge of the cube but rather the atoms touch diagonal to each face Its packing efficiency is the highest with a percentage of Atoms touch one another along the face diagonals All atoms are identical This unit cell contains four atoms To determine this we take the equation from the aforementioned Simple Cubic unit cell and add to the parenthesized six faces of the unit cell multiplied by onehalf due to the lattice points on each face of the cubic cell corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell faces x contribution atoms To calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows Some examples of FCCs

your answer Diagram Give two other examples none of which is shown above of a FaceCentered Cubic Structure metal Briefly explain your reasonings Silver crystallizes with a FCC the raidus of the atom is pm What is the density of the solid silver in grams per cubic centimeters Answers Polonium is a Simple Cubic unit cell so the equation for the edge length is r Therefore pm pm Caesium Chloride is a nonclosed packed unit cell It is common for one to mistake this as a bodycentered cubic but it is not The reason for this is because the ions do not touch one another Also in order to be considered BCC all the atoms must be the same Since the middle atome is different than the corner atoms this is not a BCC Two examples of a FCC cubic structure metals are Lead and Aluminum Each contains four atoms six of which run diagonally on each face We approach this problem by first finding the mass of the unit cell Mass of Silver is gmol thus we divide by Avagadros number x We end up with x gatom Next we find the mass of the unit cell by multiplying the number of atoms in the unit cell by the mass of each atom x gatom x grams Next we find the edge length by Which equals x meters Now we find the volume which equals the edge length to the third power We convert meters into centimeters by dividing the edge length by cmm to the third power x m x cmm x cubic centimeters Finally we find the density by mass divided by volume So x grams x cubic centimeters gcm Contributors Sonika SidherUC Davis
