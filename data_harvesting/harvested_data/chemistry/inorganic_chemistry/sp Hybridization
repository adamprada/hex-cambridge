IntroductionReferencesProblemsContributors Introduction The term sp hybridization refers to the mixing character of one sorbital and three porbitals to create four hybrid orbitals with similar characteristics In order for an atom to be sp hybridized it must have an s orbital and three p orbitals From wave function to the visual representation Four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals resulting from the combination of one s atomic orbital and three p atomic orbitals can then describe by four new wave functions equations ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz Plotting any of these four wave functions gives a picture representation of a sp orbital Each hybrid orbital consists of a large lobe and a small lobe pointing in two opposite direction figure The Bond Angle is o When the graphs of the four wave functions are combined the resulting picture shows the tetrahedral arrangement of the four sp hybrid orbitals around the central atom Because of the tetrahedral molecular geometry the calculate bond angles between and and and and and and and approximately equal o figure The Energy level and election population All four sp hybrid orbitals are delocalizedthey occupy the same energy level however they are higher in energy than the s orbital and lower in energy than the p orbital figure Just like any other atomic orbital each sp hybrid orbital can house elections Scharacter and the stability of the anion Each sp orbital has part of scharacter to parts of pcharacter In other words it has scharacter and pcharacter Since the s orbital is closer to the nucleus and thus lower in energy than the p orbital the electrons of sp hybridized species are held farther from the nucleus than those in sp scharacter and sp scharacter hybridized species The closer the electrons are to the nucleus the more stable they are Therefore when bearing the negative charge sp species are less stable than sp and sp species Put differently sp species are less likely to get deprotonated leaving a pair of electron behind Hybridization and bond lengthbond strength The greater the scharacter the closer the electrons are held to the nucleus the shorter the bond and the stronger the bond Thus sp hybridized atoms form longer and weaker bonds than those of sp and sp hybridizedReferences Brown W H Foote C S Iverson B L Anslyn E V Organic Chemistry th Ed BrooksCole Cengage Learning Problems Which of the carbons isare sp hybridized Draw the energy diagram for the orbitals of sp hybridzied carbon and nitrogen Then fill in the correct number of electron Indicate the hybridization of oxygen in each molecule Which nitrogen atoms isare sp hybridized Describe the bonding scheme of CH Answers a and b Just like the energy diagram in fig For carbon each sp orbital has electron For nitrogen the first sp orbital has electrons then one electron for each of the remaining three All of them Dont for get the elctron pairs a and d Carbon has four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals Each orbital overlaps with a partially filled s atomic orbital of hydrogen to form sigma bonds To visualize hydrogen atoms are placed at the four corner of the tetrahedronContributors Quynh Nhu Nguyen
