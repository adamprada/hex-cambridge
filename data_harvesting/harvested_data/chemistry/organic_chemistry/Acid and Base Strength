ExercisesAnswersContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to write the expression for the Ka of a weak acid convert a given Ka value into a pKa value and vice versa arrange a series of acids in order of increasing or decreasing strength given their Ka or pKa values arrange a series of bases in order of increasing or decreasing strength given the Ka or pKa values of their conjugate acids Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below acidity constant Ka equilibrium constant Keq Study Notes Calculations and expressions involving Ka and pKa were covered in detail in your firstyear general chemistry course Note that acidity constant is also known as the acid dissociation constant You are no doubt aware that some acids are stronger than others Sulfuric acid is strong enough to be used as a drain cleaner as it will rapidly dissolve clogs of hair and other organic material Not surprisingly concentrated sulfuric acid will also cause painful burns if it touches your skin and permanent damage if it gets in your eyes theres a good reason for those safety goggles you wear in chemistry lab Acetic acid vinegar will also burn your skin and eyes but is not nearly strong enough to make an effective drain cleaner Water which we know can act as a proton donor is obviously not a very strong acid Even hydroxide ion could theoretically act as an acid it has after all a proton to donate but this is not a reaction that we would normally consider to be relevant in anything but the most extreme conditions The relative acidity of different compounds or functional groups in other words their relative capacity to donate a proton to a common base under identical conditions is quantified by a number called the acid dissociation constant abbreviated Ka The common base chosen for comparison is water We will consider acetic acid as our first example When a small amount of acetic acid is added to water a protontransfer event acidbase reaction occurs to some extent Notice the phrase to some extent this reaction does not run to completion with all of the acetic acid converted to acetate its conjugate base Rather a dynamic equilibrium is reached with proton transfer going in both directions thus the twoway arrows and finite concentrations of all four species in play The nature of this equilibrium situation as you recall from General Chemistry is expressed by an equilibrium constant K The equilibrium constant is actually a ratio of activities represented by the symbol but activities are rarely used in courses other than analytical or physical chemistry To simplify the discussion for general chemistry and organic chemistry courses the activities of all of the solutes are replaced with molarities and the activity of the solvent usually water is defined as having the value of In our example we added a small amount of acetic acid to a large amount of water water is the solvent for this reaction Therefore in the course of the reaction the concentration of water changes very little and the water can be treated as a pure solvent which is always assigned an activity of The acetic acid acetate ion and hydronium ion are all solutes and so their activities are approximated with molarities The acid dissociation constant or Ka for acetic acid is therefore defined as Because dividing by does not change the value of the constant the is usually not written and Ka is written as In more general terms the dissociation constant for a given acid is expressed as or Equation applies to a neutral acid such as like HCl or acetic acid while Equation applies to a cationic acid like ammonium NH The value of Ka x for acetic acid is very small this means that very little dissociation actually takes place and there is much more acetic acid in solution at equilibrium than there is acetate ion Acetic acid is a relatively weak acid at least when compared to sulfuric acid Ka or hydrochloric acid Ka both of which undergo essentially complete dissociation in water A number like x is not very easy either to say or to remember Chemists often use pKa values as a more convenient term to express relative acidity pKa is related to Ka by the following equation Doing the math we find that the pKa of acetic acid is The use of pKa values allows us to express the acidity of common compounds and functional groups on a numerical scale of about very strong acid to not acidic at all Table at the end of the text lists exact or approximate pKa values for different types of protons that you are likely to encounter in your study of organic and biological chemistry Looking at Table you see that the pKa of carboxylic acids are in the range the pKa of sulfuric acid is and the pKa of water is Alkenes and alkanes which are not acidic at all have pKa values above The lower the pKa value the stronger the acid Table Representative acid constants It is important to realize that pKa is not the same thing as pH pKa is an inherent property of a compound or functional group while pH is the measure of the hydronium ion concentration in a particular aqueous solution Any particular acid will always have the same pKa assuming that we are talking about an aqueous solution at room temperature but different aqueous solutions of the acid could have different pH values depending on how much acid is added to how much water Our table of pKa values will also allow us to compare the strengths of different bases by comparing the pKa values of their conjugate acids The key idea to remember is this the stronger the conjugate acid the weaker the conjugate base Sulfuric acid is the strongest acid on our list with a pKa value of so HSO is the weakest conjugate base You can see that hydroxide ion is a stronger base than ammonia NH because ammonium NH pKa is a stronger acid than water pKa The stronger the conjugate acid the weaker the conjugate base While Table provides the pKa values of only a limited number of compounds it can be very useful as a starting point for estimating the acidity or basicity of just about any organic molecule Here is where your familiarity with organic functional groups will come in very handy What for example is the pKa of cyclohexanol It is not on the table but as it is an alcohol it is probably somewhere near that of ethanol pKa Likewise we can use Table to predict that parahydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde an intermediate compound in the biosynthesis of morphine has a pKa in the neighborhood of close to that of our reference compound phenol Notice in this example that we need to evaluate the potential acidity at four different locations on the molecule Aldehyde and aromatic protons are not at all acidic pKa values are above not on our table The two protons on the carbon next to the carbonyl are slightly acidic with pKa values around according to the table The most acidic proton is on the phenol group so if the compound were to be reacted with a single molar equivalent of strong base this is the proton that would be donated first As you continue your study of organic chemistry it will be a very good idea to commit to memory the approximate pKa ranges of some important functional groups including water alcohols phenols ammonium thiols phosphates carboxylic acids and carbons next to carbonyl groups socalled acarbons These are the groups that you are most likely to see acting as acids or bases in biological organic reactions A word of caution when using the pKa table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair If you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia NH compared to that of ethoxide ion CHCHO for example the relevant pKa values to consider are the pKa of ammonium ion and the pKa of ethanol From these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base Do not make the mistake of using the pKa value of this is the pKa of ammonia acting as an acid and tells you how basic the NH ion is very basic Example Acidic Groups Using the pKa table estimate pKa values for the most acidic group on the compounds below and draw the structure of the conjugate base that results when this group donates a proton Use the pKa table above andor from the Reference Tables Answer a The most acidic group is the protonated amine pKa b Alpha proton by the CO group pKa c Thiol pKa d Carboxylic acid pKa e Carboxylic acid pKa Example Acetic acid CHCOOH is known to have a pKa of Please determine the Ka for acetic acid Solution Solving for Ka algebraically you get the following pKa LogKa pKa LogKa pKa Ka Using a calculator first enter in the value for the pKa The make the number negative Next use the inverse log function All calculators are slightly different so this function may appear as ANTILOG INV LOG or X Often it is the second function of the LOG button Ka for acetic acid pKa x Exercises Write down an expression for the acidity constant of acetic acid CHCOOH The pKa of acetic acid is calculate its Ka The Ka of benzoic acid is determine its pKa From your answers to the questions above determine whether acetic acid or benzoic acid is stronger Answers or Thus log K a and K a antilog Benzoic acid is stronger than acetic acid Benzoic acid has a higher Ka and a lower pKa Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC
