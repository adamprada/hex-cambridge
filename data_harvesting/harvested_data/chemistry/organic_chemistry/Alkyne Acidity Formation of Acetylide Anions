Acidity of Terminal Alkynes Formation of Acetylide AnionsQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to write an equation for the reaction that occurs between a terminal alkyne and a strong base such as sodamide NaNH rank a given list of compounds including water acetylene and ammonia in order of increasing or decreasing acidity rank a given list of hydrocarbons such as acetylene ethylene and ethane in order of increasing or decreasing acidity describe a general method for determining which of two given compounds is the stronger acid provide an acceptable explanation of why terminal alkynes are more acidic than alkanes or alkenes Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below acetylide anion acidity order Study Notes An acetylide anion is an anion formed by removing the proton from the end carbon of a terminal alkyne An acidity orderis a list of compounds arranged in order of increasing or decreasing acidity The general ideas discussed in this section should already be familiar to you from your previous exposure to chemistry and from the review in Section A slightly different account of why terminal alkynes are stronger acids than are alkenes or alkanes is given below However the argument is still based on the differences between sp sp and sphybrid orbitals The carbons of a triple bond are sphybridized An sphybrid orbital has a s character and a p character whereas an sphybrid orbital is s and p and an sphybrid orbital is s and p The greater the s character of the orbital the closer the electrons are to the nucleus Thus in a CspceH bond the bonding electrons are closer to the carbon nucleus than they are in a CspceH bond In other words compared to a CspceH bond or a CspceH bond a CspceH bond is very slightly polar CδceHδ This slight polarity makes it easier for a base to remove a proton from a terminal alkyne than from a less polar or nonpolar alkene or alkane As you will appreciate the reaction between sodium amide and a terminal alkyne is an acidbase reaction The sodium acetylide product is of course a salt Terminal alkynes can also form salts with certain heavymetal cations notably silverI and copperI In the laboratory component of this course you will use the formation of an insoluble silver acetylide as a method for distinguishing terminal alkynes from alkenes and nonterminal alkynes Metal acetylides are explosive when dry They should be destroyed while still wet by warming with dilute nitric acid Acidity of Terminal Alkynes Formation of Acetylide Anions Terminal alkynes are much more acidic than most other hydrocarbons Removal of the proton leads to the formation of an acetylide anion RCC The origin of the enhanced acidity can be attributed to the stability of the acetylide anion which has the unpaired electrons in an sp hybridized orbital The stability results from occupying an orbital with a high degree of sorbital character There is a strong correlation between scharacter in the orbital containing the nonbonding electrons in the anion and the acidity of hydrocarbons The enhanced acidity with greater scharacter occurs despite the fact that the homolytic CH BDE is larger Table Akynes Compound Conjugate Base Hybridization s Character pKa CH BDE kJmol CHCH CHCH sp CHCH CHCH sp HCCH HCC sp Consequently acetylide anions can be readily formed by deprotonation using a sufficiently strong base Amide anion NH in the form of NaNH is commonly used for the formation of acetylide anions Exercise Given that the pKa of water is would you expect hydroxide ion to be capable of removing a proton from each of the substances listed below Justify your answers briefly ethanol pKa acetic acid pKa acetylene pKa Answer a No not very well The pKa of ethanol is greater than that of water thus the equilibrium lies to the left rather than to the rightAdd texts here Do not delete this text first b Yes very well There is a difference of pKa units between the pKa of water and the pKa of acetic acid The equilibrium lies well to the right c No hardly at all The hydroxide ion is too weak a base to remove a proton from acetylene The equilibrium lies well to the left Questions Q If OH has a pKa of in water what pKa be required to deprotonate OH Solutions S Need a stronger base or a compound with a pKa to deprotonate Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Prof Paul G Wenthold Purdue University Layne Morsch University of Illinois Springfield
