Radical mechanisms for flavindependent reactionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to discuss briefly some of the addition reactions that take place in nature and the role of enzymes in such processes Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below enzyme coenzyme Study Notes You need not memorize the reaction described in this section of the textbook However you should note how the names of enzymes are derived from the reactions they catalyze for example ascorbic acid oxidase is the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ascorbic acid vitamin C Radical mechanisms for flavindependent reactions Flavin coenzymes like their nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD counterparts can act as hydride acceptors and donors In these redox reactions two electrons are transferred together in the form of a hydride ion Flavin however is also capable of mediating chemical steps in which a single unpaired electron is transferred in other words radical chemistry This is due to the ability of the flavin system to form a stabilized radical intermediate called a semiquinone formed when FADH or FMNH donates a single electron or when FAD or FMN accepts a single electron This singleelectron transfer capability of flavins is critical to their metabolic role as the entry point of electrons into the electron transport phase of respiration Electrons harvested from the oxidation of fuel molecules are channeled one by one by FMNH into the electron transport chain where they eventually reduce molecular oxygen NADH is incapable of single electron transfer all it can do is transfer two electrons in the form of a hydride to FMN the regenerated FMNH is then able to continue sending single electrons into the transport chain You will learn more details about this process in a biochemistry class Because flavins are capable of singleelectron as well as twoelectron chemistry the relevant mechanisms of flavoenzymecatalyzed reactions are often more difficult to determine Recall the dehydrogenation reaction catalyzed by acylCoA dehydrogenase section C it involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons ie a hydrogen molecule to FAD Both electrons could be transferred together with the FAD coenzyme simply acting as a hydride acceptor this is the mechanism we considered previously However because the oxidizing coenzyme being used is FAD rather than NAD it is also possible that the reaction could proceed by a singleelectron radical intermediate process In the alternate radical mechanism proposed below for example the enolate intermediate first donates a single electron to FAD forming a radical semiquinone intermediate step The second electron is transferred when the semiquinone intermediate abstracts a hydrogen from Cb in a homolytic fashion step Scientists are still not sure which mechanism the hydride transfer mechanism that we saw in section B or the single electron transfer detailed above more accurately depicts what is going on in this reaction The conjugated elimination catalyzed by chorismate synthase section B is another example of a reaction where the participation of flavin throws doubt on the question of what is the relevant mechanism This could simply be a conjugated E reaction with formation of an allylic carbocation intermediate The question plaguing researchers studying this enzyme however is why FADH is required This is not a redox reaction and correspondingly FADH is not used up in the course of the transformation it just needs to be bound in the active site in order for the reaction to proceed Given that flavins generally participate in singleelectron chemistry this is an indication that radical intermediates may be involved Recently an alternative mechanism involving a flavin semiquinone intermediate has been proposed J Biol Chem Notice that a single electron is transferred from substrate to coenzyme in step then transferred back in step Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
