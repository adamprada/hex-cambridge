Geometric cis trans isomerismHow to recognize the possibility of geometric isomerismSummaryExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to discuss the formation of carboncarbon double bonds using the concept of sp hybridization describe the geometry of compounds containing carboncarbon double bonds compare the molecular parameters bond lengths strengths and angles of a typical alkene with those of a typical alkane explain why free rotation is not possible about a carboncarbon double bond explain why the lack of free rotation about a carboncarbon double bond results in the occurrence of cistrans isomerism in certain alkenes decide whether or not cistrans isomerism is possible for a given alkene and where such isomerism is possible draw the Kekul√© structure of each isomer Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below cistrans stereoisomers Study Notes Your previous studies in chemistry may have prepared you to discuss the nature of a carboncarbon double bond If not you should review Section of this course before beginning the present section It is particularly important that you make molecular models of some simple alkenes to gain insight into the geometry of these compounds Geometric isomerism also known as cistrans isomerism or EZ isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism Isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of the atoms in space That excludes any different arrangements which are simply due to the molecule rotating as a whole or rotating about particular bonds Where the atoms making up the various isomers are joined up in a different order this is known as structural isomerism Structural isomerism is not a form of stereoisomerism and is dealt with in a separate Module Geometric cis trans isomerism These isomers occur where you have restricted rotation somewhere in a molecule At an introductory level in organic chemistry examples usually just involve the carboncarbon double bond and thats what this page will concentrate on Think about what happens in molecules where there is unrestricted rotation about carbon bonds in other words where the carboncarbon bonds are all single The next diagram shows two possible configurations of dichloroethane These two models represent exactly the same molecule You can get from one to the other just by twisting around the carboncarbon single bond These molecules are not isomers If you draw a structural formula instead of using models you have to bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bonds You must accept that these two structures represent the same molecule But what happens if you have a carboncarbon double bond as in dichloroethene These two molecules are not the same The carboncarbon double bond wont rotate and so you would have to take the models to pieces in order to convert one structure into the other one That is a simple test for isomers If you have to take a model to pieces to convert it into another one then youve got isomers If you merely have to twist it a bit then you havent Drawing structural formulae for the last pair of models gives two possible isomers In one the two chlorine atoms are locked on opposite sides of the double bond This is known as the trans isomer trans from latin meaning across as in transatlantic In the other the two chlorine atoms are locked on the same side of the double bond This is know as the cis isomer cis from latin meaning on this side The most likely example of geometric isomerism you will meet at an introductory level is butene In one case the CH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond and in the other case they are on the same side The importance of drawing geometric isomers properly Its very easy to miss geometric isomers in exams if you take shortcuts in drawing the structural formulae For example it is very tempting to draw butene as CHCHCHCH If you write it like this you will almost certainly miss the fact that there are geometric isomers If there is even the slightest hint in a question that isomers might be involved always draw compounds containing carboncarbon double bonds showing the correct bond angles around the carbon atoms at the ends of the bond In other words use the format shown in the last diagrams above How to recognize the possibility of geometric isomerism You obviously need to have restricted rotation somewhere in the molecule Compounds containing a carboncarbon double bond have this restricted rotation Other sorts of compounds may have restricted rotation as well but we are concentrating on the case you are most likely to meet when you first come across geometric isomers If you have a carboncarbon double bond you need to think carefully about the possibility of geometric isomers What needs to be attached to the carboncarbon double bond Think about this case Although weve swapped the righthand groups around these are still the same molecule To get from one to the other all you would have to do is to turn the whole model over You wont have geometric isomers if there are two groups the same on one end of the bond in this case the two pink groups on the lefthand end So there must be two different groups on the lefthand carbon and two different groups on the righthand one The cases weve been exploring earlier are like this But you could make things even more different and still have geometric isomers Here the blue and green groups are either on the same side of the bond or the opposite side Or you could go the whole hog and make everything different You still get geometric isomers but by now the words cis and trans are meaningless This is where the more sophisticated EZ notation comes in Summary To get geometric isomers you must have restricted rotation often involving a carboncarbon double bond for introductory purposes two different groups on the lefthand end of the bond and two different groups on the righthand end It doesnt matter whether the lefthand groups are the same as the righthand ones or not Exercises The reading shows the two geometric isomers of butene CH There are two other alkenes with the formula CH Draw their structures and determine whether they too can exist in cis and trans forms Answers methylpropene does not have cis and trans forms butene does not have cis and trans forms Questions Q Which of the following can have cistrans isomers Draw their isomers CHCHCHCH CHCHCCHCH CHCHCHCHCH Q Name the following compounds with cistrans nomenclature Solutions S The last compound in the list can be a cistrans isomer S A transmethylhexene B cisdibromohexene Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC
