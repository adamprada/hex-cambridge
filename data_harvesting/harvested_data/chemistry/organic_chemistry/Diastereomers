IntroductionDiastereomers vs EnantiomersExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to calculate the maximum number of stereoisomers possible for a compound containing a specified number of chiral carbon atoms draw wedgeandbrokenline structures for all possible stereoisomers of a compound containing two chiral carbon atoms with or without the aid of molecular models assign RS configurations to wedgeandbrokenline structures containing two chiral carbon atoms with or without the aid of molecular models determine with or without the aid of molecular models whether two wedgeandbrokenline structures containing two chiral carbon atoms are identical represent a pair of enantiomers or represent a pair of diastereomers draw the wedgeandbrokenline structure of a specific stereoisomer of a compound containing two chiral carbon atoms given its IUPAC name and RS configuration Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below diastereomer Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not related as object and mirror image and are not enantiomers Unlike enatiomers which are mirror images of each other and nonsumperimposable diastereomers are not mirror images of each other and nonsuperimposable Diastereomers can have different physical properties and reactivity They have different melting points and boiling points and different densities They have two or more stereocenters Introduction It is easy to mistake between diasteromers and enantiomers For example we have four steroisomers of bromobutanol The four possible combination are SS RR SR and RS Figure One of the molecule is the enantiomer of its mirror image molecule and diasteromer of each of the other two molecule SS is enantiomer of RR and diasteromer of RS and SR SSs mirror image is RR and they are not superimposable so they are enantiomers RS and SR are not mirror image of SS and are not superimposable to each other so they are diasteromers Figure Diastereomers vs Enantiomers Tartaric acid CHO is an organic compound that can be found in grape bananas and in wine The structures of tartaric acid itself is really interesting Naturally it is in the form of RR stereocenters Artificially it can be in the meso form RS which is achiral RR tartaric acid is enantiomer to is mirror image which is SS tartaric acid and diasteromers to mesotartaric acid Figure RR and SS tartaric acid have similar physical properties and reactivity However mesotartaric acid have different physical properties and reactivity For example melting point of RR SS tartaric is about degree Celsius and melting point of mesotartaric acid is about degree Celsius Figure We turn our attention next to molecules which have more than one stereocenter We will start with a common fourcarbon sugar called Derythrose A note on sugar nomenclature biochemists use a special system to refer to the stereochemistry of sugar molecules employing names of historical origin in addition to the designators D and L You will learn about this system if you take a biochemistry class We will use the DL designations here to refer to different sugars but we wont worry about learning the system As you can see Derythrose is a chiral molecule C and C are stereocenters both of which have the R configuration In addition you should make a model to convince yourself that it is impossible to find a plane of symmetry through the molecule regardless of the conformation Does Derythrose have an enantiomer Of course it does if it is a chiral molecule it must The enantiomer of erythrose is its mirror image and is named Lerythrose once again you should use models to convince yourself that these mirror images of erythrose are not superimposable Notice that both chiral centers in Lerythrose both have the S configuration Note In a pair of enantiomers all of the chiral centers are of the opposite configuration What happens if we draw a stereoisomer of erythrose in which the configuration is S at C and R at C This stereoisomer which is a sugar called Dthreose is not a mirror image of erythrose Dthreose is a diastereomer of both Derythrose and Lerythrose The definition of diastereomers is simple if two molecules are stereoisomers same molecular formula same connectivity different arrangement of atoms in space but are not enantiomers then they are diastereomers by default In practical terms this means that at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite in a pair of diastereomers By definition two molecules that are diastereomers are not mirror images of each other Lthreose the enantiomer of Dthreose has the R configuration at C and the S configuration at C Lthreose is a diastereomer of both erythrose enantiomers In general a structure with n stereocenters will have n different stereoisomers We are not considering for the time being the stereochemistry of double bonds that will come later For example lets consider the glucose molecule in its openchain form recall that many sugar molecules can exist in either an openchain or a cyclic form There are two enantiomers of glucose called Dglucose and Lglucose The Denantiomer is the common sugar that our bodies use for energy It has n stereocenters so therefore there are n possible stereoisomers including Dglucose itself In Lglucose all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose That leaves diastereomers of Dglucose these are molecules in which at least one but not all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose One of these diastereomers a sugar called Dgalactose is shown above in Dgalactose one of four stereocenters is inverted relative to Dglucose Diastereomers which differ in only one stereocenter out of two or more are called epimers Dglucose and Dgalactose can therefore be refered to as epimers as well as diastereomers Example Draw the structure of Lgalactose the enantiomer of Dgalactose Draw the structure of two more diastereomers of Dglucose One should be an epimer Answer Erythronolide B a precursor to the macrocyclic antibiotic erythromycin has stereocenters Its enantiomer is that molecule in which all stereocenters are inverted In total there are stereoisomers in the erythronolide B family of these are diastereomers of the structure above one is the enantiomer of the structure above and the last is the structure above We know that enantiomers have identical physical properties and equal but opposite degrees of specific rotation Diastereomers in theory at least have different physical properties we stipulate in theory because sometimes the physical properties of two or more diastereomers are so similar that it is very difficult to separate them In addition the specific rotations of diastereomers are unrelated they could be the same sign or opposite signs and similar in magnitude or very dissimilar Exercises
