formed between any two elements not listed in Objective above using a periodic table Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below electronegativity inductive effect polar covalent bond Study Notes Students often wonder why it is important to be able to tell whether a given bond is polar or not and why they need to know which atoms carry a partial positive charge and which a partial negative charge Consider the chloromethane CHCl molecule The carbon atom is shown as carrying a partial positive charge Now recall that opposite charges attract Thus it seems reasonable that the slightly positive carbon atom in chloromethane should be susceptible to attack by a negatively charged species such as the hydroxide ion OH This theory is borne out in practice hydroxide ions react with chloromethane by attacking the slightly positive carbon atom in the latter It is often possible to rationalize chemical reactions in this manner and you will find the knowledge of bond polarity indispensible when you start to write reaction mechanisms Note Because of the small difference in electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen the CH bond is normally assumed to be nonpolar Electronegativity Because the tendency of an element to gain or lose electrons is so important in determining its chemistry various methods have been developed to quantitatively describe this tendency The most important method uses a measurement called electronegativity represented by the Greek letter chi χ pronounced ky as in sky which is defined as the relative ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself in a chemical compound Elements with high electronegativities tend to acquire electrons in chemical reactions and are found in the upper right corner of the periodic table Elements with low electronegativities tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions and are found in the lower left corner of the periodic table Electronegativity of an atom is not a simple fixed property that can be directly measured in a single experiment In fact an atoms electronegativity should depend to some extent on its chemical environment because the properties of an atom are influenced by the neighboring atoms in a chemical compound Nevertheless when different methods for measuring the electronegativity of an atom are compared they all tend to assign similar relative values to a given element Figure shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century Linus Pauling In this scale a value of is arbitrarily given to the most electronegative element fluorine and the other electronegativities are scaled relative to this value In general electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group Thus the nonmetals which lie in the upper right tend to have the highest electronegativities with fluorine the most electronegative element of all EN as previously noted It is important to notice that the elements most important to organic chemistry carbon nitrogen and oxygen have some of the highest electronegativites in the periodic table EN respectively Metals on the left tend to be less electronegative elements with cesium having the lowest EN Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell Electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom in a particular molecule to attract electrons to itself The larger the electronegativity value the greater the attraction Figure Pauling scale electronegativities of elements Figure Visual representation of electronegativities Electronegativity and Bond Type The two idealized extremes of chemical bonding ionic bondingin which one or more electrons are transferred completely from one atom to another and the resulting ions are held together by purely electrostatic forcesand covalent bonding in which electrons are shared equally between two atoms Most compounds however have polar covalent bonds which means that electrons are shared unequally between the bonded atoms Electronegativity determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a polar covalent bond The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds the larger its electronegativity Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom thus the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge The greater the difference in electronegativity the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms Recall that a lowercase Greek delta δ is used to indicate that a bonded atom possesses a partial positive charge indicated by δ or a partial negative charge indicated by δ and a bond between two atoms that possess partial charges is a polar bond Figure The Electron Distribution in a Nonpolar Covalent Bond a Polar Covalent Bond and an Ionic Bond Using Lewis Electron Structures Electronrich negatively charged regions are shown in blue electronpoor positively charged regions are shown in red Whether a bond is ionic nonpolar covalent or polar covalent can be estimated by by calculating the absolute value of the difference in electronegativity ΔEN of two bonded atoms When the difference is very small or zero the bond is covalent and nonpolar When it is large the bond is polar covalent or ionic The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds HH HCl and NaCl are nonpolar polar covalent and ionic respectively The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies from completely equal pure covalent bonding to not at all ionic bonding Figure shows the relationship between electronegativity difference and bond type This table is just a general guide however with many exceptions The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent bonding between a metal and a nonmetal is often ionic Figure As the electronegativity difference increases between two atoms the bond becomes more ionic Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds The atoms in polyatomic ions such as OH NO and NH are held together by polar covalent bonds However these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds by combining with ions of opposite charge For example potassium nitrate KNO contains the K cation and the polyatomic NO anion Thus bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic resulting from the electrostatic attraction between the ions K and NO as well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in NO Example Electronegativity and Bond Polarity Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of proteins Using the electronegativity values in Table A arrange the following covalent bondsall commonly found in amino acidsin order of increasing polarity Then designate the positive and negative atoms using the symbols δ and δ CH CN CO NH OH SH Solution The polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the electronegativity difference increases The atom with the δ designation is the more electronegative of the two Table shows these bonds in order of increasing polarity Table Bond Polarity and Electronegativity Difference Bond ΔEN Polarity CH SH CN NH CO OH Visualizing Bonding Calculated charge distributions in molecules can easily be visualized by using electrostatic potential maps The color red is used to indicate electronrich regions of a molecule while the color blue is used to indicated electronpoor regions An easier method for visually representing electron displacement in a molecule uses a crossed arrow By convention the arrow point in the direction of the electronrich region of a molecule and away from the electronpoor An example is shown in the molecule fluoromethane The CF bond is polarized drawing the bonding electrons toward the more electronegative fluorine giving it a partial negative charge Consequently the bonding electrons are drawn away from the less electronegative carbon giving it a partial positive charge The the electronrich fluorine is shown as red in the electrostatic potential map and while the electronpoor carbon is shown as blue The crossed arrow points in the direction of the electronrich fluorine Chemists often use the term inductive effect to describe the shifting of electrons in a sigma by the electronegativity of atoms Relatively electronegative atoms such as fluorine tend to inductively draw electrons towards themselves and away from nearby atoms The inductive effect will be used to explain chemical reactivity in many situations in organic chemistry An excellent example of the inductive effect is seen when comparing the OH bond polarities of water HO and hypochlorous acid ClOH Replacing the less electronegative hydrogen EN in water with the more electronegative chlorine EN in hypochlorous acid creates a greater bond polarity The chlorine draws electrons away giving the hydrogen a greater partial positive charge This is shown in the electrostatic potential map as an increase in the blue color around hydrogen A spectrum of bonds There is no clearcut division between covalent and ionic bonds In a pure nonpolar covalent bond the electrons are held on average exactly half way between the atoms In a polar bond the electrons have been dragged slightly towards one end How far does this dragging have to go before the bond counts as ionic There is no real answer to that Sodium chloride is typically considered an ionic solid but even here the sodium has not completely lost control of its electron Because of the properties of sodium chloride however we tend to count it as if it were purely ionic Lithium iodide on the other hand would be described as being ionic with some covalent character In this case the pair of electrons has not moved entirely over to the iodine end of the bond Lithium iodide for example dissolves in organic solvents like ethanol not something which ionic substances normally do A general rule in organic chemistry is if the bond is between metal and a nonmetal atoms then the bond should be considered ionic Examples of this are the lithium carbon bond in methyl lithium and the potassium oxygen bond in potassium tertbutoxide Methyl Lithium potassium tertbutoxide Summary Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of both atoms In pure covalent bonds the electrons are shared equally In polar covalent bonds the electrons are shared unequally as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other The ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms there is no difference in electronegativity so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent When the electronegativity difference is very large as is the case between metals and nonmetals the bonding is characterized as ionic No electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a nonpolar covalent bond A small electronegativity difference leads to a polar covalent bond A large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond HClHOHOC Exercises Identify the positive and negative ends of each of the bonds shown below Which of the following elements is the more electronegative a Br or C b C
