Using pKa values to predict reaction EquilibriaExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to use pKa values to calculate Keq use pKa values to predict the equilibrium direction of an acidbase reaction Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below pKa Using pKa values to predict reaction Equilibria By definition the pKa value tells us the extent to which an acid will react with water as the base but by extension we can also calculate the equilibrium constant for a reaction between any acidbase pair Mathematically it can be shown that Keq for the acid base reaction in question Î”pKa where is the of product acid minus of reactant acid Consider a reaction between methylamine and acetic acid First we need to identify the acid species on either side of the equation On the left side the acid is of course acetic acid while on the right side the acid is methyl ammonium The specific pKa values for these acids are not on our very generalized pKa table but are given in the figure above Without performing any calculations you should be able to see that this equilibrium lies far to the righthand side acetic acid has a lower pKa is a stronger acid and thus it wants to give up its proton more than methyl ammonium does Doing the math we see that So is a very large number much greater than and the equilibrium lies far to the righthand side of the equation just as we had predicted If you had just wanted to approximate an answer without bothering to look for a calculator you could have noted that the difference in pKa values is approximately so the equilibrium constant should be somewhere in the order of or one million Using the pKa table in this way and making functional groupbased pKa approximations for molecules for which we dont have exact values we can easily estimate the extent to which a given acidbase reaction will proceed Example Show the products of the following acidbase reactions and estimate the value of Keq Use the pKa table from Section andor from the Reference Tables Answer Exercises Exercise Use the pKa table from Section andor from the Reference Tables to determine if the following reactions would be expected to occur a b c Answer a Yes alkenes have pKa values of while alkynes have pKa values of This means that alkynes are more acidic and more likely to donate a proton b Yes alkenes have pKa values of while alcohols have pKa values of This means that alcohols are more acidic and more likely to donate a proton c No carboxylic acids have pKa values of while alcohols have pKa values of This means that carboxylic acids are more acidic and more likely to donate a proton so the reverse reaction would be expected to occur Questions Q In the following reactions give the resulting products and label the conjugate acid and bases Solutions S Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Layne Morsch University of Illinois Springfield
