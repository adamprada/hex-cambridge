different flour streams approximately that vary in quality and chemical analysis These are combined into four basic streams of edible flour with four other streams going to feed Top patent flour This stream is composed of only the purest and most highly refined streams from the mill It is low in ash and is approximately of the flour extracted The term ash indicates the mineral content eg phosphorus of the flour When flour is burned all that is left is the burned mineral elements that constitute ash Second patent flour This flour is composed of streams with an intermediate degree of refinement It has an average ash content of approximately and represents about of the total flour First clear flour This stream contains the balance of the flour that possesses baking properties and is high in ash and protein content It is usually about of the total flour Second clear flour This grade contains the poorest flour streams It is very high in ash approximately and has little or no baking quality It is about of the total flour Feed streams The balance of the streams from the mill are classed as feed Feeds are marketed as bran wheat shorts flour middlings and wheat germ Within the streams of edible flours there are a number of different types of flour used in food preparation Each has different characteristics and with those come different uses as described below AllPurpose Flour General purpose or home use flours are usually a blend of hard spring wheats that are lower in protein gluten content than bread flours They are top patent flours and contain sufficient protein to make good yeast breads yet not too much for good quick breads cakes and cookies Note A word about gluten quality as opposed to gluten quantity The fact that a particular flour contains a high quantity of protein say to does not necessarily mean that it is of high quality It may contain too much ash or too much damaged starch to warrant this classification High quality is more important in many bread applications than high quantity Allpurpose flour is an example of a highquality flour with a protein content of about Graham Flour A US patented flour graham flour is a combination of whole wheat flour slightly coarser with added bran and other constituents of the wheat kernel Bread Flour Bread flour is milled from blends of hard spring and hard winter wheats They average about protein and are slightly granular to the touch This type of flour is sold chiefly to bakers because it makes excellent bread with bakery equipment but has too much protein for home use It is also called strong flour or hard flour and is second patent flour For example the specification sheet on bread flour produced by a Canadian miller might include the following information Ingredients Wheat flour amylase ascorbic acid niacin iron thiamine mononitrate riboflavin azodicarbonamide folic acid Moisture Ash Protein x N Along with this information there is microbiological data and an allergen declaration Note that the formula in parentheses beside Protein is simply the laboratorys way of deriving the protein figure from the nitrogen content Cake Flour Cake flour is milled from soft winter wheats The protein content is about and the granulation is so uniform and fine that the flour feels satiny An exception is a highprotein cake flour formulated especially for fruited pound cakes to prevent the fruit from sinking Clear Flour Clear flour comes from the part of the wheat berry just under the outer covering Comparing it to first patent flour is like comparing cream to skim milk It is dark in colour and has a very high gluten content It is used in rye and other breads requiring extra strength Gluten Flour Gluten flour is made from wheat flour by removing a large part of the starch It contains no more than moisture and no more than starch Pastry Flour Pastry flour is made from either hard or soft wheat but more often from soft It is fairly low in protein and is finely milled but not so fine as cake flour It is unsuitable for yeast breads but ideal for cakes pastries cookies and quick breads SelfRising Flour Selfrising flour has leavening and salt added to it in controlled amounts at the mill Wheat Germ Flour Wheat germ flour consists entirely of the little germ or embryo part of the wheat separated from the rest of the kernel and flattened into flakes This flour should be refrigerated Whole Wheat Flour Whole wheat flour contains all the natural parts of the wheat kernel up to of the total weight of the wheat It contains more protein than allpurpose flour and produces heavier products because of the bran particles Whole Wheat Pastry Flour Whole wheat pastry flour is milled from the entire kernel of soft wheat is low in gluten and is suitable for pastry cakes and cookies Hovis Flour Most of the germ goes away with the shorts and only a small fraction of the total quantity can be recovered in a fairly pure form At the mill a special process developed in England to improve its keeping qualities and flavour cooks this fraction It is then combined with white flour to make Hovis flour which produces a loaf that though small for its weight has a rich distinctive flavour Triticale Flour The worlds first new grain triticale is a hybrid of wheat and rye It combines the best qualities of both grains It is now grown commercially in Manitoba Semolina Semolina is the granular product consisting of small fragments of the endosperm of the durum wheat kernel The equivalent particles from other hard wheat are called farina The commonest form of semolina available commercially is the breakfast cereal Cream of Wheat NoTime Flour The primary goal of all bakers has been to reduce production time and keep costs to a minimum without losing quality flavour or structure After extensive research millers have succeeded in eliminating bulk fermentation for both sponge and straight dough methods Notime flour is flour with additives such as ascorbic acid bromate and cysteine It saves the baker time and labour and reduces floor spac requirements The baker can use his or her own formulas with only minor adjustments Blending Flours Blending of flours is done at the mill and such is the sophistication of the analysis and testing of flours test baking etc that when problems occur it is generally the fault of the baker and not the product Today the millers and their chemists ensure that bakers receive the high grade of flour that they need to produce marketable products for a qualityconscious consumer Due to the vagaries of the weather and its effect on growing conditions the quality of the grain that comes into the mill is hardly ever constant For example if damp weather occurs at harvest time the grain may start to sprout and will cause what is known as damaged starch Through analysis and adjustments in grain handling and blending the miller is able to furnish a fairly constant product Bakers do blend flours however A portion of soft flour may be blended with the bread flour to reduce the toughness of a Danish pastry or sweet dough for example Gluten flour is commonly used in multigrain bread to boost the aeration
