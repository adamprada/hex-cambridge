Contributed by Henry JakubowskiProfessor Chemistry at College of St BenedictSt Johns University No headers Topic hierarchy This page contains assessmentexam questions using data figures and graphs from research journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry which allow their use or from journals such as from PLOS that are completely open access The papers and topics chosen were selected to assess student understanding of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ASBMB foundational concepts and learning objectives as well as MCAT foundational concepts and objectives These two sets of standards broadly overlap Both ASBMB and the MCAT strongly emphasis scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are perhaps best assessed by openended questions derived from the literature in which students must employ higher level Bloom skills of application and analysis These questions can also be used by students who seek more opportunities to practice interpreting research literature results The ability to apply analyze and evaluate information and concepts are at the heart of scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are central to the new ASBMB and MCAT competency standards The questions in this learning module are designed to assess these competencies using openended responses instead of multiplechoice questions Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper The following questions are based on data graphs and figures from the following article Naphthoquinonemediated Inhibition of Lysine Acetyltransferase KATBp Basis for Nontoxic Inhibitor Synthesis Mohankrishna Dalvoy Vasudevarao et al The Journal of Biological Chemistry March doi jbcM BACKGROUND Doublestanded DNA is a polyanion as every phosphate in the backbone is negatively charged To pack it into chromosome in the nucleus DNA is complexed to a variety of proteins In the first stage of packing DNA is wound around a core of positively charged histones protein forming a nucleosome The size of the nucleosome is about the size of RNA polymerase Nucleosome Jmol Java JSMol HTML A For RNA polymerase to transcribe DNA that is packed in a nucleosome what must likely happen to the nucleosome complex The DNA must unwind from the histone core of then nucleosome to allow binding of transcription factors and ultimately RNA polymerase to the regulatory regions of the DNA promoter etc Otherwise DNAdependent RNA polymerization will not occur B The phenotype of a cell depends on the DNA sequence of the cell and the subset of genes that are expressed by that cell The emerging field of epigenetics describes how factors other than the DNA sequence control cell phenotype and heritability of traits Key features in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription are chromatin remodeling packing and covalent modification of DNA Chromatin packing at the level of DNAhistone interactions are critical Key to these interactions are the state of covalent modification of lysine K side chains in protein by histone acetylases HATs which are also called lysine acetylases KATs and histone deacetylases HDACs Two chemical modifications of lysine side chains in histones are shown below a Offer a chemical explanation of why structure b will not be acetylated by KAT b What affect might KAT modification of histone lysine side chains have on transcriptional competency of DNA in nucleosomes Naphthoquinone derivatives are naturally occurring compounds that are present in the Plumbago and Diospyros plant genera and have a variety of biological activities One such derivative plumbagin is a potent inhibitor of a particular lysine acetyltransferase KAT p lysine acetyltransferases BA pCBP Some of the inhibitors are toxic to cells as they react with free RSH groups in cells and generate reactive oxygen species ROS An ideal drug would be nontoxic and an effective inhibitoractivator of a specific enzyme Investigators synthesized a derivative PTK of plumbagin which inhibit p and with much lower toxicity that plumbagin How does it work Fig A To study the toxicity of plumbagin investigators dissolved it in the solvent DMSO Nacetylcysteine NAC which scavenges ROS They added these reagents to three different human cells lines SHSYY HEK and HeLa S as shown below a What effect did plumbagin have on cell toxicity b What effect did NAC have plumbagin cell effects c What did the investigators conduct an experiment just DMSO alone Fig B It has been shown that on DNA oxidative damage or breaks one of the histones HAX is phosphorylated by a kinase pIK Cells were treated as describe below Plu plumbagin_ and subjected to SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis After the electrophoresis a nitrocellluose membrane was placed on top and the proteins in the gel were electrophoresed into the membrane a technique called Western blotting Individual protein band were visualized by adding antibodies that recognized phosphorylated HAXg or histone H without modification followed by reagents that produce a dark band Interpret the results Why did the investigators do blots for unmodified H Fig C What affect did plumbagin have on histone acetylation Immuoblots were performed after plumbagin treatment in the presence or absence of NAC in the indicated cell lines as above using antibodies that recognized acetylated Lys on H HK or histone H without modfication Does Plu inhibit HK acetylation How does NAC affect Plumbagin effect on acetylation Fig D Another inhibitor of HK acetylation isogarcinol IsoGar was studied by western blotting Did NAC have same effect on HK acetylation of cells treated with IsoGAr as those treated with Plu shown in Fig C NAC seems to behave differently in the presence of two acetylation inhibitors These results offer two possibilities for its effects ROS could lead to decrease acetylation of histones and NAC by decreasing ROS restore acetylation Alternatively plumbagin reacts with the RSH of NAC which decreases it effect on KAT and restores acetylation Draw cartoon models that would reflect these two different scenarios using a line with an arrow to indicate activation or promotion of an activity and a line with a blunt end to show inhibition Also use and these symbols Investigators found no increase in ROS with purified KAT in a cell free in vitro produced no free radicals Which of your models is more likely Fig AB To simplify study of these effects the investigators performed in vitro cell free assays in which no ROS superoxide hydrogen peroxide would be produced They studied two different KATs p A and CBP B using HeLa cell core histones with μm plumbagin lanes in A and B either in the presence or absence of NAC DTT and another reducing agent Trolox lane Interpret the results What part of NAC and DTT appear important in their effects on plumbagin inhibition Fig A These data suggest a chemical reaction of NAC and DTT with plumgartin The generic structure of Naphthoquinone derivatives including plumgartin are shown below along with NAC and DTT Fig B The thiol group on NAC is likely to react with a sp C ultimately leading to a product which retains conjugation if possible Draw a mechanism showing how NAC might react with the structure below and show the final products Fig A A variety of Naphthoquinone derivatives were tested to see their effect on p activity in the presence and absence of NAC One lawsone whose structure is given below showed no inhibitory effects as shown below Give a likely chemical explanation for this observation Fig C If they reacted with free thiols then the naphthoquinone derivatives should have an effect on the concentration of free thiols in an in vitro assays Results of one such assay are shown below Compare this graph with the proceeding one What conclusion can you draw Fig not shown The authors used UVVis and fluorescence spectroscopy to study the effect of NAC on the spectra of naphthoquinone analogs What likely effects would you expect to observe on the spectrum of lawsone Fig A The ultimate goal of the investigators was to make a naphthoquinone derivative that was not cytotoxic which presumably results from its interactions with free thiols They synthesized PTK as shown below Why would this reaction produce a potential inhibitor that did not react with free thols in cells FIGURE B Investigators studied the effects of PTK on P acetylation of HeLa core histones with different concentrations of PTK in the absence and presence of NAC Figure B as well the presence of free thiol in the presence or absence of PTK Figure C What can you conclude from these graphs Figure D The figure below shows the UVvisible absorption spectrum of PTK in the in presence or absence of NAC What conclusions can you draw Fig E The figure below shows immunoblotting analysis IB of cell lysates upon h of treatment by PTK using HK acetylation antibodies The concentrations of PTK used are indicated in the figure E Error bars SD What conclusions can you draw from the blots How might PTK inhibit p KAT activity Enzyme kinetic analyses would be useful The enzyme has two substates acetyl CoA and histones Previous studies have shown that substrates bind to p in an ordered mechanism The noncompetitive inhibitor PTK could bind to the free enzyme as well as to the substratebound form resulting in an abortive ternary complex T Presume that added reversible inhibitors behavior in a similar fashion with single and multisubstrate reactions Here are some simple rules that apply to double reciprocal plots v vs S when substrate is kept constant The slope changes when I and S bind to the same form of the enzyme for example E binds both S and I OR I binds to a form of E on the horizontal line which is connected to the form that S binds and I binds first for example I binds to E and then S binds The Y intercept changes when I and S bind to different forms of the enzyme unless I binds first and the binding of I and S are in rapid equilibrium Figure AB Figure A and B below show double reciprocal or LineweaverBurk plots v vs S of p KAT with one substrate fixed and the other varying at different fixed concentrations of inhibitor PTK In Figure A the concentration of core histones was kept constant at μm while increasing the concentration of isotope labeled HacetylCoA from to μm either in the absence no inhibitor or increasing concentrations of PTK and μm The direction of increasing inhibitor concentration is shown by the red arrow In Figure B inhibition of p KAT activity by PTK was studied at a fixed concentration of HacetylCoA μm and increasing concentrations of core histones nm either in the absence of no inhibitor or increasing concentrations of PTK and μm By analogy with single substrate reactions shown below in the linked chemical equations which type of inhibition is displayed by PTK Answer Key
