by both their flavor and their appearance just as savory sauces enhance meats fish and vegetables Crème anglaise chocolate sauce caramel sauce and the many fruit sauces and coulis are the most versatile One or another of these sauces will complement nearly every dessert Examples of dessert sauces Caramel sauce A proper caramel flavor is a delicate balance between sweetness and bitterness As sugar cooks and begins to change color a flavor change will occur The darker the sugar the more bitter it will become Depending on the application for the finished caramel it can be made mild or strong At this point a liquid is added This liquid will serve several roles it will stop the cooking process it can add richness and flavor and it will soften the sauce The fluidity of the finished sauce will depend on the amount of liquid added to it and the temperature it is served at Dairy products such as cream milk or butter will add richness use water for a clear sauce use fruit purées to add different flavor elements Chocolate sauce Sometimes called fudge sauce chocolate sauce is generally made from cream or milk butter and chocolate and can be served hot or cold The proportion of each of the ingredients will affect the thickness of the final product Compote French for mixture a compote is cooked fruit served in its own cooking liquid usually a sugar syrup Compotes can be made with fresh frozen or dried fruits and served hot or cold Coulis French for strained liquid a coulis is most often an uncooked strained purée Flavors remain pure and the colors bright One of the drawbacks of using a coulis is that it may separate quickly when used as a plating sauce Its best to use à la minute Crème anglaise French for English custard crème anglaise is a rich pourable custard sauce that can be served hot or cold over cake fruits or other desserts Made with eggs sugar and milk or cream it is stirred over heat until it thickens into a light sauce However its a delicate operation too much heat turns it into scrambled eggs It should not get above C F during the cooking process Vanilla is the classic flavoring but coffee spices chocolate or liqueurs can be added With additional yolks and heavy cream it becomes the custard used for French ice cream With additional yolks gelatin whipped cream and flavoring it becomes Bavarian cream Curd A curd is creamy and fruit based with citrus and berry flavors being the most popular Made from fruit juices eggs butter and sugar cooked in a process similar to crème anglaise curds can be thick pourable sauces or spreads Fruit butter Fruit butter is a spread made from whole fruits cooked reduced and puréed if you dont want any chunks in it until very thick It does not contain any butter the term refers to the consistency Fruit sauce A fruit sauce is a fruit purée cooked and thickened with a starch It is normally served cold Hard sauce This traditional sauce for Christmas pudding or any steamed pudding is made by combining butter sugar and flavorings often liqueurs It is normally piped into shapes and chilled then placed on the warm dessert just before serving Sabayon Sabayon is a mixture of egg yolks flavoring and sugar beaten over simmering water until thick then beaten until cool It is traditionally flavored with sweet white wine or liquor then served over fresh fruit and grilled when it is called a gratin The Italian version of this is called azabaglione and isflavored with Madeira wine Whipped cream This very popular dessert topping can be served plain sweetened or flavoredCrème chantilly a classic version of this is a combination of whipped cream sugar and vanilla Applying dessert sauces Except in the case of some homestyle or frozen desserts sauces are usually not ladled over the dessert because doing so would mar the appearance Instead the sauce is applied in a decorative fashion to the plate rather than the dessert Many different styles of plate saucing are available Pouring a pool of sauce onto the plate is knownfloaosding Although plate flooding often looks old fashioned today it can still be a useful technique for many desserts Flooded plates can be made more attractive by applying a contrasting sauce and then blending or feathering the two sauces decoratively with a pick or the end of a knife For this technique to work the two sauces should be at about the same fluidity or consistency Rather than flooding the entire plate it may be more appropriate for some desserts to apply a smaller pool of sauce to the plate as this avoids overwhelming the dessert with too much sauce A variation of the flooding technique is outlining where a design is piped onto the plate with chocolate and allowed to set The spaces can then be flooded with colorful sauces A squeeze bottle is useful for making dots lines curves and streaks of sauce in many patterns Or just a spoon is needed to drizzle random patterns of sauce onto a plate Another technique for saucing is applying a small amount of sauce and streaking it with a brush an offset spatula or the back of a spoon Sauces are a great way to highlight flavors Choose ones that will create balance on the plate not just for color but with all the components A tart berry sauce will complement a rich cheesecake or chocolate dessert because sourness acid will cut through fat making it taste lighter than it is A sweet sauce served with a sweet dessert will have the overall effect of hiding flavors in both Hold back on sweetness in order to intensify other flavors Many modern presentations may have a minimal amount of sauce Sometimes this is done just for aesthetic reasons and not for how it will complement the dessert Think of the dish and the balance of the components This is the most important factor flavor first presentation second Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a
