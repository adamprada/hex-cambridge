journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry which allow their use or from journals such as from PLOS that are completely open access The papers and topics chosen were selected to assess student understanding of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ASBMB foundational concepts and learning objectives as well as MCAT foundational concepts and objectives These two sets of standards broadly overlap Both ASBMB and the MCAT strongly emphasis scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are perhaps best assessed by openended questions derived from the literature in which students must employ higher level Bloom skills of application and analysis These questions can also be used by students who seek more opportunities to practice interpreting research literature results The ability to apply analyze and evaluate information and concepts are at the heart of scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are central to the new ASBMB and MCAT competency standards The questions in this learning module are designed to assess these competencies using openended responses instead of multiplechoice questions Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper A pHdependent Molten Globule Transition Is Required for Activity of the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein StAR Bo Y Baker Dustin C Yaworsky and Walter L Miller J Biol Chem Vol Issue December Steroids synthesis requires cholesterol which get converted to pregnenolone by an enzyme in the inner mitochondrial membrane IM A regulatory protein which we will call SR is found in the outer mitochondrial membrane OM and is involved in cholesterol movement from the OM to the IM Mutations in SR can cause congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia a potentially lethal disease The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a MW preprotein whose N terminal leader sequence targets SR to the mitochondria Upon translocation of the protein to the IM the leader is cleaved by proteolysis and is removed from the final active protein The Cterminus must be critical for its function since mutations in this region causes the hyperplasia discussed above Models of SR suggest that it is similar to related protein that have a βbarrel structure with a hydrophobic binding pocket which can bind cholesterol If the first Nterminal amino acids are removed from the precursor preprotein the protein N SR retains activity When added to LUVs with a lipid composition similar to the OM only the Cterminal alpha helical end of the protein is protected from added proteases suggesting that that end inserts into the OM effectively tethering the protein to the OM Using spectral analysis and proteolysis of the protein it appears that the protein may adopt a molten globule state at both low pH or when bound to a LUV A conformation change appears to be induced when the protein interacts with protonated head groups of the LUV The Cterminal helix is more protected from proteolysis at pH compared to Modeling studies based on xray structures of homologous proteins show that the access channel to the hydrophobic binding site in the protein is not large enough to pass cholesterol These results show that the protein must change conformations to elicit its biological activity The experiments described below were done to determine if a conformational change occurs in the protein on interaction with lipids and whether a molten globule state of the protein is formed A model structure of N SR is shown below in Figure A It has a tightly folded Nterminal domain and a more loosely folded Cterminal domain A molecular dynamics simulation of the protein under different protonation states was done in a bath of water molecules in order to simulate possible conformational changes in the protein The first charge state was defined to be neutral simulating pH Next they changed the protonation state of amino acids to reflect expected charges under acidic pH condition which might promote a change to the molten globule state In a last trial they left the majority of the protein under neutral pH condition but changed just the charge state of the Cterminal helix to acidic pH conditions FIGURE Modeling and molecular dynamics of N SR A ribbon diagram of the model of N SR the salt bridges between Asp D and Arg R and between Glu E and Arg R are shown as ballandstick

and OδNω but under acidified Chelix conditions the ω loop and Chelix movement and bonding are disrupted Which amino acids would be protonated on the shift from neutral to acidic pH conditions Explain why the authors ran a simulation with just the Cterminal helix in the acidic protonation state Compare the energies of the neutral and acidified strucutures B and the rigidity of the two structures in D Which one is more compact Flexible Higher in energy Which would be more consistent with a molten globule conformation Do these structures support the notion that the protein might interact with the membrane through its Cterminal helix Snapshots of molecular dynamics simulations were taken every picoseconds and the distance between the Cγ of Asp D in the ω loop and the guanidino group of Arg R on the Cterminal alpha helix was determined and represented graphically below in Figure C top panel below same color coding as before The bottom panel in C shows the distance between Asp D and Arg R

conformation transitions are particularly prominent at the Ω region B interatomic distances in ï½ between Arg and Asp as a function of time during molecular dynamics simulations The carboxyl carbon Cγ

between Cζ in Arg and Cδ in Glu Black neutral red acidic green acidified Chelix Referring to the location of the amino acids structure shown in Fig A and the data in Fig C which part of the protein is likely to change to promote access of cholesterol to sterol binding pocket in the protein In an attempt to run an additional control for their in silico molecular dynamics experiment the authors found two pairs of amino acids with the amino acids in each pair being approximately angstroms from each other in the C helix and adjacent loop The two pairs were Ser Ser and Asp Ala They changed them to Cys and created in silico the following mutation pairs in single letter code SCSC and DCAC Note DA mutant places the C closer to the end of the C helix than in the SS mutant where the C is position Why did they believe that changes these amino acids to Cys would not dramatically change the folding of the protein Energy minimization results showed that the Cα backbone of the Cterminal helix or Ω loop did not change What would the likely effect be on the local structure in the vicinity of the pair How would the molecular dynamics simulation in the top panel of C change The mutants described above where made using sitespecific mutagenesis and SDSpolyacrylamide gels run Why did the mutants DA and SS migrated further on the gel than the wild type WT unmutated proteins When the mutant proteins were treated first with diothiothreitol DTT before electrophoreis they comigrated with the WT proteins When the mutant proteins were treated with diamide oxidizes sulfhydryls to disulfides their migration was not affected The structures of DTT and diamide are shown below Explain the gel results FIGURE Characterization of the disulfide mutants A model of N SR showing the locations of the SS mutant replacing Ser and Ser and the DA mutant replacing Asp and Ala with Cys Both mutants are shown in a single molecule but each was prepared separately Note that the perspective is from behind

mutant proteins diamide mutant plus diamide DTT mutant plus DTT The amino acid sequence as derived from the DNA sequence shows that the WT N protein has Cys and the two mutants DA and SS mutated as above to contain two Cys each have The amount of free Cys in each protein was determined using Ellmans reagent Draw a reaction to show how a free Cys represented as RSH below reacts with Ellmans reagent What instrument would you use to measure the reaction and quantitate the levels of Cys Reaction mechanism Computer modeling of the WT N SR shows no disulfides and two accessible Cys Compare
