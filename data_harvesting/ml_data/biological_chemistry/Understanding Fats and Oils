oxygen O arranged to form molecules There are many types of fats and oils and a number of terms and concepts associated with them which are detailed further here Lipids In baking lipids are generally a synonym for fats Baking books may talk about the lipid content of eggs for example Triglycerides Triglycerides is another chemical name for the most common type of fats found in the body indicating that they are usually made up of three tri fatty acids and one molecule of glycerol glycerine is another name as shown in Figure The mono and diglycerides that are used as emulsiﬁers have one and two fatty acids respectively Figure Composition of fats triglycerides Fatty Acids Each kind of fat or oil has a different combination of fatty acids The nature of the fatty acid will determine the consistency of the fat or oil For example stearic acid is the major fatty acid in beef fat and linoleic acid is dominant in seed oils Fatty acids are deﬁned as short medium or long chain depending on the number of atoms in the molecule The reason that some fat melts gradually is that as the temperature rises each fatty acid will in turn soften as its melting point is reached Fats that melt all of a sudden mean that the fatty acids are of the same or similar type and have melting points within a narrow range An example of such a fat is coconut fat one second it is solid the next liquid Table shows the characteristics of three fatty acids Table Characteristics of Fatty Acids Type of Fatty Acid Melting Point Physical State at room temperature Stearic C F Solid Oleic C F Liquid Linoleic C F Liquid Rancid Rancid is a term used to indicate that fat has spoiled The fat takes on an unpleasant ﬂavor when exposed to air and heat Unsalted butter for example will go rancid quickly if left outside the refrigerator especially in warm climates OxidationAntioxidants Oxidation exposure to air causes rancidity in fats over time This is made worse by combination with certain metals such as copper This is why doughnuts are never fried in copper pans Some oils contain natural antioxidants such as tocopherols vitamin E is one kind but these are often destroyed during the processing As a result manufacturers add synthetic antioxidants to retard rancidity BHA and BHT are synthetic antioxidants commonly used by fat manufacturers SaturatedUnsaturated Saturated and unsaturated refer to the extent to which the carbon atoms in the molecule of fatty acid are linked or bonded saturated to hydrogen atoms One system of fatty acid classiﬁcation is based on the number of double bonds double bonds saturated fatty acids Stearic acid is a typical longchain saturated fatty acid Figure Figure Stearic Acid double bond monounsaturated fatty acids Oleic acid is a typical monounsaturated fatty acid Figure Figure Oleic Acid or more double bonds polyunsaturated fatty acids Linoleic acid is a typical polyunsaturated fatty acid Figure Figure Linoleic Acid Saturated fat is a type of fat found in food For many years there has been a concern that saturated fats may lead to an increased risk of heart disease however there have been studies to the contrary and the literature is far from conclusive The general assumption is that the less saturated fat the better as far as health is concerned For the fat manufacturer however low saturated fat levels make it diﬃcult to produce oils that will stand up to the high temperatures necessary for processes such as deepfrying Hydrogenation has been technologys solution Hydrogenation will be discussed later in the chapter Saturated fat is found in many foods Animal foods like beef chicken lamb pork and veal Coconut palm and palm kernel oils Dairy products like butter cheese and whole milk Lard Shortening Unsaturated fat is also in the foods you eat Replacing saturated and trans fats see below with unsaturated fats has been shown to help lower cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease Unsaturated fat is also a source of omega and omega fatty acids which are generally referred to as healthy fats Choose foods with unsaturated fat as part of a balanced diet using the US Department of Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines Even though unsaturated fat is a good fat having too much in your diet may lead to having too many calories which can increase your risk of developing obesity type diabetes heart disease and certain types of cancer There are two main types of unsaturated fats Monounsaturated fat which can be found in Avocados Nuts and seeds like cashews pecans almonds and peanuts Vegetable oils like canola olive peanut saﬄower sesame and sunﬂower Polyunsaturated fat which can be found in Fatty ﬁsh like herring mackerel salmon trout and smelt Fish oils Nuts and seeds like cashews pecans almonds and peanuts Vegetable oils like canola corn ﬂaxseed soybean and sunﬂower Hydrogenation Simply put hydrogenation is a process of adding hydrogen gas to alter the melting point of the oil or fat The injected hydrogen bonds with the available carbon which changes liquid oil into solid fat This is practical in that it makes fats versatile Think of the diﬀerent temperature conditions within a bakery during which fat must be workable think of the diﬀerent climatic conditions encountered in bakeries Trans Fat Trans fat is made from a chemical process known as partial hydrogenation This is when liquid oil is made into a solid fat Like saturated fat trans fat has been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol levels which may in turn increase your risk for heart disease Unlike saturated fat trans fat also lowers HDL or good cholesterol A low level of HDLcholesterol is also a risk factor for heart disease Until recently most of the trans fat found in a typical American diet came from Fried foods like doughnuts baked goods including cakes pie crusts biscuits frozen pizza cookies and crackers stick margarine and other spreads The US Food and Drug Administration FDA speciﬁcally prescribe what information must be displayed on a label The trans fat content of food is one piece of core nutrition information that is required to be declared in a nutrition facts table More information on a nutrition facts table and labeling details can be found in wwwfdagovfoodingredientspucmhtm Emulsiﬁcation Emulsiﬁed Shortenings Emulsiﬁcation is the process by which normally unmixable ingredients such as oil and water can be combined into a stable substance Emulsiﬁers are substances that can aid in this process There are natural emulsiﬁers such as lecithin found in egg yolks Emulsiﬁers are generally made up of monoglycerides and diglycerides and have been added to many hydrogenated fats improving the fats ability to Develop a uniformly ﬁne structure Absorb a high percentage of sugar Hold in suspension a high percentage of liquid Emulsiﬁed shortenings are ideal for cakes and icings but they are not suitable for deepfrying Stability Stability refers to the ability of a shortening to have an extended shelf life It refers especially to deepfrying fats where a smoke point see below of C to C F to F indicates a fat of high stability Smoke Point The smoke point is the temperature reached when fat ﬁrst starts to smoke The smoke point will decline over time as the fat breaks down see below Fat Breakdown The technical term for fat breakdown is hydrolysis which is the chemical reaction of a substance with water In this process fatty acids are separated from their glycerol molecules and accumulate over time in the fat When their concentration reaches a certain point the fat takes on an unpleasant taste and continued use of the fat will yield a nasty ﬂavor The moisture which is at the root of this problem comes from the product being fried This is why it is a good reason to turn oﬀ the fryer or turn it to standby between batches of frying foods such as doughnuts Another cause of fat breakdown is excessive ﬂour on the product or particles breaking oﬀ the product Attribution Figure Stearic Acide Retrieved from httplibrarymedutaheduNetBiochAcids_html Figure Oleic Acid Retrieved from httplibrarymedutaheduNetBiochAcids_html Figure Linoleic
