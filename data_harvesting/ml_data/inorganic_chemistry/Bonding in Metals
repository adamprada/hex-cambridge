Nearly free electron modelElectron wavelength and wavenumber Energies of orbitals in a metallic crystal Density of States DOS Metals semiconductors and insulators The electron pair description of chemical bonds which was the basis of the octet rule for pblock compounds breaks down for metals This is illustrated well by Na metal the structure of which is shown at the left Na has too few valence electrons to make electron pair bonds between each pair of atoms We could think of the Na unit cell as having eight nobond resonance structures in which only one NaNa bond per cell contains a pair of electrons Sodium metal crystallizes in the bodycentered cubic structure in which each atom has eight nearest neighbors Since the electronic configuration of Na is Ars there are only two valence electrons per unit cell that are shared among eight NaNa bonds This means that the NaNa bond order is in Na metal A more realistic way to describe the bonding in metals is through band theory The evolution of energy bands in solids from simple MO theory Chapter is illustrated at the right for a chain of six Na atoms each of which has one s valence orbital and contributes one valence electron In general n atomic orbitals in this case the six Na s orbitals will generate n molecular orbitals with n possible nodes In Chapter we showed that the energy versus internuclear distance graph for a two hydrogen atom system has a low energy level and a high energy level corresponding to the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals respectively These two energy levels were well separated from each other and the two electrons in H energetically prefer the lower energy level If more atoms are introduced to the system there will be a number of additional levels between the lowest and highest energy levels MO picture for a linear chain of six Na atoms Three of the six MOs can accommodate all six valence electrons Adding more atoms to the chain makes more molecular orbitals of intermediate energy which eventually merge into a continuous band of orbitals For Na the s band is always halffilled because each MO can accommodate two electrons In band theory the atom chain is extrapolated to a very large number on the order of atoms in a crystal so that the different combinations of bonding and antibonding orbitals create bands of possible energy states for the metal In the language of physics this approach of building the bands from discrete atomic orbitals is called the tightbinding approximation The number of atoms is so large that the energies can be thought of as a continuum rather than a series of distinct levels A metal will only partially fill this band as there are fewer valence electrons than there are energy states to fill In the case of Na metal this results in a halffilled s band Nearly free electron model In metals the valence electrons are delocalized over many atoms The total energy of each electron is given by the sum of its kinetic and potential energy E KE PE E pm V where p is the momentum of the electron a vector quantity m is its mass and V is an average potential that the electron feels from the positive cores of the atoms This potential holds the valence electrons in the crystal but in the free electron model is essentially uniform across the crystal Electron wavelength and wavenumber What are the consequences of this model for band theory For a hypothetical infinite chain ie a D crystal of Na atoms the molecular orbitals at the bottom of the s band are fully bonding and the wavelength of electrons x the distance between nodes in these orbitals is very long At the top of the band the highest orbital is fully antibonding and the wavelength is times the distance between atoms a since there is one node per atom Remember that the wavelength of an electron λ is inversely proportional to its momentum p according to the de Broglie relation λ hp For a nearly free electron the kinetic energy can be expressed in terms of its wavelength using KE pm and the de Broglie relation We can think of the wavelength of an electron in a molecular orbital as twice the distance between nodes If there are N atoms in a linear chain the wavelength of the nth orbital is given by λ Nan where a is the distance between atoms At this point it is convenient to define the wavenumber of the electron as k which has units of inverse length and is inversely proportional to λ k is also directly proportional to the momentum p Like p k is a vector quantity In a D crystal k can be either positive or negative corresponding to an electron moving to the left or right along the chain The most important property of k is that it is directly proportional to the number of nodes n in a molecular orbital within the band For a D crystal of sodium atoms that contains N unit cells each separated by a distance a a molecular orbital with n nodes has a wavelength λ Nan and the wavenumber k πnNa We can see from this definition that k at the bottom of the band where λ is infinite and k πa at the top of the band where the MO contains N nodes and λ a Energies of orbitals in a metallic crystal Electrons with long wavelengths do not feel the individual atoms in the lattice and so they behave as if they are nearly free but confined to the crystal Near the bottom of the band the electron energy increases parabolically with the number of nodes KE n since the momentum p is directly proportional to n Because p is also directly proportional to k we can write This parabolic relationship is followed as long as the electron wavelength is long compared to the distance between atoms Near the top of the band the wavelength becomes shorter and the electrons start to feel the positively charged atomic cores In particular the electrons prefer to have the maxima in their wavefunctions line up with the atomic cores which is the most electrostatically favorable situation The electronatom attraction lowers the energy and causes the E vs k curve to deviate from the parabolic behavior of a free electron as shown in the figure below Density of States DOS The density of states is defined as the number of orbitals per unit of energy within a band Because of the parabolic relation between E and k the density of states for a D metallic crystal is highest near the bottom and top of the energy band where the slope of the E vs k curve is closest to zero The shape of the DOS curve is different in crystals of higher dimensionality as shown in the figure in the left because statistically there are more ways to make an orbital with N nodes than there are with zero or N nodes The situtation is analogous to the numbers you can make by rolling dice With one die the numbers have equal probability However with two dice there is only one way to make a two snake eyes or a twelve boxcars but many ways to make a seven a winner Electrons in metals follow a parabolic dispersion curve where the energy increases with the square of the wavenumber k Near the top of the band the dispersion curve deviates from the parabolic dotted line Because there is one MO for each value of k the number of orbitals per unit energy the density of states DOS is highest at the bottom and top of the band for a D chain of atoms The density of states is constant with energy for a D crystal and has a maximum in the middle of the band for a D crystal At low temperature all the MOs below the Fermi level EF are occupied and all the MOs above it are empty While most of the time we will talk about D crystals that have their maximum DOS near the middle of the energy band there are examples of quasiD systems such as carbon nanotubes Metallic carbon nanotubes have strong optical absorption bands that correspond to transitions between the two regions of high DOS the van Hove singularities near the bottom and top of the bands Singlewalled carbon nanotubes with armchair chirality are metallic and have characteristic sharp absorption bands in the infrared Prof Millie Dresselhaus below did foundational research on the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes and other lowdimensional conductors Metals semiconductors and insulators The degree to which bands fill determines whether a crystalline solid is a metal semiconductor or insulator If the highest occupied molecular orbitals lie within a band ie if the Fermi level EF cuts through a band of orbitals then the electrons are free to change their speed and direction in an electric field and the solid is metallic However if the solid contains just enough electrons to completely fill a band and the next highest set of molecular orbitals is empty then it is a semiconductor or insulator In this case there is an energy gap between the filled and empty bands which are called the valence and conduction bands respectively Although the distinction is somewhat arbitrary materials with a large gap eV are called insulators and those with smaller gaps are called semiconductors We will learn more about the properties of semiconductors in Chapter Why dont insulators conduct electricity The energy vs DOS diagram below shows what happens when an electric field is applied to a metal or an insulator In this case we have changed the diagram to show explicitly the energies of electrons moving left and right These energies are the same in the absence of an electric field Once we apply a field eg by putting a voltage across a metal wire the electrons moving in the direction of the field have lower energy than those moving in the opposite direction In the case of the metal the populations of electrons moving with and against the electric field are different and there is a net flow of current Note that this can happen only when the Fermi level cuts through a partially filled band With a semiconductor or insulator the valence band is filled and the conduction band is empty Applying an electric field changes the energies of electrons traveling with and against the field but because the band is filled the same number are going in both directions and there is no net current flow E vs DOS diagrams comparing the behavior of metals and insulators in an applied electric field Note that in this picture all the molecular orbitals extend over the entire crystal The valence electrons are delocalized even in the case of a semiconductor or insulator However there can be no net movement of electrons unless the band is partially filled
