No headers Crystal lattices can be classified by their translational and rotational symmetry In threedimensional crytals these symmetry operations yield distinct lattice types which are called Bravais lattices In these lattice diagrams shown below the dots represent lattice points which are places where the whole structure repeats by translation For example in the bodycentered cubic bcc structure of sodium metal which is discussed below we put one atom at the corner lattice points and another in the center of the unit cell In the NaCl structure which is discussed in Chapter we place one NaCl formula unit on each lattice point in the facecentered cubic fcc lattice That is one atom Na or Cl would be placed on the lattice point and the other one would be placed halfway between Similarly in the cubic diamond structure we place one C unit around each lattice point in the fcc lattice The fourteen Bravais lattices fall into seven crystal systems that are defined by their rotational symmetry In the lowest symmetry system triclinic there is no rotational symmetry This results in a unit cell in which none of the edges are constrained to have equal lengths and none of the angles are º In the monoclinic system there is one twofold rotation axis by convention the baxis which constrains two of the angles to be º In the orthorhombic system there are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes along the three unit cell directions Orthorhombic unit cells have three unequal unit cell edges that are mutually perpendicular Tetragonal unit cells have a fourfold rotation axis which constrains all the angles to be º and makes the a and b axes equivalent The rhombohedral system has a threefold axis which constrains all the unit cell edges and angles to be equal and the hexagonal system has a sixfold axis which constrains the a and b lattice dimensions to be equal and the angle between them to be º The cubic system has a threefold axis along the body diagonal of the cube as well as twofold axes along the three perpendicular unit cell directions In the cubic system all unit cell edges are equal and the angles between them are º The translational symmetry of the Bravais lattices the lattice centerings are classified as follows Primitive P lattice points on the cell corners only sometimes called simple BodyCentered I lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of the cell FaceCentered F lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each of the faces of the cell BaseCentered A B or C lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each face of one pair of parallel faces of the cell sometimes called endcentered Not all combinations of the crystal systems and lattice centerings are unique There are in total combinations but it can be shown that several of these are in fact equivalent to each other For example the monoclinic I lattice can be described by a monoclinic C lattice by different choice of crystal axes Similarly all A or Bcentred lattices can be described either by a C or Pcentering This reduces the number of combinations to conventional Bravais lattices shown in the table below When the fourteen Bravais lattices are combined with the crystallographic point groups we obtain the space groups These space groups describe all the combinations of symmetry operations that can exist in unit cells in three dimensions For twodimensional lattices there are only possible plane groups which are also known as wallpaper groups Crystal family Lattice system Schönflies Bravais Lattices Primitive Basecentered Bodycentered Facecentered Triclinic Ci Monoclinic Ch Orthorhombic Dh Tetragonal Dh Hexagonal rhombohedral Dd hexagonal Dh Cubic Oh
