saltsLewis Acids and BasesDetermining the strength of metal ion Lewis acidsLewis bases stabilize high oxidation states Three theories of acids and bases There are three major classifications of substances known as acids or bases The Arrhenius definition states that an acid produces H in solution and a base produces OH This theory was developed by Svante Arrhenius in Later two more sophisticated and general theories were proposed These are the BrønstedLowry and the Lewis definitions of acids and bases The relationship between these theories is illustrated in the figure below Illustration of the hierarchy of acidbase theories Arrhenius acids and bases are a subclass of Brønsted acids and bases which are themselves a subclass of Lewis acids and bases The Arrhenius theory which is the simplest and least general description of acids and bases includes acids such as HClO and bases such as NaOH or MgOH This theory successfully describes how acids and bases react with each other to make water and salts However it does not explain why some substances that do not contain hydroxide ions for example F and NO can make basic solutions in water The BrønstedLowry definition of acids and bases addresses this problem In this theory an acid is a substance that can release a proton like in the Arrhenius theory and a base is a substance that can accept a proton A basic salt such as NaF generates OH ions in water by taking protons from water itself to make HF When a Brønsted acid dissociates it increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution H conversely Brønsted bases dissociate by taking a proton from the solvent water to generate OH Acid Dissociation Base dissociation Conjugate acids and bases One important consequence of these equilibria is that every acid HA has a conjugate base A and viceversa In the base dissociation equilibrium above the conjugate acid of base B is HB For a given acid or base these equilibria are linked by the water dissociation equilibrium for which the equilibrium constant Kw is x at C It can be easily shown that the product of the acid and base dissociation constants Ka and Kb is Kw Strong and weak acids and bases Acids and bases that dissociate completely are said to be strong Here the righthanded arrow implies that the reaction goes to completion That is a M solution of HClO in water actually contains M Haq and M ClOaq and very little undissociated HClO Conversely weak acids such as acetic acid CHCOOH and weak bases such as ammonia NH dissociate only slightly in water typically a few percent depending on their concentration and the values of Ka and Kb and exist mostly as the undissociated molecules Antacid tablets typically contain calcium salts of the bicarbonate ion HCO a weak base Its conjugate acid carbonic acid HCO is a weak acid The acidbase equilibrium between carbonic acid and bicarbonate is important in maintaining blood pH Example Household ammonia is a solution of NH in water that ranges from about by weight Lets calculate the percent ionization and the pH of the solution Solution For a solution that is ammonia by weight assuming that the density is about the same as that of liquid water the analytical concentration of ammonia is gL gmol M The other thing we need to know to solve this problem is the base dissociation constant We can solve this problem rigorously by invoking both charge balance H NH OH and mass balance M NH NH and using HOH But because the algebra becomes complicated with that method leading to a cubic equation that is hard to solve well invoke two simplifying assumptions which is a reasonable assumption for a basic solution and also reasonable if the percent ionization is small Now we can write The percent ionization is This example illustrates that it is technically incorrect to label a bottle of aqueous ammonia as ammonium hydroxide since only about of one percent of the weak base exists in that form Conjugate acids and bases A common misconception is that strong acids have weak conjugate bases and that weak acids have strong conjugate bases It is easy to see that this is incorrect by remembering that KaKb Kw Our definition of a strong acid or base is that K ie that the substance dissociates completely Our definition of a weak acid or base is K Kw It follows that if Ka strong then Kb cannot be Kw weak In fact strong acids such as HCl dissociate to produce spectator ions such as Cl as conjugate bases whereas weak acids produce weak conjugate bases This is illustrated below for acetic acid and its conjugate base the acetate anion Acetic acid is a weak acid Ka x and acetate is a weak base The strength of a conjugate acidbase varies inversely with the strength or weakness of its parent acid or base Any acid or base is technically a conjugate acid or conjugate base also these terms are simply used to identify species in solution ie acetic acid is the conjugate acid of the acetate anion a base while acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid an acid Neutral oxyacids HSO HPO HNO HClO etc can be classified as strong or weak following a simple rule first noted by Linus Pauling If the number of oxygen atoms exceeds the number of hydrogen atoms by two or more then the acid is strong otherwise it is weak For example HClO and HClO where the difference is and respectively are both strong acids HNO and HClO are both weak because the difference is in both cases For weak acids the relative strength depends on this difference ie HClO is a stronger weak acid than HOCl and on the electronegativity of the central atom HOCl is stronger than HOI Acids that can donate more than one proton are called polyprotic acids For example sulfuric acid HSO is a strong acid that has a conjugate base that actually happens to be a weak acid itself This means that every mole of HSO in aqueous solution donates more than mole of protons Carbonic acid HCO and phosphoric acid HPO are weak polyprotic acids Typically the sequential pKas of polyprotic acid are separated by about pH units because it becomes progressively more difficult to remove protons as the ion becomes more negatively charged For example the three pKas of phosphoric acid are and Amphoteric compounds Some substances can act either as an acid and as a base An example is water HO molecules may either donate a hydrogen ion or accept one This property makes water an amphoteric solvent In the situation where an acid dissociates in solution water is acting as a base Conversely water acts as an acid when bases dissociate The strongest acid we can make in HO is H aq and the strongest base we can make in HO is OH aq Other examples of amphoteric compounds are oxides and hydroxides of elements that lie on the border between the metallic and nonmetallic elements in the periodic table For example aluminum hydroxide AlOH is insoluble at neutral pH but can accept protons in acid to make AlHO or accept an OH ion in base to form AlOH ions Consequently aluminum oxide is soluble in acid and in base but not neutral water Other examples of amphoteric oxides are BeO ZnO GaO SbO and PbO Increasing the oxidation state of a metal increases the acidity of its oxide by withdrawing electron density from the oxygen atoms Thus SbO is acidic but SbO is amphoteric Periodic table showing basic blue amphoteric green and acidic red oxides The metalnonmetal boundary is indicated by the gray staircase line Solvent leveling Solvent leveling is an effect that occurs when a strong acid is placed in a solvent such as but not limited to HO Because strong acids donate their protons to the solvent the strongest possible acid that can exist is the conjugate acid of the solvent In aqueous solution this is HO This means that the strength of acids such as HCl and HBr cannot be differentiated in water as they both are dissociated to HO In the context of our discussion of conjugate bases above we would say that both Cl and Br are spectator ions in water neither one is a strong enough base to accept a proton from HO In order to differentiate the acidities of strong acids such as HClO and HCl or the basicities of strong bases such as CHO and NH we must typically work in nonaqueous solvents as explained below Nonaqueous solutions The Brønsted theory encompasses any type of solvent that can donate and accept H ions not just aqueous solutions The strength of an acid or a base varies depending on the solvent Nonaqueous acidbase chemistry follows similar rules to those developed for acids and bases in water For example in liquid ammonia the solvent autodissociates in the reaction This equilibrium is analogous to the autodissociation of water but has a smaller equilibrium constant K It follows by analogy to water that NH is the strongest acid and NH is the strongest base that can exist in liquid ammonia Because ammonia is a basic solvent it enhances the acidity and suppresses the basicity of substances dissolved in it For example the ammonium ion NH is a weak acid in water Ka x but it is a strong acid in ammonia Similarly acetic acid is weak in water but strong in ammonia Solvent leveling in fact makes HCl CHCOOH and NHCl all strong acids in ammonia where they have equivalent acid strength Strong acids that are leveled in water have different acid strengths in acidic solvents such as HF or anhydrous acetic acid For example acid dissociation of HX in acetic acid CHCOOH involves protonating the solvent to make its conjugate acid CHCOOH and the X anion Because CHCOOH is a stronger acid that HO the anion X which is a spectator in water can become a weak base in CHCOOH It follows that acidic solvents magnify the Brønsted basicities of substances that cannot accept protons in water Conversely basic solvents magnify the acidity of substances that cannot donate a proton to OH The acidity and basicity of nonaqueous solvents is difficult to quantify precisely but one good relative measure is the Hammett acidity function Ho Ho is defined analogously to pH according to the HendersonHasselbach equation For nonaqueous solvents or for acidic or basic compounds in dissolved in solvents that do not themselves dissociate Ho is a rough measure of the pH of the solvent or compound in question Anhydrous HF and HSO have Ho values of approximately and respectively Superacids and superbases The term superacid was originally coined by James Bryant Conant in to describe acids that were stronger than conventional mineral acids George A Olah prepared the socalled magic acid sonamed for its ability to attack hydrocarbons by mixing antimony pentafluoride SbF and fluorosulfonic acid FSOH The name was coined after a candle was placed in a sample of magic acid The candle dissolved showing the ability of the acid to protonate hydrocarbons which under aqueous acidic conditions cannot be protonated Magic acid is made by mixing FSOH and SbF Their reaction generates the HSOF cation which can protonate hydrocarbons At C FSOHSbF converts methane into the tertiarybutyl carbocation a reaction that begins with the protonation of methane Fluoroantimonic acid HSbF can produce solutions with H down to Fluoroantimonic acid is made by combining HF and SbF In this system HF releases its proton H concomitant with the binding of F by antimony pentafluoride which as described below is a Lewis acid The resulting anion SbF is both a weak nucleophile and an extraordinarily weak base Superacids are useful in reactions such as the isomerization of alkanes Industrially anhydrous acidexchanged zeolites which are superacid catalysts are used on a massive scale to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil to gasoline Superbases such as lithium diethylamide LiNEt alkyllithium compounds RLi and Grignard reagents RMgX useful in a broad range of organic reactions LiNEt deprotonates CH bonds to generate reactive carbanions RLi and RMgX are powerful nucleophiles The use of superbases in nonaqueous media allows us to rank the acidities and measure the pKas of different classes of molecules This ranking is particularly important in understanding the reactions of organic molecules Note that the order of acidities for hydrocarbons is alkynes alkenes aromatics alkanes This ordering has to do with the hybridization of the carbon atom that forms the carbanion The negatively charged lone pair of the carbanion is stabilized in orbitals that have high s character eg sp vs sp or sp This is because s orbitals have finite probability density at the nucleus and feel the positive nuclear charge thereby stabilizing the extra negative charge on carbon more than p orbitals Resonance effects also stabilize carbanions Thus cyclopentadiene is more acidic than even an alkyne because the negative charge is delocalized over the entire aromatic CH ring when the CH is deprotonated name formula structural formula pKa Methane CH Propene CH Benzene CH Acetylene CH Cyclopentadiene CH Table Carbon acid acidities in pKa in DMSO Acidbase equilibria in molten salts When a solid salt melts it forms a solution of the cations and anions For example KOH melts at temperatures above C and dissociates into K and OH ions which can act as a solvent for chemical reactions Because of the autodissociation of the OH solvent water is always present in a molten KOH flux according to the acidbase equilibrium It follows that in this very basic solvent water the conjugate acid of the solvent is the strongest acid that can exist The conjugate base of the solvent O is the strongest base This autodissociation equilibrium allows for the acidity of a flux to be easily tuned through the addition or boiling off of water A wet flux is more acidic and can dissolve metal oxides that contain the basic O anion Conversely a dry flux is more basic and will cause oxides to precipitate Molten hydroxide fluxes can thus be used in the synthesis of oxide crystals such as the perovskite superconductor KXBaXBiO Eutectic mixtures of NaOH and KOH are relatively low melting C and can be used as solvents for crystallizing a variety of basic oxides Lewis Acids and Bases The Lewis classification of acids and bases is broader than the BrønstedLowry definition and encompasses many more substances Whereas the BrønstedLowry and the Arrhenius classifications are based on transfer of protons Lewis acidity and basicity are based on the sharing of an electron pair Lewis acids can accept an electron pair while Lewis bases can donate an electron pair This definition encompasses the BrønstedLowry definition in that H is an electron pair acceptor when interacting with a base and a base is an electron pair donor in its interaction with H This is illustrated below for the protonation of ammonia Boron trifluoride BF acts as a Lewis acid when it combines with a basic ion or molecule that can donate an electron pair Such a reaction is shown below ceBF F BF Here the acid is BF and the base is F This acidbase reaction allows boron which is electrondeficient in BF to complete its octet Similarly AlCl is a Lewis acid that can react with Cl a Lewis base to make the Lewis salt AlCl Note that in water Cl is a spectator ion a weaker base than the solvent in Brønsted acidbase reactions Additional examples of Lewis acid base reactions In each try to identify the acid the base and the salt based on the concept that the base is the molecule or ion that donates an electron pair In cases where you are not sure it may help to draw the VSEPR structures of the molecules In other Lewis acid base reactions both acid and base are molecules and the product is referred to as an adduct Lewis acidity is the basis for coordination chemistry a topic we will discuss in more detail in Chapter This is because coordination chemistry involves metal ions that are Lewis acids which bond to ligands that are Lewis bases Determining the strength of metal ion Lewis acids There are three determining factors in the Lewis acid strength of a metal ion The higher positive charge on the metal the more acidic it is For example Al and Fe are good Lewis acids and their salts make acidic solutions in water but Kand Na are not The smaller the atomic radius of the metal ion the more acidic it is Going down the periodic table the Lewis acidity of metal ions decreases eg Al Ga In because the ionic radius increases For transition metal ions more electronegative metals tend to make stronger Lewis acids The electronegativity has maxima at W and Au in the d series so metal ions near in that part of the periodic table are good Lewis acids Molecules with five coordinate geometries eg PCl AsF SbF are typically strong Lewis acids because when accepting another pair of electrons from a base they form an octahedral molecule or anion Neither of the common fivecoordinate geometries trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal is efficient in terms of packing The Lewis acidbase reaction forms an additional bond with a relatively small energetic penalty of stretching the existing bonds Because F is a good Lewis base and also a small anion it can form stable octahedral anions with both main group elements and transition metals For this reason TiO and SiO dissolve in HF but are unreactive with aqueous HCl and other strong acids Lewis bases stabilize high oxidation states An interesting example of using Lewis acidbase chemstry to drive reactions is the chemical synthesis of fluorine gas which was devised by Karl O Christe in Christe at the time was organizing a symposium to commemorate the th anniversary of the isolation of elemental fluorine by Henri Moissan which Moissan did in by electrolyzing a solution of anhydrous HF years later there was still no direct nonelectrochemical synthesis of F Christes reaction scheme followed two steps The first was the known synthesis of KMnF from KMnO The second step involved reacting KMnF with the powerful Lewis acid SbF to make metastable MnF which decomposes spontaneously to MnF and fluorine gas This reaction teaches us something interesting and important about the connection between acidbase and redox chemistry Acids tend to stabilize low oxidation states and bases stabilize high oxidation states We will see this again soon in Chapter in the context of Pourbaix diagrams Mn is stable in the oxidation state in KMnF where it is surrounded by six basic F anions However the highest stable neutral fluoride of Mn is MnF and MnF transiently formed from KMnF spontaneously decomposes to generate fluorine Oxide is a better base than fluoride Interestingly Mn can lose all its valence electrons to form Mn in the permanganate ion MnO Here the oxidation state is stabilized electrostatically by coordination to four O ions and by the overall charge on the MnO anion Because of its charge O is a stronger base and a better ion for stabilizing high oxidation states than F This is a general trend among transition metals the highest oxidation state is usually reached in the oxide not in the fluoride despite the fact that F is a more electronegative element than O For example Cr is stable in the CrO and CrO anions but not in any neutral fluoride or fluoroanion The oxidation state occurs in RuO and OsO but not in any fluoride of Ru or Os
