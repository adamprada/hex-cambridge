Chains and rings of four H atoms or πorbitals H or butadieneBenzene πorbitals Ethylene The π system is analogous to σbonding in H Viewed from the top or bottom the ethylene πorbitals look like the H σ orbitals Thus we can map solutions from chains and rings of H atoms onto chains and rings of πorbitals as we did for the threeorbital case of O Chains and rings of four H atoms or πorbitals H or butadiene MO diagram for H or butadiene A few notes about this MO diagram In the linear form of the molecule the combination of AOs makes a ladder of evenly spaced energy levels that alternate g u g u Each successive orbital has one more node This is a general rule for linear chains of σ or π orbitals with even numbers of atoms In the cyclic form of the molecule there is one nondegenerate orbital at the bottom one at the top and a ladder of doubly degenerate orbitals in between This is also a general rule for cyclic molecules with even numbers of atoms This is the origin of the n rule for aromatics H has four valence electrons and by analogy butadiene has four πelectrons These electrons fill the lowest two MOs in the linear form of the molecule corresponding to two conjugated πbonds in butadiene HCCHCHCH In the cyclic form of the molecule the degenerate orbitals are singly occupied The molecule can break the degeneracy and lower its energy by distorting to a puckered rectangle This is a general rule for antiaromatic cyclic molecules n rule Thus cyclobutadiene should be antiaromatic and have two single and two double bonds that are not delocalized by resonance Cyclobutadiene is actually a very unstable molecule because it polymerizes to relieve ring strain Sterically hindered derivatives of the molecule do have the puckered rectangular structure predicted by MO theory Benzene πorbitals How do we get from a atom to atom chain By analogy to the process we used to go from a atom chain to a atom chain we now go from to We start with the orbitals of the atom chain which form a ladder of g and u orbitals Then we make g and u combinations of the two atoms that we are adding at the ends By combining gs with gs and us with us we end up with the solutions for a string of atoms Closing these orbitals into a loop gives us the π molecular orbitals of the benzene molecule The result is three π bonds as we expected Benzene fits the n rule n and is therefore aromatic Here we have used the isolobal analogy to construct MO diagrams for πbonded systems such as ethylene and benzene from combinations of sorbitals It raises the interesting question of whether the aromatic n rule might apply to sorbital systems ie if three molecules of H could get together to form an aromatic Hmolecule In fact recent studies of hydrogen under ultrahigh pressures in a diamond anvil cell show that such structures do form A solid hydrogen phase exists that contains sheets of distorted sixmembered rings analogous to the fully connected D network of sixmembered rings found in graphite or graphene It should now be evident from our construction of MO diagrams for four and sixorbital molecules that we can keep adding atomic orbitals to make chains and rings of atoms In each case the g and u orbitals form a ladder of MOs At the bottom rung of the ladder of an Natom chain there are no nodes in the MO and we add one node for every rung until we get to the top where there are N nodes Another way of saying this is that the wavelength of an electron in orbital x counting from the bottom xN is Nax where a is the distance between atoms We will find in Chapters and that we can learn a great deal about the electronic properties of metals and semiconductors from this model using the infinite chain of atoms as a model for the crystal
