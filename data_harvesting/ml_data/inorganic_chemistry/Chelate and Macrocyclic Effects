No headers Ligands that contain more than one binding site for a metal ion are called chelating ligands from the Greek word χηλή chēlē meaning claw As the name implies chelating ligands have high affinity for metal ions relative to ligands with only one binding group which are called monodentate single tooth ligands Ethylenediamine en is a bidentate ligand that forms a fivemembered ring in coordinating to a metal ion M Consider the two complexation equilibria in aqueous solution between the cobalt II ion Coaq and ethylenediamine en on the one hand and ammonia NH on the other Electronically the ammonia and en ligands are very similar since both bind through N and since the Lewis base strengths of their nitrogen atoms are similar This means that ΔH must be very similar for the two reactions since six CoN bonds are formed in each case Interestingly however we observe that the equilibrium constant is times larger for the second reaction than it is for the first The big difference between these two reactions is that the second one involves condensation of fewer particles to make the complex This means that the entropy changes for the two reactions are different The first reaction has a ΔS value close to zero because there are the same number of molecules on both sides of the equation The second one has a positive ΔS because four molecules come together but seven molecules are produced The difference between them ΔΔS is about JmolK We can translate this into a ratio of equilibrium constants using KfenKfNH eΔΔGRT eΔΔSR e The bottom line is that the chelate effect is entropydriven It follows that the more binding groups a ligand contains the more positive the ΔS and the higher the Kf will be for complex formation In this regard the hexadentate ligand ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA is an optimal ligand for making octahedral complexes because it has six binding groups In basic solutions where all four of the COOH groups are deprotonated the chelate effect of the EDTA ligand is approximately This means for a given metal ion Kf is times larger for EDTA than it would be for the relevant monodentate ligands at the same concentration EDTAtightly binds essentially any or ion in the periodic table and is a very useful ligand for both analytical applications and separations Ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid acid EDTA a hexadentate ligand The macrocyclic effect follows the same principle as the chelate effect but the effect is further enhanced by the cyclic conformation of the ligand Macrocyclic ligands are not only multidentate but because they are covalently constrained to their cyclic form they allow less conformational freedom The ligand is said to be preorganized for binding and there is little entropy penalty for wrapping it around the metal ion For example heme b is a tetradentate cyclic ligand which is strongly complexes transition metal ions including in biological systems Fe Heme b Some other common chelating and cyclic ligands are shown below Acetylacetonate acac right is an anionic bidentate ligand that coordinates metal ions through two oxygen atoms Acac is a hard base so it prefers hard acid cations With divalent metal ions acac forms neutral volatile complexes such as Cuacac and Moacac that are useful for chemical vapor deposition CVD of metal thin films Bipyridine and related bidentate ligands such as phenanthroline below center left form propellershaped complexes with metals such as Ru The Rubpy complex below left is photoluminescent and can also undergo photoredox reactions making it an interesting compound for both photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis The chiral propellor shapes of metal polypyridyl complexes such as Rubpy coincidentally match the size and helicity of the major groove of DNA This has led to a number of interesting studies of electron transfer reactions along the DNA backbone initiated by photoexcitation of the metal complex Prof Jacqueline Barton Caltech has used metal polypyridyl complexes to study electron transfer reactions that are implicated in the biological sensing and repair of damage in DNA molecules Crown ethers such as crown below center right are cyclic hard bases that can complex alkali metal cations Crowns can selectively bind Li Na or K depending on the number of ethylene oxide units in the ring The chelating properties of crown ethers are mimetic of the natural antibiotic valinomycin below right which selectively transports K ions across bacterial cell membranes killing the bacterium by dissipating its membrane potential Like crown ethers valinomycin is a cyclic hard base
