No headers Many common inorganic crystals have structures that are related to cubic close packed facecentered cubic or hexagonal close packed sphere packings These packing lattices contain two types of sites or holes that the interstitial atoms fill and the coordination geometry of these sites is either tetrahedral or octahedral An interstitial atom filling a tetrahedral hole is coordinated to four packing atoms and an atom filling an octahedral hole is coordinated to six packing atoms In both the hexagonal close packed and cubic close packed lattices there is one octahedral hole and two tetrahedral holes per packing atom Question Would anions or cations be better as packing atoms We might expect that anions which are often larger than cations would be better suited to the positions of packing atoms While this is often true there are many examples of structures in which cations are the packing atoms and others in which the distinction is arbitrary The NaCl structure is a good example of the latter One octahedral and one tetrahedral site in a facecentered cubic unit cell Each cell contains four packing atoms gray four octahedral sites pink and eight tetrahedral sites blue In the NaCl structure shown on the right the green spheres are the Cl ions and the gray spheres are the Na ions The octahedral holes in a facecentered cubic lattice can be found at fractional coordinates and There are four of these holes per cell and they are filled by the chloride ions The packing atoms Na have coordinates and Note that each of the Na positions is related to a Cl position by a translation of Another way of stating this is that the structure consists of two interpenetrating fcc lattices which are related to each other by a translation of half the unit cell along any of the three Cartesian axes We could have equivalently placed the Cl ions at the fcc lattice points and the Na ions in the octahedral holes by simply translating the origin of the unit cell by Thus the distinction between packing and interstitial atoms in this case is arbitrary Crystal structure of NaCl Both the Na and Cl ions are octahedrally coordinated NaCl is interesting in that it is a threedimensional checkerboard and thus there are no NaCl molecules that exist in the structure When this structure was originally solved in by using Xray diffraction by W L Bragg his interpretation met resistance by chemists who thought that precise integer stoichiometries were a consequence of the valency of atoms in molecules The German chemist P Pfeiffer noted in that the ordinary notion of valency didnt seem to apply and fourteen years later the influential chemist H E Armstrong still found Braggs proposed structure of sodium chloride more than repugnant to the common sense not chemical cricket Nevertheless Bragg and his father W H Bragg persevered and used the thennew technique of Xray diffraction to determine the structures of a number of other compounds including diamond zincblende calcium fluoride and other alkali halides These experiments gave chemists their first real look at the atomic structure of solids and laid the groundwork for Xray diffraction experiments that later elucidated the structures of DNA proteins and many other compounds For their work on Xray diffraction the Braggs received the Nobel prize in Physics in The lattice dimensions and positions of atoms in crystals such as NaCl are inferred from diffraction patterns Since each type of atom in the NaCl structure forms a facecentered cubic lattice there are four Na and four Cl atoms per NaCl unit cell It is because of this ratio that NaCl has a stoichiometry The shaded green and gray bipyramidal structures in the NaCl lattice show that the Na ions are coordinated to six Cl ions and vice versa The NaCl structure can be alternatively drawn as a stacking of closepacked layer planes AcBaCbAcBa along the body diagonal of the unit cell Here the uppercase letters represent the packing atoms and the lower case letters are the interstitial atoms This layered packing is illustrated below NaCl structure A c B a C b A c B a C b A Note that both the packing atoms and interstitials are stacked in the sequence ABCABC in keeping with the fact that each forms a cubic closepacked lattice The NaCl structure is fairly common among ionic compounds Alkali Halides except CsCl CsBr and CsI Transition Metal Monoxides TiO VO NiO Alkali Earth Oxides and Sulfides MgO CaO BaS except BeO and MgTe Carbides and Nitrides TiC TiN ZrC NbC these are very stable refractory interstitial alloys metallic A number of other inorganic crystal structures are formed at least conceptually by filling octahedral andor tetrahedral holes in closepacked lattices The figure at the right shows some of the most common structures fluorite halite zincblende as well as a rather rare one LiBi that derive from the fcc lattice From the hcp lattice we can make the NiAs and wurzite structures which are the hexagonal relatives of NaCl and zincblende respectively An alternative and very convenient way to represent inorganic crystal structures especially complex structures such as LiBi is to draw the unit cell in slices along one of the unit cell axes This kind of representation is shown at the left for the fcc lattice and the NaCl structure Since all atoms in these structures have zcoordinates of either or only those sections need to be drawn in order to describe the contents of the unit cell It is a useful exercise to draw some of the fcc compound structures above in sections
