No headers Crystal field theory is one of the simplest models for explaining the structures and properties of transition metal complexes The theory is based on the electrostatics of the metalligand interaction and so its results are only approximate in cases where the metalligand bond is substantially covalent But because the model makes effective use of molecular symmetry it can be surprisingly accurate in describing the magnetism colors structure and relative stability of metal complexes Consider a positvely charged metal ion such as Fe in the field of six negatively charged ligands such as CN There are two energetic terms we need to consider The first is the electrostatic attraction between the metal and ligands which is inversely proportional to the distance between them The second term is the repulsion that arises from the Pauli exclusion principle when a third electron is added to a filled orbital There is no place for this third electron to go except to a higher energy antibonding orbital This is the situation when a ligand lone pair approaches an occupied metal dorbital Now let us consider the effect of these attractive and repulsive terms as the metal ion and ligands are brought together We do this in two steps first forming a ligand sphere around the metal and then moving the six ligands to the vertices of an octahedron Initially all five dorbitals are degenerate ie they have the same energy by symmetry In the first step the antibonding interaction drives up the energy of the orbitals but they remain degenerate In the second step the dorbitals split into two symmetry classes a lower energy triplydegenerate set the tg orbitals and a higher energy doubly degenerate set the eg orbitals A Fe ion has five delectrons one in each of the five dorbitals In a spherical ligand field the energy of electrons in these orbitals rises because of the repulsive interaction with the ligand lone pairs The orbitals split into two energy levels when the ligands occupy the vertices of an octahedron but the average energy remains the same The energy difference between the eg and tg orbitals is given the symbol ΔO where the O stands for octahedral We will see that this splitting energy is sensitive to the degree of orbital overlap and thus depends on both the metal and the ligand Relative to the midpoint energy the barycenter the tg orbitals are stabilized by ΔO and the eg orbitals are destabilized by ΔO in an octahedral complex dorbitals and their orientation with relation to ligands in an octahedral complex What causes the dorbitals to split into two sets Recall that the dorbitals have a specific orientation with respect to the Cartesian axes The lobes of the dxy dxz and dyz orbitals the tg orbitals lie in the xy xz and yzplanes respectively These three dorbitals have nodes along the x y and zdirections The orbitals that contain the ligand lone pairs are oriented along these axes and therefore have zero overlap with the metal tg orbitals It is easy to see that these three dorbitals must be degenerate by symmetry On the other hand the lobes of the dz and dxy orbitals the eg orbitals point directly along the bonding axes and have strong overlap with the ligand orbitals While it is less intuitively obvious these orbitals are also degenerate by symmetry and have antibonding character It is informative to compare the results of crystal field theory and molecular orbital theory also called ligand field theory in this context for an octahedral transition metal complex The energy level diagrams below make this comparison for the d octahedral ion TiHO In the MO picture below the frontier orbitals are derived from the metal dorbitals The lower tg set which contains one electron is nonbonding by symmetry and the eg orbitals are antibonding The metal s orbital which has ag symmetry makes a low energy bonding combination that is ligandcentered and an antibonding combination that is metalcentered and above the eg levels This is the reason that our delectron counting rules do not need to consider the metal s orbital The important takehome message is that crystal field theory and MO theory give very similar results for the frontier orbitals of transition metal complexes Crystal field energy diagram for the d octahedral complex TiHO Ligandfield diagram for the octahedral complex TiHO
