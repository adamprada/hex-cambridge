The conditions of electron fillingPauli principleHunds rule Wave functions of electrons in an atom are called atomic orbitals An atomic orbital is expressed using three quantum numbers the principal quantum number n the azimuthal quantum number l and the magnetic quantum number m For a principal quantum number n there are n azimuthal quantum numbers l ranging from to n and each corresponds to the following orbitals An atomic orbital is expressed by the combination of n and l For example n is and l is for a d orbital There are l m values namely l l l l Consequently there are one s orbital three p orbitals five d orbitals and seven f orbitals The three aforementioned quantum numbers are used to express the distribution of the electrons in hydrogentype atom and another quantum number ms which describes the direction of an electron spin is necessary to completely describe an electronic state Therefore an electronic state is defined by four quantum numbers n l m ms The wave function which determines the orbital shape can be expressed as the product of a radial wavefunction R and an angular wave function Y as follows R is a function of distance from the nucleus and Y expresses the angular component of the orbital Orbital shapes are shown in Figure Since the probability of the electrons existence is proportional to the square of the wave function an electron density map resembles that of a wave function The following conditions must be satisfied when each orbital is filled with electrons The conditions of electron filling Pauli principle The number of electrons that are allowed to occupy an orbital must be limited to one or two and for the latter case their spins must be antiparallel different direction Hunds rule When there are equalenergy orbitals electrons occupy separate orbitals nd their spins are parallel same direction The order of orbital energy of a neutral atom is and the electron configuration is determined as electrons occupy orbitals in this order according to the Pauli principle and Hunds rule An s orbital with one m can accommodate electrons a p orbital with three m electrons and a d orbital with five m electrons Exercise Describe the electron configuration of a C atom an Fe atom and a Au atom Answer Electrons equal to the atomic number are arranged in the order of orbital energies Since the electrons inside the valence shell take the rare gas configuration they may be denoted by the symbol of a rare gas element in brackets Figure Shapes of s p and d orbitals Table Periodic table of elements The values are atomic weights H Li Be Na Mg K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Rb Sr Y Z Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Cs Ba Lanthanoid Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Fr Ra Actinoid Lanthanoid La Ce Pr Nd Pm Sm Eu Actinoid Ac Th Pa U Np Pu Am He B C N O F Ne Al Si P S Cl Ar Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Kr Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Xe Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Po At Rn Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu Cm Bk Cf Es Fm Md No Lr
