No headers Lewis acids and bases can be classified by designating them as hard or soft Hard AcidsBases Hard acids and bases have a high charge positive for acids negative for bases to ionic radius ratio along with higher oxidation states Hard acids are not very polarizable and have high charge densities Thus metal ions with high positive charges and smaller ionic sizes tend to be hard acids Early transition metal ions in the d series tend to be hard Lewis acids Hard bases are typically small anions and neutral molecules Some examples of hard acids and bases include H O OH F Fe and Al Soft AcidsBases Soft acids or bases have a low charge to radius ratio with low oxidation states They are normally larger ions that are polarizable For example I and S are soft bases and low charge density transition metals such as Ag are considered soft acids Soft acids often include transition metals in the second and third row of the periodic table that have a or charge as well as late transition metals especially those in the d and d series with filled or almost completely filled d orbitals Acids and bases are not strictly hard or soft with many ions and compounds being classified as intermediate For example trimethylborane Fe and Pb cations are intermediate acids and pyridine and aniline are examples of intermediate bases An element can also change its hardsoft character depending on its oxidation state The most extreme example is hydrogen where H is a hard acid and H is a soft base Ni as in the layered compound NiOOH is a hard acid but Ni as in NiCO is a soft acid The figures below show hardsoft trends for acids left and bases right in the periodic table For bases the major hardsoft discontinuity is between the nd row NOF and the rows below Hardsoft trends for acids Hardsoft trends for bases Like binds with Like Hard acids interact more strongly with hard bases than they do with soft bases and soft acids interact more strongly with soft bases than hard bases Thus the most stable complexes are those with hardhard and softsoft interactions This tendency is illustrated in the table below which shows the trend in formation constants for hard and soft acids Hard acids bind halides in the order F Cl Br I whereas soft acids follow the opposite trend Log K fluoride chloride bromide iodide acid classification Fe Hard Pb Intermediate Ag Soft Hg Soft The softest metal ion in the periodic table is Auaq It forms stable complexes with soft bases such as phosphines and CN but not with hard bases such as O or F The affinity of Au for the soft base CN is high and the resulting AuCN complex is so stable that gold which is normally very difficult to oxidize can be oxidized by oxygen in the air This reaction is used in gold mining to separate small flakes of Au from large volumes of sand and other oxides Ag is similarly dissolved by air oxidation in cyanide solutions The precious metals are then isolated from the solution using chemical reducing agents or by electroplating The use of cyanide ion on a large scale in mining however creates a potentially serious environmental hazard In a spill at Baia Mare Romania resulted in the worst environmental disaster in Europe since Chernobyl Cyanide which is highly toxic is gradually oxidized by air to the less toxic cyanate OCN ion On the laboratory scale cyanide plating solutions are typically disposed of by using bleach to oxidize CN to OCN and the metal is recovered as an insoluble chloride salt Netted solution pond next to cyanide heap leaching of gold ore near Elko Nevada The Au ion because of its higher positive charge is a harder acid than Au and can form complexes with harder bases such as HO and amines In keeping with the like binds like principle the compound AuI softsoft is stable but AuI hardsoft is unknown Conversely AuF has never been isolated but AuF hardhard is stable
