No headers Whether a ferro or ferrimagnetic material is a hard or a soft magnet depends on the strength of the magnetic field needed to align the magnetic domains This property is characterized by Hc the coercivity Hard magnets have a high coercivity Hc and thus retain their magnetization in the absence of an applied field whereas soft magnets have low values The figure at the right compares hysteresis loops for hard and soft magnets Recall that the energy dissipated in magnetizing and demagnetizing the material is proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop We can see that soft magnets while they can achieve a high value of Bsat dissipate relatively little energy in the loop This makes soft magnets preferable for use in transformer cores where the field is switched rapidly Permalloy an alloy consisting of about Fe and Ni is a soft magnet that has very high magnetic permeability µ ie a large maximum slope of the B vs H curve and a very narrow hysteresis loop Some materials such as iron metal can exist as either hard or soft magnets Whether bcc iron is a hard or soft magnet depends on the crystal grain size When crystal grains in iron are submicron size and comparable to the size of the magnetic domains then the magnetic domains are pinned by crystal grain boundaries When the magnetic domains are pinned a stronger coercive magnetic field needs to be applied to cause them to realign When iron is annealed the crystal grains grow and the magnetic domains become more free to align with applied magnetic fields This decreases the coercive field and the material becomes a soft magnet Hysteresis loops comparing a hard magnet ironsilicon steel to a soft magnet permalloy on the same scale Hc for permallloy is Oe about times lower than that of the hard magnet The remanent magnetizations of the two materials are comparable Hard magnets such as CrO γFeO and cobalt ferrite CoFeO are used in magnetic recording media where the high coercivity allows them to retain the magnetization state read as a logical or of a magnetic bit over long periods of time Hard magnets are also used in disk drives refrigerator magnets electric motors and other applications Drive motors for hybrid and electric vehicles such as the Toyota Prius use the hard magnet NdFeB also used to make strong refrigerator magnets and require kilogram pounds of neodymium A highresolution transmission electron microscope image of NdFeB is shown below and compared to the crystal structure with the unit cell marked
