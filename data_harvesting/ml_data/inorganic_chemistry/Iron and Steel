No headers One other very important place where the difference between the hardness of a BCC and a closepacked metal is important is in steelmaking Between room temperature and oC iron has the BCC structure and is a tough hard metal tough as nails Above oC pure iron switches over to the FCC austenite structure which is much more ductile So hot iron can be bent and worked into a variety of shapes when it is very hot but still solid it melts at oC Rapid quenching of hot iron eg when the blacksmith plunges a red hot piece directly into cold water cools it to room temperature but doesnt allow time for the FCC BCC phase transition to occur therefore such pieces are still relatively malleable and can be shaped The ironiron carbide FeFeC phase diagram Below C pure iron exists as the alpha phase ferrite which has the BCC structure Between and C pure iron exists as the gamma phase austenite which has the FCC structure Carbon is more soluble in the FCC phase which occupies area Î³ on the phase diagram than it is in the BCC phase The percent carbon determines the type of iron alloy that is formed upon cooling from the FCC phase or from liquid iron alpha iron carbon steel pearlite or cast iron Carbon is added about by weight to iron to make carbon steel which is a very hard material Carbon is rather soluble in the FCC phase of iron but not in the BCC phase Therefore when the ductile FCC phase cools and turns into BCC tempering the steel which means cooling it slowly enough so the FCC to BCC transformation can occur the iron can no longer dissolve the excess carbon The carbon forms layers or grains of an extra phase FeC cementite a very hard material which are layered or dotted throughout the matrix of BCC iron grains The effect of all these little grains of FeC is to stop the motion of dislocations making for a harder but with higher carbon content increasingly brittle material This is why knives and swords are quenched from the FCC phase cold worked into the appropriate shapes and then heated up again and tempered before they are sharpened when they are made Cast iron objects frying pans radiators etc have a higher carbon content and are therefore very strong but tend to fracture rather than bend because of the larger fraction of the brittle FeC phase in the alloy Upon cooling high carbon steels phase segregate into a mixture of bcc iron light gray and FeC dark gray microscopic grains
