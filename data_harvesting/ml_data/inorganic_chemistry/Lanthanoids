No headers The fifteen elements shown in Table from lanthanum La f to lutetium Lu f are lanthanoids Ln may be used as a general symbol for the lanthanoid elements Although lanthanoids scandium Sc and yttrium Y are sometimes called rare earth elements they are relatively abundant in the earths crust With the exception of promethium Pm which does form a stable isotope even the least abundant thulium Tm and lutetium Lu are as abundant as iodine Because lanthanoids have very similar properties and are difficult to separate from one another they were not useful for basic research and application and hence they were regarded as rare elements Since a liquidliquid solvent extraction method using tributylphosphine oxide became available in the s lanthanoid elements have been readily available and widely used not only for chemical research but also as materials in alloys catalysts lasers cathoderay tubes etc Exercise What is the difference between lanthanoids and lanthanides Answer Fifteen elements LaLu are lanthanoids and fourteen elements CeLu without lanthanum are lanthanides meaning the elements similar to lanthanum Occasionally the names are confused and elements including lanthanum may be called lanthanides Table Properties of lanthanoids Atomic number Name Symbol Electron configuration M radius pm Lanthanum La ds Cerium Ce fds Praseodymium Pr fs Neodymium Nd fs Promethium Pm fs Samarium Sm fs Europium Eu fs Gadolinium Ge fds Terbium Tb fs Dysprosium Dy fs Holmium Ho fs Erbium Er fs Thurium Tm fs Ytterbium Yb fs Lutetium Lu fds Because the three stages of ionization enthalpy of lanthanoid elements are comparative low they are positive elements and readily assume trivalent ionic states Most compounds of lanthano other than Ce f Eu f Yb f are usually Ln ones Ln species are hard acids and since f electrons are buried deeply and not used for bonding they are hardly influenced by ligands There is a tendency for atomic and ionic radii to decrease with the increase of the atomic number and this phenomenon is called the lanthanide contraction This contraction is due to small shielding effects of f electrons which causes the atomic nucleus to draw outer shell electrons strongly with an increase of atomic number Complexes of lanthanoid metals are to coordinate and especially many and coordinate compounds are known Organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands of the types or are also known all of which are very reactive to oxygen or water
