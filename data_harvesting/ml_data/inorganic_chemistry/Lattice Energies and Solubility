No headers Lattice energies can also help predict compound solubilities Lets consider a BornHaber cycle for dissolving a salt in water We can imagine this as the sum of two processes the vaporization of the salt to produce gaseous ions characterized by the lattice enthalpy and the hydration of those ions to produce the solution The enthalpy change for the overall process is the sum of those two steps We know that the entropy change for dissolution of a solid is positive so the solubility depends on the enthalpy change for the overall process Here we need to consider the trends in both the lattice energy EL and the hydration energy EH The lattice energy depends on the sum of the anion and cation radii r r whereas the hydration energy has separate anion and cation terms Generally the solvation of small ions typically cations dominates the hydration energy because of the r dependence For salts that contain large anions EL doesnt change much as r changes That is because the anion dominates the r r term in the denominator of the formula for EL On the other hand EH changes substantially with r especially for small cations As a result sulfate salts of small divalent cations such as MgSO epsom salts are soluble whereas the lower hydration energy of Ba in BaSO makes that salt insoluble Ksp Left EL diagram for sulfate salts The large SO ion is sizemismatched to small cations such as Mg which have large hydration energies resulting soluble salts With larger cations such as Ba which have lower EH the lattice energy exceeds the solvation enthalpy and the salts are insoluble Right In the case of small anions such as F and OH the lattice energy dominates with small cations such as transition metal ions TMn Mg and Li Anioncation size mismatch occurs with larger cations such as Cs and Ba which make soluble fluoride salts For small anions EL is more sensitive to r whereas EH does not depend on r as strongly For fluorides and hydroxides LiF is slightly soluble whereas CsF is very soluble and MgOH is insoluble whereas BaOH is very soluble Putting both trends together we see that low solubility is most often encountered when the anion and cation match well in their sizes especially when one or both are multiply charged Spacefilling models showing the van der Waals surfaces of Ba and SO The similarity in size of the two ions contributes to the low solubility of BaSO in water Combining all our conclusions about solubility we note the following trends Increasing size mismatch between the anion and cation leads to greater solubility so CsF and LiI are the most soluble alkali halides Increasing covalency leads to lower solubility in the salts due to larger EL For example AgF AgCl AgBr and AgI exhibit progressively lower solubility because of increasing covalency Increasing the charge on the anion lowers the solubility because the increase in EL is large relative to the increase in EH Small polyvalent cations having large EH make soluble salts with large univalent anions such as I NO ClO PF and acetate Examples Salts of transition metal and lanthanide ions Ln Nitrate salts are soluble but oxides and hydroxides are insoluble Fe Perchlorate is soluble but sulfate is insoluble Multiple charged anions such as O S PO and SO make insoluble salts with most M M and M metals
