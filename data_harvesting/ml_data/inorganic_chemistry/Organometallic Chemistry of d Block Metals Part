organometallic chemistry of transition metals is comparatively new Although an ethylene complex of platinum called Zeises salt KPtClCH tetracarbonylnickel NiCO and pentacarbonyliron FeCO which today are classified as organometallic compounds were prepared in the th century their bonding and structures were unknown The research of W Hieber and others on metal carbonyl compounds was important in the s but the results of these studies were limited because of the underdeveloped techniques of structural analyses available at the time The discovery of ferrocene FeCH in was epochmaking for the chemistry of this field The very unique bonding mode of this complex became clear by means of single crystal Xray structural analysis NMR spectra infrared spectra etc and served as a starting point for subsequent developments in the field It was a major discovery that ferrocene exhibited very high thermal stability in spite of the general view that the transition metalcarbon bonds were very unstable It was also clearly demonstrated that the compound had a sandwich structure in which the five carbon atoms of the cyclopentadienyl groups bonded simultaneously to the central metal iron While the various coordination modes of hydrocarbon ligands were determined one after another the industrial importance of organometallic compounds of transition metals increased with the discoveries of olefin polymerization catalysts Ziegler catalyst homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts Wilkinson catalyst and development of catalysts for asymmetric synthesis etc The Nobel prize awarded to K Ziegler G Natta E O Fischer and G Wilkinson was in recognition of this importance According to the definition of an organometallic compound at least one direct bond between a metal and a carbon atom should exist but CN complexes etc with no organometallic character are usually excluded from organometallic compounds Metal carbonyl compounds are organometallic in various aspects of their bonding structure and reactions and they are a good model system for understanding of the essence of transition metal organometallic chemistry a Metal carbonyl compounds Binary metal carbonyl compounds that consist only of a metal and CO ligands are usually prepared by the direct reaction of the powder of a highly reactive metal and carbon monoxide or by the reduction of a metal salt to zero valance followed by reaction with highpressure carbon monoxide However tetracarbonylnickel first discovered at the end of the th century forms by the reaction of nickel metal and carbon monoxide under atmospheric pressure and at room temperature The preparation of other metal carbonyl compounds on the other hand requires high temperatures and high pressures Figure Structures of metal carbonyl compounds Mononuclear metal carbonyl compounds take highly symmetric polyhedral coordination structures Hexacoordinate chromium molybdenum and tungsten hexacarbonyl MCO assume a regular octahedral pentacoordinate pentacarbonyliron FeCO a triangular bipyramid and tetracarbonylnickel NiCO a regular tetrahedron coordination structure Figure The carbon atoms of carbonyl ligands coordinate to the metal and the CO moieties are oriented along the direction of the metalcarbon axis Binuclear metal carbonyl MnCO has an MnMn bond joining two square pyramidal MnCO parts In FeCO two FeCO subunits are bridged by three CO ligands and in CoCO two CoCO subunits are connected by both three CO bridges and a CoCo bond There are a number of cluster metal carbonyl compounds with metalmetal bonds joining three or more metals and terminal CO CO a bridge between two metals and CO a bridge capping three metals are coordinated to the metal frames refer to Section f Many cluster carbonyls are formed by a pyrolysis reaction of mononuclear or binuclear carbonyl compounds Typical metal carbonyl compounds and their properties are shown in Table VCO Black solid d CrCO White solid d MnCO Yellow solid mp

Orange solid mp IrCO Yellow solid d Back donation A metal carbonyl compound consists of carbon monoxide coordinated to a zero valent metal For a long time it had been unclear why such bonding was possible let alone stable at all The belief that normal coordination bonds were formed by the donation of electrons from highly basic ligands to a metal formed the basis of the coordination theory of A Werner Because the basicity of carbon monoxide is very low and transition metalcarbon bonds are generally not very stable a suitable explanation for the stability of metal carbonyl compounds was sought If the shape and symmetry of the metal d orbital and of the CO antibonding orbital for the carbonoxygen bond are suitable for overlap a bonding interaction between the metal and carbon is expected The bonding scheme shown in Figure was proposed from this point of view The mechanism by which electrons are donated to the vacant carbon monoxide orbital from the filled metal d orbital is called back donation Since accumulation of superfluous electrons on a low oxidation state metal atom is prevented backdonation leads to the stabilization of the MC bond Fig Back donation in metal carbonyls A rise in the order of the metal carbon bond is reflected in the increase of the MC and decrease of the CO stretching frequencies in vibrational spectra Infrared spectra are useful because carbonyl frequencies are easily detectable The lowering of the oxidation state of a metal by the flow of negative charge from its coordinated ligands is reflected in the reduction of the CO stretching frequencies b Hydrocarbon complexes An organometallic compound is one which has metalcarbon bonds and between one and eight carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon ligand bond to a metal Hapticity describes the number of atoms in a ligand that have direct coordinative interaction with the metal and the number is added to An example is pentahaptocyclopentadienyl Table A ligand that donates an odd number of electrons to a metal is formally a radical and it is stabilized by bonding to the metal A ligand that donates an even number of electrons to a metal is generally a neutral molecule and it is stable even if it is not bonded to the metal Carbene or carbyne ligands are exceptions to this rule The chemical formula of an organometallic compound is expressed in many cases without using the square brackets usual for such a complex and we shall follow this convention in this book Table Hapticity and number of donating electrons of hydrocarbon ligands Name Hapticity Number of electrons Example Alkyl WCH Alkylidene CrCOCOCHCH Alkene KPtClCH allyl NiCH Diene FeCOCH Cyclopentadienyl FeCH Arene CrCH Tropylium VCO CH Cyclooctatetraene U CH Exercise Describe the difference between cyclopentadiene and cyclopentadienyl ligands Answer The chemical formula of cyclopentadiene is CH and it is bonded to a metal as a or ligand The chemical formula of cyclopentadienyl is CH and it is bonded to a metal as a or ligand Alkyl ligands Alkyl or aryl transition metal compounds have MC single bonds In spite of many attempts over most of the course of chemical history their isolation was unsuccessful and it was long considered that all MC bonds were essentially unstable Stable alkyl complexes began to be prepared gradually only from the s CpZrClPrWMe CpFeMeCO CoMepydmg dmg dimethylglyoximato IrClXEtCOPPh NiEtbipy PtClEtPEt are some representative compounds Among various synthetic processes so far developed the reactions of compounds containing Mhalogen bonds with maingroup metalalkyl compounds such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound are common synthetic routes Especially vitamin B of which D Hodgkin Nobel Prize determined the structure is known to have a very stable CoC bond Metal alkyl compounds which have only alkyl ligand such as WMe are called homoleptic alkyls It is gradually accepted that a major cause of the instability of alkyl complexes is the low activation energy of their decomposition rather than a low MC bond energy The most general decomposition path is elimination Namely the bonding interaction of a hydrocarbon ligand with the central transition metal tends to result in the formation of a metal hydride and an olefin Such an interaction is called an agostic interaction Although an alkyl and an aryl ligand are electron ligands they are regarded as anions when the oxidation number of the metal is counted The hydride ligand H resembles the alkyl ligand in this aspect allyl complexes If an allyl group CHCHCH is bonded to a metal via a carbon atom it is a electron ligand like an alkyl group If the double bond delocalizes three carbon atoms bond to the metal simultaneously as a electron ligand This is also an odd electron and formally anionic ligand and is stabilized by being coordinated to the metal PdCHAcPPh CoCH etc are wellknown examples Since and coordination modes are possible in the catalytic reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons various reactions occur cyclopentadienl complexes The cyclopentadie nyl ligand CH is abbreviated as Cp CMe in which the hydrogen atoms of Cp are replaced with methyl groups is a useful ligand called Cp star and is denoted by Cp Ferrocene CpFe is a very stable orangecolored iron compound in which two cyclopentadienyl groups are bonded to iron It was discovered independently in two laboratories but the discoverers proposed incorrect structures The correct structure was clarified by the group of G Wilkinson who won a Nobel Prize The preparation of ferrocene is usually carried out according to the following reaction path Figure Structure of ferrocene Single crystal Xray structure analysis showed that the structure of ferrocene is an iron atom sandwiched between two CH rings Figure Five carbon atoms bond to the iron simultaneously in ferrocene and unsaturated CC bonds are delocalized in the fivemembered rings Since this kind of bond was not known before it aroused interest many derivative

ligand If only one of the five carbon atoms is bonded to a metal it is a electron ligand like an alkyl group It becomes a electron ligand in rare cases and coordinates to a metal as a allyl system that extends over carbon atoms The Cp group of ferrocene has reactivity analogous to that of aromatic compounds Since the Cp group has played a significant role as a stabilizing ligand to realize the preparation of new compounds with new metalligand bonding modes it can reasonably be claimed that this ligand has made the greatest contribution to organometallic chemistry of any other ligand Although two Cp rings are bonded to the metal in parallel in ferrocene CpTiCl and CpMoH have bent Cp ligands and they are called bentsandwich compounds Olefin complexes Zeises salt KPtClCH is the oldest known organometallic compound and was synthesized and analyzed in ca by Zeise although its coordination structure was assumed only in and confirmed by the neutron diffraction in The mode of coordination of an olefin to a transition metal is described by the DewarChattDuncanson model and the bond between the metal and olefin is stabilized by the contribution of dp back donation An olefin is a electron ligand and there are many olefin complexes in which the central metal is in a relatively low oxidation state Dienes or trienes with two or more double bonds coordinate to a metal as electron or electron ligands FeCOCH and Nicod in which a butadiene or cyclooctadienes cod are coordinated to the metal are well known examples Since cyclooctadienes are easily eliminated from Nicod it is conveniently used for generating atomic zero valent nickel This complex is sometimes called naked nickel Figure Backdonation in olefin complexes Arene complexes Aromatic compounds are electron donors that coordinate to transition metals in the coordination mode with six carbon atoms Bisbenzenechromium CrCH is a typical example of such a compound The compound is prepared by reducing chromium chloride in benzene and it has a sandwich structure in which a chromium atom is insertedb etween two benzene rings When a benzene ligand is replaced by three carbonyls CrCOCH is obtained electron rule Counting valence electrons is of utmost importance in chemistry Changes in the number of valence electrons has a profound influence on the bonding structure and reactions of a compound Since both the metal and organic moieties are involved in organometallic compounds counting the number of electrons becomes complicated Hydrocarbyl ligands are classified as either neutral molecules coordinating to the metal or radicals bonding to the metal and the radicals such as alkyls and cyclopentadienyl are generally called anionic ligands Transfer of one electron from the metal to the radical ligand makes the ligand formally anionic However it is less confusing to consider that both the metal and the ligands are neutral when counting the number of valence electrons The numbers of donor electrons in typical carbon ligands from this viewpoint are listed in Table It is important to note that even in the same ligand the number of donor electrons supplied by the ligand differs depending upon the number of ligating atoms that have coordinative interactions with the metal For example or electrons can be donated from a cyclopentadienyl ligand depending on the type of coordinative interactions with the metal When the total number of valence electrons of the metal and ligands is a transition metal organometallic compound usually has high thermal stability For example CrCO FeCO NiCO FeCH MoCHCO etc satisfy the electron rule but the monomeric parts of MnCO CoCO or FeCHCO have only electrons and the extra electron comes from the partner metal by forming a metalmetal bond Unlike the electron rule in main group compounds applicability of the electron rule is limited That is to say it is a sufficient condition but compounds with high thermal stability are not necessarily electron compounds Although there are many Group chromium group through Group cobalt group organometallic compounds with carbonyl or cyclopentadienyl ligands that satisfy the electron rule many compounds of the early transition metals Group and Group nickel group fail to conform to this rule For example WCH e TiClCH e and IrClCOPPh e VCO e CoCH e NiCH e etc do not satisfy the electron rule However the electron rule provides useful clues as to the bonding modes present in a given complex For example FeCHCO with two pentahapto cyclopentadienyl ligands formally has electrons but if one of the ligands is monohapto the compound has electrons Structural analysis has shown that this is the actual coordination of this complex Exercise Calculate the valence electron number of CpMnCO Answer They are a total of electrons from Mn Cp and three CO c Phosphine complexes Tertiary phosphines PX are very useful as stabilization ligands in transition metal complexes and they coordinate to the metals in relatively high to low oxidation states Phosphines are frequently used as carbonyl or cyclopentadienyl ligands in the chemistry of organometallic complexes PX are Lewis bases and coordinate to the metal using the lone pair on phosphorus and show acidity when carrying substituents X including Ph Cl or F that have strong electron accepting properties The electronic flexibility of PX is the reason it forms so many complexes Generally the πacidity becomes smaller in the order PF PCl PPh PR Triphenylphosphine and triethylphosphine are typical substituted phosphines The tertiaryphosphine complexes mainly of metal halides are listed in Table Manganese Mn and the early transition metals form very few phosphine complexes Table Typical tertiary phosphine complexes dmpe bisdimethylphosphinoethane dppe bisdiphenylphosphinoethane TiClPPh VClPMe Ph CrCl dmpe MnCO PPh FeCl PPh CoCl PPh NiClPEt CuBrPEt ZrCldppe NbClPEt Ph MoClPMe Ph TcClPMe Ph RuCl PPh RhClPPh PdClP Ph AgClPPh HfCldppe TaClPEt WClPPh ReClPMe Ph OsCl PPh IrClPPh PtClP Ph AuClPPh Many derivatives can be prepared by substituting the halogens of the phosphine complexes A number of the complexes of polydentate phosphines with more than two coordination sites as well as those of monodentate phosphines have been prepared and they are used also as stabilization ligands in hydride alkyl dinitrogen and dihydrogen complexes The complexes of rhodium or ruthenium in which optically active phosphines are coordinated are excellent catalysts for asymmetric synthesis
