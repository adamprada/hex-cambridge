acidsSulfuric acid HSOThiosulfuric acid HSOSulfurous acid HSOg Metal oxides a Oxygen Dioxygen O is a colorless and odorless gas bp C that occupies of air volume ratio Since oxygen atoms are also the major components of water and rocks oxygen is the most abundant element on the Earths surface Despite its abundance it was established as an element as late as the th century Since an immense quantity of oxygen gas is consumed for steel production now it is separated in large quantities from liquified air The isotopes of oxygen are O abundance O and O O has nuclear spin I and is an important nuclide for NMR measurements O is used as a tracer for tracking reagents or for the study of reaction mechanisms It is also useful for the assignment of absorption lines in infrared or Raman spectra by means of isotope effects As already described in section e dioxygen O in the ground state has two unpaired spins in its molecular orbitals shows paramagnetism and is called triplet dioxygen In the excited state the spins are paired and dioxygen becomes diamagnetic which is called singlet dioxygen Singlet dioxygen is important in synthetic chemistry because it has characteristic oxidation reactivity Singlet dioxygen is generated in a solution by an energy transfer reaction from a photoactivated complex or by the pyrolysis of ozonides O compounds Superoxide ion O and peroxide ion O are the anions of dioxygen Table They can be isolated as alkali metal salts There is another state O called the dioxygen cation and it can be isolated as a salt with suitable anions Table Oxidation states of dioxygen Bond order Compound OO distance Å νOO cm O OAsF O O KO O NaO Ozone O is an allotrope of oxygen that is an unstable gas with an irritating odor Ozone is a bent threeatom molecule and has unique reactivities In recent years it has been discovered that ozone plays an important role in intercepting the detrimental ultraviolet radiation from the sun in the upper atmospheric zone and in protecting life on the Earth from photochemical damage It is now clear that chlorofluorocarbons frequently used as refrigerants or as cleaners of electronic components destroy the ozone layer and measures are being taken on a global scale to cope with this serious environmental problem b Oxides of hydrogen Oxygen is highly reactive and direct reactions with many elements form oxides Water is an oxide of hydrogen and is crucially important for the global environment and life in general Water HO Ninetyseven percent of water on the Earth is present as sea water as ice of the polar zone and fresh water represents only the small remaining fraction Fundamental chemical and physical properties of water are very significant to chemistry The main physical properties are shown in Table Most of the unusual properties of water are caused by its strong hydrogen bonds Physical properties of water differ considerably with the presence of isotopes of hydrogen At least nine polymorphs of ice are known and their crystal structures depend on the freezing conditions of the ice Water has a bond angle of and a bond distance of pm as a free molecule It is described in Section b that selfdissociation of water generates oxonium ion HO Further water molecules add to HO to form HOHn HO HO HO and HO and the structures of the various species have been determined Hydrogen peroxide HO Hydrogen peroxide is an almost colorless liquid mp C and bp extrapolated C that is highly explosive and dangerous in high concentrations Usually it is used as a dilute solution but occasionally aqueous solutions are used Since it is consumed in large quantities as a bleaching agent for fiber and paper largescale industrial synthetic process has been established This process applies very subtle catalytic reactions to produce a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide from air and hydrogen using a substituted anthraquinone This dilute solution is then concentrated When deuterium peroxide is prepared in a laboratory the following reaction is applied Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed into oxygen and water in the presence of catalysts such as manganese dioxide MnO Hydrogen peroxide may be either an oxidant or a reductant depending on its coreactants Its reduction potential in an acidic solution expressed in a Latimer diagram refer to Section c is c Silicon oxides Silicon oxides are formed by taking SiO tetrahedra as structural units and sharing the corner oxygen atoms They are classified by the number of cornersharing oxygen atoms in the SiO tetrahedra as this determines their composition and structure When the SiO tetrahedra connect by corner sharing the structures of the polymeric compounds become a chain a ring a layer or dimensional depending on the connection modes of adjacent units Fractional expression is adopted in order to show the bridging modes Namely the numerator in the fraction is the number of bridging oxygens and the denominator is meaning that one oxygen atom is shared by two tetrahedra The empirical formulae are as follows and each structure is illustrated in Figure in coordinationpolyhedron form A bridge is constructed with one oxygen atom SiOO SiO Bridges are constructed with two oxygen atoms SiOOnn SiOnn Bridges are constructed with three oxygen atoms SiOOnn SiOnn Amalgamation of bridging modes with three oxygen and two oxygen atoms SiOSiOOn SiOn Bridges are constructed with four oxygen atoms SiOn SiOn Silicates with various cross linkage structures are contained in natural rocks sand clay soil etc Figure Bridging modes of the SiO tetrahedra Aluminosilicates There are many minerals in which some silicon atoms of silicate minerals are replaced by aluminum atoms They are called aluminosilicates Aluminum atoms replace the silicon atoms in the tetrahedral sites or occupy the octahedral cavities of oxygen atoms making the structures more complicated The substitution of a tetravalent silicon by a trivalent aluminum causes a shortage of charge which is compensated by occlusion of extra cations such as H Na Ca etc Feldspars are a typical aluminosilicate mineral and KAlSiO orthoclase and NaAlSiO albite are also known well Feldspars take dimensional structures in which all the corners of the SiO and AlO tetrahedra are shared On the other hand dimensional layers are formed if AlSiO units are lined and stratified minerals like mica are constructed if coordinate ions are inserted between layers If the number of oxygen atoms in the layers is not enough to form regular octahedra between layers hydroxide groups bond to the interstitial Al ions Muscovite KAlOHSiAlO is a type of mica with such a structure and can be eas ily peeled into layers Zeolite One of the important aluminosilicates is zeolite Zeolites are present as natural minerals and also many kinds of zeolites are prepared synthetically in large quantities The SiO and AlO tetrahedra are bonded by oxygen bridges and form holes and tunnels of various sizes The structures are composites of the basic structural units of tetrahedral MO As shown in Figure the basic units are cubes with condensed MO hexagonal prisms with condensed MO and truncated octahedra with condensed MO Figure Structure of zeolite A Silicon or aluminum atoms are located on the corners of the polyhedra and the bridging oxygen atoms on the middle of each edge it should be noted that this expression is different from the polyhedron model of oxides When these polyhdra are bonded various kinds of zeolite structures are formed For example the truncated octahedra called cages are the basic frames of synthetic zeolite A NaAlSiO HO and the quadrangle portions are connected through cubes It can be seen that an octagonal tunnel B forms when eight truncated octahedra bind in this way The structure in which the hexagon portions connect through hexagonal prisms is faujasite NaCaAlSiO HO Alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cations exist in the holes and the number of these cations increases with the content of aluminum to compensate for the charge deficiency The structures of zeolites have many crevices in which cations and water are contained Utilizing this cationexchange property zeolites are used in large quantities as softeners of hard water As zeolites dehydrated by heating absorb water efficiently they are also used as desiccants of solvents or gases Zeolites are sometimes called molecular sieves since the sizes of holes and tunnels change with the kinds of zeolites and it is possible to segregate organic molecules according to their sizes Zeolites can fix the directions of more than two molecules in their cavities and can be used as catalysts for selective reactions For example synthetic zeolite ZSM is useful as a catalyst to convert methanol to gasoline This zeolite is prepared hydrothermally in an autoclave highpressure reaction vessel at ca C using metasodium luminate NaAlO as the source of aluminum oxide and silica sol as the source of silicon oxide with tetrapropylammonium bromide PrNBr present in the reaction The role of this ammonium salt is a kind of mold to form zeolite holes of a fixed size When the ammonium salt is removed by calcination at C the zeolite structure remains d Nitrogen oxides A variety of nitrogen oxides will be described sequentially from lower to higher oxidation numbers Table Table Typical oxides of main group elements LiO BeO BO CO CO NO NO NO NaO NaO NaO MgO AlO SiO PO PO SO SO ClO ClO KO KO KO CaO ZnO GaO GeO AsO AsO SeO SeO RbO RbO RbO SrO CdO InO SnO SbO SbO TeO TeO IO XeO XeO CsO CsO BaO HgO TlO TlO PbO PbO BiO Dinitrogen monoxide NO Oxide of monovalent nitrogen Pyrolysis of ammonium nitrate generates this oxide as follows Although the oxidation number is a formality it is an interesting and symbolic aspect of the versatility of the oxidation number of nitrogen that NHNO forms a monovalent nitrogen oxide is a half of the average of and for NH and NO respectively The NNO bond distances of the straight NO are pm NN and pm NO corresponding to th and th bond order respectively NO e is isoelectronic with carbon dioxide CO e This compound is also called laughing gas and is widely used for analgesia Nitric oxide NO An oxide of divalent nitrogen This is obtained by reduction of nitrite as follows Having an odd number of valence electrons electrons it is paramagnetic The NO distance is pm and the bond has double bond character The unpaired electron in the highest antibonding orbital is easily removed and NO becomes NO nitrosonium which is isoelectronic with CO Since an electron is lost from the antibonding orbital the NO bond becomes stronger The compounds NOBF and NOHSO containing this cation are used as electron oxidants Although NO is paramagnetic as a monomer in the gas phase dimerization in the ondensed phase leads to diamagnetism It is unique as a ligand of transition metal complexes and forms complexes like FeCONO in which NO is a neutral electron ligand Although MNO is straight in these kind of complexes the MNO angle bends to in CoNHNO Br in which NO coordinates as a electron ligand It has become clear recently that nitric oxide has various biological control functions such as bloodpressure depressing action and it attracts attention as the second inorganic material after Ca to play a role in signal transduction Dinitrogen trioxide NO The oxidation number of nitrogen is and this is an unstable compound decomposing into NO and NO at room temperature It is generated when equivalent quantities of NO and NO are condensed at low temperatures It is light blue in the solid state and dark blue in the liquid state but the color fades at higher temperatures Nitrogen dioxide NO A nitrogen compound with oxidation number It is an odd electron compound with an unpaired electron and is dark reddish brown in color It is in equilibrium with the colorless dimer dinitrogen tetroxide NO The proportion of NO is at C and it increases gradually to at its boiling point C and becomes at C NO can be generated by the pyrolysis of lead nitrate as follows When NO is dissolved in water nitric acid and nitrous acid are formed By one electron oxidation NO nitroyl forms and the ONO angle changes from to in the neutral NO On the other hand by one electron reduction NO nitrito forms and the angle bends to Dinitrogen pentoxide NO is obtained when concentrated nitric acid is carefully dehydrated with phosphorus pentoxide at low temperatures It sublimes at C As it forms nitric acid by dissolving in water it may also be called a nitric anhydride Although it assumes an ionpair structure NONO and straight NO and planar NO ions are located alternately in the solid phase it is molecular in the gas phase Oxoacids Oxyacids of nitrogen include nitric acid HNO nitrous acid HNO and hyponitrous acid HNO Nitric acid HNO is one of the most important acids in the chemical industry along with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid Nitric acid is produced industrially by the Ostwald process which is the oxidation reaction of ammonia in which the oxidation number of nitrogen increases from to Because the Gibbs energy of the direct conversion of dinitrogen to the intermediate NO is positive and therefore the reaction is unfavorable thermodynamically dinitrogen is firstly reduced to ammonia and this is then oxidized to NO Nitric acid HNO Commercial nitric acid is a ca aqueous solution and vacuum distillation of it in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide gives pure nitric acid As it is a srong oxidizing agent while also being a strong acid it can dissolve metals copper silver lead etc which do not dissolve in other acids Gold and platinum can even be dissolved in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid aqua regia The nitrate ion NO and nitrite ion NO take various coordination forms when they coordinate as ligands in transition metal complexes Nitrous acid HNO Although not isolated as a pure compound aqueous solutions are weak acids pKa at C and important reagents Since NaNO is used industrially for hydroxylamine NHOH production and also used for diazotidation of aromatic amines it is important for the manufacture of azo dyes and drugs Among the various coordination forms of NO isomers now known monodentate nitro Ncoordination and nitrito Ocoordination ligands had already been discovered in the th century e Phosphorus oxides The structures of the phosphorus oxides PO PO PO and PO have been determined Phosphorus pentoxide PO is a white crystalline and sublimable solid that is formed when phosphorus is oxidized completely Four phosphorus atoms form a tetrahedron and they are bridged by oxygen atoms refer to Figure Since a terminal oxygen atom is bonded to each phosphorus atom the coordination polyhedron of oxygen is also a tetrahedron When the molecular PO is heated a vitrified isomer is formed This is a polymer composed of similar tetrahedra of phosphorus oxide with the same composition that are connected to one another in sheets Since it is very reactive with water phosphorus pentoxide is a powerful dehydrating agent It is used not only as a desiccant but also it has remarkable dehydration properties and NO or SO can be formed by dehydration of HNO or HSO respectively Phosphorus pentoxide forms orthophosphoric acid HPO when reacted with sufficient water but if insufficient water is used various kinds of condensed phosphoric acids are produced depending on the quantity of reacting water Phosphorus trioxide PO is a molecular oxide and its tetrahedral structure results from the removal of only the terminal oxygen atoms from phosphorus pentoxide Each phosphorus is tricoordinate This compound is formed when white phosphorus is oxidized at low temperatures in insufficient oxygen The oxides with compositions intermediate between phosphorus pentoxide and trioxide have to terminal oxygen atoms and their structures have been analyzed Although arsenic and antimony give molecular oxides AsO and SbO that have similar structures to PO bismuth forms a polymeric oxide of composition BiO Phosphoric acid Orthophosphoric acid HPO It is one of the major acids used in chemical industry and is produced by the hydration reaction of phosphorus pentoxide PO Commercial phosphoric acid is usually of purity The pure acid is a crystalline compound mp C One terminal oxygen atom and three OH groups are bonded to the phosphorus atom in the center of a tetrahedron The three OH groups release protons making the acid tribasic pK When two orthophosphoric acid molecules condense by the removal of an HO molecule pyrophosphoric acid HPO is formed Phosphonic acid HPO This acid is also called phosphorous acid and has H in place of one of the OH groups of orthophosphoric acid Since there are only two OH groups it is a dibasic acid Phosphinic acid HPO It is also called hypophosphorous acid and two of the OH groups in orthophosphoric acid are replaced by H atoms The remaining one OH group shows monobasic acidity If the PO tetrahedra in the above phosphorus acids bind by O bridges many condensed phosphoric acids form Adenosine triphosphate ATP deoxyribonucleic acid DNA etc in which the triphosphorus acid moieties are combined with adenosine are phosphorus compounds that are fundamentally important for living organisms f Sulfur oxides Sulfur dioxide SO This is formed by the combustion of sulfur or sulfur compounds This is a colorless and poisonous gas bp C and as an industrial emission is one of the greatest causes of environmental problems However it is very important industrially as a source material of sulfur Sulfur dioxide is an angular molecule and recently it has been demonstrated that it takes various coordination modes as a ligand to transition metals It is a nonaqueous solvent similar to liquid ammonia and is used for special reactions or as a solvent for special NMR measurements Sulfur trioxide SO It is produced by catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide and used for manufacturing sulfuric acid The usual commercial reagent is a liquid bp C The gaseous phase monomer is a planar molecule It is in equilibrium with a ring trimer SO SO in the gaseous or liquid phase In the presence of a minute amount of water SO changes to SO which is a crystalline high polymer with a helical structure SO is also known as a solid of still more complicated lamellar structure All react violently with water to form sulfuric acid Sulfur acids Although there are many oxy acids of sulfur most of them are unstable and cannot be isolated They are composed of a combination of SO SOH SOS and SS bonds with a central sulfur atom As the oxidation number of sulfur atoms varies widely various redox equilibria are involved Sulfuric acid HSO It is an important basic compound produced in the largest quantity of all inorganic compounds Pure sulfuric acid is a viscous liquid mp C and dissolves in water with the generation of a large amount of heat to give strongly acidic solutions Thiosulfuric acid HSO Although it is generated if thiosulfate is acidified the free acid is unstable The SO ion is derived from the replacement of one of the oxygen atoms of SO by sulfur and is mildly reducing Sulfurous acid HSO The salt is very stable although the free acid has not been isolated The SO ion that has pyramidal Cv symmetry is a reducing agent In dithionic acid HSO and the dithionite ion SO the oxidation number of sulfer is and one SS bond is formed This is a very strong reducing agent g Metal oxides Oxides of all the metallic elements are known and they show a wide range of properties in terms of structures acidity and basicity and conductivity Namely an oxide can exhibit molecular dimensional chain dimensional layer or dimensional structures There are basic amphoteric and acidic oxides depending on the identity of the metallic element Moreover the range of physical properties displayed is also broad from insulators to semicondutors metallic conductors and superconductors The compositions of metallic oxide can be simply stoichiometric stoichiometric but not simple or sometimes nonstoichiometric Therefore it is better to classify oxides according to each property However since structures give the most useful information to understand physical and chemical properties typical oxides are classified first according to the dimensionality of their structures Table Table Table Typical binary oxides of transition me Oxidation number TiOl CuO AgO TiO VO NbO MnO FeO CoO NiO CuO AgO ScO YO TiO VO CrO FeO RhO
