No headers In Chapter we learned all about crystal structures of ionic compounds A good question to ask is what makes a compound choose a particular structure In addressing this question we will learn about the forces that hold crystals together and the relative energies of different structures This will in turn help us understand in a more quantitative way some of the heuristic concepts we have learned about in earlier chapters such as hardsoft acidbase theory At ordinary pressures the CsCl structure is adopted by only three of the alkali halides CsCl CsBr and CsI Under high pressure however other alkali halides transform from the NaCl to the CsCl structure because of the higher Madelung constant of CsCl
