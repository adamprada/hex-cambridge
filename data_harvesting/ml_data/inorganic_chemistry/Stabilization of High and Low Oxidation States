No headers Lattice energies in addition to guiding the discovery of unknown compounds are useful in explaining the absence ie the thermodynamic instability of nonexistent compounds For example CuF and AuF are unknown compounds whereas CuF AuF and AuF are stable In contrast AgF is a known stable compound From the Born Haber cycle for CuF the compound should be marginally stable Î”Hfo kJmol with respect to the elements Why then is CuF unknown To gain insight into this question we first construct a BornHaber cycle for the formation of CuF from the elements This compound is stable with respect to the elements by kJmol Combining the two cycles we see that the disproportionation of CuF to Cu and CuF is spontaneous From similar cycles we can also predict that the reaction AuF AuF Au should be spontaneous Why is the lowest oxidation state unstable for these fluorides The key point is that the large difference in EL values kJ in the case of copper fluorides drives their disproportionation reactions Note that when we use the Kapustinskii equation we calculate that EL for CuF is approximately three times that of CuF We use the same univalent radii in both calculations but Cu has a charge in CuF doubling the lattice energy relative to CuF and contains as many ions The product zzn is thus three times larger for CuF The difference in EL values will thus increase as EL for the monovalent salt increases We know that fluorides having a small anion radius will give larger EL values than iodides which have larger anions Thus the disproportionation reaction becomes more favorable for CuF than it is for CuI The stability of the lower vs higher oxidation state thus depends on the size of the anion For example in fluorides CuF is unstable but CuF is stable However in iodides CuI is stable whereas CuI is unstable From this we can develop a broad conclusion small anions OF tend to stabilize higher oxidation states whereas large anions S Br I stabilize lower oxidation states Note that this trend has to do with the size and not with the electronegativity of the anion Coincidentally F and O are electronegative elements but it is really their small size that has consequences for the lattice energy and their stabilization of higher oxidation states Cuprous iodide CuI is a crystalline compound used in organic synthesis and cloud seeding This compound can be made in the laboratory by reacting soluble Cu salts with a solution of sodium or potassium iodide Because CuI is thermodynamicaly unstable the reaction liberates I and a CuI precipitate forms Remember that the hardsoft acidbase rules could be interpreted in terms of the dominance of ionic vs covalent interactions Here we have put the hardhard interaction in quantitative terms based on electrostatic lattice energies Ag appears to buck the periodic trend Why is AgF stable This is because the second IP is very high kJ vs kJ for Cu for Au Thus both AgF and AgF are known fluorides of Ag
