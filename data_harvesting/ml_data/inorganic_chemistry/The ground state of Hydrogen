IntroductionThe wavefunction of the ground state of hydrogenReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors Hydrogen is the simplest atoms which only contains an electron and a proton The ground state of hydrogen is the lowest allowed energy level and has zero angular momentum However it is the most stable state in which a single electron occupied the s atomic orbital Introduction The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that a system at absolute zero temperature exists in its ground state Therefore its entropy is determined by the degeneracy of the ground stateThe ground state is the lowest energy state and the energy of the ground sate is called zeropoint energy The diameter of a hydrogen atom in its ground state is about x cm In order to provide the ground states of the hydrogen atom we need to solve the Schrödinger equation The wavefunction of the ground state of hydrogen A hydrogen atoms ground state wavefunction is a spherically symmetric distribution in the nucleus in which the largest at the center and reduces exponentially at larger distance The function is known as the s atomic orbital Hydrogen has more than one ground state exists in which is said to be degenerate The ground state wavefunction is ψsrπaera Since the probability density is ψsr therefore ρsrψsrπaera Next we need to consider that ρs is in spherical coordinates dVrsinφdr dθ dφ and then multiplied by r Since ψs is spherically symmetric we have to integrate over θ and φ to get the radial probability density Psrarera Energy level of the ground state of hydrogen In order to find out the energy of the particle we used the equation EhnmL where h is the Planck constant n is the energy state m is the mass of the particle and L is the widthThe ground state of hydrogen corresponds to energy level nthe principle quantum number thus langular momentum quantum number mlmagnetic quantum number An electron in the ground state for hydrogen has energy eV in which is also called the Rydberg constant The quantum numbers Principle quantum number n Angular momentum quantum number ln magnetic quantum number mlll References Housecroft Catherine E and Alan G Sharpe Inorganic Chemistry rd ed Harlow Pearson Education Print Kuhn Hans HorstDieter Försterling and David H Waldeck Principles of Physical Chemistry nded Hoboken NJ John Wiley Print Sobolewski Andrzej L and Wolfgang Domcke Photophysics of Malonaldehyde An ab Initio Study The Journal of Physical Chemistry A Print Outside Links httpenwikipediaorgwikiGround_state httpgalileophysvirginiaeduclassesmfifallHydrogenAtomhtm httpwwwphysicsforumscomshowthreadphpt Problems What is the diameter of the ground state of a hydrogen atom Answer nm What is the energy for a hydrogen atom in the ground state Answer eV In the ground state can a hydrogen atom absorb light Answer Yes Contributors Name here if anonymous you can avoid this with university affiliation
