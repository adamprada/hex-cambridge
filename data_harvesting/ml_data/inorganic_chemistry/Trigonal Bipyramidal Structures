IntroductionMolecular Geometry of the Trigonal Bipyramidal StructuresStereoisomersReferencesProblemsContributors Trigonal Bipyramidal electron configuration is part of the VSEPR model of an atom with electron pairs Introduction Trigonal Bipyramidal structures are electronic configurations of molecules VSEPR gives us a handful of parent shapes The one with sets of bonded or nonbonded electrons Molecular Geometry of the Trigonal Bipyramidal Structures Number of Lone pairs Geometry Bond Angles Trigonal Bipyramidal and Seesaw and TShaped Linear The order of most repulsion to least repulsion among bonding and lone pair electrons are Lone pairLone pair Lone pairBond pair Bond pairBond pair To decide where to place lone pairs on the parent Trigonal Bipyramidal structure we must place lone pairs far away from each other and bond pairs The seesaw shape maximizes the bond angles of the single lone pair and the other atoms in the molecule The lone pair is in an equatorial position offering and degree bond angles compared to only degree bond angles if placed at the axial position The T shaped structure minimizes the remaining bond pairbond pair angles at degrees and maximizes the lone pairlone pair bond angle at The linear structure does the same by making sure that the lone pairs are kept at a maximum of degree bond angles As a result all are placed in the equatorial position leaving room at the axial postion for the atoms Thus the bond angles of the atoms are degrees from each other Stereoisomers Since there are two types of atoms on a Trigonal Bipyramidal structure axial and equatorial there are different Stereoisomers that could arise depending on the substituents attached For example if there is X atoms and Y atom attached to the central atom Y could either be in an equatorial position or in an axial position If there are X atoms and Y atoms then one Y atom could be placed in a equatorial position and the other in an axial position or both Y atoms could be placed in the same position References Housecroft CE Sharpe AG Inorganic chemistry Essex England Pearson Education Petrucci RH Harwood WS Herring FG Madura JD General chemistry principles and modern application Upper Saddle River New Jersey Pearson Education Problems How would you arrange SeCl How would you arrange ArCl How would you arrange ICl Contributors Ian Marton UC Davis
