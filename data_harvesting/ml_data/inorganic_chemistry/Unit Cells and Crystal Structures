No headers Crystals can be thought of as repeating patterns much like wallpaper or bathroom tiles but in three dimensions The fundamental repeating unit of the crystal is called the unit cell It is a three dimensional shape that can be repeated over and over by unit translations to fill space and leave minimal gaps in the structure Some possible unit cells are shown in the tiling pattern at the right along with arrows that indicate unit translation vectors In three dimensions the hexagonal or rhombic unit cells of this pattern would be replaced by three dimensional boxes that would stack together to fill all space As shown in the figure the origin of the unit cell is arbitrary The same set of boxes will fill all space no matter where we define the origin of the lattice We will see that pure metals typically have very simple crystal structures with cubic or hexagonal unit cells However the crystal structures of alloys can be quite complicated When considering the crystal structures of metals and alloys it is not sufficient to think of each atom and its neighboring ligands as an isolated system Instead think of the entire metallic crystal as a network of atoms connected by a sea of shared valence electrons The electrons are delocalized because there are not enough of them to fill each bond between atoms with an electron pair For example in the crystal structures of sblock and pblock metals each atom has either or nearest neighbors but the maximum number of s p electrons is Thus there are not enough to put two electrons between each pair of atoms Transition metals can also use their dorbitals in bonding but again there are never enough electrons to completely fill all the bonds Possible unit cells in a periodic tile pattern The arrows connect translationally equivalent points lattice points in the pattern The atoms in a metal lattice arrange themselves in a certain pattern which can be represented as a D box structure known as the unit cell which repeats across the entire metal Simple Cubic Body Centered Cubic Face Centered Cubic Hexagonal Close Packed atomcell atomscell atomscell atomscell Metal atoms can be approximated as spheres and therefore are not efficient in packing the same way a stack of cannonballs has some empty spaces between the balls Different unit cells have different packing efficiencies The number of atoms that is included in the unit cell only includes the fractions of atoms inside of the box Atoms on the corners of the unit cell count as ⅛ of an atom atoms on a face count as ½ an atom in the center counts as a full atom Using this lets calculate the number of atoms in a simple cubic unit cell a face centered cubic fcc unit cell and a body centered cubic bcc unit cell Simple Cubic corner atoms ⅛ atomcell The packing in this structure is not efficient and so this structure type is very rare for metals Body Centered Cubic bcc corner atoms ⅛ center atom atomscell The packing is more efficient and the structure is a common one for alkali metals and early transition metals Alloys such as brass CuZn also adopt these structures Face Centered Cubic fcc also called Cubic Close Packed ccp corner atoms ⅛ face atoms ½ atomscell This structure along with its hexagonal relative hcp has the most efficient packing Many metals adopt either the fcc or hcp structure Hexagonal Close Packed hcp Like the fcc structure the packing density of hcp is The unit cell of a bcc metal contains two atoms Calculating the packing fraction The packing fractions of the crystal structures shown above can be calculated by dividing the volume of the atoms in the cell by the volume of the cell itself The volume of the atoms in the cell is equal to the number of atomscell times the volume of a sphere πr The volume of the cubic cells is found by cubing the side length As an example lets calculate the packing efficiency of a simple cubic unit cell As we saw earlier in the section a simple cubic unit cell contains one atom The side length of the simple cubic unit cell is r since the centers of each atom occupy the corners of the unit cell The same method can be applied to bcc and fcc structures Facecentered cubic stack of cannonballs
