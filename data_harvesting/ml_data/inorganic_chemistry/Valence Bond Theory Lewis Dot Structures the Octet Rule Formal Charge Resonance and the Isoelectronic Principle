and Molecules Atomism because it was dismissed by Aristotle enjoyed a long sleep in scientific discourse until it was reconsidered by Galileo Decartes and Gassendi in the s Dalton postulated the modern atomic theory in based on his observation that elements such as hydrogen and oxygen combined in specific ratios the Law of Definite Proportions but the atomic theory remained contentious throughout most of the th century Thompson Rutherford Bohr and others around the turn of the th century established that matter was indeed composed of atoms that contained heavy nuclei and light electrons and that atoms could exist in excited states that could be interpreted as excitations of their electrons to different energy levels However the atomic theory did not provide a ready explanation for the bonded states of atoms in molecules In still more than a decade before modern quantum theory would adequately describe the shapes of atomic orbitals Lewis proposed the octet theory based on the empirically observed rules of valence ie the combining ratios of atoms in molecules This theory in hindsight can be rationalized for s and pblock elements by observing that maingroup atoms can use their four valence orbitals s px py and pz to accommodate up to eight electrons some or all of which may be shared with other atoms In Lewis model the valence electrons of an atom were situated at the corners of a cube and the cubes could share edges or faces to complete their octets Lewis developed a shorthand notation for these structures based on dots that represented the valence electrons as illustrated in Fig A pair of electrons shared between atoms constitutes a chemical bond and can also be represented as a line joining the atoms Four electrons shared between atoms represented by two lines is a double bond and so forth Any pairs of electrons not involved in bonding form lone pairs that belong to one atom only and are thus not involved in bonding The Lewis picture is powerful in its simplicity It can be readily used to rationalize or predict the combining ratios of atoms to sort plausible and unlikely structures for molecules including large ones and to rationalize the acidbase properties of many molecules It is important to remember that the model is built on a shaky prequantum mechanical description of atoms and so with it we will make mistakes Nevertheless it is useful to see how far we can go with the Lewis model Figure Examples of Lewis dot diagrams showing chemical bonds between carbon hydrogen and oxygen and nonbonding electron pairs Constructing the octet valence bond picture for a molecule We can construct an octet picture for any molecule using the NV method Number of electrons needed to make separate octets around all atoms N N for nonH atoms N for H Number of valence electrons V add up using group numbers dont forget to add or subtract for charges on ions Number of shared electrons S NV and therefore the number of bonds S Fill in lone pairs everywhere else to complete octets Example nitrate anion NO N atoms x electrons V N O O O charge S shared electrons bonds The number of lone pairs is obtained by difference VS Now draw the molecule starting with the four bonds and adding eight lone pairs to complete the octets Count the shared and unshared electrons around each atom in the nitrate ion and you will see that all atoms are octet and that the total number of valence electrons V is If you do the NV calculation according to the rules above you should always get an octet structure The charges on atoms in a molecule or an extended solid such as SiO can be estimated from Xray photoelectron spectra XPS Energetic Xrays ionize atoms by kicking out electrons from their core orbitals By conservation of energy the kinetic energy KE of an emitted electron is related to its binding energy BE and the energy of the incoming Xray photon hν by BE hν KE Electrons are harder to remove from positively charged atoms higher BE and easier to remove from negatively charged atoms lower BE relative to the neutral element The formal charge distribution is assigned by dividing the shared bonding electrons equally between atoms Thus the singly bonded O atoms each possess electrons and because O is in group their formal charge is The doubly bonded O has a formal charge of zero The N atom has a formal charge of because it owns valence electrons and is in group Note that the formal charge is not the same thing as the oxidation number or oxidation state In the nitrate ion the oxidation state of nitrogen is and the oxidation state of oxygen is The formal charge is typically closer to the real charge on the atom as measured eg by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy Oxidation states are a useful bookkeeping device for keeping track of oxidationreduction reactions as we will discuss in Chapter Like oxidation states the formal charges on the atoms in a molecule or ion must add up to its overall charge We can similarly draw the Lewis structure for ammonia as shown below When we divide the shared electrons equally between the atoms we see that the N atom has five electrons and each H atom has one These are the same as their group numbers and thus all the formal charges in the ammonia molecule are zero Octet structures of the Lewis acidbase adduct NHBF the hydronium ion HO and the sulfate anion SO are shown below In this case and in many Lewis structures we will draw we leave off the implied lone pairs around the peripheral atoms Try calculating the number of bonds in each of these molecules using the NV method and fill in the lone pairs that are not explicitly drawn in In cases where more than one valence bond structure is possible we can use formal charges to decide which structures should be more or less stable The rules are The formal charges on atoms are minimized in stable structures zero being the best case Negative formal charges should be placed on the most electronegative atoms Positive formal charges should be placed on the least electronegative atoms It is unfavorable to place like charges or on neighboring atoms in a molecule Examples of these rules are shown below for alternative structures of BF and ONF In the BF case the structure on the left is nonoctet because there are only six electrons three bonds in the valence shell of B Such structures are said to be electron deficient An octet structure right can be drawn but it places a positive formal charge on F the most electronegative atom in the molecule Thus neither structure is completely happy but the formal charge rules tell us that the electrondeficient structure on the left is more stable The electron deficiency of BFmakes it a powerful Lewis acid In the case of ONF the structure on the left is unfavorable for two reasons First it places a positive formal charge on F the most electronegative atom Second there is another possible structure right that has zero formal charge which is preferable to one with nonzero charge This means that the structure on the right with a double bond between N and O is more reasonable Life outside of the ocean owes its existence to the presence of ozone O in the stratosphere Ozone absorbs the ultraviolet light in the solar spectrum which otherwise would cause catastrophic damage to DNA and other biological molecules Because ozone is produced photochemically from O which is itself generated by photosynthesis the spectroscopic signature of ozone in the atmosphere of distant planets is one possible way to look for extraterrestrial life Resonance structures The ozone O molecule has two equivalent octet structures shown below In both cases the Lewis dot diagram suggests that there are three kinds of oxygen atoms in the molecule with and formal charges These structures also suggest that ozone should have one single and one double bond Experimentally by electron diffraction however we find that the molecule is symmetric with both OO bond lengths the same The real instantaneous structure is the average of the two forms as shown below In the classical Lewis picture of the molecule we can rationalize resonance by observing that electrons being thousands of times lighter than the nuclei of atoms move very fast on the timescale of molecular vibrations Thus in the time it takes for the oxygen atoms to adjust their positions the electrons can move back and forth many times In the quantum mechanical MO picture Chapter we will see that resonance involves electrons that are fully delocalized over the atoms in the molecule We represent resonance structures with a doubleheaded arrow to signify that the only difference between the Lewis structures is the distribution of electrons Susan Solomon discovered the heterogeneous catalytic mechanism whereby ozone is decomposed by chlorofluorocarbons freons creating the Antarctic ozone hole Her work formed the basis of the UN Montreal Protocol an international agreement to protect the ozone layer by regulating damaging chemicals In the instantaneous structure of ozone the formal charge is shared between the two terminal oxygen atoms and therefore each one has a formal charge of The OO bonds are the average of a single and a double bond ie each OO bond order is Similarly the nitrate anion has three resonance structures and experimentally by Xray crystallography of nitrate salts we find that all the NO bonds in the ion are the same In this case in the averaged structure each O atom has a formal charge of and the NO bond order is Inequivalent resonance structures The rules of resonance also apply to inequivalent structures which in general will have different energies from each other In this case the structure of the molecule represents a weighted average of the low energy structures A good example is the cyanate ion OCN We can write three inequivalent octet structures for the molecule The first two are reasonable resonance structures although we suspect the one on the left is the best because it puts the negative formal charge on the most electronegative atom The last one is clearly a bad resonance structure because the formal charges are high and there is a positive charge on the oxygen atom The real structure is thus a weighted average of the first two Nobond resonance An interesting and useful kind of inequivalent resonance structure is one in which there is a bond order of zero between two of the atoms This concept of nobond resonance is important in understanding the bonding in many halogen and hydrogencontaining compounds The idea is illustrated below for the generic molecule XYZ where Z might be an electronegative halogen atom such as F By moving the bonding electrons from the YZ bond onto the Z atom and moving a lone pair from X into the XY bond we generate the resonance structure shown on the right in which all atoms remain octet but there is no bond between Y and Z It is important to recognize in this example that the nobond form is only one resonance structure and therefore the Z atom is still bound to Y If the two resonance structures in this example have the same energy we would expect the XY bond order to be and the YZ bond order to be Therefore the YZ bond should be longer than it is in a compound where the bond order is one and it should be relatively easy to break the YZ bond Some molecular examples of nobond resonance are shown below In the molecule ONF the NF bond is unusually long relative to the NF bond in NF in which the bond order is This can be explained by the nobond resonance forms shown on the right Similarly in the Lewis acidbase adduct formed by combining BH with CO we can explain the long BH bonds using nobond resonance forms that place a partial positive charge on the H atoms Nobond resonance is often used to provide an octet bonding picture for socalled hypervalent compounds which are compounds that appear to have more than valence electrons in the bonding shell of the central atom For example we can consider two different valence bond structures for the triiodide ion I which is formed by reaction of I with I in water In this structure the central iodine atom has electrons in its valence shell in violation of the octet rule Raman spectra of the triiodide ion show that the II bond is weaker than the II single bond in I suggesting that this picture is not an accurate description of the bonding A better representation of I can be obtained with nobond resonance structures as shown below We will see that this picture is consistent with the MO description of I in Chapter The deep blue color of starchiodine solutions results from the complexation of linear polyiodide ions In by the starch amylose lefthanded helix The interior of the helix is hydrophobic In electron donor solvents such as ethanol and water I and salts of I have a brown color the result of a charge transfer interaction between the solvent and solute We can draw a similar picture for the XeF molecule which has the same number of valence electrons as I This picture is consistent with XPS data which show a partial negative charge on the F atoms as well as vibrational spectra which show that the XeF bond is weaker in XeF than it is in the singlybonded cation XeF Other well known examples of hypervalent compounds are PF PCH and SF as well as oxyacids such as HSO and HClO The hypervalent structure is often drawn for these molecules with the explanation that dorbitals on the central atom contribute to the bonding in dsp and dsp hybrids for and coordinate molecules respectively However realistic molecular orbital calculations show that the phosphorus and sulfur d orbitals are too high in energy to contribute significantly to bonding in PF and SF For these molecules we can use nobond resonance to make reasonable octet structures that predict polar bonds between the central atom and F Spacefilling model of sulfur hexafluoride SF is surprisingly unreactive with water relative to other compounds that contain SF bonds The tight packing of F atoms around S prevents nucleophilic attack by water In other cases such as PCH the octet structure is unreasonable because it suggests a polar bond between P and C with a partial negative charge on C Further in the case of oxyacids such as HSO and HClO Xray crystallographic data establish that the SO and ClO bonds are shorter for the oxygen atoms not bonded to hydrogen which is more consistent with the hypervalent picture The question of whether hypervalency and the octet rule are really useful descriptions of the bonding in these compounds has been considered in a number of computational studies which have used increasingly accurate quantum mechanical calculations to determine the number of electrons associated with the central atom In a study Gillespie and Silvi found that the population of the valence shell is greater than eight for compounds with electropositive ligands such as PCH and less than eight for compounds such as PF They concluded that these valence electron shell populations depend primarily on the coordination numbers and electronegativities of the central atoms and their ligands and that there is no fundamental difference between the bonding in hypervalent and nonhypervalent Lewis octet molecules This reminds us that the octet rule is not a law of nature but rather an empirical rule that is useful within certain limits The isoelectronic principle In calculating the octet structures of molecules using the NV method we needed to know only the number of atoms and the number of electrons not the identities of the atoms themselves This means that we will get the same answer and the same set of octet and resonance structures for any molecule or ion that contains a the same number of nonhydrogen atoms and b the same total number of valence electrons Such molecules are said to be isoelectronic This is a powerful conclusion because once we have determined the electronic structure of one molecule we can write down the same solution for all other molecules that are isoelectronic For example we noted above that I and XeF which both have valence electrons have the same valence bond structure We can further expect that isoelectronic molecules will have the same shapes and very often similar physical properties The four molecules and ions below all contain three nonhydrogen atoms and valence electrons All of them are linear molecules with two double bonds The four molecules and ions shown below them all contain four nonhydrogen atoms and valence electrons These four have a trigonal planar shape While BF is a member of this isoelectronic series we do not write it in the resonance form that contains a BF double bond because that would put a positive formal charge on F Similarly we can show that CH NH NH HO HO HF F and OH are all isoelectronic with one nonH atom and eight valence electrons In the next section we will see that this gives rise to nearly identical electronic shapes for these molecules Nitrous oxide NO or laughing gas is isoelectronic with CO The two molecules have the same shape linear and similar physical properties CO sublimes at C whereas NO melts at C and boils at C Isoelectronic solids The isoelectronic principle works not just for molecules but for extended solids as well One technologically important set of isoelectronic solids are the pblock semiconductors The group element Si is the most widely used semiconductor for electronics but as we will discuss later it is not a good light emitter Lightemitting diodes LEDs which are used in lasers high efficiency lighting and display technologies are made from compounds that are isoelectronic with Si and Ge especially GaAs GaP AlAs and GaN all contain four valence electrons per atom CdTe and CuInxGaxSe CIGS are promising solar cell materials that also have the same number of valence electrons per atom Like Si and Ge these compounds have tetrahedrally bonded structures in the solid state and absorb light across most of the solar spectrum as we will discuss in more detail in Chapters and Figure The tetrahedral bonding in crystals of GaAs CdTe CuInxGaxSe and other semiconductors is similar to that in isoelectronic Si and Ge The isoelectronic principle is also a powerful tool in materials research because it provides guidance about where to look for new materials with similar and perhaps improved properties For example the discovery that efficient thin layer solar cells could be made with the compound CsSnI stimulated the exploration of many isoelectronic ABX compounds with the same perovskite crystal structure Very recently thin film solar cells based on light absorbers in this structural family MAPbIxClx and FAxMAxPbBryIy MA methylammonium CHNH FA formamidinium HCNH have been reported with efficiencies as high as
