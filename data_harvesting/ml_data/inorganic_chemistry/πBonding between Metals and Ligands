No headers An important factor that contributes to the high ligand field strength of ligands such as CO CN and phosphines is πbonding between the metal and the ligand There are three types of pibonding in metal complexes The most common situation is when a ligand such as carbon monoxide or cyanide donates its sigma nonbonding electrons to the metal while accepting electron density from the metal through overlap of a metal tg orbital and a ligand π orbital This situation is called backbonding because the ligand donates σelectron density to the metal and the metal donates πelectron density to the ligand The ligand is thus acting as a σdonor and a πacceptor In πbackbonding the metal donates π electrons to the ligand π orbital adding electron density to an antibonding molecular orbital This results in weakening of the CO bond which is experimentally observed as lengthening of the bond relative to free CO in the gas phase and lowering of the CO infrared stretching frequency dd π bonding occurs when an element such phosphorus which has a σsymmetry lone pair and an empty metal d orbital binds to a metal that has electrons in a tg orbital This is a common situation for phosphine complexes eg triphenylphosphine bound to lowvalent late transition metals The backbonding in this case is analogous to the CO example except that the acceptor orbital is a phosphorus d orbital rather than a ligand π orbital Here the phosphine ligand acts as a σdonor and a πacceptor forming a dπdπ bond The third kind of metalligand πbonding occurs when a πdonor ligand an element with both a σsymmetry electron pair and a filled orthogonal porbital bonds to a metal as shown above at the right for an O ligand This occurs in early transition metal complexes In this example O is acting as both a σdonor and a πdonor This interaction is typically drawn as a metalligand multiple bond eg the VO bond in the vanadyl cation VO Typical πdonor ligands are oxide O nitride N imide RN alkoxide RO amide RN and fluoride F For late transition metals strong πdonors form antibonding interactions with the filled dlevels with consequences for spin state redox potentials and ligand exchange rates πdonor ligands are low in the spectrochemical series Carboncontaining ligands that are πdonors and their complexes with transition metal ions are very important in olefin metathesis a reaction in which carboncarbon double bonds are interchanged Using these catalysts cyclic olefins can be transformed into linear polymers in high yield through ringopening metathesis polymerization ROMP Catalysts of this kind were developed by the groups of Richard Schrock and Robert Grubbs who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Yves Chauvin for their discoveries The Schrock catalysts are based on early transition metals such as Mo they are more reactive but less tolerant of different organic functional groups and protic solvents than the Grubbs catalysts which are based on Ru complexes A chiral Schrock catalyst polymerizes a norbornadiene derivative to a highly stereoregular isotactic polymer Synthesis of a Grubbs olefin metathesis catalyst
