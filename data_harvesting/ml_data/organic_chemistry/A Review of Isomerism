Conformational IsomersStructural IsomersStereoisomersExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to explain the differences among constitutional structural isomers and stereoisomers geometric isomers Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below constitutional structural isomers stereoisomers Different types of isomers Vladsinger Conformational Isomers The CC single bonds in ethane propane and other alkanes are formed by the overlap of an sp hybrid orbital on one carbon atom with an sp hybrid orbital on another carbon atom forming a σ bond Each sp hybrid orbital is cylindrically symmetrical all crosssections are circles resulting in a carboncarbon single bond that is also cylindrically symmetrical about the CC axis Because rotation about the carboncarbon single bond can occur without changing the overlap of the sp hybrid orbitals there is no significant electronic energy barrier to rotation Consequently many different arrangements of the atoms are possible each corresponding to different degrees of rotation Differences in threedimensional structure resulting from rotation about a σ bond are called differences in conformation and each different arrangement is called a conformational isomer or conformer Structural Isomers Unlike conformational isomers which do not differ in connectivity structural isomers differ in connectivity as illustrated here for propanol and propanol Although these two alcohols have the same molecular formula CHO the position of the OH group differs which leads to differences in their physical and chemical properties In the conversion of one structural isomer to another at least one bond must be broken and reformed at a different position in the molecule Consider for example the following five structures represented by the formula CH Of these structures a and d represent the same compound as do b and c No bonds have been broken and reformed the molecules are simply rotated about a vertical axis Only threenpentane a and d methylbutane b and c and dimethylpropane eare structural isomers Because no bonds are broken in going from a to d or from b to c these alternative representations are not structural isomers The three structural isomerseither a or d either b or c and ehave distinct physical and chemical properties Stereoisomers Molecules with the same connectivity but different arrangements of the atoms in space are called stereoisomers There are two types of stereoisomers geometric and optical Geometric isomers differ in the relative positions of substituents in a rigid molecule Simple rotation about a CC σ bond in an alkene for example cannot occur because of the presence of the π bond The substituents are therefore rigidly locked into a particular spatial arrangement Thus a carboncarbon multiple bond or in some cases a ring prevents one geometric isomer from being readily converted to the other The members of an isomeric pair are identified as either cis or trans and interconversion between the two forms requires breaking and reforming one or more bonds Because their structural difference causes them to have different physical and chemical properties cis and trans isomers are actually two distinct chemical compounds Stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different arrangements of atoms in space Optical isomers are molecules whose structures are mirror images but cannot be superimposed on one another in any orientation Optical isomers have identical physical properties although their chemical properties may differ in asymmetric environments Molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are said to be chiral pronounced kyral from the Greek cheir meaning hand Examples of some familiar chiral objects are your hands feet and ears As shown in part a in Figure your left and right hands are nonsuperimposable mirror images Try putting your right shoe on your left footit just doesnt work An achiral object is one that can be superimposed on its mirror image as shown by the superimposed flasks in part b in Figure Figure Chiral and Achiral Objects a Objects that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are chiral such as the left and the right hand b The unmarked flask is achiral because it can be superimposed on its mirror image Most chiral organic molecules have at least one carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups as occurs in the bromochlorofluoromethane molecule shown in part a in Figure This carbon often designated by an asterisk in structural drawings is called a chiral center or asymmetric carbon atom If the bromine atom is replaced by another chlorine part b in Figure the molecule and its mirror image can now be superimposed by simple rotation Thus the carbon is no longer a chiral center Asymmetric carbon atoms are found in many naturally occurring molecules such as lactic acid which is present in milk and muscles and nicotine a component of tobacco A molecule and its nonsuperimposable mirror image are called enantiomers from the Greek enantiou meaning opposite Figure Comparison of Chiral and Achiral Molecules a Bromochlorofluoromethane is a chiral molecule whose stereocenter is designated with an asterisk Rotation of its mirror image does not generate the original structure To superimpose the mirror images bonds must be broken and reformed b In contrast dichlorofluoromethane and its mirror image can be rotated so they are superimposable Exercises Questions Q
