Dehydration of Alcohols to Yield Alkenes One way to synthesize alkenes is by dehydration of alcohols Alcohols undergo E or E mechanisms to lose water and form a double bond This mechanism is analogous to the alkyl halide mechanism The only difference is that hydroxide is a very poor leaving group so an extra step is required The hydroxyl group is protonated so that water is now the leaving group Therefore the dehydration reaction of alcohols to generate alkene proceeds by heating the alcohols in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid at high temperatures The required reaction temperature range decreases with increasing substitution of the hydroxycontaining carbon alcohols C alcohols C alcohols C If the reaction is not sufficiently heated the alcohols do not dehydrate to form alkenes but react with one another to form ethers eg the Williamson Ether Synthesis Mechanism for the Dehydration of Alcohols Different types of alcohols may dehydrate through a slightly different mechanism pathway However the general idea behind each dehydration reaction is that the OH group in the alcohol donates two electrons to H from the acid reagent to form an alkyloxonium ion This ion acts as a very good leaving group for either the E or E mechanism The deprotonated acid the conjugate base then reacts with one of the betahydrogens to form a double bond Primary Alcohols and the E Mechanism Primary alcohols undergo bimolecular elimination E mechanism while secondary and tertiary alcohols undergo unimolecular elimination E mechanism The relative reactivity of alcohols in dehydration reaction is ranked as the following Methanol primary secondary tertiary Primary alcohol dehydrates through the E mechanism Oxygen donates two electrons to a proton from sulfuric acid HSO forming an alkyloxonium ion The resulting conjugate base HSO approaches in an anticoplanar orientation relative to the leaving group and reacts with one adjacent hydrogen while the alkyloxonium ion simultaneously leaves in a concerted process making a double bond Secondary and Tertiary Alcohols and the E Mechanism Secondary and tertiary alcohols dehydrate through the E mechanism Similarly to the reaction above secondary and tertiary OH protonate to form alkyloxonium ions However the ion leaves first and forms a carbocation as the reaction intermediate The water molecule which is a stronger base than the HSO ion then abstracts a proton from an adjacent carbon forming a double bond For example in the mechanism below that the alkene formed depends on which proton is abstracted the red arrows show formation of the more substituted butene while the blue arrows show formation of the less substituted butene Recall the general rule that more substituted alkenes are more stable than less substituted alkenes and trans alkenes are more stable than cis alkenes Thereore the trans diastereomer of the butene product is most abundant The dehydration mechanism for a tertiary alcohol is analogous to that shown above for a secondary alcohol The E elimination of ºalcohols under relatively nonacidic conditions may be accomplished by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride POCl in pyridine This procedure is also effective with hindered ºalcohols but for unhindered and ºalcohols an SN chloride ion substitution of the chlorophosphate intermediate competes with elimination Examples of these and related reactions are given in the following figure The first equation shows the dehydration of a ºalcohol The predominance of the nonZaitsev product less substituted double bond is presumed due to steric hindrance of the methylene group hydrogen atoms which interferes with the approach of base at that site The second example shows two elimination procedures applied to the same ºalcohol The first uses the single step POCl method which works well in this case because SN substitution is retarded by steric hindrance The second method is another example in which an intermediate sulfonate ester confers halogenlike reactivity on an alcohol In every case the anionic leaving group is the conjugate base of a strong acid Carbocation Rearrangements and the E Mechanism Carbocation stability is always a driving force in E mechanisms It is important to evaluate the structure of all carbocation intermediates to look for the possibility of hydride or methyl shifts to form more stable carbocation intermediates Carbocation rearrangements are discussed more completely in chapter Exercise Draw the bondline structures for the products formed and
