Contributors and Attributions The socalled aromatic hydrocarbons or arenes are cyclic unsaturated compounds that have such strikingly different chemical properties from conjugated alkenes polyenes that it is convenient to consider them as a separate class of hydrocarbon The simplest member is benzene which frequently is represented as a cyclic conjugated molecule of three single and three double carboncarbon bonds Actually all the carboncarbon bonds are equivalent see Chapter but it is convenient to represent the structure in the manner shown A variety of substituted benzenes are known that have one or more of the hydrogen atoms of the ring replaced with other atoms or groups In almost all of these compounds the special properties associated with the benzene nucleus are retained A few examples of benzenoid hydrocarbons follow and it will be noticed that the hydrocarbon substituents include alkyl alkenyl and alkynyl groups Many have trivial names indicated in parentheses The hydrocarbon group from benzene itself is called a phenyl group and often is abbreviated as or less preferably by the symbol Generally aryl groups are abbreviated as in contrast to alkyl groups for which we use Thus is a methylsubstituted arene whereas is an alkylsubstituted benzene When there are two or more substituents on a benzene ring position isomerism arises Thus there are three possible isomeric disubstituted benzene derivatives according to whether the substituents have the or relationship The isomers commonly are designated as ortho meta and para or o m and p for the and isomers respectively The actual symmetry of the benzene ring is such that only one disubstitution product is found despite the fact that two would be predicted if benzene had the cyclohexatriene structure When the benzene ring carries different substituents we shall cite them in alphabetical order disregarding multiplying prefixes and assign their positions on the ring with the lowest possible numbers Examples are The IUPAC nomenclature system for other types of compounds is given in Chapter and is based on the fundamental rules described in this chapter Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
