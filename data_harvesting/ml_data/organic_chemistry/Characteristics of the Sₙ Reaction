SN reactions draw and interpret Reaction Energy Diagrams for SN reactions In order of decreasing importance the factors impacting SN reaction pathways are structure of the alkyl halide stability of the leaving group type of solvent The unimolecular transition state of the SN pathway means that structure of the alkyl halide and stability of the leaving group are the primary considerations Alkyl halides that can ionize to form stable carbocations are more reactive via the SN mechanism Because carbocation stability is the primary energetic consideration stabilization of the carbocation via solvation is also an important consideration Alkyl Halide Structure and Carbocation Stability The first order kinetics of SN reactions suggest a twostep mechanism in which the ratedetermining step consists of carbocation formation from the ionization of the alkyl halide as shown in the diagram below In this mechanism the carbocation is a highenergy intermediate the bonds immediately to nearby nucleophiles The only reactant that is undergoing change in the first ratedetermining step is the alkyl halide so we expect such reactions would be unimolecular and follow a firstorder rate equation Hence the name SN is applied to this mechanism The Hammond postulate suggests that the activation energy of the ratedetermining first step will be inversely proportional to the stability of the carbocation intermediate the more stable the carbocation the lower the activation energy the faster the reactivity Therefore carbocation stability is a primary consideration in SN reactions Carbocations can be stabilized by delocalizing the charge via resonance and through inductive electron donation of alkyl groups Carbocations can also stabilize by rearrangement via hydride or methyl shifts Carbocation rearrangements are explained in a subsequent section of this chapter Benzyl Carbocation The relative stability of carbocations is summarized below Carbocation Stability CH CHCH CHCH CHCHCH CHCH CHC Consequently we expect that ºalkyl halides will be more reactive than their º and ºcounterparts in reactions that follow an SN mechanism This is opposite to the reactivity order observed for the SN mechanism Allylic and benzylic halides are exceptionally reactive by either mechanism This trend is summarized in the diagram below Effects of Leaving Group An SN reaction speeds up with a good leaving group This is because the leaving group is involved in the ratedetermining step A good leaving group wants to leave so it breaks the CLeaving Group bond faster Once the bond breaks the carbocation is formed and the faster the carbocation is formed the faster the nucleophile can come in and the faster the reaction will be completed A good leaving group is a weak base because weak bases can hold the charge Theyre happy to leave with both electrons and in order for the leaving group to leave it needs to be able to accept electrons Strong bases on the other hand donate electrons which is why they cant be good leaving groups As you go from left to right on the periodic table electron donating ability decreases and thus ability to be a good leaving group increases Halides are an example of a good leaving group whos leavinggroup ability increases as you go down the column The two reactions below is the same reaction done with two different leaving groups One is significantly faster than the other This is because the better leaving group leaves faster and thus the reaction can proceed faster Figure below Methyl Sulfate Ion Mesylate Ion Triflate Ion Tosylate Ion CHSO CHSO CFSO CHCHSO Solvent Effects on the SN Reaction To facilitate the charge separation of the ionization reaction in the first step a good ionizing solvent is needed Two solvent characteristics will be particularly important the polarity and the solvating power The dielectric constant ε measures polarity of solvent molecules and their ability to orient themselves between ions to attenuate reduce the electrostatic force one ion exerts on the other The higher the dielectric constant the more polar the substance and in the case of SN reactions the faster the rate A dielectric constant below is usually considered nonpolar Solvents having high dielectric constants such as water ε formic acid ε dimethyl sulfoxide ε acetonitrile ε are generally considered better ionizing solvents than are some common organic solvents such as ethanol ε acetone ε methylene chloride ε ether ε Below is the same reaction conducted in two different solvents The relative reaction rate in water ε is times faster than in methanol ε Solvation refers to the solvents ability to stabilize ions by encasing them in a sheath of weakly bonded solvent molecules Anions are solvated by partial positive charges of hydrogenbonding solvents Cations are often best solvated by the nucleophilic sites on a solvent molecule eg oxygen nitrogen atoms The interaction of the carbocations with these nucleophilic solvents may be strong enough to form covalent bonds to carbon thus converting the intermediate to a substitution product and creating the reaction name solvolysis When solvolysis occurs with water the actions are called hydrolysis reactions as shown in the reaction below Polar Protic and Polar Aprotic Solvents Protic solvents contain polarized hydrogen Whereas aprotic solvents do NOT contain polarized hydrogen For SN reactions solvation of the nucleophile by polar protic solvents slows the reaction rate However in SN reaction the nucleophile is not a part of the ratedetermining step so this concern is not relevant In fact polar protic solvents actually speed up the rate of SN reactions because the polar solvent helps stabilize the transition state and carbocation intermediate Since the carbocation is unstable anything that can stabilize this even a little will speed up the reaction Polar aprotic solvents have a dipole moment but their hydrogen is not highly polarized Polar aprotic solvents are not used in SN reactions because some of them can react with the carbocation intermediate and give an unwanted sideproduct Rather polar protic solvents are preferred for unimolecular substitution reactions Effects of Nucleophile The strength of the nucleophile does not affect the reaction rate of SN because the nucleophile is not involved in the ratedetermining step Since nucleophiles only participate in the fast second step their relative molar concentrations rather than their nucleophilicities should be the primary productdetermining factor If a nucleophilic solvent such as water is used its high concentration will assure that alcohols are the major product However if you have more than one nucleophile competing to bond to the carbocation the strengths and concentrations of those nucleophiles affects the distribution of products For example if tbutylchloride reacts with a mixture of water and formic acid where the water and formic acid are competing nucleophiles two different products are formed CHCOH and CHCOCOH The relative yields of these products depends on the concentrations and relative reactivities of the nucleophiles With a higher electron density water is considered the stronger nucleophile and the tertiary alcohol will be the major product if there are equal concentrations of competing nucleophiles
