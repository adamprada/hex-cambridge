No headers Learning Objective Draw interpret and convert between Lewis Kekule Condensed and Bondline Structures Note The review of general chemistry in sections is integrated into the above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and Common bonding patterns in organic structures The Lewis structure below of one of the four nucleoside building blocks that make up DNA can appear complex and confusing at first glance Fortunately common bonding patterns occur that can allow for simplifications when drawing structures The rules for the simplifies structures rely on the neutral bonding patterns for carbon orygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur primarily Since organic compounds have a hydrocarbon backbone the atoms that are NOT carbon and hydrogen are called heteroatoms deoxycytidine contains seven heteroatoms four oxygen atoms land three nitrogen atoms Heteroatoms are a primary source of chemical reactivity for organic chemistry Heteroatoms atoms in an organic compound that are NOT carbon or hydrogen typically oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur The ability to quickly and efficiently draw large structures and determine formal charges is not terribly hard to come by all it takes is a few shortcuts and some practice at recognizing common bonding patterns Lets start with carbon the most important element for organic chemists Carbon is said to be tetravalent meaning that it tends to form four bonds If you look at the simple structures of methane methanol ethane ethene and ethyne in the figures from the previous section you should quickly recognize that in each molecule the carbon atom has four bonds and a formal charge of zero This is a pattern that holds throughout most of the organic molecules we will see but there are also exceptions style typetextcssstyle In carbon dioxide the carbon atom has double bonds to oxygen on both sides OCO Later on in this chapter and throughout this book we will see examples of organic ions called carbocations and carbanions in which a carbon atom bears a positive or negative formal charge respectively If a carbon has only three bonds and an unfilled valence shell in other words if it does not fulfill the octet rule it will have a positive formal charge If on the other hand it has three bonds plus a lone pair of electrons it will have a formal charge of Another possibility is a carbon with three bonds and a single unpaired free radical electron in this case the carbon has a formal charge of zero One last possibility is a highly reactive species called a carbene in which a carbon has two bonds and one lone pair of electrons giving it a formal charge of zero You may encounter carbenes in more advanced chemistry courses but they will not be discussed any further in this book You should certainly use the methods you have learned to check that these formal charges are correct for the examples given above More importantly you will need before you progress much further in your study of organic chemistry to simply recognize these patterns and the patterns described below for other atoms and be able to identify carbons that bear positive and negative formal charges by a quick inspection The pattern for hydrogens is easy hydrogen atoms have only one bond and no formal charge The exceptions to this rule are the proton H and the hydride ion H which is a proton plus two electrons Because we are concentrating in this book on organic chemistry as applied to living things however we will not be seeing naked protons and hydrides as such because they are too reactive to be present in that form in aqueous solution Nonetheless the idea of a proton will be very important when we discuss acidbase chemistry and the idea of a hydride ion will become very important much later in the book when we discuss organic oxidation and reduction reactions As a rule though all hydrogen atoms in organic molecules have one bond and no formal charge Let us next turn to oxygen atoms Typically you will see an oxygen bonding in three ways all of which fulfill the octet rule If it has two bonds and two lone pairs as in water it will have a formal charge of zero If it has one bond and three lone pairs as in hydroxide ion it will have a formal charge of If it has three bonds and one lone pair as in hydronium ion it will have a formal charge of When we get to our discussion of free radical chemistry in chapter we will see other possibilities such as where an oxygen atom has one bond one lone pair and one unpaired free radical electron giving it a formal charge of zero For now however concentrate on the three main nonradical examples as these will account for virtually everything we see until chapter Nitrogen has two major bonding patterns both of which fulfill the octet rule If a nitrogen has three bonds and a lone pair it has a formal charge of zero If it has four bonds and no lone pair it has a formal charge of In a fairly uncommon bonding pattern negatively charged nitrogen has two bonds and two lone pairs Two third row elements are commonly found in biological organic molecules sulfur and phosphorus Although both of these elements have other bonding patterns that are relevant in laboratory chemistry in a biological context sulfur almost always follows the same bondingformal charge pattern as oxygen while phosphorus is present in the form of phosphate ion PO where it has five bonds almost always to oxygen no lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Remember that atoms of elements in the third row and below in the periodic table have expanded valence shells with d orbitals available for bonding and the the octet rule does not apply Finally the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are very important in laboratory and medicinal organic chemistry but less common in naturally occurring organic molecules Halogens in organic compounds usually are seen with one bond three lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Sometimes especially in the case of bromine we will encounter reactive species in which the halogen has two bonds usually in a threemembered ring two lone pairs and a formal charge of These rules if learned and internalized so that you dont even need to think about them will allow you to draw large organic structures complete with formal charges quite quickly Once you have gotten the hang of drawing Lewis structures it is not always necessary to draw lone pairs on heteroatoms as you can assume that the proper number of electrons are present around each atom to match the indicated formal charge or lack thereof Occasionally though lone pairs are drawn if doing so helps to make an explanation more clear Exercise Draw one structure that corresponds to each of the following molecular formulas using the common bonding patters covered above Be sure to include all lone pairs and formal charges where applicable and assume that all atoms have a full valence shell of electrons More than one correct answer
