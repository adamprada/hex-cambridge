CyclopropaneCyclobutaneCyclopentaneCC Cycloalkanes in NatureExercisesSolutionsQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe and sketch the conformation of cyclopropane cyclobutane and cyclopentane describe the bonding in cyclopropane and use this to account for the high reactivity of this compound analyze the stability of cyclobutane cyclopentane and their substituted derivatives in terms of angular strain torsional strain and steric interactions Study Notes Notice that in both cyclobutane and cyclopentane torsional strain is reduced at the cost of increasing angular angle strain Although the customary line drawings of simple cycloalkanes are geometrical polygons the actual shape of these compounds in most cases is very different Cyclopropane is necessarily planar flat with the carbon atoms at the corners of an equilateral triangle The º bond angles are much smaller than the optimum º angles of a normal tetrahedral carbon atom and the resulting angle strain dramatically influences the chemical behavior of this cycloalkane Cyclopropane also suffers substantial eclipsing strain since all the carboncarbon bonds are fully eclipsed Cyclobutane reduces some bondeclipsing strain by folding the outofplane dihedral angle is about º but the total eclipsing and angle strain remains high Cyclopentane has very little angle strain the angles of a pentagon are º but its eclipsing strain would be large about kJmol if it remained planar Consequently the fivemembered ring adopts nonplanar puckered conformations whenever possible Rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar However this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring Cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations Cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring Cyclic systems are a little different from openchain systems In an open chain any bond can be rotated º going through many different conformations That complete rotation isnt possible in a cyclic system because the parts that would be trying to twist away from each other would still be connected together Thus cyclic systems have fewer degrees of freedom than aliphatic systems they have restricted rotation Because of the restricted rotation of cyclic systems most of them have much more welldefined shapes than their aliphatic counterparts Lets take a look at the basic shapes of some common rings Many biologically important compounds are built around structures containing rings so its important that we become familiar with them In nature three to sixmembered rings are frequently encountered so well focus on those Cyclopropane A three membered ring has no rotational freedom whatsoever A plane is defined by three points so the three carbon atoms in cyclopropane are all constrained to lie in the same plane This lack of flexibility does not allow cyclopropane to form more stable conformers which are nonplanar The main source of ring strain in cyclopropane is angle strain All of the carbon atoms in cyclopropane are tetrahedral and would prefer to have a bond angle of o The angles in an equilateral triangle are actually o about half as large as the optimum angle The large deviation from the optimal bond angle means that the CC sigma bonds forming the cyclopropane ring are bent Maximum bonding occurs when the overlapping orbitals are pointing directly toward each other The severely strained bond angles in cyclopropane means that the orbitals forming the CC bonds overlap at a slight angle making them weaker This strain is partially overcome by using socalled banana bonds where the overlap between orbitals is no longer directly in a line between the two nuclei as shown here in three representations of the bonding in cyclopropane The constrained nature of cyclopropane causes neighboring CH bonds to all be held in eclipsed conformations Cyclopropane is always at maximum torsional strain This strain can be illustrated in a Newman projections of cyclopropane as shown from the side Newman Projection of cyclopropane Cyclopropane isnt large enough to introduce any steric strain Steric strain does not become a factor until we reach six membered rings Before that point rings are not flexible enough to allow for two ring substituents to interact with each other Interactive Element The D Structure of Cyclopropane The combination of torsional and angle strain creates a large amount of ring strain in cyclopropane which weakens the CC ring bonds kJmol when compared to CC bonds in openchain propane kJmol Cyclobutane Cyclobutane is a four membered ring The larger number of ring hydrogens would cause a substantial amount of torsional strain if cyclobutane were planar In three dimensions cyclobutane is flexible enough to buckle into a puckered shape which causes the CH ring hydrogens to slightly deviate away from being completely eclipsed This conformation relives some of the torsional strain but increases the angle strain because the ring bond angles decreases to o In a line drawing this butterfly shape is usually shown from the side with the near edges drawn using darker lines The deviation of cyclobutanes ring CH bonds away from being fully eclipsed can clearly be seen when viewing a Newman projections signed down one of the CC bond Newman projection of cyclobutane With bond angles of o rather than o degrees cyclobutane has significant amounts of angle strain but less than in cyclopropane Although torsional strain is still present the neighboring CH bonds are not exactly eclipsed in the cyclobutanes puckered conformation Steric strain is very low Cyclobutane is still not large enough that substituents can reach around to cause crowding Overall the ring strain in cyclobutane kJmol is slightly less than cyclopropane kJmol Interactive Element The D Structure of Cyclobutane Cyclopentane Cyclopentanes are even more stable than cyclobutanes and they are the secondmost common cycloalkane ring in nature after cyclohexanes Planar cyclopentane has virtually no angle strain but an immense amount of torsional strain To reduce torsional strain cyclopentane addops a nonplanar conformation even though it slightly increases angle strain The lowest energy conformation of cyclopentane is known as the envelope with four of the ring atoms in the same plane and one out of plane notice that this shape resembles an envelope with the flap open The outofplane carbon is said to be in the endo position endo means inside The envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope However the neighboring carbons are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap D structure of cyclopentane notice that the far top right carbon is the endo position At room temperature cyclopentane undergoes a rapid bond rotation process in which each of the five carbons takes turns being in the endo position Cyclopentane distorts only very slightly into an envelope shape in which one corner of the pentagon is lifted up above the plane of the other four The envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope by allowing the bonds to be in an almost completely staggared position However the neighboring bonds are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap Viewing a Newman projections of cyclopentane signed down one of the CC bond show the staggered CH bonds Newman projection of cyclopentane The angle strain in the envelope conformation of cyclopentane is low The ideal angle in a regular pentagon is about o very close to the preferred o tetrahedral bond angle There is some torsional strain in cyclopentane The envelope conformation reduces torsional strain by placing some bonds in nearly staggered positions However other bonds are still almost fully eclipsed Cyclopentane is not large enough to allow for steric strain to be created Overall cyclopentane has very little ring strain kJmol when compared to cyclopropane and cyclobutane Interactive Element The D Structure of Cyclopentane CC Cycloalkanes in Nature If one of the carboncarbon bonds is broken in cyclopropane or cyclobutane the ring will spring open releasing energy as the bonds reassume their preferred tetrahedral geometry The effectiveness of two antibiotic drugs fosfomycin and penicillin is due in large part to the high reactivity of the three and fourmembered rings in their structures One of the most important fivemembered rings in nature is a sugar called ribose DNA and RNA are both constructed upon backbones derived from ribose Pictured below is one thymidine T deoxynucleotide from a stretch of DNA Since the ribose has lost one of the OH groups at carbon of the ribose ring this is part of a deoxyribonucleic acid DNA If the OH at carbon of the ribose ring was present this would be part of a ribonucleic acid RNA The lowestenergy conformations for ribose are envelope forms in which either C or C are endo on the same side as the C substituent Exercises If cyclobutane were to be planar how many HH eclipsing interactions would there be Assuming kJmol per HH eclipsing interaction what would the strain be on this planar molecule In the two conformations of transDimethylcyclopentane one is more stable than the other Explain why this is In methylcyclopentane which carbon would most likely be in the endo position Solutions There are eclipsing interactions two per CC bond The extra strain on this molecule would be kJmol kJmol x The first conformation is more stable Even though the methyl groups are trans in both models they are anti to one another in the first structure which is lower energy while they are gauche in the second structure increasing strain within the molecule The ring carbon attached to the methyl group would most likely be the endo carbon The large methyl group would create the most torsional strain if eclipsed Being in the endo position would place the bonds is a more staggered position which would reduce strain Questions Q If cyclobutane were to be planar how many HH eclipsing interactions would there be and assuming kJmol per HH eclipsing interaction what is the strain on this planar molecule Q In the two conformations of transcyclopentane one is more stable than the other Explain why this is Solutions S There are eclipsing interactions two per CC bond The extra strain on this molecule would be kJmol kJmol x S The first conformation is more stable Even though the methyl groups are trans in both models in the second structure they are eclipsing one another therefore increasing the strain within the molecule
