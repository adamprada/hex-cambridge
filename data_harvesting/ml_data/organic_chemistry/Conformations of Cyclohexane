cyclohexane rings are free of angular strain draw the structure of a cyclohexane ring in the chair conformation Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below chair conformation twistboat conformation We will find that cyclohexanes tend to have the least angle strain and consequently are the most common cycloalkanes found in nature A wide variety of compounds including hormones pharmaceuticals and flavoring agents have substituted cyclohexane rings Example hormone testosterone which contains three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring Rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar However this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring Cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations Cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring Cyclohexane has the possibility of forming multiple conformations each of which have structural differences which lead to different amounts of ring strain Conformations of Cyclohexane A planar structure for cyclohexane is clearly improbable The bond angles would necessarily be ยบ ยบ larger than the ideal tetrahedral angle Also every carbonhydrogen bond in such a structure would be eclipsed The resulting angle and eclipsing strains would severely destabilize this structure The ring strain of planar cyclohexane is in excess of kJmol so it rarely discussed other than in theory Cyclohexane in the strained planar configuration showing how the hydrogens become eclipsed Chair Conformation of Cyclohexane The flexibility of cyclohexane allows for a conformation which is almost free of ring strain If two carbon atoms on opposite sides of the sixmembered ring are bent out of the plane of the ring a shape is formed that resembles a reclining beach chair This chair conformation is the lowest energy conformation for cyclohexane with an overall ring strain of kJmol In this conformation the carboncarbon ring bonds are able to assume bonding angles of o which is very near the optimal tetrahedral o so angle strain has been eliminated Also the CH ring bonds are staggered so torsional strain has also been eliminated This is clearly seen when looking at a Newman projection of chair cyclohexane sighted down the two central CC bonds Newman projection of cyclohexane Interactive Element The D Structure of Chair Cyclohexane How to Draw the Chair Conformation Boat Conformation of Cyclohexane The Boat Conformation of cyclohexane is created when two carbon atoms on opposite sides of the sixmembered ring are both lifted up out of the plane of the ring creating a shape which slightly resembles a boat The boat conformation is less stable than the chair form for two major reasons The boat conformation has unfavorable steric interactions between a pair of hydrogens the socalled flagpole hydrogens that are forced to be very close together ร This steric hindrance creates a repulsion energy of about kJmol An additional cause of the higher energy of the boat conformation is that adjacent hydrogen atoms on the bottom of the boat are forced into eclipsed positions For these reasons the boat conformation about kJmol less stable than the chair conformation A boat structure of cyclohexane the interfering flagpole hydrogens are shown in red TwistBoat Conformation of Cyclohexane The boat form is quite flexible and by twisting it at the bottom created the twistboat conformer This conformation reduces the strain which characterized the boat conformer The flagpole hydrogens move farther apart the carbons they are attached to are shifted in opposite directions one forward and one back and the eight hydrogens along the sides become largely but not completely staggered Though more stable than the boat conformation the twistboat sometimes skewboat conformation is roughly kJmol less stable than the chair conformation A twistboat structure of cyclohexane Half Chair Conformation of Cyclohexane Cyclohexane can obtain a partially plane conformation called half chair but with only with excessive amounts of ring strain The half chair conformation is formed by taking planar cyclohexane and lifting one carbon out of the plane of the ring The half chair conformation has much of the same strain effects predicted by the fully planar cyclohexane In the planar portion of half chair cyclohexane the CC bond angles are forced to o which creates significant amounts of angle strain Also the corresponding CH bonds are fully eclipsed which create torsional strain The outofplane carbon allows for some of the rings bond angles to reach o and for some of CH bonds to not be fully eclipsed Overall the half chair conformation is roughly kJmol less stable than the chair conformation Conformation Changes in Cyclohexane Ring Flips Cyclohexane is rapidly rotating between the two most stable conformations known as the chair conformations in what is called the ring flip shown below The importance of the ring flip will be discussed in the next section Ring flip describes the rapid equilibrium of cyclohexane rings between the two chair conformations It is important to note that one chair does not immediately become the other chair rather the ring must travel through the higher energy conformations as transitions At room temperature the energy barrier created by the half chair conformation is easily overcome allowing for equilibration between the two chair conformation on the order of times per second Although cyclohexane is continually converting between these different conformations the stability of the chair conformation causes it to comprises more than of the equilibrium mixture at room temperature Image of energy diagram of cyclohexane conformations
