Drawing Newman ProjectionsExampleExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to depict the staggered and eclipsed conformers of propane or a similar compound using sawhorse representations and Newman projections sketch a graph of energy versus bond rotation for propane or a similar compound and discuss the graph in terms of torsional strain depict the anti gauche eclipsed and fully eclipsed conformers of butane or a similar compound using sawhorse representations and Newman projections sketch a graph of energy versus CC bond rotation for butane or a similar compound and discuss it in terms of torsional and steric repulsion assess which of two or more conformers of a given compound is likely to predominate at room temperature from a semiquantitative knowledge of the energy costs of the interactions involved Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below anti conformation gauche conformation eclipsed conformation steric repulsion strain In butane there are three rotating carboncarbon sigma bonds to consider but we will focus on the middle bond between C and C Below are two representations of butane in a conformation which puts the two CH groups C and C in the eclipsed position Eclipsed interaction Energy kcalmol Energy kJmol HH HCH CHCH The CHCH groups create the significantly larger eclipsed interaction of kJmol There are also two HH eclipsed interactions at kJmol each to create a total of kJmol kJmol kJmol of strain This is the highest energy conformation for butane due to torsional strain caused by the electrostatic repulsion of electrons in the eclipsed bonds but also because of another type of strain called steric repulsion between the two rather bulky methyl groups Steric strain comes about when two large groups such as two methyl groups try to occupy the same space What results is a repulsive noncovalent interaction caused by their respective electron densities If we rotate the front blue carbon by clockwise the butane molecule is now in a staggered conformation This is more specifically referred to as the gauche conformation of butane Notice that although they are staggered the two methyl groups are not as far apart as they could possibly be There is still significant steric repulsion between the two bulky groups A further rotation of gives us a second eclipsed conformation B in which both methyl groups are lined up with hydrogen atoms Due to steric repulsion between methyl and hydrogen substituents this eclipsed conformation B is higher in energy than the gauche conformation However because there is no methyltomethyl eclipsing it is lower in energy than eclipsed conformation A One more rotation produces the anti conformation where the two methyl groups are positioned opposite each other and steric repulsion is minimized The anti conformation is the lowest energy conformation for butane The diagram below summarizes the relative energies for the various eclipsed staggered and gauche conformations Interactive Element Figure A D Structure of the Anti Butane Conformer Figure Potential curve vs dihedral angle of the CC bond of butane Figure Newman projections of butane conformations their relative energy differences not total energies Conformations form when butane rotates about one of its single covalent bond Torsionaldihedral angle is shown on xaxis Torsionaldihedral angle is shown on xaxis Conformation names according to IUPAC A antiperiplanar anti or trans B synclinal or gauche C anticlinal or eclipsed D synperiplanar or cis Source for conformation names conformer classification Pure Appl Chem Vol No pp Public Domain Keministi At room temperature butane is most likely to be in the lowestenergy anti conformation at any given moment in time although the energy barrier between the anti and eclipsed conformations is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at very low temperatures For this reason and also simply for ease of drawing it is conventional to draw straightchain alkanes in a zigzag form which implies the anti conformation at all carboncarbon bonds For example octane is commonly drawn as Drawing Newman Projections Newman projections are a valuable method for viewing the relative positions of groups within molecule Being able to draw the Newman projection for a given molecule is a valuable skill and will be used repeatedly throughout organic chemistry Because organic molecules often contain multiple carboncarbon bonds it is important to precisely know which bond and which direction is being sighted for the Newman projection The details of the Newman projection change given the molecule but for typical alkanes a full conformational analysis involves a full o rotation in o increments This will produce three staggered conformers and three eclipsed conformers Typically the staggered conformers are more stable and the eclipsed conformers are less stable The least stable conformer will have the largest groups eclipsed while the most stable conformer will have the largest groups anti o to each other Example Draw the Newman projection of dimethylbutane along the CC bond Then determine the least stable conformation First draw the molecule and locate the indicated bond Because the question asks for the least stable conformation focus on the three possible eclipsed Newman projections Draw out three eclipsed Newman projections as a template Because it is difficult to draw a true staggered Newman projection it is common to show the bonds slightly askew Place the substituents attached to the second carbon C on the back bonds of all three Newman projections In this example they are CHs and an H Place the substituents in the same position on all three Newman projections Then place the substituents attached to the first carbon C on the front bonds of the Newman projection In this example the substituents are also CHs and an H Move the substituents through two o rotations to create the remaining two eclipsed Newman projections Leave the substituents on the back carbon in place Attempting to rotate the front and back carbons simultaneously is a common mistake and often leads to incorrect Newman projections Compare the Newman projections by looking the eclipsed interactions Remember that the order of torsional strain interactions are CHCH CHH HH The third structure has two CHCH torsional interactions which will make it the least stable conformer of dimethyl butane Example Draw Newman projections of the eclipsed and staggered conformations of propane as if viewed down the CC bond Answer Example Draw a Newman projection looking down the CC bond of butene in the conformation shown below Answer Exercises Questions Q Draw the energy diagram for the rotation of the bond highlighted in pentane Solutions S Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of
