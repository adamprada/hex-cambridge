Contributors and Attributions The cycloalkanes with one ring have the general formula and are named by adding the prefix cyclo to the name of the corresponding continuouschain alkane having the same number of carbon atoms as the ring Substituents are assigned numbers consistent with their position in such a way as to give the lowest numbers possible for the substituent positions The substituent groups derived from cycloalkanes by removing one hydrogen are named by replacing the ending ane of the hydrocarbon with yl to give cycloalkyl Thus cyclohexane becomes cyclohexyl cyclopentane becomes cyclopentyl and so on Remember the numbering of the cycloalkyl substituent starts at the position of attachment and larger rings take precedence over smaller rings When a cycloalkane has an alkyl substituent the compound could be called either an alkylcycloalkane or a cycloalkylalkane The alkylcycloalkane name is the proper one in naming alkyl substituted cycloalkanes Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
