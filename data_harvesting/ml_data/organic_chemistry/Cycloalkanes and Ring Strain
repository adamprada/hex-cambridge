Learning Objective explain the partial rotation of carboncarbon single bonds in rings explain ring strain and its relationship to cycloalkane stability Cycloalkanes aka Rings Cycloalkanes have one or more rings of carbon atoms The simplest examples of this class consist of a single unsubstituted carbon ring and these form a homologous series similar to the unbranched alkanes The IUPAC names of the first five members of this series are given in the following table The last column gives the general formula for a cycloalkane of any size If a simple unbranched alkane is converted to a cycloalkane two hydrogen atoms one from each end of the chain must be lost Hence the general formula for a cycloalkane composed of n carbons is CnHn Although a cycloalkane has two fewer hydrogens than the equivalent alkane each carbon is bonded to four other atoms so such compounds are still considered to be saturated with hydrogen Table Examples of Simple Cycloalkanes Name Cyclopropane Cyclobutane Cyclopentane Cyclohexane Cycloheptane Cycloalkane Molecular Formula CH CH CH CH CH CnHn Structural Formula CHn Line Formula Although the customary line drawings of simple cycloalkanes are geometrical polygons the actual shape of these compounds in most cases is very different Cyclic systems are a little different from openchain systems In an open chain any bond can be rotated degrees going through many different conformations Complete rotation isnt possible in a cyclic system because the parts that you would be trying to twist away from each other would still be connected together Cyclic systems have fewer degrees of freedom than aliphatic systems they have restricted rotation Because of the restricted rotation of cyclic systems most of them have much more welldefined shapes than their aliphatic counterparts Lets take a look at the basic shapes of some common rings Many biologically important compounds are built around structures containing rings so its important that we become familiar with them In nature three to sixmembered rings are frequently encountered so well focus on those The Baeyer Theory and the Experimental Evidence of Ring Strain Many of the properties of cyclopropane and its derivatives are similar to the properties of alkenes In the famous German organic chemist A Baeyer suggested that cyclopropane and cyclobutane derivatives are different from cyclopentane and cyclohexane because their CCC angles cannot have the tetrahedral value of At the same time Baeyer hypothesized that the difficulties encountered in synthesizing cycloalkane rings from C upward was the result of the angle strain that would be expected if the large rings were regular planar polygons see Table Baeyer also believed that cyclohexane had a planar structure like that shown in Figure which would mean that the bond angles would have to deviate from the tetrahedral value However in the then unknown chemist H Sachse suggested that cyclohexane exists in the strainfree chair and boat forms discussed in Section This suggestion was not accepted at the time because it led to the prediction of several possible isomers for compounds such as chlorocyclohexane cf Exercise The idea that such isomers might act as a single substance as the result of rapid equilibration seemed like a needless complication and it was not until that E Mohr proposed a definitive way to distinguish between the Baeyer and Sachse cyclohexanes As will be discussed in Section the result now known as the SachseMohr theory was complete confirmation of the idea of nonplanar large rings

ethene cyclopropane cyclobutane cyclopentane cyclohexane cycloheptane cyclooctane cyclononane cyclodecane cyclopentadecane open chain alkane Ring Strain in Cycloalkanes Ring Strain occurs because the carbons in cycloalkanes are sp hybridized which means that they do not have the expected ideal bond angle of o this causes an increase in the potential energy because of the desire for the carbons to be at an ideal o An example of ring strain can be seen in the diagram of cyclopropane below in which the bond angle is o between the carbons The reason for ring strain can be seen through the tetrahedral carbon model The CCC bond angles in cyclopropane diagram above o and cyclobutane o are much different than the ideal bond angle of o This bond angle causes cyclopropane and cyclobutane to have a high ring strain However molecules such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane would have a much lower ring strain because the bond angle between the carbons is much closer to o Below are some examples of cycloalkanes Ring strain can be seen more prevalently in the cyclopropane and cyclobutane models Below is a chart of cycloalkanes and their respective heats of combustion ΔHcomb The ΔHcomb value increases as the number of carbons in the cycloalkane increases higher membered ring and the ΔHcombCH ratio decreases The increase in ΔHcomb can be attributed to the greater amount of London Dispersion forces However the decrease in ΔHcombCHcan be attributed to a decrease in the ring strain Certain cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane deal with ring strain by forming conformers A conformer is a stereoisomer in which molecules of the same connectivity and formula exist as different isomers in this case to reduce ring strain The ring strain is reduced in conformers due to the rotations around the sigma bonds Other Types of Strain There are many different types of strain that occur with cycloalkanes In addition to ring strain there is also transannular strain eclipsing or torsional strain and bond angle strainTransannular strain exists when there is steric repulsion between atoms Eclipsing torsional strain exists when a cycloalkane is unable to adopt a staggered conformation around a CC bond and bond angle strain is the energy needed to distort the tetrahedral carbons enough to close the ring The presence of angle strain in a molecule indicates that there are bond angles in that particular molecule that deviate from the ideal bond angles required ie that molecule has conformers Cyclopropane A three membered ring has no rotational freedom whatsoever so the three carbon atoms in cyclopropane are all constrained to lie in the same plane at the corners of an equilateral triangle The º bond angles are much smaller than the optimum º angles of a normal tetrahedral carbon atom and the resulting angle strain dramatically influences the chemical behavior of this cycloalkane Cyclopropane also suffers substantial eclipsing strain since all the carboncarbon bonds are fully eclipsed Furthermore if you look at a model you will find that the neighboring CH bonds CC bonds too are all held in eclipsed conformations Cyclopropane is always at maximum torsional strain This strain can be illustrated in a line drawing of cyclopropane as shown from the side In this oblique view the dark lines mean that those sides of the ring are closer to you However the ring isnt big enough to introduce any steric strain which does not become a factor until we reach six membered rings Until that point rings are not flexible enough for two atoms to reach around and bump into each other The really big problem with cyclopropane is that the CCC bond angles are all too small All the carbon atoms in cyclopropane appear to be tetrahedral These bond angles ought to be degrees The angles in an equilateral triangle are actually degrees about half as large as the optimum angle This factor introduces a huge amount of strain in the molecule called ring strain Cyclobutane Cyclobutane is a four membered ring In two dimensions it is a square with degree angles at each corner Cyclobutane reduces some bondeclipsing strain by folding the outofplane dihedral angle is about º but the total eclipsing and angle strain remains high Cyclopentane has very little angle strain the angles of a pentagon are º but its eclipsing strain would be large about kcalmol if it remained planar Consequently the fivemembered ring adopts nonplanar puckered conformations whenever possible However in three dimensions cyclobutane is flexible enough to buckle into a butterfly shape relieving torsional strain a little bit When it does that the bond angles get a little worse going from degrees to degrees In a line drawing this butterfly shape is usually shown from the side with the near edges drawn using darker lines With bond angles of rather than degrees cyclobutane has a lot of ring strain but less than in cyclopropane Torsional strain is still present but the neighbouring bonds are not exactly eclipsed in the butterfly Cyclobutane is still not large enough that the molecule can reach around to cause crowding Steric strain is very low Cyclobutanes are a little more stable than cyclopropanes and are also a little more common in nature Cyclopentane Cyclopentanes are even more stable than cyclobutanes and they are the secondmost common paraffinic ring in nature after cyclohexanes In two dimensions a cyclopentane appears to be a regular pentagon In three dimensions there is enough freedom of rotation to allow a slight twist out of this planar shape In a line drawing this threedimensional shape is drawn from an oblique view just like cyclobutane The ideal angle in a regular pentagon is about degrees very close to a tetrahedral bond angle Cyclopentane distorts only very slightly into an envelope shape in which one corner of the pentagon is lifted up above the plane of the other four and as a result ring strain is entirely removed The envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope However the neighbouring carbons are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap There is still some torsional strain in cyclopentane Again there is no steric strain in this system Rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar However this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring Cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations Cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring Exercise If cyclobutane were to be planar how many HH eclipsing interactions would there be and assuming kJmol per HH eclipsing interaction what is the strain on this planar molecule In the two conformations of ciscyclopentane one is more stable than the other Explain why this is Answer There are eclipsing interactions two per CC bond The extra strain on this molecule would be kJmol kJmol x The first conformation is more stable Even though the methyl groups are cis in the model on the left they are eclipsing due the conformation therefore increasing the strain within the molecule
