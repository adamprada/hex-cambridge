Equilibrium ConstantFree EnergyApplications to Organic ReactionsContributors and Attributions Learning Objective perform calculations using the equation and explain the relationship between equilibrium and free energy Equilibrium Constant For the hypothetical chemical reaction the equilibrium constant is defined as where the notation A signifies the molar concentration of species A Note that the expression for the equilibrium constant includes only solutes and gases pure solids and liquids do not appear in the expression For example the equilibrium expression for the reaction is the following Observe that the gasphase species and appear in the expression but the solids and do not appear The equilibrium constant is most readily determined by allowing a reaction to reach equilibrium measuring the concentrations of the various solutionphase or gasphase reactants and products and substituting these values into the Law of Mass Action Free Energy The interaction between enthalpy and entropy changes in chemical reactions is best observed by studying their influence on the equilibrium constants of reversible reactions To this end a new thermodynamic function called Free Energy or Gibbs Free Energy symbol is defined as shown in the first equation below Two things should be apparent from this equation First in cases where the entropy change is small Second the importance of in determining increases with increasing temperature where the temperature is measured in absolute temperature K The free energy function provides improved insight into the thermodynamic driving forces that influence reactions A negative is characteristic of an exergonic reaction one which is thermodynamically favorable and often spontaneous as is the melting of ice at ºC Likewise a positive is characteristic of an endergonic reaction one which requires an input of energy from the surroundings For an example of the relationship of free energy to enthalpy consider the decomposition of cyclobutane to ethene shown in the following equation The standard state for all the compounds is gaseous This reaction is endothermic but the increase in number of molecules from one reactants to two products results in a large positive ΔSº At ºC K ΔGº kcalmol calmole kcalmole kcalmole Thus the entropy change opposes the enthalpy change but is not sufficient to change the sign of the resulting free energy change which is endergonic Indeed cyclobutane is perfectly stable when kept at room temperature Because the entropy contribution increases with temperature this energetically unfavorable transformation can be made favorable by raising the temperature At ºC K This is now an exergonic reaction and the thermal cracking of cyclobutane to ethene is known to occur at higher temperatures where R cal K mole T temperature in K and K equilibrium constant Note Equation refeq is important because it demonstrates the fundamental relationship of to the equilibrium constant Because of the negative logarithmic relationship between these variables a negative ΔGº generates a K whereas a positive ΔGº generates a K When ΔGº K Furthermore small changes in ΔGº produce large changes in K A change of kcalmole in ΔGº changes K by approximately a factor of This interrelationship may be explored with the calculator on the right Entering free energies outside the range to kcalmole or equilibrium constants outside the range to will trigger an alert indicating the large imbalance such numbers imply Applications to Organic Reactions The equation below can also be useful without performing any calculations Conceptually this equation helps us compare the energetics of reaction mechanisms to predict the major products For example if ΔG then K and products are favored over reactants If ΔG then K and reactants are favored over products If ΔG then K and the system is at equilibrium Recognizing the underlying energetics of equilibrium the stability of charged reactants and products can be used to predict reaction equilibrium Reaction conditions can also be adjusted or controlled to shift the equilibrium in the desired direction by a range of experimental methods A theoretical understanding of the reaction free energy and equilibrium helps us predict and design the optimum reaction conditions for a desired product Exercises At C the equilibrium constant Keq for the reaction has a value of Calculate ΔG for this reaction at C Acetylene CH can be converted into benzene CH according to the equation At C ΔG for this reaction is kJ and ΔH is kJ Determine ΔS and indicate whether the size of ΔS agrees with what you would have predicted simply by looking at the chemical equation Answer Δ G R T ln K eq J K mol K ln J K mol K J mol KJ mol Δ G Δ H T Δ S Δ S Δ H Δ G T kJ kJ K kJ K KJ mol J mol The entropy change is negative as one would expect from looking at the chemical equation since three moles of reactants yield one mole of product that is the system becomes much more ordered as it goes from reactants to products Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma
