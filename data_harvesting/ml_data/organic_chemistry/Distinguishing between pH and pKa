Relative Acidity and pKa Values Learning Objective Determine relative strengths of acids and bases from their pKa values Determine the form of an acid or base at a specified pH given the pKa The HendersonHasselbach Equation a Quantitative View We will use the general reaction for a weak acid to write the Ka expression pKa log Ka where each bracketed term represents the concentration of that substance in solution The stronger an acid the greater the ionization the lower the pKa and the lower the pH the compound will produce in solution It is important to realize that pKa is not at all the same thing as pH the former is an inherent property of a compound or functional group while the latter is the measure of the hydronium ion concentration in a particular aqueous solution pH log HO Additional reagents can be added to a reaction solution to change the pH of the reaction conditions beyond the effects of an individual compound Relative Acidity and pKa Values An application of the HendersonHasselbach Equation is the ability to determine the relative acidity of compounds by comparing their pKa values The stronger an acid the greater the ionization the lower the pKa and the lower the pH the compound will produce in solution Some selected pKa values for compounds in the study of organic chemistry are shown bellow Since organic reactions can be performed in nonaqueous environments the pH can exceed and organic compounds can have pKa values above It is a variation on that line from the Wizard of Oz We dont live in water anymore It is a very good idea to commit to memory the approximate pKa ranges of the compounds above A word of caution when using the pKa table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair If you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia NH compared to that of ethoxide ion CHCHO for example the relevant pKa values to consider are the pKa of ammonium ion and the pKa of ethanol From these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base Do not make the mistake of using the pKa value of this is the pKa of ammonia acting as an acid and tells you how basic the NH ion is very basic A note on the pKa of water The pKa of water is Biochemistry and organic chemistry texts often list the value as These texts have incorrectly factored the molar value for the concentration of water into the equilibrium constant The correct derivation of the equilibrium constant involves the activity of water which has a value of Example While this course begins with single functional groups we will eventually work with interesting compounds containing multiple functional groups Recognizing which hydrogens can be ionized as acidic protons and which hydrogens can NOT is a useful skill Notice in this example that we need to evaluate the potential acidity at four different locations on the molecule Aldehyde and aromatic protons are not at all acidic pKavalues are above not on our table The two protons on the carbon next to the carbonyl are slightly acidic with pKa values around according to the table The most acidic proton is on the phenol group so if the compound were to be subjected to a single molar equivalent of strong base this is the proton that would be donated Acidic Basic Environments Everything is Relative in Reactivity Because our goal is understanding dynamic chemical reactivity we do NOT need to know the specific amount of the protonated and unprotonated forms of a compound We simply need to know which form is predominate When the pH of the environment is less than the pKa of the compound the environment is considered acidic and the compound will exist predominately in its protonated form When the pH of the environment is greater than the pKa of the compound the environment is considered basic and the compound will exist predominately in its deprotonated form For example the pKa of acetic acid is about At a pH of the environment is considered acidic and acetic acid exists predominately in its protonated form At pH the environment is considered basic and acetic acid becomes deprotonated to form acetate CHCO Conversely the pKa of phenol is At pH the environment is considered acidic for phenol and it remains primarily protonated It is also important to remember that organic chemistry does NOT have to occur in water so pKa values can be as high as Exercise Complete the table below to indicate whether each compound exists predominantly in its protonated acidic environment or deprotonated basic environment form compound pKa pH environment pH environment pH environment Answer compound pKa pH environment pH environment pH environment
