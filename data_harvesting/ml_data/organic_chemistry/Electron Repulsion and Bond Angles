Contributors and Attributions In predicting bond angles in small molecules we find we can do a great deal with the simple idea that unlike charges produce attractive forces while like charges produce repulsive forces We will have electronnuclear attractions electronelectron repulsions and nucleusnucleus repulsions Let us first consider the case of a molecule with just two electronpair bonds as might be expected to be formed by combination of beryllium and hydrogen to give beryllium hydride The problem will be how to formulate the bonds and how to predict what the angle will be If we proceed as we did with the bond we might try to formulate bond formation in by bringing two hydrogen atoms in the state up to beryllium in the ground state Table But there is a problem in the groundstate configuration of beryllium the orbital is full and cannot accommodate any more electrons The way around this is to promote one of the electrons of beryllium to a orbital The resulting beryllium atom called the valence state then could form a bond with a hydrogen by overlap of the and orbitals as shown in also see Figure We might formulate a second bond involving the orbital but a new problem arises as to where the hydrogen should be located relative to the beryllium orbital Is it as in or some other way The and nuclei will be farther apart in than they will be in or any other similar arrangement so there will be less internuclear repulsion with We therefore expect the hydrogen to locate along a line going through the greatest extension of the orbital According to this simple picture beryllium hydride should have two different types of bonds one as in and the other as in This is intuitively unreasonable for such a simple compound Furthermore the bond angle is unspecified by this picture because the orbital is spherically symmetrical and could form bonds equally well in any direction However if we forget about the orbitals and only consider the possible repulsions between the electron pairs and between the hydrogen nuclei we can see that these repulsions will be minimized when the bond angle is Thus arrangement should be more favorable than with a angle less than Unfortunately we cannot check this particular bond angle by experiment because is unstable and reacts with itself to give a highmolecularweight solid However a number of other compounds such as and are known to have bonds involving valence states Measurements of the bond angles at the metal of these substances in the vapor state has shown them to be uniformly Figure Representation of the relative sizes of and orbitals How are the and orbitals deployed in this kind of bonding It turns out that stronger bonds are formed when the degree of overlap of the orbitals is high The degree of overlap will depend on the sizes of the orbital and particularly on how far out they extend from the nucleus Figure shows how far and orbitals extend relative to one another Bonding with these orbitals as in and does not utilize the overlapping power of the orbitals to the fullest extent With we have overlap that uses only part of the orbital and with only a part of the orbital Molecules such as can be formulated with better overlap and equivalent bonds with the aid of the concept of orbital hybridization This concept published independently by L Pauling and J C Slater in involves determining which if any combinations of and orbitals may overlap better and make more effective bonds than do the individual and orbitals The mathematical procedure for orbital hybridization predicts that an and a orbital of one atom can form two stronger covalent bonds if they combine to form two new orbitals called hybridized orbitals Figure Each hybrid orbital has an overlapping power of compared to the pure orbital taken as unity and a pure orbital as Bond angles of are expected for bonds to an atom using hybrid orbitals and of course this also is the angle we expect on the basis of our consideration of minimum electronpair and internuclear repulsions Henceforth we will proceed on the basis that molecules of the type may form hybrid bonds Figure Diagram of two hybrid orbitals composed of an orbital and a orbital One of the orbitals solid line has its greatest extension in the plus direction while the other orbital dotted line has its greatest extension in the minus direction Bonds utilizing both of these orbitals would form at an angle of On the basis of repulsion between electron pairs and between nuclei molecules such as and in which the central atom forms three covalent bonds using the valencestate electronic configuration are expected to be planar with bond angles of For example Any departure from the planar arrangement will be less stable because it will increase internuclear and interelectronic repulsion by bringing nuclei closer together and the electron pairs closer together The and orbitals used in bonding in these compounds can be hybridized to give three equivalent orbitals Figure These orbitals have their axes in a common plane and are at to one another The predicted overlapping power is Figure Diagram of three hybrid orbitals made from an orbital a orbital and a orbital Each orbital is shown with a different kind of line With atoms such as carbon and silicon the valencestate electronic configuration to form four covalent bonds has to be Repulsion between the electron pairs and between the attached nuclei will be minimized by formation of a tetrahedral arrangement of the bonds the same geometry is predicted from hybridization one one and three orbitals which gives four hybrid orbitals directed at angles of to each other The predicted relative overlapping power of hybrid orbitals is Figure Figure Diagram of the hybrid
