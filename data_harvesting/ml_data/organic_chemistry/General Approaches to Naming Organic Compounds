A Naming a Compound of Known StructureB Translating a Name into its Chemical StructureContributors and Attributions There are two aspects to consider how to derive the name from the structure and how to derive the structure from the name We will discuss each by example A Naming a Compound of Known Structure You first should decide what type of compound it is The decision usually is straightforward for hydrocarbons which will fall in one or the other of the categories alkanes alkenes alkynes arenes cycloalkanes and so on But when the compound has more than one functional group it is not always obvious which is the parent function For example Compound could be named as an alkene because of the doublebond function or as an alcohol because of the function There are no simple rules to follow that dictate which is the parent function and we suggest that the order of precedence of functional groups set by Chemical Abstracts be used whenever possible see Table By this system the group takes precedence over hydrocarbons and Compound therefore is named as an alcohol not as an alkene Having decided on the main classification our next step is to identify the longest chain that includes the main functional group Then this chain is numbered starting at the end that gives the main function the lowest possible number The remaining groups functional or nonfunctional are taken as substituents and are assigned numbers according to their position along the chain Thus for Compound The longest continuous carbon chain carrying the group is a sixcarbon unit The prefix for a sixcarbon hydrocarbon is hex The chain is numbered so the group is at the lowest possible number Therefore the IUPAC suffix is ol in which ol signifies alcohol see Section The remaining functions are methyl at and ene at The complete name is Notice that the final e is dropped from the suffix ene when followed by another suffix beginning with a vowel One further point of possible confusion is where to locate the numerical symbol for the main functional group in the name For instance if the double bond in were absent we could name the compound either methylhexanol or methylhexanol The rule is to not divide the name unnecessarily Thus methylhexanol would be correct and methylhexanol would be incorrect B Translating a Name into its Chemical Structure The first step is to identify the parent function which usually is determined from the suffix or word at the end of the name Suppose for example that a structure is to be written for a compound having the name methoxybutanal The suffix al is the IUPAC suffix for aldehyde therefore the compound is an aldehyde and the function is The next step is to set up the carbon chain that includes the aldehyde carbon The prefix butan denotes a saturated fourcarbon chain and a partial structure with numbering may be written to place the aldehyde function at The rest of the name which generally precedes the parent name describes the substituent and its position on the parent chain In our example methoxy means a group at Thus the complete structure of methoxybutanal is The foregoing examples illustrate that naming compounds from structures or deducing structures from names requires knowledge of both the parent names and the substituent names of the important types of functional and nonfunctional groups This information is summarized in the following sections and in Table Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
