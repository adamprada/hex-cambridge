forces IMFs of organic compounds The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids In contrast to intramolecular forces such as the covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules and polyatomic ions intermolecular forces hold molecules together in a liquid or solid Intermolecular forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds For example it requires kJ to overcome the intramolecular forces and break both OH bonds in mol of water but it takes only about kJ to overcome the intermolecular attractions and convert mol of liquid water to water vapor at C Despite this seemingly low value the intermolecular forces in liquid water are among the strongest such forces known Given the large difference in the strengths of intra and intermolecular forces changes between the solid liquid and gaseous states almost invariably occur for molecular substances without breaking covalent bonds The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids Intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the boiling points of liquids Liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid Similarly solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature that is they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species Like covalent and ionic bonds intermolecular interactions are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components Because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids where the molecules are close together These interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law at high pressures For more information on the behavior of real gases and deviations from the ideal gas law In this section we explicitly consider three kinds of intermolecular interactions There are two additional types of electrostatic interaction that you are already familiar with the ionion interactions that are responsible for ionic bonding and the iondipole interactions that occur when ionic substances dissolve in a polar substance such as water The first two are often described collectively as van der Waals forces DipoleDipole Interactions Polar covalent bonds behave as if the bonded atoms have localized fractional charges that are equal but opposite ie the two bonded atoms generate a dipole If the structure of a molecule is such that the individual bond dipoles do not cancel one another then the molecule has a net dipole moment Molecules with net dipole moments tend to align themselves so that the positive end of one dipole is near the negative end of another and vice versa as shown in Figure Figure Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions a and b Molecular orientations in which the positive end of one dipole δ is near the negative end of another δ and vice versa produce attractive interactions c and d Molecular orientations that juxtapose the positive or negative ends of the dipoles on adjacent molecules produce repulsive interactions These arrangements are more stable than arrangements in which two positive or two negative ends are adjacent Figure Hence dipoledipole interactions such as those in Figure are attractive intermolecular interactions whereas those in Figure are repulsive intermolecular interactions Because molecules in a liquid move freely and continuously molecules always experience both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions simultaneously as shown in Figure On average however the attractive interactions dominate Figure Both Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions Occur in a Liquid Sample with Many Molecules Because each end of a dipole possesses only a fraction of the charge of an electron dipoledipole interactions are substantially weaker than the interactions between two ions each of which has a charge of at least or between a dipole and an ion in which one of the species has at least a full positive or negative charge In addition the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do the ionion interactions Recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r where r is the distance between the ions Doubling the distance r r decreases the attractive energy by onehalf In contrast the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to r so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction by or fold Thus a substance such as which is partially held together by dipoledipole interactions is a gas at room temperature and atm pressure whereas which is held together by interionic interactions is a highmeltingpoint solid Within a series of compounds of similar molar mass the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases as shown in Table Table Relationships between the Dipole Moment and the Boiling Point for Organic Compounds of Similar Molar Mass Compound Molar Mass gmol Dipole Moment D Boiling Point K CH cyclopropane CHOCH dimethyl ether CHCN acetonitrile The attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r whereas the attractive energy between two dipoles is proportional to r Example Arrange ethyl methyl ether CHOCHCH methylpropane isobutane CHCHCH and acetone CHCOCH in order of increasing boiling points Their structures are as follows Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Compare the molar masses and the polarities of the compounds Compounds with higher molar masses and that are polar will have the highest boiling points Solution The three compounds have essentially the same molar mass gmol so we must look at differences in polarity to predict the strength of the intermolecular dipoledipole interactions and thus the boiling points of the compounds The first compound methylpropane contains only CH bonds which are not very polar because C and H have similar electronegativities It should therefore have a very small but nonzero dipole moment and a very low boiling point Ethyl methyl ether has a structure similar to HO it contains two polar CO single bonds oriented at about a angle to each other in addition to relatively nonpolar CH bonds As a result the CO bond dipoles partially reinforce one another and generate a significant dipole moment that should give a moderately high boiling point Acetone contains a polar CO double bond oriented at about to two methyl groups with nonpolar CH bonds The CO bond dipole therefore corresponds to the molecular dipole which should result in both a rather large dipole moment and a high boiling point Thus we predict the following order of boiling points methylpropane ethyl methyl ether acetone This result is in good agreement with the actual data methylpropane boiling point C and the dipole moment μ D methyl ethyl ether boiling point C and μ D acetone boiling point C and μ D Exercise Arrange carbon tetrafluoride CF ethyl methyl sulfide CHSCH dimethyl sulfoxide CHSO and methylbutane isopentane CHCHCHCH in order of decreasing boiling points Answer dimethyl sulfoxide boiling point C ethyl methyl sulfide boiling point C methylbutane boiling point C carbon tetrafluoride boiling point C London Dispersion Forces Thus far we have considered only interactions between polar molecules but other factors must be considered to explain why many nonpolar molecules such as bromine benzene and hexane are liquids at room temperature and others such as iodine and naphthalene are solids Even the noble gases can be liquefied or solidified at low temperatures high pressures or both Table What kind of attractive forces can exist between nonpolar molecules or atoms This question was answered by Fritz London a German physicist who later worked in the United States In London proposed that temporary fluctuations in the electron distributions within atoms and nonpolar molecules could result in the formation of shortlived instantaneous dipole moments which produce attractive forces called London dispersion forces between otherwise nonpolar substances Table Normal Melting and Boiling Points of Some Elements and Nonpolar Compounds Substance Molar Mass gmol Melting Point C Boiling Point C Ar Xe N O F I CH Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms for example On average the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed around the nucleus Because the electrons are in constant motion however their distribution in one atom is likely to be asymmetrical at any given instant resulting in an instantaneous dipole moment As shown in part a in Figure the instantaneous dipole moment on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom pulling them toward the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end The net effect is that the first atom causes the temporary formation of a dipole called an induced dipole in the second Interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another These attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance London was able to show with quantum mechanics that the attractive energy between molecules due to temporary dipoleinduced dipole interactions falls off as r Doubling the distance therefore decreases the attractive energy by or fold Figure Instantaneous Dipole Moments The formation of an instantaneous dipole moment on one He atom a or an H molecule b results in the formation of an induced dipole on an adjacent atom or molecule Instantaneous dipoleinduced dipole interactions between nonpolar molecules can produce intermolecular attractions just as they produce interatomic attractions in monatomic substances like Xe This effect illustrated for two H molecules in part b in Figure tends to become more pronounced as atomic and molecular masses increase Table For example Xe boils at C whereas He boils at C The reason for this trend is that the strength of London dispersion forces is related to the ease with which the electron distribution in a given atom can be perturbed In small atoms such as He the two s electrons are held close to the nucleus in a very small volume and electronelectron repulsions are strong enough to prevent significant asymmetry in their distribution In larger atoms such as Xe however the outer electrons are much less strongly attracted to the nucleus because of filled intervening shells As a result it is relatively easy to temporarily deform the electron distribution to generate an instantaneous or induced dipole The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule is called its polarizability Because the electron distribution is more easily perturbed in large heavy species than in small light species we say that heavier substances tend to be much more polarizable than lighter ones For similar substances London dispersion forces get stronger with increasing molecular size The polarizability of a substance also determines how it interacts with ions and species that possess permanent dipoles Thus London dispersion forces are responsible for the general trend toward higher boiling points with increased molecular mass and greater surface area in a homologous series of compounds such as the alkanes part a in Figure The strengths of London dispersion forces also depend significantly on molecular shape because shape determines how much of one molecule can interact with its neighboring molecules at any given time For example part b in Figure shows dimethylpropane neopentane and npentane both of which have the empirical formula CH Neopentane is almost spherical with a small surface area for intermolecular interactions whereas npentane has an extended conformation that enables it to come into close contact with other npentane molecules As a result the boiling point of neopentane C is more than C lower than the boiling point of npentane C Figure Mass and Surface Area Affect the Strength of London Dispersion Forces a In this series of four simple alkanes larger molecules have stronger London forces between them than smaller molecules and consequently higher boiling points b Linear npentane molecules have a larger surface area and stronger intermolecular forces than spherical neopentane molecules As a result neopentane is a gas at room temperature whereas npentane is a volatile liquid All molecules whether polar or nonpolar are attracted to one another by London dispersion forces in addition to any other attractive forces that may be present In general however dipoledipole interactions in small polar molecules are significantly stronger than London dispersion forces so the former predominate Example Arrange nbutane propane methylpropane isobutene CHCHCH and npentane in order of increasing boiling points Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Determine the intermolecular forces in the compounds and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution The four compounds are alkanes and nonpolar so London dispersion forces are the only important intermolecular forces These forces are generally stronger with increasing molecular mass so propane should have the lowest boiling point and npentane should have the highest with the two butane isomers falling in between Of the two butane isomers methylpropane is more compact and nbutane has the more extended shape Consequently we expect intermolecular interactions for nbutane to be stronger due to its larger surface area resulting in a higher boiling point The overall order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses propane C methylpropane C nbutane C npentane C Exercise Arrange GeH SiCl SiH CH and GeCl in order of decreasing boiling points Answer GeCl C SiCl C GeH C SiH C CH C Hydrogen Bonds Molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms such as O N and F and to a much lesser extent Cl and S tend to exhibit unusually strong intermolecular interactions These result in much higher boiling points than are observed for substances in which London dispersion forces dominate as illustrated for the covalent hydrides of elements of groups in Figure Methane and its heavier congeners in group form a series whose boiling points increase smoothly with increasing molar mass This is the expected trend in nonpolar molecules for which London dispersion forces are the exclusive intermolecular forces In contrast the hydrides of the lightest members of groups have boiling points that are more than C greater than predicted on the basis of their molar masses The effect is most dramatic for water if we extend the straight line connecting the points for HTe and HSe to the line for period we obtain an estimated boiling point of C for water Imagine the implications for life on Earth if water boiled at C rather than C Figure The Effects of Hydrogen Bonding on Boiling Points These plots of the boiling points of the covalent hydrides of the elements of groups show that the boiling points of the lightest members of each series for which hydrogen bonding is possible HF NH and HO are anomalously high for compounds with such low molecular masses Why do strong intermolecular forces produce such anomalously high boiling points and other unusual properties such as high enthalpies of vaporization and high melting points The answer lies in the highly polar nature of the bonds between hydrogen and very electronegative elements such as O N and F The large difference in electronegativity results in a large partial positive charge on hydrogen and a correspondingly large partial negative charge on the O N or F atom Consequently HO HN and HF bonds have very large bond dipoles that can interact strongly with one another Because a hydrogen atom is so small these dipoles can also approach one another more closely than most other dipoles The combination of large bond dipoles and short dipoledipole distances results in very strong dipoledipole interactions called hydrogen bonds as shown for ice in Figure A hydrogen bond is usually indicated by a dotted line between the hydrogen atom attached to O N or F the hydrogen bond donor and the atom that has the lone pair of electrons the hydrogen bond acceptor Because each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs a tetrahedral arrangement maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed In the structure of ice each oxygen atom is surrounded by a distorted tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms that form bridges to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules The bridging hydrogen atoms are not equidistant from the two oxygen atoms they connect however Instead each hydrogen atom is pm from one oxygen and pm from the other In contrast each oxygen atom is bonded to two H atoms at the shorter distance and two at the longer distance corresponding to two OH covalent bonds and two OH hydrogen bonds from adjacent water molecules respectively The resulting open cagelike structure of ice means that the solid is actually slightly less dense than the liquid which explains why ice floats on water rather than sinks Figure The HydrogenBonded Structure of Ice Each water molecule accepts two hydrogen bonds from two other water molecules and donates two hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bonds with two more water molecules producing an open cagelike structure The structure of liquid water is very similar but in the liquid the hydrogen bonds are continually broken and formed because of rapid molecular motion Hydrogen bond formation requires both a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor Because ice is less dense than liquid water rivers lakes and oceans freeze from the top down In fact the ice forms a protective surface layer that insulates the rest of the water allowing fish and other organisms to survive in the lower levels of a frozen lake or sea If ice were denser than the liquid the ice formed at the surface in cold weather would sink as fast as it formed Bodies of water would freeze from the bottom up which would be lethal for most aquatic creatures The expansion of water when freezing also explains why automobile or boat engines must be protected by antifreeze and why unprotected pipes in houses break if they are allowed to freeze Example Considering CHOH CH Xe and CHN which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Given compounds Asked for formation of hydrogen bonds and structure Strategy Identify the compounds with a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F These are likely to be able to act as hydrogen bond donors Of the compounds that can act as hydrogen bond donors identify those that also contain lone pairs of electrons which allow them to be hydrogen bond acceptors If a substance is both a hydrogen donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor draw a structure showing the hydrogen bonding Solution A Of the species listed xenon Xe ethane CH and trimethylamine CHN do not contain a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F hence they cannot act as hydrogen bond donors B The one compound that can act as a hydrogen bond donor methanol CHOH contains both a hydrogen atom attached to O making it a hydrogen bond donor and two lone pairs of electrons on O making it a hydrogen bond acceptor methanol can thus form hydrogen bonds by acting as either a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor The hydrogenbonded structure of methanol is as follows Exercise Considering CHCOH CHN NH and CHF which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Answer CHCOH and NH Although hydrogen bonds are significantly weaker than covalent bonds with typical dissociation energies of only kJmol they have a significant influence on the physical properties of a compound Compounds such as HF can form only two hydrogen bonds at a time as can on average pure liquid NH Consequently even though their molecular masses are similar to that of water their boiling points are significantly lower than the boiling point of water which forms four hydrogen bonds at a time Example Buckyballs Arrange C buckminsterfullerene which has a cage structure NaCl He Ar and NO in order of increasing boiling points Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Identify the intermolecular forces in each compound and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution Electrostatic interactions are strongest for an ionic compound so we expect NaCl to have the highest boiling point To predict the relative boiling points of the other compounds we must consider their polarity for dipoledipole interactions their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their molar mass for London dispersion forces Helium is nonpolar and by far the lightest so it should have the lowest boiling point Argon and NO have very similar molar masses and gmol respectively but NO is polar while Ar is not Consequently NO should have a higher boiling point A C molecule is nonpolar but its molar mass is gmol much greater than that of Ar or NO Because the boiling points of nonpolar substances increase rapidly with molecular mass C should boil at a higher temperature than the other nonionic substances The predicted order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses He C Ar C NO C C C NaCl C Exercise Arrange dimethylheptane Ne CS Cl and KBr in order of decreasing boiling points Answer KBr C dimethylheptane C CS C Cl C Ne C Example Identify the most significant intermolecular force in each substance CH CHOH HS Solution a Although CH bonds are polar they are only minimally polar The most significant intermolecular force for this substance would be dispersion forces b This molecule has an H atom bonded to an O atom so it will experience hydrogen bonding c Although this molecule does not experience hydrogen bonding the Lewis electron dot diagram and VSEPR indicate that it is bent so it has a permanent dipole The most significant force in this substance is dipoledipole interaction Exercise Identify the most significant intermolecular force in each substance HF HCl Answer a hydrogen bonding Answer b dipoledipole interactions More complex examples of hydrogen bonding The hydration of negative ions When an ionic substance dissolves in water water molecules cluster around the separated ions This process is called hydration Water frequently attaches to positive ions by coordinate dative covalent bonds It bonds to negative ions using hydrogen bonds If you are interested in the bonding in hydrated positive ions you could follow this link to coordinate dative covalent bonding The diagram shows the potential hydrogen bonds formed to a chloride ion Cl Although the lone pairs in the chloride ion are at the level and would not normally be active enough to form hydrogen bonds in this case they are made more attractive by the full negative charge on the chlorine Figure Hydrogen bonding between chloride ions and water However complicated the negative ion there will always be lone pairs that the hydrogen atoms from the water molecules can hydrogen bond to Hydrogen bonding in alcohols An alcohol is an organic molecule containing an OH group Any molecule which has a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen or a nitrogen is capable of hydrogen bonding Such molecules will always have higher boiling points than similarly sized molecules which dont have an OH or an NH group The hydrogen bonding makes the molecules stickier and more heat is necessary to separate them Ethanol CHCHOH and methoxymethane CHOCH are structural isomers with the same molecular formula CHO They have the same number of electrons and a similar length to the molecule The van der Waals attractions both dispersion forces and dipoledipole attractions in each will be much the same However ethanol has a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen and that oxygen still has exactly the same two lone pairs as in a water molecule Hydrogen bonding can occur between ethanol molecules although not as effectively as in water The hydrogen bonding is limited by the fact that there is only one hydrogen in each ethanol molecule with sufficient charge In methoxymethane lone pairs on the oxygen are still there but the hydrogens are not sufficiently for hydrogen bonds to form Except in some rather unusual cases the hydrogen atom has to be attached directly to the very electronegative element for hydrogen bonding to occur The boiling points of ethanol and methoxymethane show the dramatic effect that the hydrogen bonding has on the stickiness of the ethanol molecules ethanol with hydrogen bonding C methoxymethane without hydrogen bonding C The hydrogen bonding in the ethanol has lifted its boiling point about C It is important to realize that hydrogen bonding exists in addition to van der Waals attractions For example all the following molecules contain the same number of electrons and the first two are much the same length The higher boiling point of the butanol is due to the additional hydrogen bonding Comparing the two alcohols containing OH groups both boiling points are high because of the additional hydrogen bonding due to the hydrogen attached directly to the oxygen but they are not the same The boiling point of the methylpropanol isnt as high as the butanol because the branching in the molecule makes the van der Waals attractions less effective than in the longer butanol Hydrogen bonding in organic molecules containing nitrogen Hydrogen bonding also occurs in organic molecules containing NH groups in the same sort of way that it occurs in ammonia Examples range from simple molecules like CHNH methylamine to large molecules like proteins and DNA The two strands of the famous double helix in DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen on one strand and lone pairs on another nitrogen or an oxygen on the other one Donors and Acceptors In order for a hydrogen bond to occur there must be both a hydrogen donor and an acceptor present The donor in a hydrogen bond is the atom to which the hydrogen atom participating in the hydrogen bond is covalently bonded and is usually a strongly electronegative atom such as NO or F The hydrogen acceptor is the neighboring electronegative ion or molecule and must posses a lone electron pair in order to form a hydrogen bond Why does a hydrogen bond occur Since the hydrogen donor is strongly electronegative it pulls the covalently bonded electron pair closer to its nucleus and away from the hydrogen atom The hydrogen atom is then left with a partial positive charge creating a dipoledipole attraction between the hydrogen atom bonded to the donor and the lone electron pair on the accepton This results in a hydrogen bondsee Interactions Between Molecules With Permanent Dipoles Types of hydrogen bonds Hydrogen bonds can occur within one single molecule between two like molecules or between two unlike molecules Intramolecular hydrogen bonds Intramolecular hydrogen bonds are those which occur within one single molecule This occurs when two functional groups of a molecule can form hydrogen bonds with each other In order for this to happen both a hydrogen donor an acceptor must be present within one molecule and they must be within close proximity of each other in the molecule For example intramolecular hydrogen bonding occurs in ethylene glycol CHOH between its two hydroxyl groups due to the molecular geometry Intermolecular hydrogen bonds Intermolecular hydrogen bonds occur between separate molecules in a substance They can occur between any number of like or unlike molecules as long as hydrogen donors and acceptors are present an in positions in which they can interactFor example intermolecular hydrogen bonds can occur between NH molecules alone between HO molecules alone or between NH and HO molecules Properties and effects of hydrogen bonds On Boiling Point When we consider the boiling points of molecules we usually expect molecules with larger molar masses to have higher normal boiling points than molecules with smaller molar masses This without taking hydrogen bonds into account is due to greater dispersion forces see Interactions Between Nonpolar Molecules Larger molecules have more space for electron distribution and thus more possibilities for an instantaneous dipole moment However when we consider the table below we see that this is not always the case Compound Molar Mass Normal Boiling Point gmol K gmol K gmol K gmol K gmol K gmol K We see that HO HF and NH each have higher boiling points than the same compound formed between hydrogen and the next element moving down its respective group indicating that the former have greater intermolecular forces This is because HO HF and NH all exhibit hydrogen bonding whereas the others do not Furthermore has a smaller molar mass than HF but partakes in more hydrogen bonds per molecule so its boiling point is consequently higher On Viscosity The same effect that is seen on boiling point as a result of hydrogen bonding can also be observed in the viscosity of certain substances Those substances which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds tend to have a higher viscosity than those that do not Substances which have the possibility for multiple hydrogen bonds exhibit even higher viscosities Factors preventing Hydrogen bonding Electronegativity Hydrogen bonding cannot occur without significant electronegativity differences between hydrogen and the atom it is bonded to Thus we see molecules such as PH which no not partake in hydrogen bonding PH exhibits a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry like that of ammmonia but unlike NH it cannot hydrogen bond This is due to the similarity in the electronegativities of phosphorous and hydrogen Both atoms have an electronegativity of and thus no dipole moment occurs This prevents the hydrogen bonding from acquiring the partial positive charge needed to hydrogen bond with the lone electron pair in another molecule see Polarizability Atom Size The size of donors and acceptors can also effect the ability to hydrogen bond This can account for the relatively low ability of Cl to form hydrogen bonds When the radii of two atoms differ greatly or are large their nuclei cannot achieve close proximity when they interact resulting in a weak interaction Hydrogen Bonding in Nature Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in many biological processes and can account for many natural phenomena such as the Unusual properties of Water In addition to being present in water hydrogen bonding is also important in the water transport system of plants secondary and tertiary protein structure and DNA base pairing Plants The cohesionadhesion theory of transport in vascular plants uses hydrogen bonding to explain many key components of water movement through the plants xylem and other vessels Within a vessel water molecules hydrogen bond not only to each other but also to the cellulose chain which comprises the wall of plant cells This creates a sort of capillary tube which allows for capillary action to occur since the vessel is relatively small This mechanism allows plants to pull water up into their roots Furthermorehydrogen bonding can create a long chain of water molecules which can overcome the force of gravity and travel up to the high altitudes of leaves Proteins Hydrogen bonding is present abundantly in the secondary structure of proteins and also sparingly in tertiary conformation The secondary structure of a protein involves interactions mainly hydrogen bonds between neighboring polypeptide backbones which contain NitrogenHydrogen bonded pairs and oxygen atoms Since both N and O are strongly electronegative the hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen in one polypeptide backbone can hydrogen bond to the oxygen atoms in another chain and visaversa Though they are relatively weakthese bonds offer great stability to secondary protein structure because they repeat a great number of times In tertiary protein structureinteractions are primarily between functional R groups of a polypeptide chain one such interaction is called a hydrophobic interaction These interactions occur because of hydrogen bonding between water molecules around the hydrophobe and further reinforce
