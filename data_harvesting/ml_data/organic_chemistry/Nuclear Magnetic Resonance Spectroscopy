SplittingL Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance SpectroscopyReferences Nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy is extremely useful for identification and analysis of organic compounds The principle on which this form of spectroscopy is based is simple The nuclei of many kinds of atoms act like tiny magnets and tend to become aligned in a magnetic field In NMR spectroscopy we measure the energy required to change the alignment of magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field To illustrate the procedure with a simple example consider the behavior of a proton in a magnetic field There are two possible alignments of this magnetic nucleus with respect to the direction of the applied field as shown in Figure The nuclear magnets can be aligned either with the field direction or opposed to it The two orientations are not equivalent and energy is required to change the more stable alignment to the less stable alignment Figure Schematic representation of the possible alignments of a magnetic nucleus here hydrogen in an applied magnetic field Transitions between the two states constitute the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance The arrows through the nuclei represent the average component of their nuclear magnetic moment in the field direction A schematic diagram of an NMR instrument is shown in Figure When a substance such as ethanol the hydrogens of which have nuclei protons that are magnetic is placed in the transmitter coil and the magnetic field is increased gradually at certain field strengths radiofrequency energy is absorbed by the sample and the ammeter indicates an increase in the flow of current in the coil The overall result is a spectrum such as the one shown in Figure This spectrum is detailed enough to serve as a useful fingerprint for ethanol and also is simple enough that we will be able to account for the origin of each line It is the purpose of this section to explain how the complexities of spectra such as that of Figure can be interpreted in terms of chemical structure Figure Essential features of a simple NMR spectrometer For what kinds of substances can we expect nuclear magnetic resonance absorption to occur Magnetic properties always are found with nuclei of oddnumbered masses and so on as well as for nuclei of even mass but odd atomic number and so on Nuclei such as and which have even mass and atomic numbers have no magnetic properties and do not give nuclear magnetic resonance signals For various reasons routine use of NMR spectra in organic chemistry is confined to and We shall be concerned in this chapter only with NMR spectra of hydrogen and of carbon Figure Proton NMR spectrum of ethanol containing a trace of hydrochloric acid Chemical shifts are relative to tetramethylsilane that is TMS The stepped line is an integral of the areas under each of the resonance lines The kind of NMR spectroscopy we shall discuss here is limited in its applications because it can be carried out only with liquids or solutions Fortunately the allowable range of solvents is large from hydrocarbons to concentrated sulfuric acid and for most compounds it is possible to find a suitable solvent Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra may be so simple as to have only a single absorption peak but they also can be much more complex than the spectrum of Figure However it is important to recognize that no matter how complex an NMR spectrum appears to be in involves just three parameters chemical shifts spinspin splittings and kinetic reactionrate processes We shall have more to say about each of these later First let us try to establish the relationship of NMR spectroscopy to some of the other forms of spectroscopy we have already discussed in this chapter A The Relation of NMR to Other Kinds of Spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy involves transitions between possible energy levels of magnetic nuclei in an applied magnetic field see Figure The transition energies are related to the frequency of the absorbed radiation by the familiar equation An important difference between nmr and other forms of spectroscopy is that is influenced by the strength of the applied field This should not be surprising because if we are to measure the energy of changing the direction of alignment of a magnetic nucleus in a magnetic field then the stronger the field the more energy will be invloved Nuclear spin symbolized as is a quantized property that correlates with nuclear magnetism such that when is zero the nucleus has no spin and no magnetic properties Examples are and Several nuclei of particular interest to organic chemists and have spin of With there are only two magnetic energy states of the nucleus in a magnetic field These states are designated with the spin quantum numbers and The difference in energy between these states is given by or in which is Plancks constant is in hertz is a nuclear magnetic constant called the gyromagnetic ratio and is the magnetic field strength at the nucleus In general will not be exactly equal to the applied magnetic field and as we will see this difference leads to important chemical information Each kind of nucleus etc has its own value and consequently will undergo transitions at different frequencies at any particular value of This should become clearer by study of Figure Figure Fieldfrequency diagram that represents the energies in frequency units of the and magnetic states of and nuclei as a function of magnetic field The vertical scale is of frequency in megahertz cycles per sec while the horizontal scale is of magnetic field in gauss For comparison the Earths magnetic field is about gauss The dashed vertical line at gauss tells us that the resonance frequency will be and the resonance frequency will be at this field strength There are several modes of operation of an nmr spectrometer First and most common we hold constant and vary or sweep Close to energy is absorbed by the nuclei and the current flow from the transmitter increases until is exactly equal to Further increase of makes and the current flow decreases The form of the energyabsorption curve as a function of when is changed very slowly is shown in Figure a The peak is centered on the point where When is changed more rapidly transient effects are observed on the peak which are a consequence of the fact that the nuclei do not revert instantly from the to state The resulting Figure Comparison of sweep rates on nmr absorption curves a sweep b sweep c sweep The ringing in the faster sweep curves is a transient effect that has a small effect on the position of the peak and none on the integral phenomenon is called ringing and is shown in Figures b and c Evidence of ringing also will be seen on peaks of Figure An alternative method of running an nmr spectrometer is to hold the magnetic field constant and to sweep the transmitter frequency through the resonances This mode of operation is more like other forms of spectroscopy and gives the same line shapes as sweeping the field Figure What energy is associated with a nmr transition The magnitude of this energy may be calculated from the relationship between energy and wavelength frequency of the absorbed radiation Section That is and The frequency is the operating frequency of the spectrometer which we will take as or cycles and the velocity of light is Hence and This is a very small energy difference which means that only very few more of the nuclei are in the more stable state than in the less stable state The equilibrium constant for calculated from Equation for textK and neglecting possible entropy effects is B The Chemical Shift The plot of signal against magnetic field strength for ethanol in Figure shows three principal groups of lines corresponding to the three varieties of hydrogen present methyl methylene and hydroxyl Differences in the field strengths at which signals are obtained for nuclei of the same kind such as protons but located in different molecular environments are called chemical shifts Another very important point to notice about Figure is that the intensities of the three principal absorptions are in the ratio of corresponding to the ratio of the number of each kind of proton producing the signal In general areas under the peaks of a spectrum such as in Figure are proportional to the number of nuclei in the sample that give those peaks The areas can be measured by electronic integration and the integral often is displayed on the chart as it is in Figure as a stepped line increasing from left to right The height of each step corresponds to the relative number of nuclei of a particular kind Unless special precautions are taken integrals usually should not be considered accurate to better than about Why do protons in different molecular environments absorb at different field strengths The field strength at a particular nucleus is less than the strength of the external magnetic field This is because the valence electrons around a particular nucleus and around neighboring nuclei respond to the applied magnetic field so as to shield the nucleus from the applied field The way this shielding occurs is as follows First when an atom is placed in a magnetic field its electrons are forced to undergo a rotation about the field axis as shown in Figure Second Figure Induced magnetic field at the nucleus as the result of rotation of electrons about the nucleus in an applied magnetic field rotation of the electrons around the nucleus is a circulation of charge and this creates a small magnetic field at the nucleus opposite in the direction to Third the magnitude of this diamagnetic effect is directly proportional to and can be quantified as in which is the proportionality constant It is important to recognize that is not a nuclear property but depends on the chemical environment of the atom Each chemically different proton will have a different value of and hence a different chemical shift The actual field at the nucleus will be Because acts to reduce the strength of the applied field at the nucleus it is called the magnetic shielding parameter The more shielding there is the stronger the applied field must be to satisfy the resonance condition Common usage is upfield more shielding downfield less shielding and you should remember that fieldsweep spectra always are recorded with the field increasing from left to right C Chemical Shift and Stereochemistry The value of nmr spectroscopy in structure determination lies in the fact that chemically different nuclei absorb at different field strengths In later sections we will be concerned with correlating the chemical shifts with structural features However before proceeding furher it is extremely important that you be able to identify the number and kind of nonequivalent protons in a given structure and therefore the number of chemical shifts to expect This number is not always selfevident especially when subtle factors of stereochemistry intervene For this reason we suggest that you inspect structures to convince yourself that the protons labeled with different letter subscripts in any one molecule are indeed chemically different One way of checking whether two protons are in equivalent environments is to imagine that each is separately replaced with a different atom or group If the product of replacing is identical with that obtained by replacing then and are chemically equivalent If the two products are nonidentical then and are nonequivalent For example replacement of or in and by an atom would give different products Therefore and are nonequivalent in and Matters become more complicated with substances such as and Notice that represents a chiral molecule and if and each are replaced with we get and which are diastereomers see Section You can verify this with molecular models if necessary Diastereomers have different chemical and physical properties therefore and in are nonequivalent They often are called diastereotopic hydrogens What of the two methylene protons in ethanol which we have labeled as Are they identical In a sense they are not identical because if each were replaced by we would have a pair of enantiomers Therefore and sometimes are called enantiotopic hydrogens But you will recall that enantiomers are chemically indistinguishable unless they are in a chiral environment Therefore we expect shifts of enantiotopic hydrogens to be identical unless they are in a chiral environment To summarize enantiotopic protons normally will have the same chemical shifts whereas diastereotopic protons normally will have different chemical shifts We so far have ignored the relationship of chemical shifts to conformational equilibria Consider a specific example dibromoethane for which there are three staggered conformations and Each of these conformations is expected to have its own nmr spectrum The two gauche forms and are enantiomers and their spectra should be identical The hydrogens in each are trans to the bromine on the adjacent carbon while the hydrogens are cis to the same bromines see Section A Consequently the and hydrogens are nonequivalent and would be expected to have different chemical shifts In contrast all of the hydrogens of the anti conformer are equivalent and would have the same chemical shift Therefore we would expect to observe three chemical shifts arising from and for a mixture of and However the actual spectrum of dibromoethane shows only one sharp proton signal under ordinary conditions The reason is that the magnetic nuclei can absorb the exciting radiation The result is that we observe an average chemical shift which reflects the relative shifts and populations of the three conformers present If we can go to a sufficiently low temperature to make interconversion of the conformations slow on the order of times per second then we will expect to see the three different chemical shifts and with intensities corresponding to the actual populations of the conformations at the sample temperature This is one example of the effect of rate processes on nmr spectra Other examples and a more detailed account of how to relate the appearance of the signal to the rates of the exchange processes are given in Section D ChemicalShift Standards and Units Chemical shifts always are measured with reference to a standard For protons or in organic molecules the customary standard is a tetramethylsilane which gives strong sharp nmr signals in regions where only a very few other kinds of protons or carbon nuclei absorb Chemical shifts often are expressed in cycles per second relative to tetramethylsilane TMS These may seem odd units for magnetic field strength but because resonance occurs at either frequency units radians or magnetic field units gauss are appropriate Ten years ago most nmr spectrometers operated for protons with radiofrequency rf transmitters set at cycles per second but there has been a proliferation of different protonoperating frequencies and now and machines are commercially available The cost of these machines is roughly proportional to the square of the frequency and one well may wonder why there is such an exotic variety available and what this has to do with the chemical shift High operating frequencies are desirable because chemical shifts increase with spectrometer frequency and this makes the spectra simpler to interpret A fold increase in operating frequency as from to means a fold increase in at the point of resonance remember and this means also a fold increase in Thus resonances that differ because they correspond to different values will be twelve times farther apart at than at This can produce a dramatic simplification of spectra as can be seen from Figure which shows the effect of almost a factor of four in on the proton nmr spectrum of methylbutanol Figure Comparison of the proton nmr spectra of methylbutanol at rf transmitter frequencies of and The line at in the spectrum is due to the protons and this is offscale to the left in the spectrum The large single line in the center of the spectra arises from the resonances of the six methyl hydrogens The line at is TMS in each case To reiterate chemical shifts are strictly proportional to spectrometer frequency thus lines apart at will be apart at This might seem to make comparisons of nmr spectra on different spectrometers hopelessly complex but because of the proportionality of shifts to frequency or field if we divide the measured shifts in relative to the same standard for any spectrometer by the transmitter frequency in we get a set of frequencyindependent shifts in parts per million which are useful for all nmr spectrometers Nmr shifts reported in relative to TMS as zero as shown in Figure are called delta values Thus if at a proton signal comes downfield relative to tetramethylsilane it can be designated as being relative to tetramethylsilane At the line then will be downfield from tetramethylsilane Typical proton chemical shifts relative to TMS are given in Table The values quoted for each type of proton may in practice show variations of This is not unreasonable because the chemical shift of a given proton is expected to depend somewhat on the nature of the particular molecule involved and also on the solvent temperature and concentration A positive value means a shift to lower field or lower frequency with respect to TMS whereas a negative signifies a shift to higher field or higher frequency The convention is accepted widely but you often find in the literature proton shifts with reference to TMS reported as values The scale has the TMS reference at so most proton signals fall in the range of to A value can be converted to the appropriate value by subtracting it from Life with nmr spectra would be simpler if the scale would just go away E Correlations Between Structure and Chemical Shifts Protonc chemical shifts are very valuable for the determination of structures but to use the shifts in this way we must know something about the correlations that exist between chemical shift and structural environment of protons in organic compounds The most important effects arise from differences in electronegativity types of carbon bonding hydrogen bonding and chemical exchange Electronegativity Consider first the chemical shifts of protons attached to an carbon The degree of shielding of the proton by the carbon valence electrons depends on the character of the substituent atoms and groups present and particularly on their electronattracting power or electronegativity For a grouping of the type the shielding will be less as is more electron withdrawing relative to hydrogen If is electronwithdrawing the proton is deshielded For example the proton chemical shifts of the methyl halides Table show decreasing shielding hence progressively lowfield chemical shifts with increasing halogen electronegativity The effect of electronegativity on a more remote proton as in is expected to be smaller as more bonds intervene In fact the resonances of different derivatives fall in a range of not more than compared to for the proton resonances see Table Figure shows how the shift differences between the and the protons in some derivatives depend on the electronegativity of using the electronegativity defined by L Pauling see Section B The trend is not wholly linear but the proton chemicalshift differences become larger the more electronegative becomes We can predict with some confidence therefore that a molecule such as will have lowerfield chemical shifts larger for than for if is more electronegative than Table Typical Proton ChemicalShift Values in Dilute Solutions Figure Chemicalshift differences between the and protons of derivatives as a function of the Pauling electronegativity of see Section A When two electronegative groups and are bonded to the same carbon as in the protons are expected to be less shielded and come into resonance downfield of the methylenes of There is an approximate relationship see below between the shifts of the protons and the effective shielding constants of and known as Shoolerys rule Appropriate values of for use with this equation are given in Table Effects of Carbon Bond Type The shifts of the protons of alkanes and cycloalkanes fall in the range of with protons coming at the lowfield end of this range and protons coming at the highfield end see Table Alkenic hydrogens vinyl hydrogens normally are observed between toward lower fields than the shifts of protons in alkanes and cycloalkanes This means that alkenic hydrogens in an organic compound can be easily distinguished from alkane hydrogens Aromatic protons such as those in benzene have shifts at still lower fields and commonly are observed at In contrast alkynic protons of the type give resonances that are upfield of alkenic or aromatic protons and come at Another effect associated with multiple bonds is the large difference in shift between a proton which normally comes at about and aldehyde protons which are much farter downfield at Clearly the shifts of a proton depend on whether the carbon forms single double or triple bonds In a magnetic field the circulation of electrons in the orbitals of multiple bonds induced by the field Figure generates diamagnetic shielding effects in some regions of the multiple bond and paramagnetic deshielding effects in other regions Apparently protons attached to doublebonded carbons are in the deshielding zones and thus are downfield while protons attached to triplebonded carbons are in the shielding zones and are observed at rather high field Hydrogen Bonding When a proton is directly bonded to a strongly electronegative atom such as oxygen or nitrogen its chemical shift is critically dependent on the nature of the solvent temperature concentration and whether acidic or basic impurities are present The usual variations in chemical shift for such protons are so large up to for alcohols that no very useful correlations exist Hydrogen bonding is the major reason for the variable chemical shifts of and protons In general hydrogen bonding results in deshielding which causes the resonances to move downfield The extent of hydrogen bonding varies with concentration temperature and solvent and changes in the degree of hydrogen bonding can cause substantial shift changes This is very evident in the nmr spectrum of ethanol taken at different concentrations in Figure The hydroxyl resonance will be seen to move upfield by hydrogen bonding through equilibria such as Figure Proton spectra of ethanol at showing how the resonance changes in position with percent concentration in The background noise level increases at the lower concentrations because the receiver gain has been increased to maintain constant height of the resonances The changes in appearance of the resonance broad at compared to Figure a triplet at broad at the other concentrations is a consequence of slow exchange of the protons only from molecule to molecule as will be discussed in Section I There is no significant change in the relative shifts of the and lines as the concentration is changed Chemical Exchange Many and compounds are weak acids and weak bases and can undergo autoprotolysis which means that a proton can be transferred from one molecule to another Suppose we have a compound such as aminoethanol This substance normally would be expected to have an proton resonance at about and an proton resonance at about Autoprotolysis equilibria can exchange the protons between the molecules and also from one end to the other as shown below even if the equilibria are not very favorable Such equilibria can be established very rapidly especially if traces of a strong acid or a strong base are present In such circumstances a single average proton signal is observed because the excitation of a given proton from its lowerenergy magnetic state to its higherenergy magnetic state occurs while it is partly on oxygen and partly on nitrogen This is the same kind of chemical shift averaging that occurs for rapidly equilibrating conformations see Section C F Application of Chemical Shifts to Structure Determination To see how nmr and infrared spectra can be used together for structure determination we shall work through a representative example The objective is to assign a structure to the compound whose nmr spectrum is shown in Figure and whose infrared spectrum shows prominent bands at and Figure Proton nmr spectrum of a compound at relative to TMS The infrared spectrum indicates and The position of the carbonyl band suggests that it is probably an ester A carboxylic acid is ruled out because there is no sign of an stretch The nmr spectrum shows three kinds of signals corresponding to three kinds of protons The integral shows these are in the ratio of From this we can conclude that they are two different kinds of groups and a group The chemical shifts of the presumed groups are at and Because the compound contains only and the data of Table suggest that these resonances arise from groups The lowfield resonance is likely to be we know from the infrared that there probably is an ester function while the higherfield resonance is possibly an ether function If you put all of this information together you find that is the only possible structure To check whether the resonance at is consistent with the assigned structure we can calculate a shift value from Equation The agreement between the calculated and observed shifts is not perfect but is within the usual range of variation for Equation We can be satisfied that the assigned structure is correct Figure Proton nmr spectrum of a compound at relative to TMS at The stepped line is the integral running from left to right G SpinSpin Splitting What We Observe If you look at the nmr spectrum of ethanol in Figure you will see that the resonance is actually a group of four lines and the resonance is a group of three lines This threefour line pattern for the grouping also is evident in the spectrum of methylbutanol Figure and in the spectrum of ethyl iodide Figure Why do certain proton resonances appear as groups of equally spaced lines rather than single resonances The facts are that nonequivalent protons on contiguous carbons such as ethyl derivatives interact magnetically to split each others resonances This multiplicity of lines produced by the mutual interaction of magnetic nuclei is called spinspin splitting and while it complicates nmr spectra it also provides valuable structural information as we shall see An example of a complex proton spectrum is that of ethyl iodide Figure To a first approximation the two main groups of lines appear as equally spaced sets of three and four lines arising from what are called firstorder spinspin interactions Matters are further complicated by additional splitting of the threefour pattern of ethyl iodide as also can be seen in Figure This additional splitting is called secondorder splitting When there are so many lines present how do we know what we are dealing with From where to we measure the chemical shift in a complex group of lines Figure Highresolution nmr spectrum of ethyl iodide at relative to TMS The firstorder splitting pattern is seen in the wellseparated threefour line pattern for the resonances The secondorder splitting is the additional fine structure superimposed on the threefour pattern First the chemical shift normally is at the center of the group of lines corresponding to firstorder splitting In ethyl iodide the chemical shift of the methyl protons is in the center of the quartet Second the chemical shift can be recognized by the fact that it is directly proportional to the transmitter frequency If we double the chemical shifts double In contrast the firstorder spinspin splittings remain the same By this we mean that the magnitude in of the spacing between the lines of a split resonance is independent of the transmitter frequency This spacing corresponds to what is called the spinspin coupling constant or simply the coupling constant and is symbolized by and are directly proportional to the transmitter frequency of the spectrometer but the internal spacings of the split resonances are not see Figure Third the secondorder splitting tends to disappear with increasing transmitter frequency For ethyl iodide Figure the secondorder splitting at is barely discernible at and disappears at This also can be seen to occur for the threefour splitting pattern of methylbutanol as a function of Figure The next question is how can we understand and predict what spinspin splitting patterns will be observed And how do they give us structural information The important point is that the multiplicity of lines for protons of a given chemical shift often is seen to be in which is the number of protons on the contiguous carbons For example the resonance of the ethyl group of ethyl iodide is a quartet of lines because of the spinspin interaction with the neighboring three protons of the methyl group Likewise the group is a triplet of lines because of spinspin interactions with the two protons of the methylene group The spinspin splitting patterns observed for some different combinations of protons on contiguous carbons are given in Figure where and are groups that give no spin interactions with the protons The value of these patterns when observed lies in the way that they indicate the number of equivalent protons on contiguous carbons For instance a twothree line pattern where the twopart has an integrated intensity twice that of the threepart suggests the grouping Figure Schematic proton nmr spectra and are nonmagnetic nuclei For propane derivatives as at the top the ceCH_ resonances are double because of the splitting produced by the single proton on C For the ethane derivatives the right set of lines is always a triplet when observable because of the two protons of the group We assume here that the chemical shifts of the protons are independent of the number of substituents The ratios of the line intensities in the spinspin splitting patterns of Figure usually follow simple rules A doublet appears as two lines of equal intensity a triplet as three lines in the ratio a quartet as four lines in the ratio a quintet as and so on The intensities follow the binomial coefficients for where is the number of protons in the splitting group Thus when we have or The spectrum of Figure provides an excellent example of how nmr shows the presence of contiguous protons The symmetrical doublet and quartet are typical of the interaction between a single proton and an adjacent group of three that is The methyl protons of the groups are too far from the others to give demonstrable spinspin splitting thus they appear as a single sixproton resonance Figure Proton nmr spectrum of dimethoxyethane dimethyl acetal at relative to TMS In general the magnitude of the spinspin splitting effect of one proton on another proton or group of equivalent protons depends on the number and kind of intervening chemical bonds and on the spatial relationships between the groups For simple systems without double bonds and with normal bond angles we usually find for nonequivalent protons ie having different chemical shifts Where restricted rotation or double and triplebonded groups are involved widely divergent splittings are observed For double bonds the twobond couplings between two nonequivalent hydrogens located on one end are characteristically small while the threebond couplings in are larger especially for the trans configuration Coupling through four or more bonds is significant for compounds with double or triple bonds Examples of these socalled longrange couplings and some other useful splitting values follow Finally chemically equivalent protons do not split each others resonances H ProtonProton Splittings and Conformational Analysis A very important characteristic of threebond protonproton couplings is the way that they depend on the conformation at the bond Typical values for several particular conformations are For protons in groups such as ethyl groups in which rotation is rapid and the favored conformations are staggered but none of the staggered conformations is preferred over the others average protonproton splittings are observed The average for splittings is about which corresponds to I ProtonProton Splittings and Chemical Exchange You may have wondered why the hydroxyl proton of ethanol produces a single resonance in the spectrum of Figure It is quite reasonable to expect that the hydroxyl proton would be split by the neighboring methylene protons because they are only three bonds apart however this coupling will not be observed if the hydroxyl protons are exchanging rapidly between the ethanol molecules Section E When proton exchange is rapid the spin interactions between the and protons average to zero At intermediate exchange rates the coupling manifests itself through line broadening or by actually giving multiple lines If you look at the several spectra of ethanol in Figure you will notice how the shape of the resonance varies from a broad singlet to a distinct triplet Rapid chemical exchange of magnetic nuclei is not the only way that spincoupling interactions can be averaged to zero The same effect can be achieved by a technique known as double resonance To understand how this is done consider two coupled protons and having different chemical shifts Suppose that is selectively irradiated at its resonance frequency while at the same time we observe the resonance signal of The coupling between and disappears and shows a single resonance Why is this so By irradiation of the nuclei are changed from the state to and back again sufficiently rapidly that the neighboring nucleus effectively sees neither one state nor the other The magnetic interaction between the states therefore averages to zero This decoupling of magnetic nuclei by double resonance techniques is especially important in NMR spectroscopy Section L but also is used to simplify proton spectra by selectively removing particular couplings J Use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Organic Structural Analysis The solution of a typical structural analysis problem by nmr methods utilizes at least four kinds of information obtained directly from the spectrum They are chemical shifts line intensities signal areas spinspin splitting patterns line mulitplicities and coupling constants We already have shown how chemical shifts are used in the absence of spinspin splitting We now will illustrate how more complex spectra may be analyzed Figure shows the proton nmr spectrum for a compound of formula There are three principal groups of lines at and Look at the multiplicity of these groups before reading further Figure Nmr spectrum and integral for a compound of formula at relative to TMS There are several ways to approach a problem such as this but probably the easiest is to start with the integral The relative heights of the stepped integral for the principal groups of lines can be obtained by a pair of dividers with a ruler or with horizontal lines as in Figure The integral suggests that one hydrogen is responsible for the resonance at two hydrogens at and three at Three hydrogens in a single group suggest a group and because there is a threefour splitting pattern it is reasonable to postulate Subtracting from the given formula leaves which with normal valences has to be The spectrum thus appears to be consistent with the structure propanal as judged from the molecular formula and the spinspin splitting pattern which indicates the grouping To be sure of the structure we should check it against all of the available information First from the shifts Table we see that the single proton at fits almost perfectly for the twoproton resonance at is consistent with that reported for while the threeproton line at checks with for What about the couplings The threefour pattern has a spacing of slightly over which is just right for an ethyl group compare Figures and The doubling up almost obscured by secondorder splitting of the resonance and the splitting of the resonance into a triplet indicate about a coupling for the group Threebond couplings between and adjacent protons appear to be generally smaller than couplings We usually would not rely on nmr alone in a structureanalysis problem of this kind but would seek clues or corroboration from the infrared electronic or other spectra as well as chemical tests In later chapters we will have many problems that will be facilitated by the use of both nmr and infrared spectra A further worked example will illustrate the approach A compound has the composition and gives the infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra shown in Figure The problem is how to use this information to deduce the structure of the compound The molecular formula tells us the number and kind of atoms and the number of multiple bonds or rings The formulas of the corresponding hydrocarbon without the bromine would be or four hydrogens less than the saturated alkane This means there must be two double bonds or the equivalent one triple bond or one ring and one double bond Because from the formula we suspect unsaturation we should check this out with the infrared spectrum There is a band at which is indicative of an unsymmetrically substituted group Table The strong sharp band at further tells us that the substance is a alkyne Figure Infrared and nmr spectra for a compound of formula The infrared spectrum here is different from others shown in this book in being linear in wavelength instead of in wave numbers The units of wavelength here are microns The proton nmr spectrum shows that there are only two principal groups of lines a twoproton doublet at and a oneproton triplet at The twothree splitting pattern combined with the proton ratio suggests a group coupled with a group The structure must be a bromopropyne To confirm the assignment the chemical shifts should be checked Table The at agrees well with the tabulated value of There is no tabulated data for but the observed shift at is at slightly lower fields than the tabulated for This is expected because of the triple bond The correlation of Equation predicts a value of Very often a proton will be spincoupled to two or more different protons and the couplings are not necessarily the same When this happens the resulting spectrum can be quite complex as our next example shows A compound gives the nmr spectrum of Figure There are clearly four kinds of protons in the molecule at and Although the integral is not shown the main groups of lines have intensities from the lowfield to highfield in the ratio of Figure Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of at The calibrations are relative to the protons of TMS The insets show the peaks centered on and with an expanded scale The spacing between the peaks is for Group B at and for Groups A and C at and The protons are coupled to each other not to A B or C The fiveproton signal at is typical of a phenyl group and the oneproton signals at and are in the region for alkenic protons The threeproton signal at is typical of a methyl group on a carboncarbon double bond There are only three ways to put together a phenyl ring and two protons such that they add up to They are We can distinguish between these three possible structures on the basis of the splitting patterns observed and expected from the coupling of the alkenic and methyl protons The observed splittings are shown in expanded form inset in Figure and the three mutually coupled groups are labeled as A B and C Coupling between A and B designated by the constant should give four lines two for A and two for B as shown in Figure Because A and B also are coupled to the three hydrogens of the methyl group C each of the four lines corresponding to will be further split into quartets If then the spacing of the lines in the two sets of quartets will not be the same Figure Spinspin splitting patterns predicted for the nmr signals of the two alkenic protons A and B of a methylsubstituted alkene of the type where According to the foregoing analysis the maximum number of lines observable for the A and B resonances is sixteen for A and for B In fact only eleven are visible for A and for B which means that some of the sixteen possible lines must overlap Without examining all possibilities we can see that the actual situation can be reproduced if The only structure that is consistent with is or phenylpropene the other possibilities are excluded because should be about for and for K ChemicalShift Effects on SpinSpin Splitting The simple rule for predicting the multiplicity of spincoupled proton signals often breaks down whenever the chemicalshift difference between the protons in different groups becomes comparable to coupling constants for magnetic interaction between the groups Under these circumstances you may expect to see more lines or lines in different positions with different intensities than predicted from the simple firstorder treatment One example is the effect of changing chemical shift on a twoproton spectrum with Figure We see in Figure that even when the shift is times larger than the coupling the outside lines are weaker than the inside lines This general kind of asymmetry of line intensities also is apparent in the spectrum of ethyl iodide Figure in which the lines of each group are more like and rather than the and ratios predicted from the firstorder treatment The asymmetry is such that two groups of lines that are connected by spinspin splitting in effect point to one another the lines on the inside of the pattern are stronger than predicted from the firstorder treatment whereas those on the outside are weaker The effect can be put to practical use as illustrated in the following exercise Figure Representation of the changes in line positions and intensities for a twoproton system with a coupling constant of and the indicated chemicalshift differences Only a single sharp line is observed if the shift difference is zero To explain the effect of chemical shifts on secondorder splitting is beyond the scope of this book In fact we havent really explained firstorder splitting although more on this topic will be found in Section But regardless of how many lines appear in a complex nmr spectrum they can be rationalized in terms of the chemical shifts coupling constants and exchange effects Furthermore the overall signal intensities remain proportional to the number of protons giving rise to the signals When there are many hydrogens and small chemicalshift differences as in alkanes the proton nmr spectra may have so many closely spaced resonance lines that they merge together to give a series of smooth moreorless featureless peaks The proton spectrum of octane Figure a is an excellent example of this type of spectrum Useful information often can be obtained from such spectra as to the ratio of by investigation of the integrals over the range of alkane proton absorptions Figure illustrates how this can be done for octane and trimethylpentane Figure Proton nmr spectra of a octane and b trimethylpentane at relative to TMS as standard The upper left curve of b represents the spectrum from at increased sensitivity to show the details of the absorption Notice that the ratio of to usually can be determined from the integrals centered on and and will be for an unbranched alkane with carbons For octane a the integral ratio is or L Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy In recent years nmr spectroscopy using of natural abundance has become an important tool for organic structural analysis That this did not happen sooner is because has a much smaller magnetic moment than and the small moment combined with the small natural abundance means that is harder to detect in the nmr than by a factor of This is a large difference and can be put in the proper context in the following way Suppose two people are talking in a noisy room and one is trying to hear the other The common request is talk louder If this is not possible then the request is say it again or talk more slowly Either of the latter requests amounts to an integration of signal versus noise and takes time Improvement in signaltonoise for a given communication is achieved as the square root of the time of communication On the crucial time basis nmr signals require times more time to get the same signaltonoise ratio as in nmr for the same number of nuclei per unit volume This is a problem Electronic improvements and use of communication theory with emphasis on the sayitagain technique have provided the means for obtaining routine spectra for even fairly dilute solutions of quite complex molecules Some of the same kinds of structural effects are important for chemical shifts as for proton chemical shifts Section E For example there is a similar parallel between shift differences in compounds of the type and electronegativity Figure as between the corresponding proton shifts and electronegativity Figure It is important to notice that shifts in units are much larger than those of protons This is because carbon uses orbitals in forming bonds whereas hydrogen uses orbitals We therefore will expect to find the the nuclei of other elements that use orbitals in bonding such as and also will have larger shifts than for protons as indeed they do Figure Carbon chemical shift differences for C and C of derivatives as a function of Pauling electronegativity The methyl carbons of derivatives are downfield from the of TMS A structural application of nmr which shows its power in an area where nmr is indecisive is shown in Figure Here we see the highfield resonances of a substance known variously as Coumadin or the sodium salt of warfarin which is used widely as a blood anticoagulant in the treatment of diseases such as phlebitis It also has substantial utility as a rat poison because of its anticoagulant action The spectra of Figure show no splittings of the resonances by the hydrogens directly attached to the carbons even though such splittings normally are quite large The reason is that while the spectra were taken protons were simultaneously subjected to strong irradiation at their resonance frequency which as far as spinspin splitting goes causes them to act as nonmagnetic nuclei such as and This doubleresonance technique for removing the splittings is called proton decoupling see Section I Figure Protondecoupled nmr spectrum at of the upfield region of a the sodium salt of warfarin showing on the right side the resonances of C C and C This part of the spectrum can be compared with the more complete spectrum b of warfarin itself and The gaggle of evenly spaced sharp peaks toward the center of the spectrum arises from the solvent There is no indication of any abnormality in the chemical shifts of carbons and shown in Figure a Furthermore there is a downfield resonance from the carbons of TMS not shown in Figure a which is typical of a carbon corresponding to C When is treated with acid we expect the product warfarin of structure to be formed which should have a spectrum much like that shown in Figure a In fact the nmr spectrum of the product Figure b is much more complex The C C and C resonances of Figure a now come in unequal pairs Futhermore the carbon resonance of has disappeared and two new lines are observed at and farther upfield The data indicate clearly that warfarin is not in solution but is a mixture of two diastereomers and called cyclic hemiketals resulting from addition of the group of to the bond This is one example of the power of nmr to solve subtle structural problems Although the principal isotopes of and have magnetic properties because of the special character of all of these isotopes they act in organic compounds as though they were nonmagnetic Resonance in the sense used here means that the radiofrequency absorption takes place at specified resonance frequencies However you will see that almost all of the forms of spectroscopy we discuss in this book involve resonance absorption in the same sense Here is in per gauss physicists usually define in radians per second per gauss From the Greek prefix dia meaning through across The opposite of diamagnetic is paramagnetic para meaning alongside We shall use this term later In addition to giving better separation of the lines and clearer spectra going to higher fields also has the beneficial effect of increasing the proportions of the nuclei in the state thereby giving more intense easiertodetect resonances Many other protonshift values are available in NMR Spectra Catalog Volume and Varian Associates Palo Alto Calif If two rings were present this also would give four hydrogens less than the alkane However two rings are not possible with only three carbons References John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following
