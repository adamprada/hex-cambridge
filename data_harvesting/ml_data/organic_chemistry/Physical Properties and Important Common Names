Common namesPhysical Properties of Selected AlkenesPolarity and Physical PropertiesContributors Learning Objectives memorize the common names for vinylic and allylic groups including isoprene and styrene predict the relative physical properties of alkenes Common names The carbon atoms sharing the double bond can be referred to as the vinyl carbons The carbon atoms adjacent to the vinyl carbon atoms are called allylic carbons These carbon atoms have unique reactivity because of the potential for interaction with the pi bond Overall common names remove the ane suffix and add ylene There are a couple of unique ones like ethenyls common name is vinyl and propenyls common name is allyl that need to be memorized vinyl substituent HCCH allyl substituent HCCHCH allene molecule HCCCH isoprene is shown below Physical Properties of Selected Alkenes Some representative alkenestheir names structures and physical propertiesare given in the table below Physical Properties of Some Selected Alkenes IUPAC Name Molecular Formula Condensed Structural Formula Melting Point C Boiling Point C ethene CH CHCH propene CH CHCHCH butene CH CHCHCHCH pentene CH CHCHCHCH hexene CH CHCHCHCH heptene CH CHCHCHCH octene CH CHCHCHCH Polarity and Physical Properties Alkenes are nonpolar hydrocarbons The dominant intermolecular forces shared by alkenes are the London dispersion forces These interactions are weak and temporary so they are easily disrupted Physical States The physical states reflect the weak attractive forces between molecules Ethene propene and butene exist as colorless gases Alkenes with to carbons are liquids and alkenes with carbons or more are solids Density Alkenes are less dense than water with most densities in the range of to gmL Alkenes float on top of water Solubility Alkenes are virtually insoluble in water but dissolve in organic solvents The reasons for this are exactly the same as for the alkanes Boiling Points The boiling point of each alkene is very similar to that of the alkane with the same number of carbon atoms Boiling points of alkenes depend on more molecular mass chain length The more intermolecular mass is added the higher the boiling point Intermolecular forces of alkenes gets stronger with increase in the size of the molecules In each case the alkene has a boiling point which is a small number of degrees lower than the corresponding alkane The only attractions involved are Van der Waals dispersion forces and these depend on the shape of the molecule and the number of electrons it contains Compound Boiling points oC Ethene Propene TransButene Cisbutene Trans dichlorobutene Cis dichlorobutene Pentene TransPentene CisPentene Heptene Octene Nonene Decene Melting Points Melting points of alkenes depends on the packaging of the molecules so the stereochemistry of the carboncarbon double bond has a strong influence on the relative melting points Alkenes have similar melting points to that of alkanes however in cis isomers molecules are package in a Ubending shape therefore will display a lower melting points to that of the trans isomers This effect is notable when comparing the melting points of fats and oils The differences in the melting points is strongly influenced by the long hydrocarbon tails Oils have a greater number of cis double bonds and exist as liquids at room temperature Whereas fats are primarily saturated and exist as solids at room temperature Compound Melting Points C Ethene Propene Butene Pentene TransPentene CisPentene Heptene Octene Nonene Decene Exercise Draw the bondline structures for the following compounds in order of increasing boiling point methylpentene hexene isoprene heptene Which phase will contain the most octene a water or hexane b water or benzene c methanol or octanol Answer relative boiling points a hexane Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic and lipophilic b benzene Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic and lipophilic c octanol Hydrocarbons seek the solvent with the most carbons and fewest polar groups Contributors Trung Nguyen Jim Clark Chemguidecouk Layne A Morsch University of Illinois Springfield
