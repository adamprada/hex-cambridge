Alkyl Halide Structure and Reaction LanguageThe Reactions Nucleophilic Substitution and EliminationWhat decides whether you get substitution or eliminationContributors and Attributions Learning Objective apply the alpha and beta labels to alkyl halides for substitution and elimination reactions refer to section Alkyl Halide Structure and Reaction Language The carbon bonded to a halide is called the alphacarbon The carbons bonded to the alphacarbon are called betacarbons Carbon atoms further removed from the alpha carbon are named by continuing the Greek alphabet alpha beta gamma delta etc In discussing the reactions of alkyl halides it can be effective to use the alpha and beta labels The structure for bromopropane is used below to illustrate the application of these terms The Reactions Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination Alkyl halides can undergo two major types of reactions substitution andor elimination The substitution reaction is called a Nucleophilic Substitution reaction because the electrophilic alkyl halide forms a new bond with the nucleophile which substitutes for replaces the halogen at the alphacarbon Because carbon can only form four bonds the halogen must leave and is called the Leaving Group Alkyl halides are excellent electrophiles because halogens share a polar bond with carbon are polarizable and form relatively stable leaving groups as halide anions In the example below bromopropane is converted into propanol in a substitution reaction Allkyl halides can also undergo elimination reactions in the presence of strong bases The elimination of a betahydrogen hydrogen on a carbon vicinal to the alkyl halide carbon and the halide produces a carboncarbon double bond to form an alkene In the example below bromopropane has undergone an elimination reaction to give an alkene propene What decides whether you get substitution or elimination In the examples above the reagents were the same for both substitution and elimination the halogenoalkane and either sodium or potassium hydroxide solution In all cases you will get a mixture of both reactions happening some substitution and some elimination The product distribution depends on a number of factors These factors will be explored in the remaining sections of this chapter Depending on the structure of the alkyl halide reagent type reaction conditions some reactions will only undergo only one pathway substitution or elimination While other alkyl halides will always produce a mixture of substitution and elimination products like the example above The goal of efficient multiplestep synthetic pathways is to maximize the formation of a single product during each step The reaction conditions explored in this chapter will be useful for future reactions we will study and learn Exercise Classify the following reactions as Substitutions or Eliminations Answer a substitution b elimination c elimination d substitution Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Jim Clark Chemguidecouk
