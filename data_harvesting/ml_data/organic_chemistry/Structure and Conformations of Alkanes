Ethane ConformationsFree Rotations Do Not Exist in Ethane Learning Objective interpret and draw the rotation about a carboncarbon single bond using Newman projections and sawhorse structures correlate energies of conformations with rotational energy diagrams Single Bond Rotation and Conformational Isomerism Conformational isomerism involves rotation about sigma bonds and does not involve any differences in the connectivity or geometry of bonding Two or more structures that are categorized as conformational isomers or conformers are really just two of the exact same molecule that differ only in terms of the angle about one or more sigma bonds The carboncarbon single bonds of alkanes rotate freely Conformers are the same molecule shown with different sigma bond rotations Newman projections are one way to communicate bond rotation Ethane Conformations Although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical Rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations In order to better visualize these different conformations it is convenient to use a drawing convention called the Newman projection In a Newman projection we look lengthwise down a specific bond of interest in this case the carboncarbon bond in ethane When there are multiple carbonsthen we specify the bond of interest using the carbon numbers from the IUPAC name We depict the front atom as a dot and the back atom as a larger circle The six carbonhydrogen bonds are shown as solid lines protruding from the two carbons at angles which is what the actual tetrahedral geometry looks like when viewed from this perspective and flattened into two dimensions The lowest energy conformation of ethane shown in the figure above is called the staggered or anti conformation in which all of the CH bonds on the front carbon are positioned at dihedral angles of relative to the CH bonds on the back carbon In this conformation the distance between the bonds and the electrons in them is maximized If we now rotate the front CH group clockwise the molecule is in the highest energy eclipsed conformation where the hydrogens on the front carbon are as close as possible to the hydrogens on the back carbon This is the highest energy conformation because of unfavorable interactions between the electrons in the front and back CH bonds The energy of the eclipsed conformation is approximately kcalmol higher than that of the staggered conformation Another rotation returns the molecule to a second eclipsed conformation This process can be continued all around the circle with three possible eclipsed conformations and three staggered conformations in addition to an infinite number of variations in between The carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate there is indeed a small kcalmol barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another This rotational barrier is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at extremely cold temperatures However at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other state Free Rotations Do Not Exist in Ethane The carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate there is indeed a small kcalmol barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another This rotational barrier is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at extremely cold temperatures However at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other state The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds as shown below The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds Although the conformers of ethane are in rapid equilibrium with each other the kcalmol energy difference leads to a substantial preponderance of staggered conformers at any given time The animation below illustrates the relationship between ethanes potential energy and its dihedral angle Figure X Animation of potential energy vs dihedral angle in ethane Exercise Draw the Newman projections for the staggered and eclipsed conformers of propane along the CC axis Answer
