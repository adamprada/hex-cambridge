Contributors and Attributions Organic chemistry originally was defined as the chemistry of those substances formed by living matter and for quite a while there was a firm belief that it would never be possible to prepare organic compounds in the laboratory outside of a living system However after the discovery by Wohler in that a supposedly typical organic compound urea could be prepared by heating an inorganic salt ammonium cyanate this definition gradually lost significance and organic chemistry now is broadly defined as the chemistry of carboncontaining compounds Nonetheless the designation organic is still very pertinent because the chemistry of organic compounds is also the chemistry of living organisms Each of us and every other living organism is comprised of and endlessly manufactures organic compounds Further all organisms consume organic compounds as raw materials except for those plants that use photosynthesis or related processes to synthesize their own from carbon dioxide To understand every important aspect of this chemistry be it the details of photosynthesis digestion reproduction muscle action memory or even the thought process itself is a primary goal of science and it should be recognized that only through application of organic chemistry will this goal be achieved Modern civilization consumes vast quantities of organic compounds Coal petroleum and natural gas are primary sources of carbon compounds for use in production of energy and as starting materials for the preparation of plastics synthetic fibers dyes agricultural chemicals pesticides fertilizers detergents rubbers and other elastomers paints and other surface coatings medicines and drugs perfumes and flavors antioxidants and other preservatives as well as asphalts lubricants and solvents that are derived from petroleum Much has been done and you soon may infer from the breadth of the material that we will cover that most everything worth doing already has been done However many unsolved scientific problems remain and others have not even been thought of but in addition there are many technical and social problems to which answers are badly needed Some of these include problems of pollution of the environment energy sources overpopulation and food production insect control medicine drug action and improved utilization of natural resources Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
