Kinetic Isotope EffectsPrimary KIEs Contributors and Attributions Learning Objective explain how the kinetic isotope effect KIE can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms Kinetic Isotope Effects Kinetic Isotope Effects KIEs are used to determine reaction mechanisms by determining rate limiting steps and transition states and are commonly measured using NMR to detect isotope location or GCMS to detect mass changes In a KIE experiment an atom is replaced by its isotope and the change in rate of the reaction is observed A very common isotope substitution is when hydrogen is replaced by deuterium This is known as a deuterium effect and is expressed by the ratio kHkD as explained above Normal KIEs for the deuterium effect are around to or Large effects are seen because the percentage mass change between hydrogen and deuterium is great Heavy atom isotope effects involve the substitution of carbon oxygen nitrogen sulfur and bromine with effects that are much smaller and are usually between and The difference in KIE magnitude is directly related to the percentage change in mass Large effects are seen when hydrogen is replaced with deuterium because the percentage mass change is very large mass is being doubled while smaller percent mass changes are present when an atom like sulfur is replaced with its isotope increased by two mass units Primary KIEs Primary kinetic isotope effects are rate changes due to isotopic substitution at a site of bond breaking in the rate determining step of a reaction Example Consider the bromination of acetone kinetic studies have been performed that show the rate of this reaction is independent of the concentration of bromine To determine the rate determining step and mechanism of this reaction the substitution of a deuterium for a hydrogen can be made When hydrogen was replaced with deuterium in this reaction a of was found Therefore the rate determining step is the tautomerization of acetone and involves the breaking of a CH bond Since the breaking of a CH bond is involved a substantial isotope effect is expected Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
