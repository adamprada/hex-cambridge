References The most straightforward way to determine the structures of molecules would be to see how the nuclei are arranged and how the electrons are distributed This is not possible with visible light because the wavelengths of visible light are very much longer than the usual molecular dimensions A beam of electrons can have the requisite short wavelengths but small organic molecules are destroyed rapidly by irradiation with electrons of the proper wavelengths Nonetheless electron microscopy is a valuable technique for the study of large molecules such as DNA which can be stained with heavymetal atoms before viewing or are themselves reasonably stable to an electron beam Figures and Figure Electron micrograph x of two linked catenated cyclic mitochondrial DNA molecules from a culture of human cells The DNA was stained with uranyl acetate then shadowed with platinum and palladium atoms in high vacuum to make the molecules easily visible in the electron microscope Photograph

diffraction for determination of the structures of molecules in crystals is of particular value and in the past ten years this technique has become almost routine Figure shows the detailed arrangement of the carbons hydrogens and bromines in bisbromomethylnaphthalene as determined by xray diffraction The apparatus and techniques used are highly complex and are not available yet to very many organic laboratories Other diffraction methods include electron diffraction which may be used todetermine the structures of gases or of volatile liquid substances that cannot be obtained as crystals suitable for xray diffraction and neutron diffraction which has special application for crystals in which the exact location of hydrogens is desired Hydrogen does not have sufficient scattering power for x rays to be located precisely by xray diffraction Figure Bond lengths angles and arrangement of carbons and bromines in a crystal of bisbromomethylnaphthalene as determined by xray diffraction Notice that the preferred conformation in the crystal has the bromines on opposite sides of the naphthalene ring The diffraction methods can be used to determine complete structures of organic molecules but they are not sufficiently routine to be utilized generally in practical organic laboratory work For this reason in the remainder of this chapter we will emphasize those forms of spectroscopy that are generally available for routine laboratory use As will be seen these methods are used by organic chemists in more or less empirical ways In general spectroscopic methods depend on some form of excitation of molecules by absorption of electromagnetic radiation and as we have said virtually all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have utility in this regard The commonly used span of the electromagnetic spectrum is shown in Figure along with a comparison of the various units that are employed to express energy or wavelength The major kinds of spectroscopy used for structural analysis of organic compounds are listed in Table The range of frequencies of the absorbed radiation are shown as well as the effect produced by the radiation and specific kind of information that is utilized in structural analysis After a brief account of the principles of spectroscopy we will describe the methods that are of greatest utility to practical laboratory work Nonetheless it is very important to be aware of the other less routine methods that can be used to solve special problems and some of these are discussed in this chapter and in Chapters and You may have problems with the relationships among the variety of wavelength and frequency units commonly used in spectroscopy The relationship between wavelength frequency and velocity should become clear to you by considering yourself standing on a pier watching ocean waves going by Assuming the waves are uniformly spaced there will be a uniform distance between the crests which is the wavelength The wave crests will pass by at a certain number per minute which is the frequency The velocity at which the crests move by you is related to and by the relationship This is not really very complicated and it applies equally well to water waves or electromagnetic radiation What is almost needlessly complicated is the variety of units commonly used to express and for electromagnetic radiation One problem is tradition the other is the desire to avoid very large or very small numbers Thus as Figure shows we may be interested in electromagnetic wavelengths that differ by as much as a factor of Because the velocity of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum is constant at the frequencies will differ by the same factor Figure The span of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation used in spectroscopic investigations of organic compounds along with comparison of some of the various units commonly employed for wavelength and energy of the radiation on log scales Units commonly used for wavelength are meters centimeters nanometers and microns In the past angstroms and millimicrons also were used rather widely Frequency units are in cycles per second cps or hertz which are equivalent radians per second are used widely by physicists Table Principal Spectroscopic Techniques Currently in Use for Analysis of Molecular Structure Frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum can be seen from Figure generally to be large As a result it is common to use wave numbers instead of or megahertz The frequency in wave number is simply the frequency in divided by the velocity of light in Wavenumber units are and we can think of the wave number as being the number of wave crests per centimeter A useful description of how molecular structures can be determined by xray vision is given in Chapter XI of Organic
