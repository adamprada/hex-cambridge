on the result of another trial we may still be able to use the laws of probability However to do so we must know the nature of the interdependence If the activity associated with event C precedes the activity associated with event D the probability of D may depend on whether C occurs Suppose that the first activity is tossing a coin and that the second activity is drawing a card from a deck however the deck we use depends on whether the coin comes up heads or tails If the coin is heads we draw a card from an ordinary deck if the coin is tails we draw a coin from a deck with the face cards removed Now we ask about the probability of drawing an ace If the coin is heads the probability of drawing an ace is If the coin is tails the probability of drawing an ace is The combination coin is heads and card is ace has probability The combination coin is tails and card is ace has probability In this case the probability of drawing an ace depends on the modification we make to the deck based on the outcome of the coin toss Applying the laws of probability is straightforward An example that illustrates the application of these laws in a transparent way is provided by villages First Second Third and Fourth which are separated by rivers See Figure Bridges and span the river between First and Second Bridges and span the river between Second and Third Bridges and span the river between Third and Fourth A traveler from First to Fourth who is free to take any route he pleases has a choice from among possible combinations Let us consider the probabilities associated with various events There are possible routes If a traveler chooses his route at random the probability that he will take any particular route is This illustrates our assumption that each event in a set of exhaustive and mutually exclusive events occurs with probability If he chooses a route at random the probability that he goes from First to Second by either bridge or bridge is This illustrates the calculation of the probability of alternative events The probability of the particular route is and we calculate the same probability for any other route from First to Fourth This illustrates the calculation of the probability of a compound event If he crosses bridge the probability that his route will be is zero of course The probability of an event that has already occurred is and the probability of any alternative is zero If he crosses bridge and Given that a traveler has used bridge the probability of the route becomes the probability of path which is Since the probability of the compound event is the probability of the compound event The outcomes of rolling dice rolling provide more illustrations If we roll two dice we can classify the possible outcomes according to the sums of the outcomes for the individual dice There are thirtysix possible outcomes They are displayed in Table Table Outcomes from tossing two dice Outcome for first die Outcome for second die Let us consider the probabilities associated with various dicethrowing events The probability of any given outcome say the first die shows and the second die shows is Since the probability that the first die shows while the second die shows is also the probability that one die shows and the other shows is Four different outcomes correspond to the event that the score is Therefore the probability of rolling is The probability of rolling a score of three or less is the probability of rolling plus the probability of rolling which is Suppose we roll the dice one at a time and that the first die shows The probability of rolling when the second die is thrown is now because only rolling a can make the score and there is a probability of that a will come up when the second die is thrown Suppose the first die is red and the second die is green The probability that the red die comes up and the green die comes up is Above we looked at the number of outcomes associated with a score of to find that the probability of this event is We can use another argument to get this result The probability that two dice roll a score of three is equal to the probability that the first die shows or times the probability that the second die shows whatever score is necessary to make the total equal to three This is Application of the laws of probability is frequently made easier by recognizing a simple restatement of the requirement that events be mutually exclusive In a given trial either an event occurs or it does not Let the probability that an event A occurs be Let the probability that event A does not occur be Since in any given trial the outcome must belong either to event A or to event we have For example if the probability of success in a single trial is the probability of failure is If we consider the outcomes of two successive trials we can group them into four events Event SS First trial is a success second trial is a success Event SF First trial is a success second trial is a failure Event FS First trial is a failure second trial is a success Event FF First trial is a failure second trial is a failure Using the laws of probability we have where and are the probability of event in the first and second trials respectively This situation can be mapped onto a simple diagram We represent the possible outcomes of the first trial by line segments on one side of a unit square We represent the outcomes of the second trial by line segments along an adjoining side of the unit square The four possible events are now represented by the areas of four mutually exclusive and exhaustive portions of the unit square as shown in Figure Figure Success and failure in successive trials
