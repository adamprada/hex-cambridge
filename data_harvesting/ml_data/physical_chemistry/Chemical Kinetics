Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers Chemical kinetics is the study of how fast chemical reactions occur In Chapter we see that there is a unique way to specify what we mean by how fast We call this specification the reaction rate Chemical kinetics is the study of the factors that determine the rate of a particular reaction There are many such factors among them temperature pressure concentrations of the reactants and products nature and concentrations of spectator species like a solvent or dissolved salts isotopic substitution presence or absence of a catalyst We will look briefly at all of these but the thrust of our development will be to understand how the rate of a reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactions reactants and products Many reactions that we observe actually occur as a sequence of more simple reactions Such a sequence of simple reaction steps is called a reaction mechanism Our principal goal is to understand the relationships among concentrations reaction rates reaction mechanisms and the conditions that must be satisfied when a particular reaction reaches equilibrium We will find that two related ideas characterize equilibrium from a reactionrate perspective One is that concentrations no longer change with time The other is a fundamental postulate called the principle of microscopic reversibility about the relative rates of individual steps in an overall chemical reaction mechanism when the reacting system is at equilibrium
