behave like point masses that do not interact with one another The pressure of the gas results from collisions of the gas molecules with the walls of the container The contribution of one collision to the force on the wall is equal to the change in the molecules momentum divided by the time between collisions The magnitude of this force depends on the molecules speed and the angle at which it strikes the wall Each such collision makes a contribution to the pressure that is equal to the force divided by the area of the wall To find the pressure from this model it is necessary to average over all possible molecular speeds and all possible collision angles In Chapter we derive Boyles law in this way We can do a simplified derivation by making a number of assumptions We assume that all of the molecules in a sample of gas have the same speed Let us call it As sketched in Figure we assume that the container is a cubic box whose edge length is If we consider all of the collisions between molecules and walls it is clear that each wall will experience of the collisions or each pair of opposing walls will experience of the collisions Instead of averaging over all of the possible angles at which a molecule could strike a wall and all of the possible times between collisions we assume that the molecules travel at constant speed back and forth between opposite faces of the box Since they are point masses they never collide with one another If we suppose that of the molecules go back and forth between each pair of opposite walls we can expect to accomplish the same kind of averaging in setting up our artificial model that we achieve by averaging over the real distribution of angles and speeds In fact this turns out to be the case the derivation below gets the same result as the rigorous treatment we develop in Chapter Figure Simplified model for velocities of gas molecules in a cubic box Since each molecule goes back and forth between opposite walls it collides with each wall once during each round trip At each collision the molecules speed remains constant but its direction changes by that is the molecules velocity changes from to Letting be the time required for a round trip the distance traversed in a round trip is The magnitude of the momentum change for a molecule in one collision is The magnitude of the force on the wall from one collision is and the pressure contribution from one collision on the wall of area is so that we have from the collision of one molecule with one wall If the number of molecules in the box is of them make collisions with this wall so that the total pressure on one wall attributable to all molecules in the box is or Since the ideal gas equation can be written as we see that so that and Thus we have found a relationship between the molecular speed and the temperature of the gas The actual speed of a molecule can have any value between zero andfor present purposesinfinity When we average the values of for many molecules we find the average value of the squared speeds In Chapter we find that That is the average speed we use in our derivation turns out to be a quantity called the rootmeansquare speed This result also gives us the average kinetic energy of a single gas molecule From this derivation we have a simple mechanical model that explains Boyles law as the logical consequence of pointmass molecules colliding with the walls of their container By combining this result with the ideal gas equation we find that the average speed of ideal gas molecules depends only on the temperature From this we have the very important result that the translational kinetic energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature Since our noninteracting pointmass molecules have no potential energy arising from their interactions with one another their translational kinetic energy is the whole of their energy Because two such molecules neither attract nor repel one another no work is required to change the distance between them The work associated with changing the volume of a confined sample of an ideal gas arises because of the pressure the molecules exert on the walls of the container the pressure arises because of the molecules kinetic energy The energy of one mole of monatomic ideal gas molecules is When we expand our concept of ideal gases to include molecules that have rotational or vibrational energy but which neither attract nor repel one another it remains true that the energy of a macroscopic sample depends only on temperature However the molar energy of such a gas is greater than because of the energy associated with these additional motions We make extensive use of the conclusion that the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature As it turns out this conclusion follows rigorously from the second law of thermodynamics In Chapter we show that for a substance that obeys the ideal gas equation at constant temperature the energy of an ideal gas is independent of the volume and independent of the pressure So long as pressure volume and temperature are the only variables needed to specify its state the laws of thermodynamics imply that the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature While the energy of an ideal gas is independent of pressure the energy of a real gas is a function of pressure at a given temperature At ordinary pressures and temperatures this dependence is weak and can often be neglected The first experimental investigation of this issue was made by James Prescott Joule for whom the SI unit of energy is named Beginning in Joule did a long series of careful measurements of the mechanical equivalent of heat These measurements formed the original experimental basis for the kinetic theory of heat Among Joules early experiments was an attempt to measure the heat absorbed by a gas as it expanded into an evacuated container a process known as a free expansion No absorption of heat was observed which implied that the energy of the gas was unaffected by the volume change However it is difficult to do this experiment with meaningful accuracy Subsequently Joule collaborated with William Thomson Lord Kelvin on a somewhat different experimental approach to essentially the same question The JouleThomson experiment provides a much more sensitive measure of the effects of intermolecular forces of attraction and repulsion on the energy of a gas during its expansion Since our definition of an ideal gas includes the stipulation that there are no intermolecular forces the JouleThomson experiment is consistent with the conclusion that the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature However since intermolecular forces are not zero for any real gas our analysis reaches this conclusion in a somewhat indirect way The complication arises because the JouleThomson results are not entirely consistent with the idea that all properties of a real gas approach those of an ideal gas at a sufficiently low pressure The best of models can have limitations We discuss the JouleThomson experiment in Section
