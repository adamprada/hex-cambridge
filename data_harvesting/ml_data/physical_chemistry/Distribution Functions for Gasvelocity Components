simplified argument to conclude that this speed depends only on temperature We now recognize that the individual molecules in a gas sample have a wide range of speeds the velocities of gas molecules must be described by a distribution function It is true however that the average speed depends only on temperature James Clerk Maxwell was the first to derive the distribution function for gas velocities He did it about We follow Maxwells argument For a molecule moving in three dimensions there are three velocity components Maxwells argument uses only one assumption the speed of a gas molecule is independent of the direction in which it is moving Equivalently we can say that the components of the velocity of a gas molecule are independent of one another knowing the value of one component of a molecules velocity does not enable us to infer anything about the values of the other two components When we use Cartesian coordinates Maxwells assumptionMaxwells assumption means also that the same mathematical model must describe the distribution of each of the velocity components Since the velocity of a gas molecule has three components we must treat the velocity distribution as a function of three random variables To understand how this can be done let us consider how we might find probability distribution functions for velocity components We need to consider both spherical and Cartesian coordinate systems Let us suppose that we are able to measure the Cartesiancoordinate components and of the velocities of a large number of randomly selected gas molecules in a particular constanttemperature sample Then we can transform each set of Cartesian components to sphericalcoordinate velocity covelocity componentsmponents and We imagine accumulating the results of these measurements in a table like Table As a practical matter of course we cannot make the measurements to complete such a table However there is no doubt that at every instant every gas molecule can be characterized by a set of such velocity components the values exist even if we cannot measure them We imagine that we have such data only as a way to clarify the properties of the distribution functions that we need Table Molecular Velocity Components Molecule Number v These data have several important features The scalar velocity ranges from to and range from to In we see that varies from to and ranges from to Each column represents data sampled from the distribution of the corresponding random variable In Chapter we find that we can use such data to find mathematical models for such distributions Here we can find mathematical models for the cumulative distribution functions and We can approximate the graph of by plotting the rank probability of versus We expect this plot to be sigmoid at any the slope of this plot is the probabilitydensity function The probability density function for depends only on because the value measured for is independent of the values measured for and However by Maxwells assumption the functions describing the distribution of and are the same as those describing the distribution of While redundant it is convenient to introduce additional symbols to represent these probability density functions We define and When we find these onedimensional distribution functions by modeling the experimental data in this way each datum that we use in our analysis comes from an observation on a molecule and is associated with particular and values These values of and can be anything from to This is a significant point The functions and are independent of and We can also say that describes the distribution of when and are averaged over all the values it is possible for them to have To clarify this let us consider another cumulative probability distribution function which is just the fraction of all molecules whose respective Cartesian velocity components are less than Since and are the fractions whose components are less than and respectively their product is equal to We have For the velocity of a randomly selected molecule to be included in the fraction represented by the velocity must be in the particular range and However for a velocity to be included in we must have and that is the components and can have any values Since the probability that and satisfy and is the probability that is included in becomes beginaligned Pleftv_xv_xv_y infty v_z infty right f_xyz left v_x infty infty right f_x left v_x right f_y left infty right f_z left infty right f_x left v_x right endaligned For our purposes we need to be able to express the probability that the velocity lies within any range of velocities Let us use to designate a particular volume region in velocity space and use to designate the probability that the velocity of a randomly selected molecule is in this region When we let Ê‹ be the region in velocity space in which components lie between and components lie between and and components lie between and denotes the probability that the velocity of a randomly chosen molecule satisfies the conditions and is an increment of probability The dependence of on and can be made explicit by introducing a new function defined by Since is the volume available in velocity space for velocities whose components are between and whose components are between and and whose components are between and we see that is a probability density function in three dimensions The value of is the probability per unit volume in velocity space that a molecule has the velocity For any velocity there is a value of this value is just a number If we want the probability of finding a velocity within some small volume of velocity space around we can find it by multiplying by this volume From the onedimensional probabilitydensity functions the probability that the component of a molecular velocity lies between and is just whatever the values of and The probability that the component lies between and is just whatever the values of and The probability that the component lies between and is just whatever the values of and When we interpret Maxwells assumption to mean that these are independent probabilities the probability that all three conditions are realized simultaneously is Evidently the product of these three onedimensional probability densities is the threedimensional probability density We have From Maxwells assumption we have derived the conclusion that can be expressed as a product of the onedimensional probability densities and Since these are probability densities we have and Moreover because the Cartesian coordinates differ from one another only in orientation and must all be the same function Figure Transformation from Cartesian to spherical coordinates To summarize the development above we define independently of and Then from Maxwells assumption that the three onedimensional probabilities are independent we find Alternatively we could take Maxwells assumption to be that the threedimensional probability density function is expressible as a product of three onedimensional probability densities In this case the relationships of and to the onedimensional cumulative probabilities etc must be deduced from the properties of As emphasized above our deduction of from experimental data uses values that are associated with all possible values of and That is what we determine in our hypothetical experiment is from which it follows that Figure The differential volume element in spherical coordinates
