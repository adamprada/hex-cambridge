reversible change occurs only because the system responds to changes in the conditions imposed on it by its surroundings A reversible process is driven by the surroundings In contrast a spontaneous process is driven by the system Nevertheless when a spontaneous process occurs under some specific set of imposed conditions specific values of the temperature and pressure for example the systems equilibrium state depends on these conditions To specify a particular spontaneous change we must specify enough constraints to fix the final state of the system To see these points from a slightly different perspective let us consider a closed reversible system in which only pressurevolume work is possible Duhems theorem asserts that a change in the state of this system can be specified by specifying the changes in some pair of state functions say and If the imposed values of and are constant at their eventual equilibrium values but the system is changing the system cannot be on a Gibbsian equilibrium manifold We say that the system is undergoing a spontaneous change at constant and This description is a figure of speech in that the systems and values do not necessarily attain the imposed values and become constant until equilibrium is reached An example is in order A system whose original pressure and temperature are and can undergo a spontaneous change while the surroundings impose a constant pressure and the system is immersed in constant temperature bath at The pressure and temperature of the system may be indeterminate as the process occurs but the equilibrium pressure and temperature must be and If the surroundings operate to impose particular values of and on the system then the position at which the system eventually reaches equilibrium is determined by these values The same equilibrium state is reached for any choice of surroundings that imposes the same values of and on the system at the time that the system reaches equilibrium For every additional form of nonpressurevolume work that affects the system we must specify the value of one additional variable in order to specify a unique equilibrium state The entropy changes that occur in the system and its surroundings during a spontaneous process have predictive value However our definitions do not enable us to find the entropy change for a spontaneous process and the temperature of the system may not have a meaningful value On the other hand we can always carry out the process so that the temperature of the surroundings is known at every point in the process Indeed if the system is in thermal contact with its surroundings as the process occurs we cannot specify the conditions under which the process occurs without specifying the temperature of the surroundings along this path Figure describes a spontaneous process whose path can be specified by the values of thermodynamic variable and the temperature of the surroundings as a function of time Let us denote the curve that describes this path as We can divide this path into short intervals Let denote a short segment of this path along which the temperature of the surroundings is approximately constant For our present purposes the temperature of the system is irrelevant since the process is spontaneous the temperature of the system may have no meaningful value within the interval As the system traverses segment it accepts a quantity of heat from the surroundings which are at temperature The heat exchanged by the surroundings within is Below we show that it is always possible to carry out the process in such a way that the change in the surroundings occurs reversibly Then and since it follows that This is the Clausius inequality It plays a central role in the thermodynamics of spontaneous processes When we make the intervals arbitrarily short we have To demonstrate that we can measure the entropy change in the surroundings during a spontaneous process let us use a conceptual device to transfer the heat that must be exchanged from the surroundings at temperature to the system As sketched in Figure we imagine a very small reversible idealgas Carnot engine whose hightemperature reservoir is also very small We suppose that the Carnot engine delivers a very small heat increment to the high temperature reservoir in every cycle While the system is within we maintain the Carnot engines high temperature reservoir at and allow heat to pass from the high temperature reservoir to the system The high temperature reservoir is the only part of the surroundings that is in thermal contact with the system is the only heat exchanged by the system while it is within Figure Using a reversible Carnot engine to exchange heat with a spontaneously changing system To maintain the high temperature reservoir at we operate the Carnot engine for a large integral number of cycles such that and do so at a rate that just matches the rate at which heat passes from the hightemperature reservoir to the system When the system passes from pathsegment to pathsegment we alter the steps in the reversible Carnot cycle to maintain the hightemperature reservoir at the new surroundings temperature The lowtemperature heat reservoir for this Carnot engine is always at the constant temperature Let the heat delivered from the hightemperature reservoir to the Carnot engine within be We have Let the heat delivered from the lowtemperature reservoir to the Carnot engine within be Let the heat delivered to the lowtemperature reservoir within be We have Since the Carnot engine is reversible we have and so that While the system is within it receives an increment of heat from the high temperature reservoir Simultaneously three components in the surroundings also exchange heat Let the entropy changes in the hightemperature reservoir the Carnot engine and the lowtemperature reservoir be and respectively The high temperature reservoir receives heat from the Carnot engine and delivers the same quantity of heat to the system The net heat accepted by the high temperature reservoir is zero No change occurs in the hightemperature reservoir We have The reversible Carnot engine completes an integral number of cycles so that The low temperature reservoir accepts heat at the fixed temperature during the reversible operation of the Carnot engine so that The entropy change in the surroundings as the system passes through is so that as we observed above Since can be any part of path C and can be made arbitrarily short we have for every increment of any spontaneous process occurring in a closed system that can exchange heat with its surroundings and If the temperature of the surroundings is constant between any two points A and B on curve C we can integrate over this interval to obtain and For an adiabatic process For any arbitrarily small increment of an adiabatic process It follows that and for any spontaneous adiabatic process
