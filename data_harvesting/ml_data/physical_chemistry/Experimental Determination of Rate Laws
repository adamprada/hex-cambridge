adequately describes reactionrate data We can distinguish two general approaches to this task One approach is to measure reaction rate directly That is for we measure the reaction rate in experiments where the concentrations and of reactants and products are known The other is to measure a concentration at frequent time intervals as a batch reaction goes nearly to completion We then seek a differential equation that is consistent with this concentrationversustime data If the reaction is the only process that affects direct measurement of the reaction rate can be effected by measuring over a short time interval in which the concentrations and do not change appreciably This is often difficult to implement experimentally primarily because it is difficult to measure small values of with the necessary accuracy at known values of and Method of Initial Rates The method of initial rates is an experimentally simple method in which the reaction rate is measured directly Initialrate measurements are extensively used in the study of enzymecatalyzed reactions Direct measurement of reaction rate can also be accomplished using a flow reactor We discuss the method of initial rates a particular kind of flow reactor known as a CSTR and enzyme catalysis in Sections and respectively The most common reactionrate experiment is a batch reaction in which we mix the reactants as rapidly as possible and then monitor the concentration vs time of one or more of the reactants or products as the reaction proceeds We do the mixing so that the initially mixed reactants are at a known temperature which can be maintained constant for the remainder of the experiment The data from such an experiment are a set of concentrations and the times at which they are measured To find the rate law corresponding to these concentrationversustime data we employ a trialanderror procedure We guess what the rate law is likely to be We then obtain a general solution for this differential equation This solution predicts the dependence of concentrations versus time as a function of one or more rate constants If we can obtain a satisfactory fit of experimental concentrationversustime data to the concentrationversustime equation predicted by the rate law we conclude that the rate law is a satisfactory representation of the experimental data For a reaction in a closed constantvolume system we would want to test a firstorder rate law rate law which we can express in several alternative ways Using the changing concentration of A to express the rate separating variables and integrating between the initial concentration at and concentration at time gives so that or Frequently it is convenient to introduce the extent of reaction or the concentration of a product as a parameter In the present instance if the initial concentration of is zero Then at any time t we have and the firstorder rate equation can be written as which we rearrange and integrate between the limits and as To give It is easy to test whether concentration versus time data conform to the firstorder decay model If they do a plot of or versus time is a straight line For a reaction we would want to test a rate law rate of the form If the initial concentration of is zero and at any time The rate law can be written as and rearranged and integrated as to give or If concentrationversustime data conform to this secondorder rate law a plot of versus time is a straight line For a reaction we would want to test a rate law of the form If the initial concentration of is again zero and at any time The rate law can be written as If this can be integrated by partial fractions to give If experimental data conform to this equation a plot of versus time is linear In practice this often has disadvantages and experiments to study reactions like this typically exploit the technique of flooding Flooding is a widely used experimental technique that enables us to simplify a complex rate law in a way that makes it more convenient to test experimentally In the case we are considering we can often arrange to carry out the reaction with the initial concentration of much greater than the initial concentration of Then the change that occurs in the concentration of during the reaction has much less effect on the reaction rate than the change that occurs in the concentration of in the rate equation it becomes a good approximation to let at all times For a fuller consideration of this point see problem The secondorder rate equation simplifies to where Since the simplified rate equation is approximately first order the observed rate constant is the slope of a plot of versus is called a pseudofirstorder rate constant Of course one such experiment tests only whether the true rate law is first order in It tells nothing about the dependence on If we do several such experiments at different initial concentrations of the resulting set of values must be directly proportional to the corresponding values This can be tested graphically by plotting versus If the rate law is first order in the resulting plot is linear with an intercept of zero The slope of this plot is the secondorder rate constant Flooding works by simplifying the rate law that is observed in a given experiment Similar simplification can be achieved by designing the experiment so that the initial concentrations of two or more reactants are proportional to their stoichiometric coefficients For the reaction and the expected rate law we would initiate the experiment with equal concentration of reactants and Letting and the concentrations of and at longer times become The rate law becomes effectively second order
