it is important to appreciate that new approaches are always under development in all areas of theoretical chemistry In this Section I want to introduce you to two tools that are proving to offer high precision in the treatment of electron correlation energies These are the socalled quantum Quantum MonteCarlo and r approaches to this problem Both methods currently are used when one wishes to obtain the absolute highest precision in an electronic structure calculation The computational requirements of both of these methods are very high so at present they can only be used on species containing fewer than ca electrons However with the power and speed of computers growing as fast as they are it is likely that these highend methods will be more and more widely used as time goes by Quantum MonteCarlo In this method one first rewrites the time dependent Schrödinger equation for negative imaginary values of the time variable ie one simply replaces by This gives which is analogous to the wellknown diffusion equation The rewritten Schrödinger equation can be viewed as a diffusion equation in the spatial coordinates of the electrons with a diffusion coefficient that is related to the electrons mass me by The socalled source and sink term in the diffusion equation is related to the electronnuclear and electronelectron Coulomb potential energies denoted V In regions of space where is large and negative ie where the potential is highly attractive is large and negative so is large and positive This causes the concentration of the diffusing material to accumulate in such regions Likewise where is positive will decrease Clearly by recognizing as the concentration variable in this analogy one understands that will accumulate where is negative and will decay where is positive as one expects So far we see that the trick of taking to be negative and imaginary causes the electronic Schrödinger equation to look like a dimensional diffusion equation Why is this useful and why does this trick work It is useful because as we see in Chapter of this text MonteCarlo methods are highly efficient tools for solving certain equations it turns out that the diffusion equation is one such case So the Quantum MonteCarlo approach can be used to solve the imaginarytime Schrödinger equation even for systems containing many electrons But what does this imaginary time mean To understand the imaginary time trick let us recall that any wave function eg the trial wave function with which one begins to use MonteCarlo methods to propagate the diffusing function can be written in terms of the exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian as follows If the MonteCarlo method can in fact be used to propagate forward in time such a function but with then it will in principle generate the following function at such an imaginary time As increases the relative amplitudes of all states but the lowest state ie that with smallest will decay compared to the amplitude of the lowest state So the timepropagated wave function will at long enough t be dominated by its lowestenergy component In this way the quantum MonteCarlo propagation method can generate a wave function in dimensions that approaches the groundstate wave function It has turned out that this approach which tackles the electron correlation problem headon has proven to yield highly accurate energies and wave functions that display the proper cusps near nuclei as well as the negative cusps ie the wave function vanishes whenever two electrons coordinates approach one another Finally it turns out that by using a starting function of a given symmetry and nodal structure this method can be extended to converge to the lowestenergy state of the chosen symmetry and nodal structure So the method can be used on excited states also In Chapter of this text you will learn how the MonteCarlo tools can be used to simulate the behavior of manybody systems eg the electron system we just discussed in a highly efficient and easily parallellized manner The Method In this approach to electron correlation one employs a trial variational wave function that contains components that depend explicitly on the interelectron distances By so doing one does not rely on the polarized orbital pair approach introduced earlier in this Chapter to represent all of the correlations among the electrons An example of such an explicitly correlated wave function is which consists of an antisymmetrized product of spinorbitals multiplied by a factor that is symmetric under interchange of any pair of electrons and contains the electronelectron distances in addition to a single variational parameter Such a trial function is said to contain linear correlation factors Of course it is possible to write many other forms for such an explicitly correlated trial function For example one could use as a trial function Both the linear and the exponential forms have been used in developing this tool of quantum chemistry Because the integrals that must be evaluated when one computes the Hamiltonian expectation value are most computationally feasible albeit still very taxing when the linear form is used this particular parameterization is currently the most widely used
