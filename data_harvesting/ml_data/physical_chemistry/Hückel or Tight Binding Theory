orbitals eg orbitals in polyenes metal semiconductor or insulator or orbitals in a solid or or atomic orbitals in a molecule split I know that in our earlier discussion we talked about the degree of overlap between orbitals on neighboring atoms relating to the energy splitting but now it is time to make this concept more quantitative To begin consider two orbitals one on an atom labeled A and another on a neighboring atom labeled B these orbitals could be for example the orbitals of two hydrogen atoms such as Figure illustrates Figure Two orbitals combine to produce a bonding and a antibonding molecular orbital However the two orbitals could instead be two orbitals on neighboring carbon atoms such as are shown in Figure as they form bonding and antibonding orbitals Figure Two atomic orbitals form a bonding and antibonding molecular orbital In both of these cases we think of forming the molecular orbitals MOs as linear combinations of the atomic orbitals AOs ca on the constituent atoms and we express this mathematically as follows where the are called linear combination of atomic orbital to form molecular orbital LCAOMO coefficients The MOs are supposed to be solutions to the Schrödinger equation in which the Hamiltonian H involves the kinetic energy of the electron as well as the potentials and detailing its attraction to the left and right atomic centers this oneelectron Hamiltonian is only an approximation for describing molecular orbitals more rigorous Nelectron treatments will be discussed in Chapter In contrast the AOs centered on the left atom A are supposed to be solutions of the Schrödinger equation whose Hamiltonian is and the AOs on the right atom B have Substituting into the MOs Schrödinger equation and then multiplying on the left by the complex conjugate of and integrating over the and coordinates of the electron produces Recall that the Dirac notation denotes the integral of and and denotes the integral of and the operator op acting on b In what is known as the Hückel model in chemistry or the tightbinding model in solidstate theory one approximates the integrals entering into the above set of linear equations as follows The diagonal integral involving the AO centered on the right atom and labeled is assumed to be equivalent to which means that net attraction of this orbital to the left atomic center is neglected Moreover this integral is approximated in terms of the binding energy denoted not to be confused with the electron spin function a for an electron that occupies the orbital The physical meaning of is the kinetic energy of the electron in plus the attraction of this electron to the right atomic center while it resides in Of course an analogous approximation is made for the diagonal integral involving These values are negative quantities because as is convention in electronic structure theory energies are measured relative to the energy of the electron when it is removed from the orbital and possesses zero kinetic energy The offdiagonal integrals are expressed in terms of a parameter which relates to the kinetic and potential energy of the electron while it resides in the overlap region in which both and are nonvanishing This region is shown pictorially above as the region where the left and right orbitals touch or overlap The magnitude of is assumed to be proportional to the overlap between the two AOs It turns out that is usually a negative quantity which can be seen by writing it as Since is an eigenfunction of having the eigenvalue the first term is equal to a negative quantity times the overlap The second quantity is equal to the integral of the overlap density multiplied by the negative Coulomb potential for attractive interaction of the electron with the left atomic center So whenever and have positive overlap b will turn out negative iii Finally in the most elementary Hückel or tightbinding model the offdiagonal overlap integrals are neglected and set equal to zero on the right side of the matrix eigenvalue equation However in some Hückel models overlap between neighboring orbitals is explicitly treated so in some of the discussion below we will retain With these Hückel approximations the set of equations that determine the orbital energies and the corresponding LCAOMO coefficients are written for the twoorbital case at hand as in the first matrix equations shown below left beginarraycc alpha beta beta alpha endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right varepsilon left beginarraycc S S endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right which is sometimes written a left beginarraycc alphavarepsilon betavarepsilon S betavarepsilon S alphavarepsilon endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right leftbeginarrayc endarray right These equations reduce with the assumption of zero overlap to left beginarraycc alpha beta beta alpha endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right varepsilon left beginarraycc endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right The a parameters are identical if the two AOs ca and are identical as would be the case for bonding between the two orbitals of two H atoms or two orbitals of two C atoms or two s orbitals of two Na atoms If the left and right orbitals were not identical eg for bonding in HeH or for the bonding in a CO group their a values would be different and the Hückel matrix problem would look like left beginarraycc alpha beta beta alpha endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right varepsilon left beginarraycc S S endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right To find the MO energies that result from combining the AOs one must find the values of e for which the above equations are valid Taking the matrix consisting of e times the overlap matrix to the left hand side the above set of equations reduces to the third set displayed earlier It is known from matrix algebra that such a set of linear homogeneous equations ie having zeros on the right hand sides can have nontrivial solutions ie values of that are not simply zero only if the determinant of the matrix on the left side vanishes Setting this determinant equal to zero gives a quadratic equation in which the e values are the unknowns This quadratic equation can be factored into a product which has two solutions As discussed earlier it turns out that the b values are usually negative so the lowest energy such solution is the solution which gives the energy of the bonding MO Notice that the energies of the bonding and antibonding MOs are not symmetrically displaced from the value a within this version of the Hückel model that retains orbital overlap In fact the bonding orbital lies less than b below a and the antibonding MO lies more than b above a because of the and factors in the respective denominators This asymmetric lowering and raising of the MOs relative to the energies of the constituent AOs is commonly observed in chemical bonds that is the antibonding orbital is more antibonding than the bonding orbital i bonding This is another important thing to keep in mind because its effects pervade chemical bonding and spectroscopy Having noted the effect of inclusion of AO overlap effects in the Hückel model I should admit that it is far more common to utilize the simplified version of the Hückel model in which the S factors are ignored In so doing one obtains patterns of MO orbital energies that do not reflect the asymmetric splitting in bonding and antibonding orbitals noted above However this simplified approach is easier to use and offers qualitatively correct MO energy orderings So lets proceed with our discussion of the Hückel model in its simplified version To obtain the LCAOMO coefficients corresponding to the bonding and antibonding MOs one substitutes the corresponding a values into the linear equations left beginarraycc alphavarepsilon beta beta alphavarepsilon endarray right leftbeginarrayc C_L C_R endarray right leftbeginarrayc endarray right and solves for the coefficients actually one can solve for all but one and then use normalization of the MO to determine the final Ca For example for the bonding MO we substitute into the above matrix equation and obtain two equations for and These two equations are clearly not independent either one can be solved for one C in terms of the other C to give which means that the bonding MO is The final unknown C_L is obtained by noting that f is supposed to be a normalized function Within this version of the Hückel model in which the overlap S is neglected the normalization of f leads to the following condition with the final result depending on assuming that each c is itself also normalized So finally we know that and hence the bonding MO is Actually the solution of could also have yielded and then we would have These two solutions are not independent one is just times the other so only one should be included in the list of MOs However either one is just as good as the other because as shown very early in this text all of the physical properties that one computes from a wave function depend not on but on So two wave functions that differ from one another by an overall sign factor as we have here have exactly the same and thus are equivalent In like fashion we can substitute into the matrix equation and solve for the can values that are appropriate for the antibonding MO Doing so gives us or alternatively Again the fact that either expression for is acceptable shows a property of all solutions to any Schrödinger equations any multiple of a solution is also a solution In the above example the two answers for differ by a multiplicative factor of Lets try another example to practice using Hückel or tightbinding theory In particular Id like you to imagine two possible structures for a cluster of three Na atoms ie pretend that someone came to you and asked what geometry you think such a cluster would assume in its ground electronic state one linear and one an equilateral triangle Further assume that the NaNa distances in both such clusters are equal ie that the person asking for your theoretical help is willing to assume that variations in bond lengths are not the crucial factor in determining which structure is favored In Figure I shown the two candidate clusters and their s orbitals Figure Linear and equilateral triangle structures of sodium trimer Numbering the three Na atoms valence s orbitals and we then set up the x Hückel matrix appropriate to the two candidate structures left beginarrayccc alpha beta beta alpha beta beta alpha endarray right for the linear structure nb the zeros arise because and do not overlap and thus have no coupling matrix element Alternatively for the triangular structure we find left beginarrayccc alpha beta beta beta alpha beta beta beta alpha endarray right as the Hückel matrix Each of these x matrices will have three eigenvalues that we obtain by subtracting e from their diagonals and setting the determinants of the resulting matrices to zero For the linear case doing so generates and for the triangle case it produces The first cubic equation has three solutions that give the MO energies for the bonding nonbonding and antibonding MOs respectively The second cubic equation also has three solutions So for the linear and triangular structures the MO energy patterns are as shown in Figure Figure Energy orderings of molecular orbitals of linear and triangular sodium trimer For the neutral cluster about which you were asked you have three valence electrons to distribute among the lowest available orbitals In the linear case we place two electrons into the lowest orbital and one into the second orbital Doing so produces a electron state with a total energy of Alternatively for the triangular species we put two electrons into the lowest MO and one into either of the degenerate MOs resulting in a electron state with total energy Because b is a negative quantity the total energy of the triangular structure is lower than that of the linear structure since The above example illustrates how we can use Hückel or tightbinding theory to make qualitative predictions eg which of two shapes is likely to be of lower energy Notice that all one needs to know to apply such a model to any set of atomic orbitals that overlap to form MOs is the individual AO energies a which relate to the electronegativity of the AOs the degree to which the AOs couple the b parameters which relate to AO overlaps an assumed geometrical structure whose energy one wants to estimate This example and the earlier example pertinent to or the bond in ethylene also introduce the idea of symmetry Knowing for example that ethylene and linear have a leftright plane of symmetry allows us to solve the Hückel problem in terms of symmetryadapted atomic orbitals rather than in terms of primitive atomic orbitals as we did earlier For example for linear we could use the following symmetryadapted functions both of which are even under reflection through the symmetry plane and which is odd under reflection The x Hückel matrix would then have the form left beginarrayccc alpha sqrtbeta sqrtbeta alpha alpha endarray right For example and are evaluated as follows The three eigenvalues of the above Hückel matrix are easily seen to be and exactly as we found earlier So it is not necessary to go through the process of forming symmetryadapted functions the primitive Hückel matrix will give the correct answers even if you do not However using symmetry allows us to break the full x in this case Hückel problem into separate Hückel problems for each symmetry component one odd function and two even functions in this case so a x and a sub matrix While we are discussing the issue of symmetry let me briefly explain the concept of approximate symmetry again using the above Hückel problem as it applies to ethylene as an illustrative example Figure a Ethylene molecules and orbitals showing the reflection plane that is a symmetry property of this molecule Clearly as illustrated in Figure a at its equilibrium geometry the ethylene molecule has a plane of symmetry denoted that maps nuclei and electrons from its left to its right and vice versa This is the symmetry element that could used to decompose the Hückel matrix describing the and orbitals into two x matrices However if any of the four CH bond lengths or HCH angles is displaced from its equilibrium value in a manner that destroys the perfect symmetry of this molecule or if one of the CH units were replaced by a CCH unit it might appear that symmetry would no longer be a useful tool in analyzing the properties of this molecules molecular orbitals Fortunately this is not the case Even if there is not perfect symmetry in the nuclear framework of this molecule the two atomic orbitals will combine to produce a bonding and antibonding orbital Moreover these two molecular orbitals will still possess nodal properties similar to those shown in Figure a even though they will not possess perfect even and odd character relative to the plane The bonding orbital will still have the same sign to the left of the plane as it does to the right and the antibonding orbital will have the opposite sign to the left as it does to the right but the magnitudes of these two orbitals will not be leftright equal This is an example of the concept of approximate symmetry It shows that one can use symmetry even when it is not perfect to predict the nodal patterns of molecular orbitals and it is the nodal patterns that govern the relative energies of orbitals as we have seen time and again Lets see if you can do some of this on your own Using the above results would you expect the cation to be linear or triangular What about the anion Next I want you to substitute the MO energies back into the x matrix and find the and coefficients appropriate to each of the MOs of the linear and of the triangular structure See if doing so leads you to solutions that can be depicted as shown in Figure and see if you can place each set of MOs in the proper energy ordering Figure The molecular orbitals of linear and triangular sodium trimer note they are not energy ordered in this figure Now I want to show you how to broaden your horizons and use tightbinding theory to describe all of the bonds in a more complicated molecule such as ethylene shown in Figure What is different about this kind of molecule when compared with metallic or conjugated species is that the bonding can be described in terms of several pairs of valence orbitals that couple to form twocenter bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals Within the Hückel model described above each pair of orbitals that touch or overlap gives rise to a x matrix More correctly all n of the constituent valence orbitals form an nxn matrix but this matrix is broken up into x blocks Notice that this did not happen in the triangular Na case where each AO touched two other AOs For the ethlyene case the valence orbitals consist of a four equivalent C orbitals that are directed toward the four H atoms b four H orbitals c two C orbitals directed toward one another to form the CC bond and d two C orbitals that will form the CC bond This total of orbitals generates Hückel matrices as shown below the ethylene molecule Figure Ethylene molecule with four CH bonds one CC bond and one CC bond We obtain one matrix for the CC bond of the form left beginarraycc alpha_sp beta_spsp beta_spsp alpha_sp endarray right and one matrix for the CC bond of the form left beginarraycc alpha_p_pi beta_p_pip_pi beta_p_pip_pi alpha_p_pi endarray right Finally we also obtain four identical matrices for the CH bonds left beginarraycc alpha_sp beta_spH beta_spH alpha_H endarray right The above matrices produce four identical CH bonding MOs having energies four identical CH antibonding MOs having energies one bonding CC orbital with a partner antibonding CC orbital with a CC bonding MO with and phi its antibonding partner with In all of these expressions the parameter is supposed to be that appropriate to the specific orbitals that overlap as shown in the matrices If you wish to practice this exercise of breaking a large molecule down into sets of interacting valence try to see what Hückel matrices you obtain and what bonding and antibonding MO energies you obtain for the valence orbitals of methane shown in Figure Figure Methane molecule with four CH bonds Before leaving this discussion of the Hückeltightbinding model I need to stress that it has its flaws because it is based on approximations and involves neglecting certain terms in the Schrödinger equation For example it predicts see above that ethylene has four energetically identical CH bonding MOs and four degenerate CH antibonding MOs However this is not what is seen when photoelectron spectra are used to probe the energies of these MOs Likewise it suggests that methane has four equivalent CH bonding and antibonding orbitals which again is not true It turns out that in each of these two cases ethylene and methane the experiments indicate a grouping of four nearly isoenergetic bonding MOs and four nearly isoenergetic antibonding MOs However there is some splitting among these clusters of four MOs The splittings can be interpreted within the Hückel model as arising from couplings or interactions among for example one sp or orbital on a given C atom and another such orbital on the same atom Such couplings cause the nxn Hückel matrix to not blockpartition into groups of sub matrices because now there exist offdiagonal b factors that couple one pair of directed valence to another When such couplings are included in the analysis one finds that the clusters of MOs expected to be degenerate are not but are split just as the photoelectron data suggest Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of
