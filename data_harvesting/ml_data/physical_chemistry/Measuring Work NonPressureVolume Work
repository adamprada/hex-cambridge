possible From our vector definition of work any force that originates in the surroundings can do work on a system The force drives a displacement in space of the system or some part of the system Stretching a strip of rubber is a onedimensional analog of pressurevolume work Changing the surface area of a liquid is a twodimensional analog of pressurevolume work When only internal forces act a liquid system minimizes its surface area We can model this property by attributing a surfacearea minimizing force which we call the surface tension to the surface of the liquid We can think of the layer of molecules at the surface as a film that separates the bulk liquid from its surroundings To increase the area of a liquid system requires an expenditure of work by the surroundings against the surface tension of the film Gravitational electrical and magnetic forces can all do work on particular systems In this book we give little attention to the details of the various kinds of nonpressurevolume work that can be important There are two exceptions Electrical work is important in electrochemistry which we discuss in Chapter We discuss gravitational work in examples that illustrate reversible processes and some aspects of the criteria for change Nevertheless no development of the basic concepts can be complete without including the effects of nonpressurevolume work For this reason we include nonpressurevolume work in our discussions frequently For the most part however we do so in a generalized or abstract way To do so we must identify some essential features of any process that does work on a system Whenever a particular kind of work is done on a system some change occurs in a thermodynamic variable that is characteristic of that kind of work For pressurevolume work this is the volume change For stretching a strip of rubber it is the change in length For gravitational work it is the displacement of a mass in a gravitational field For changing the shape of a liquid it is the change in surface area For electrical work it is the displacement of a charge in an electrical field For magnetic work it is the displacement of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field For an arbitrary form of nonpressurevolume work let us use to represent this variable We can think of as a generalized displacement When there is an incremental change in this variable there is a corresponding change in the energy of the system For a displacement let the increase in the energy of the system be The energy increase also depends on the magnitude of the force that must be applied to the system parallel to the displacement Let this force be Then for this arbitrary abstract process we have or Since is the contribution to the incremental change in the energy of the system associated with the displacement we can also write this as We can generalize this perspective need not be a vector and need not be a mechanical force So long as determines the energy change we have We call a potential If we let the energy increment becomes If multiple forms of work are possible we can distinguish them by their characteristic variables which we label For each of these characteristic variables there is a corresponding potential The total energy increment which we also call the nonpressurevolume work becomes For pressurevolume work The characteristic variable is volume and the potential is the negative of the pressure For gravitational work the characteristic variable is elevation for a given system the potential depends on the gravitational acceleration and the mass of the system When a process changes the composition of a system it is often important to relate the work done on the system to the composition change Formally we express the incremental work resulting from the th generalized displacement as where and are the incremental changes in the work done on the system and the number of moles of the substance in the system To see how this works out in practice let us consider the particular case of electrical work The electrodes of an electrochemical cell can be at different electric potentials We usually designate the potential difference between the electrodes as We can also write when we want to keep our notation uniform The unit of electrical potential is the volt V One volt is one joule per coulomb We are usually interested in cases in which we can assume that is constant Whenever a current flows in an electrochemical cell electrons flow through an external circuit from one electrode to the other By our definition of electrical potential the energy change that occurs when a charge passes through a potential difference is We have Evidently charge is the characteristic variable for electrical work we have and Letting the magnitude of the electron charge be electrons carry charge Then The magnitude of the charge carried by one mole of electrons is the faraday That is See Letting be the number of moles of electrons we have and so that The work done when moles of electrons pass through the potential difference becomes We find the work done when ions pass through a potential difference by essentially the same argument If ions of species carry charge then ions carry charge and the electrical work is If different species pass through the potential difference the total electrical work becomes
