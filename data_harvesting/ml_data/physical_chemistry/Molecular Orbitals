Before moving on to discuss methods that go beyond the HF model it is appropriate to examine some of the computational effort that goes into carrying out a HF SCF calculation on a molecule The primary differences that appear when molecules rather than atoms are considered are The electronic Hamiltonian contains not only one nuclearattraction Coulomb potential but a sum of such terms one for each nucleus in the molecule whose locations are denoted One has AO basis functions of the type discussed above located on each nucleus of the molecule These functions are still denoted but their radial and angular dependences involve the distance and orientation of the electron relative to the particular nucleus on which the AO is located Other than these two changes performing a SCF calculation on a molecule or molecular ion proceeds just as in the atomic case detailed earlier Let us briefly review how this iterative process occurs Once atomic basis sets have been chosen for each atom the one and twoelectron integrals appearing in the and overlap matrices must be evaluated There are numerous highly efficient computer codes that allow such integrals to be computed for and even and basis functions After executing one of these socalled integral packages for a basis with a total of functions one has available usually on the computers hard disk of the order of oneelectron and and twoelectron integrals When treating extremely large atomic orbital basis sets eg or more basis functions modern computer programs calculate the requisite integrals but never store them on the disk Instead their contributions to the matrix elements are accumulated on the fly after which the integrals are discarded This is usually referred to as the direct integraldriven approach a Shapes Sizes and Energies of Orbitals Each molecular spinorbital MO that results from solving the HF SCF equations for a molecule or molecular ion consists of a sum of components involving all of the basis AOs In this expression the are referred to as LCAOMO coefficients because they tell us how to linearly combine AOs to form the MOs Because the AOs have various angular shapes eg or shapes and radial extents ie different orbital exponents the MOs constructed from them can be of different shapes and radial sizes Lets look at a few examples to see what I mean The first example is rather simple and pertains to two H atoms combining to form the molecule The valence AOs on each H atom are the AOs they combine to form the two valence MOs and depicted in Figure Figure Two Hydrogen Atomic Orbitals Combine to Form a Bonding and Antibonding Molecular Orbital The bonding MO labeled s has LCAOMO coefficients of equal sign for the two AOs as a result of which this MO has the same sign near the left H nucleus A as near the right H nucleus B In contrast the antibonding MO labeled has LCAOMO coefficients of different sign for the A and B AOs As was the case in the HÃ¼ckel or tightbinding model outlined in Chapter the energy splitting between the two MOs depends on the overlap between the two AOs which in turn depends on the distance between the two nuclei An analogous pair of bonding and antibonding MOs arises when two orbitals overlap sideways as in ethylene to form and MOs which are illustrated in Figure Figure Two Atomic Orbitals on Carbon Atoms Combine to Form a Bonding and Antibonding Molecular Orbital The shapes of these MOs clearly are dictated by the shapes of the AOs that comprise them and the relative signs of the LCAOMO coefficients that relate the MOs to AOs For the MO these coefficients have the same sign on the left and right atoms for the MO they have opposite signs I should stress that the signs and magnitudes of the LCAOMO coefficients arise as eigenvectors of the HF SCF matrix eigenvalue equation It is a characteristic of such eigenvalue problems for the lower energy eigenfunctions to have fewer nodes than the higher energy solutions as we learned from several examples that we solved in Part of this text Another thing to note about the MOs shown above is that they will differ in their quantitative details but not in their overall shapes when various functional groups are attached to the ethylene molecules C atoms For example if electronwithdrawing groups such as Cl OH or Br are attached to one of the C atoms the attractive potential experienced by a electron near that C atom will be enhanced relative to the potential near the other C atom As a result the bonding MO will have larger LCAOMO coefficients Ckm belonging to tighter basis AOs on this C atom This will make the bonding MO more radially compact in this region of space although its nodal character and gross shape will not change Alternatively an electron donating group such as HC or tbutyl attached to one of the C centers will cause the MO to be more diffuse by making its LCAOMO coefficients for more diffuse basis AOs larger In addition to MOs formed primarily of AOs of one type ie for it is primarily stype orbitals that form the and MOs for ethylenes bond it is primarily the C AOs that contribute there are bonding and antibonding MOs formed by combining several AOs For example the four equivalent CH bonding MOs in shown in Figure each involve C and as well as H basis AOs Figure The Four CH Bonds in Methane The energies of the MOs depend on two primary factors the energies of the AOs from which the MOs are constructed and the overlap between these AOs The pattern in energies for valence MOs formed by combining pairs of firstrow atoms to form homonuclear diatomic molecules is shown in Figure Figure Energies of the Valence Molecular Orbitals in Homonuclear Diatomics Involving FirstRow Atoms In this figure the core MOs formed from the AOs are not shown only those MOs formed from and AOs appear The clear trend toward lower orbital energies as one moves from left to right is due primarily to the trends in orbital energies of the constituent AOs That is F being more electronegative than has a lowerenergy orbital than does b Bonding Antibonding Nonbonding and Rydberg Orbitals As noted above when valence AOs combine to form MOs the relative signs of the combination coefficients determine along with the AO overlap magnitudes the MOs energy and nodal properties In addition to the bonding and antibonding MOs discussed and illustrated earlier two other kinds of MOs are important to know about Nonbonding MOs arise for example when an orbital on one atom is not directed toward and overlapping with an orbital on a neighboring atom For example the lone pair orbitals on or on the oxygen atom of are nonbonding orbitals They still are described in the LCAOMO manner but their coefficients do not contain dominant contributions from more than one atomic center Finally there is a type of orbital that all molecules possess but that is ignored in most elementary discussions of electronic structure All molecules have socalled Rydberg orbitals These orbitals can be thought of as large diffuse orbitals that describe the regions of space an electron would occupy if it were in the presence of the corresponding closedshell molecular cation Two examples of such Rydberg orbitals are shown in Figure On the left we see the Rydberg orbital of and on the right that of The former species can be thought of as a closedshell ammonium cation around which a Rydberg orbital resides The latter is protonated methyl amine with its Rydberg orbital Figure Rydberg Orbitals of and of Protonated Methyl Amine
