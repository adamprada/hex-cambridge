Crystallography NMR Spectroscopy Theoretical Simulation of StructuresContributors and Attributions Experimental Probes of Molecular Shapes I expect you are wondering why I want to discuss how experiments measure molecular shapes in this text whose aim is to introduce you to the field of theoretical chemistry In fact theory and experimental measurement are very connected and it is these connections that I wish to emphasize in the following discussion In particular I want to make it clear that experimental data can only be interpreted and thus used to extract molecular properties through the application of theory So theory does not replace experiment but serves both as a complementary component of chemical research via simulation of molecular properties and as the means by which we connect laboratory data to molecular properties Rotational Spectroscopy Most of us use rotational excitation of molecules in our everyday life In particular when we cook in a microwave oven the microwave radiation which has a frequency in the range inputs energy into the rotational motions of the primarily water molecules contained in the food These rotationally hot water molecules then collide with neighboring molecules ie other water as well as proteins and other molecules in the food and in the cooking vessel to transfer some of their motional energy to them Through this means the translational kinetic energy of all the molecules inside the cooker gains energy This process of rotationtotranslation energy transfer is how the microwave radiation ultimately heats the food which cooks it What happens when you put the food into the microwave oven in a metal container or with some other metal material As shown in Chapter the electrons in metals exist in very delocalized partially filled orbitals called bands These band orbitals are spread out throughout the entire piece of metal The application of any external electric field eg that belonging to the microwave radiation causes these metal electrons to move throughout the metal As these electrons accumulate more and more energy from the microwave radiation they eventually have enough kinetic energy to be ejected into the surrounding air forming a discharge This causes the sparking that we see when we make the mistake of putting anything metal into our microwave oven Lets now learn more about how the microwave photons cause the molecules to become rotationally excited Using microwave radiation molecules having dipole moment vectors can be made to undergo rotational excitation In such processes the timevarying electric field of the microwave electromagnetic radiation interacts with the molecules via a potential energy of the form This potential can cause energy to flow from the microwave energy source into the molecules rotational motions when the energy of the former matches the energy spacing between two rotational energy levels This idea of matching the energy of the photons to the energy spacings of the molecule illustrates the concept of resonance and is something that is ubiquitous in spectroscopy as we learned in mathematical detail in Chapter Upon first hearing that the photons energy must match an energylevel spacing in the molecule if photon absorption is to occur it appears obvious and even trivial However upon further reflection there is more to such resonance requirements than one might think Allow me to illustrate using this microwaveinduced rotational excitation example by asking you to consider why photons whose energies considerably exceed the energy spacing will not be absorbed in this transition That is why is more than enough energy not good enough The reason is that for two systems in this case the photons electric field and the molecules rotation which causes its dipole moment to also rotate to interact and thus exchange energy this is what photon absorption is they must have very nearly the same frequencies If the photons frequency exceeds the rotational frequency of the molecule by a significant amount the molecule will experience an electric field that oscillates too quickly to induce a torque on the molecules dipole that is always in the same direction and that lasts over a significant length of time As a result the rapidly oscillating electric field will not provide a coherent twisting of the dipole and hence will not induce rotational excitation One simple example from every day life can further illustrate this issue When you try to push your friend spouse or child on a swing you move your arms in resonance with the swinging persons movement frequency Each time the person returns to you your arms are waiting to give a push in the direction that gives energy to the swinging individual This happens over and over again each time they return your arms have returned to be ready to give another push in the same direction In this case we say that your arms move in resonance with the swings motion and offer a coherent excitation of the swinger If you were to increase greatly the rate at which your arms are moving in their up and down pattern the swinging person would not always experience a push in the correct direction when they return to meet your arms Sometimes they would feel a strong inphase push but other times they would feel an outofphase push in the opposite direction The net result is that over a long period of time they would feel random jerks from your arms and thus would not undergo smooth energy transfer from you This is why too high a frequency and hence too high an energy does not induce excitation Let us now return to the case of rotational excitation by microwave photons As we saw in Chapter for a rigid diatomic molecule the rotational energy spacings are given by where is the moment of inertia of the molecule given in terms of its equilibrium bond length and its reduced mass as Thus in principle measuring the rotational energy level spacings via microwave spectroscopy allows one to determine The second identity above simply defines what is called the rotational constant in terms of the moment of inertia The rotational energy levels described above give rise to a manifold of levels of nonuniform spacing as shown in the Figure Figure Rotational energy levels vs rotational quantum number The nonuniformity in spacings is a result of the quadratic dependence of the rotational energy levels on the rotational quantum number E_J JJ biggdfrachbarIbiggtag Moreover the level with quantum number is fold degenerate that is there are distinct energy states and wave functions that have energy and that are distinguished by a quantum number These states have identical energy but differ among one another by the orientation of their angular momentum in space ie the orientation of how they are spinning For polyatomic molecules we know from Chapter that things are more complicated because the rotational energy levels depend on three socalled principal moments of inertia which in turn contain information about the molecules geometry These three principle moments are found by forming a x moment of inertia matrix having elements and expressed in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of the nuclei a and of the center of mass in an arbitrary moleculefixed coordinate system analogous definitions hold for and The principle moments are then obtained as the eigenvalues of this x matrix For molecules with all three principle moments equal the rotational energy levels are given by E_JK dfrachbarJJI and are independent of the quantum number and on the quantum number that again describes the orientation of how the molecule is spinning in space Such molecules are called spherical tops For molecules called symmetric tops with two principle moments equal and one unique moment the energies depend on two quantum numbers and and are given by E_JK dfrachbarJJI_a hbarK biggdfracI_c dfracI_abigg tag Species having all three principal moments of inertia unique termed asymmetric tops have rotational energy levels for which no analytic formula is yet known The HO molecule shown in Figure is such an asymmetric top molecule More details about the rotational energies and wave functions were given in Chapter Figure Water molecule showing its three distinct principal moment of inertia The moments of inertia that occur in the expressions for the rotational energy levels involve positions of atomic nuclei relative to the center of mass of the molecule So a microwave spectrum can in principle determine the moments of inertia and hence the geometry of a molecule In the discussion given above we treated these positions and thus the moments of inertia as fixed ie not varying with time Of course these distances are not unchanging with time in a real molecule because the molecules atomic nuclei undergo vibrational motions Because of this it is the vibrationallyaveraged moments of inertia that must be incorporated into the rotational energy level formulas Specifically because the rotationally energies depend on the inverses of moments of inertia one must vibrationally average over the vibrational motion that characterizes the molecules movement For species containing stiff bonds the vibrational average of the inverse squares of atomic distances relative to the center of mass does not differ significantly from the equilibrium values of the same distances However for molecules such as weak van der Waals complexes eg HO or ArHCl that undergo floppy largeamplitude vibrational motions there may be large differences between the equilibrium and the vibrationally averaged values The proper treatment of the rotational energy level patterns in such floppy molecules is still very much under active study by theoretical and experimental chemists For this reason it is a very challenging task to use microwave data on rotational energies to determine geometries equilibrium or vibrationally averaged for these kinds of molecules So in the area of rotational spectroscopy theory plays several important roles It provides the basic equations in terms of which the rotational line spacings relate to moments of inertia It allows one given the distribution of geometrical bond lengths and angles characteristic of the vibrational state the molecule exists in to compute the proper vibrationallyaveraged moment of inertia It can be used to treat large amplitude floppy motions eg by simulating the nuclear motions on a BornOppenheimer energy surface thereby allowing rotationally resolved spectra of such species to provide proper moment of inertia and thus geometry information Vibrational Spectroscopy The ability of molecules to absorb and emit infrared radiation as they undergo transitions among their vibrational energy levels is critical to our planets health It turns out that water and molecules have bonds that vibrate in the frequency range which is within the infrared spectrum As solar radiation primarily visible and ultraviolet impacts the earths surface it is absorbed by molecules with electronic transitions in this energy range eg colored molecules such as those contained in plant leaves and other dark material These molecules are thereby promoted to excited electronic states Some such molecules reemit the photons that excited them but most undergo socalled radiationless relaxation that allows them to return to their ground electronic state but with a substantial amount of internal vibrational energy That is these molecules become vibrationally very hot Subsequently these hot molecules as they undergo transitions from highenergy vibrational levels to lowerenergy levels emit infrared IR photons If our atmosphere were devoid of water vapor and these IR photons would travel through the atmosphere and be lost into space The result would be that much of the energy provided by the suns visible and ultraviolet photons would be lost via IR emission However the water vapor and do not allow so much IR radiation to escape These greenhouse gases absorb the emitted IR photons to generate vibrationally hot water and molecules in the atmosphere These vibrationally excited molecules undergo collisions with other molecules in the atmosphere and at the earths surface In such collisions some of their vibrational energy can be transferred to translational kinetic energy of the collisionpartner molecules In this manner the temperature which is measure of the average translational energy increases Of course the vibrationally hot molecules can also reemit their IR photons but there is a thick layer of such molecules forming a blanket around the earth and all of these molecules are available to continually absorb and reemit the IR energy In this manner the blanket keeps the IR radiation from escaping and thus keeps our atmosphere warm Those of us who live in dry desert climates are keenly aware of such effects Clear cloudless nights in the desert can become very cold primarily because much of the days IR energy production is lost to radiative emission through the atmosphere and into space Lets now learn more about molecular vibrations how IR radiation excites them and what theory has to do with this When infrared IR radiation is used to excite a molecule it is the vibrations of the molecule that are in resonance with the oscillating electric field Molecules that have dipole moments that vary as its vibrations occur interact with the IR electric field via a potential energy of the form Here denotes the change in the molecules dipole moment associated with motion along the vibrational normal mode labeled As the IR radiation is scanned it comes into resonance with various vibrations of the molecule under study and radiation can be absorbed Knowing the frequencies at which radiation is absorbed provides knowledge of the vibrational energy level spacings in the molecule Absorptions associated with transitions from the lowest vibrational level to the first excited lever are called fundamental transitions Those connecting the lowest level to the second excited state are called first overtone transitions Excitations from excited levels to even higher levels are named hotband absorptions Fundamental vibrational transitions occur at frequencies that characterize various functional groups in molecules eg OH stretching HNH bending NH stretching CC stretching etc As such a vibrational spectrum offers an important fingerprint that allows the chemist to infer which functional groups are present in the molecule However when the molecule contains soft floppy vibrational modes it is often more difficult to use information about the absorption frequency to extract quantitative information about the molecules energy surface and its bonding structure As was the case for rotational levels of such floppy molecules the accurate treatment of largeamplitude vibrational motions of such species remains an area of intense research interest within the theory community In a polyatomic molecule with atoms there are many vibrational modes The total vibrational energy of such a molecule can be approximated as a sum of terms one for each of the or for a linear molecule vibrations Ev_ v_Ntext or hbaromega_j bigv_j dfracbig tag Here is the harmonic frequency of the mode and is the vibrational quantum number associated with that mode As we discussed in Chapter the vibrational wave functions are products of harmonic vibrational functions for each mode psi prod_jNtext or psi_v_j x jtag and the spacings between energy levels in which one of the normalmode quantum numbers increases by unity are expressed as Delta E_v_j Ev_j E v_j hbaromega_j That is the spacings between successive vibrational levels of a given mode are predicted to be independent of the quantum number v within this harmonic model as shown in Figure Figure Harmonic vibrational energy levels vs vibrational quantum number In Chapter the details connecting the local curvature ie Hessian matrix elements in a polyatomic molecules potential energy surface to its normal modes of vibration are presented Experimental evidence clearly indicates that significant deviations from the harmonic oscillator energy expression occur as the quantum number grows These deviations are explained in terms of the molecules true potential deviating strongly from the harmonic potential at higher energy as shown in the Figure Figure Harmonic parabola and anharmonic potentials At larger bond lengths the true potential is softer than the harmonic potential and eventually reaches its asymptote which lies at the dissociation energy above its minimum This deviation of the true from causes the true vibrational energy levels to lie below the harmonic predictions It is convention to express the experimentally observed vibrational energy levels along each of the or independent modes in terms of an anharmonic formula similar to what we discussed for the Morse potential in Chapter Ev_j hbiggomega_j bigv_j dfracbig omega_x_j bigv_j dfracbig omega_y_j bigv_j dfracbig omega_z_j bigv_j dfracbig bigg The first term is the harmonic expression The next is termed the first anharmonicity it usually produces a negative contribution to that varies as Subsequent terms are called higher anharmonicity corrections The spacings between successive energy levels are then given by DeltaEv_j Ev_j Ev_jtag A plot of the spacing between neighboring energy levels versus should be linear for values of where the harmonic and first anharmonicity terms dominate The slope of such a plot is expected to be and the small intercept should be Such a plot of experimental data which clearly can be used to determine the and parameters of the vibrational mode of study is shown in Figure Figure BirgeSponer plot of vibrational energy spacings vs quantum number These socalled BirgeSponer plots can also be used to determine dissociation energies of molecules if the vibration whose spacings are plotted corresponds to a bondstretching mode By linearly extrapolating such a plot of experimental values to large values one can find the value of at which the spacing between neighboring vibrational levels goes to zero This value max specifies the quantum number of the last bound vibrational level for the particular bondstretching mode of interest The dissociation energy can then be computed by adding to the zero point energy along this mode the sum of the spacings between neighboring vibrational energy levels from to So in the case of vibrational spectroscopy theory allows us to interpret observed infrared lines in terms of absorptions arising in localized functional groups extract dissociation energies if a long progression of lines is observed in a bondstretching transition and treat highly nonharmonic floppy vibrations by carrying out dynamical simulations on a BornOppenheimer energy surface XRay Crystallography In xray crystallography experiments one employs crystalline samples of the molecules of interest and makes use of the diffraction patterns produced by scattered xrays to determine positions of the atoms in the molecule relative to one another using the famous Bragg formula In this equation is the wavelength of the xrays is a spacing between layers planes of atoms in the crystal is the angle through which the xray beam is scattered and is an integer that labels the order of the scattered beam Because the xrays scatter most strongly from the innershell electrons of each atom the interatomic distances obtained from such diffraction experiments are more precisely measures of distances between high electron densities in the neighborhoods of various atoms The xrays interact most strongly with the innershell electrons because it is these electrons whose characteristic Bohr frequencies of motion are nearly in resonance with the high frequency of such radiation For this reason xrays can be viewed as being scattered from the core electrons that reside near the nuclear centers within a molecule Hence xray diffraction data offers a very precise and reliable way to probe interatomic distances in molecules The primary difficulties with xray measurements are That one needs to have crystalline samples often materials simply cannot be grown as crystals That one learns about interatomic spacings as they occur in the crystalline state not as they exist for example in solution or in gasphase samples This is especially problematic for biological systems where one would like to know the structure of the biomolecule as it exists within the living organism Nevertheless xray diffraction data and its interpretation through the Bragg formula provide one of the most widely used and reliable ways for probing molecular structure NMR Spectroscopy NMR spectroscopy probes the absorption of radiofrequency RF radiation by the nuclear spins of the molecule The most commonly occurring spins in natural samples are protons deuterons and nuclei In the presence of an external magnetic field along the axis each such nucleus has its spin states split in energy by an amount given by where is the component of the nucleus spin angular momentum along the axis is the strength of the external magnetic field and is a socalled gyromagnetic factor ie a constant that is characteristic of the nucleus This splitting of magnetic spin levels by a magnetic field is called the Zeeman effect and it is illustrated in Figure Figure Zeeman splitting of magnetic nucleuss two levels caused by magnetic field The factor is introduced to describe the screening of the external field at the nucleus caused by the electron cloud that surrounds this nucleus In effect is the magnetic field experienced local to the nucleus It is this screening that gives rise to the phenomenon of chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopy and it is this factor that allows NMR measurements of shielding factors to be related by theory to the electronic environment of a nucleus In Figure we display the chemical shifts of proton and nuclei in a variety of chemical bonding environments Figure Chemical shifts characterizing various electronic environments for protons and for carbon nuclei Because the quantum number changes in steps of unity and because each photon possesses one unit of angular momentum the RF energy that will be in resonance with the nucleus Zeemansplit levels is given by In most NMR experiments a fixed RF frequency is employed and the external magnetic field is scanned until the above resonance condition is met Determining at what value a given nucleus absorbs RF radiation allows one to determine the local shielding for that nucleus This in turn provides information about the electronic environment local to that nucleus as illustrated in the above figure This data tells the chemist a great deal about the molecules structure because it suggests what kinds of functional groups occur within the molecule To extract even more geometrical information from NMR experiments one makes use of another feature of nuclear spin states In particular it is known that the energy levels of a given nucleus eg the one are altered by the presence of other nearby nuclear spins These spinspin coupling interactions give rise to splittings in the energy levels of the nucleus that alter the above energy expression as follows Where is the component of the nuclear spin angular momentum is the corresponding component of a nearby nucleus causing the splitting and is called the spinspin coupling constant between the two nuclei Examples of how spins on neighboring centers split the NMR absorption lines of a given nucleus are shown in Figs for three common cases The first involves a nucleus labeled A that is close enough to one other magnetically active nucleus labeled X the second involves a nucleus A that is close to two equivalent nuclei X and the third describes a nucleus A close to three equivalent nuclei X Figure Splitting pattern characteristic of AX case In Figure are illustrated the splitting in the X nucleus absorption due to the presence of a single A neighbor nucleus right and the splitting in the A nucleus absorption left caused by the X nucleus In both of these examples the X and A nuclei have only two values so they must be spin nuclei This kind of splitting pattern would for example arise for a group in the benzene molecule where A and X Figure Splitting pattern characteristic of case The splitting pattern shown if Figure would for example arise in the spectrum of a group and illustrates the splitting of the A nucleus absorption line by the four spin states that the two equivalent X spins can occupy Again the lines shown would be consistent with X and A both having spin because they each assume only two values Figure Splitting pattern characteristic of case In Figure is the kind of splitting pattern that would apply to the NMR absorptions for a group In this case the spin A line is split by the eight spin states that the three equivalent spin H nuclei can occupy The magnitudes of these coupling constants depend on the distances R between the two nuclei to the inverse sixth power ie as They also depend on the values of the two interacting nuclei In the presence of splitting caused by nearby usually covalently bonded nuclei the NMR spectrum of a molecule consists of sets of absorptions each belonging to a specific nuclear type in a particular chemical environment and thus have a specific chemical shift that are split by their couplings to the other nuclei Because of the spinspin couplings strong decay with internuclear distance the magnitude and pattern of the splitting induced on one nucleus by its neighbors provides a clear signature of what the neighboring nuclei are ie through the number of values associated with the peak pattern and how far these nuclei are through the magnitude of the constant knowing it is proportional to This nearneighbor data combined with the chemical shift functional group data offer powerful information about molecular structure An example of a full NMR spectrum is given in Figure where the spectrum ie only the proton absorptions are shown of appears along with plots of the integrated intensities under each set of peaks The latter data suggests the total number of nuclei corresponding to that group of peaks Notice how the protons absorption the absorption of the two equivalent protons on the group and that of the three equivalent protons in the group occur at different field strengths ie have different chemical shifts Also note how the peak is split only slightly because this proton is distant from any others but the protons peak is split by the neighboring groups protons in an pattern Finally the protons peak is split by the neighboring groups three protons in an pattern Figure Proton NMR of ethanol showing splitting of three distinct protons as well as integrated intensities of the three sets of peaks In summary NMR spectroscopy is a very powerful tool that allows us to extract internuclear distances or at least tell how many nearneighbor nuclei there are and thus geometrical information by measuring coupling constants and subsequently using the theoretical expressions that relate values to values allows us to probe the local electronic environment of nuclei inside molecules by measuring chemical shifts or shielding and then using the theoretical equations relating the two quantities Knowledge about the electronic environment tells one for example about the degree of polarity in bonds connected to that nuclear center tells us through the splitting patterns associated with various nuclei the number and nature of the neighbor nuclei again providing a wealth of molecular structure information Theoretical Simulation of Structures We have seen how microwave infrared and NMR spectroscopy as well as xray diffraction data when subjected to proper interpretation using the appropriate theoretical equations can be used to obtain a great deal of structural information about a molecule As discussed in Part of this text theory is also used to probe molecular structure in another manner That is not only does theory offer the equations that connect the experimental data to the molecular properties but it also allows one to simulate a molecule This simulation is done by solving the Schrödinger equation for the motions of the electrons to generate a potential energy surface after which this energy landscape can be searched for points where the gradients along all directions vanish An example of such a PES is shown in Figure for a simple case in which the energy depends on only two geometrical parameters Even in such a case one can find several local minima and transition state structures connecting them Figure Potential energy surface in two dimensions showing reactant and product minima transition states and paths connecting them As we discussed in Chapter among the stationary points on the potential energy surface PES those at which all eigenvalues of the second derivative Hessian matrix are positive represent geometrically stable isomers of the molecule Those stationary points on the PES at which all but one Hessian eigenvalue are positive and one is negative represent transition state structures that connect pairs of stable isomers Once the stable isomers of a molecule lying within some energy interval above the lowest such isomer have been identified the vibrational motions of the molecule within the neighborhood of each such isomer can be described either by solving the Schrödinger equation for the vibrational wave functions belonging to each normal mode or by solving the classical Newton equations of motion using the gradient of the PES to compute the forces along each molecular distortion direction The decision about whether to use the Schrödinger or Newtonian equations to treat the vibrational motion depends on whether one wishes needs to properly include quantum effects eg zeropoint motion and wave function nodal patterns in the simulation Once the vibrational motions have been described for a particular isomer and given knowledge of the geometry of that isomer one can evaluate the moments of inertia one can properly vibrationally average all of the quantities that enter into these moments and hence one can simulate the microwave spectrum of the molecule Also given the Hessian matrix for this isomer one can form its massweighted variant whose nonzero eigenvalues give the normalmode harmonic frequencies of vibration of that isomer and whose eigenvectors describe the atomic motions that correspond to these vibrations Moreover the solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation allows one to compute the NMR shielding values at each nucleus as well as the spinspin coupling constants between pairs of nuclei the treatment of these subjects is beyond the level of this text you can find it in Molecular Electronic Structure Theory by Helgaker et al Again using the vibrational motion knowledge one can average the and values over this motion to gain vibrationally averaged and values that best simulate the experimental parameters One carries out such a theoretical simulation of a molecule for various reasons Especially in the early days of developing theoretical tools to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation or the vibrational motion problem one would do so for molecules whose structures and IR and NMR spectra were well known The purpose in such cases was to calibrate the accuracy of the theoretical methods against established experimental data Now that theoretical tools have been reasonably well tested and can be trusted within known limits of accuracy one often uses theoretically simulated structural and spectroscopic properties to identify spectral features whose molecular origin is not known That is one compares the theoretical spectra of a variety of test molecules to the observed spectral features to attempt to identify the molecule that produced the spectra It is also common to use simulations to examine species that are especially difficult to generate in reasonable quantities in the laboratory and species that do not persist for long times Reactive radicals cations and anions are often difficult to generate in the laboratory and may be impossible to retain in sufficient concentrations and for a sufficient duration to permit experimental characterization In such cases theoretical simulation of the properties of these molecules may be the most reliable way to access such data Moreover one might use simulations to examine the behavior of molecules under extreme conditions such as high pressure confinement to nanoscopic spaces high temperature or very low temperatures for which experiments could be very difficult or expensive to carry out Let me tell you about an example of how such theoretical simulation has proven useful probably even essential for interpreting experimental data the data is reported in N I Hammer JW Shin J M Headrick E G Diken J R Roscioli G H Weddle and M A Johnson Science In the group of Prof Mark Johnson at Yale infrared spectroscopy is carried out on gasphase ions In this particular experiment water cluster anions with one or more Ar atoms attached to them were formed and using a mass spectrometer the ions of one specific mass were selected for subsequent study In the example illustrated here the cluster containing four water molecules was studied When infrared IR radiation impinges on the ions it can be absorbed if its frequency matches the frequency of one of the vibrational modes of this cluster If for example IR radiation in the cm frequency range is absorbed this range corresponds to frequencies of HOH bending vibrations this excess internal energy can cause one or more of the weakly bound Ar atoms to be ejected from the cluster thus decreasing the number of intact ions in the mass spectrometer The decrease in the number of intact ions is a direct measure then of the absorption of the IR light By monitoring the number of ie the strength of the mass spectrometers signal at this particular masstocharge ratio as the IR radiation is tuned through the cm frequency range the experimentalists obtain spectral signatures ie the ion intensity loss of the IR absorption by the cluster ions When they carry out this kind of experiment using and scan the IR radiation in the cm frequency range they obtained the spectrum labeled A in Figure a When they performed the same kind of experiment on and scanned in the cm frequency range which is where OD stretching vibrations are known to occur they obtained the spectrum labeled B in Figure a Figure a Infrared spectra of and respectively in the cm and cm frequency ranges What the experimentalists did not know however is what the geometrical structure of the underlying ion was Nor did they know exactly which HOH bending or OH or OD stretching vibrations were causing the various peaks shown in Figure a A and B By carrying out electronic structure calculations on a large number of geometries for and searching for local minima on the ground electronic state of this ion there are a very large number of such local minima and then using the massweighted Hessian matrix at each local minima to calculate the structures vibrational energies the experimentalists were able to figure out what structure for was most consistent with their observed IR spectrum For example for the rather extended structure of they computed the IR spectrum shown in panel E and for in panel F of Figure a Alternatively for the cyclic structure of they computed the IR spectrum shown in panel C and for in panel D of Figure a Clearly the spectrum of panels C and D agrees much better with their experimental spectrum in panels A and B than does the spectrum of panels E and F Based on these comparisons these scientists concluded that the ions in their and have the cyclic geometry not the extended quasilinear geometry Moreover by looking at which particular vibrational modes of the cyclic produced which peaks in panels C and D they were able to assign each of the IR peaks seen in their data of panels A and B This is a good example of how theoretical simulation can help interpret experimental data without the theory these scientists would not know the geometry of Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools on
