found experimentally the rate law plays a central role in the investigation of chemical reaction mechanisms The discussion above introduces the problems and methods associated with collecting rate data and with finding an empirical rate law that fits experimental concentrationversustime data We turn now to finding the rate laws that are consistent with a particular proposed mechanism For simplicity we consider reactions in closed constantvolume systems In principle numerical integration can be used to predict the concentration at any time of each of the species in any proposed reaction mechanism This prediction can be compared to experimental observations to see whether they are consistent with the proposed mechanism To do the numerical integration it is necessary to know the initial concentrations of all of the chemical species and to know or assume values of all of the rate constants The initial concentrations are known from the procedure used to initiate the reaction However the rate constants must be determined by some iterative procedure in which initial estimates of the rate constants are used to predict concentrationversustime data that can be compared to the experimental results to produce refined estimates In practice we tailor our choice of reaction conditions so that we can use various approximations to test whether a proposed mechanism can explain the data We now consider the most generally useful of these approximations In this discussion we assume that the overall reaction goes to completion that is at equilibrium the concentration of the reactant whose concentration is limiting has become essentially zero If the overall reaction involves more than one elementary step then an intermediate compound is involved A valid mechanism must include this intermediate and more than one differential equation may be needed to characterize the time rate of change of all of the species involved in the reaction We focus on conditions and approximations under which the rate of appearance of the final products in a multistep reaction mechanism can be described by a single differential equation the rate law We examine the application of these approximations to a particular reaction mechanism When we understand the application of these approximations to this mechanism the ways in which they can be used in other situations are clear Consider the following sequence of elementary steps whose kinetics are described by the following simultaneous differential equations The general analytical solution for this system of coupled differential equations can be obtained but it is rather complex because increases early in the reaction passes through a maximum and then decreases at long times In principle experimental data could be fit to these equations The numerical approach requires that we select values for and and then numerically integrate to get and as functions of time In principle we could refine our estimates of and by comparing the calculated values of one or more concentrations to the experimental ones In practice the approximate treatments we consider next are more expedient When we begin a kinetic study we normally have a working hypothesis about the reaction mechanism and we design our experiments to simplify the differential equations that apply to it For the present example we will assume that we always arrange the experiment so that and In consequence at all times Also we restrict our considerations to experiments in which This exemplifies the use of flooding The practical effect is that the concentration of remains effectively constant at its initial value throughout the entire reaction which simplifies the differential equations significantly In the present instance setting means that the ratelaw term can be replaced to a good approximation by where Once we have decided upon the reaction conditions we are going to use whether the resulting concentrationversustime data can be described by a single differential equation depends on the relative magnitudes of the rate constants in the several steps of the overall reaction Particular combinations of relationships that lead to simplifications are often referred to by particular names we talk about a combination that has a ratedetermining step or one that involves a prior equilibrium or one in which a steadystate approximation is applicable To see what we mean by these terms let us consider some particular relationships that can exist among the rate constants in the mechanism above Case I Suppose that and We often describe this situation by saying rather imprecisely that the reaction to convert to is very fast and that the reaction to convert back to and is very slowcompared to the reaction that forms from and When is produced in these circumstances it is converted to so rapidly that we never observe a significant concentration of in the reaction mixture The formation of a molecule of is tantamount to the formation of a molecule of and the reaction produces at essentially the same rate that it consumes or We say that the first step is the ratedetermining step in the reaction We have The assumption that means that we can neglect the smaller term in the equation for giving the approximation Letting and recognizing that our assumptions make the massbalance condition becomes Choosing means that The rate equation becomes firstorder Since is not strictly constant it is a pseudofirstorder rate constant The disappearance of is said to follow a pseudofirstorder rate equation The concept of a ratedetermining step step is an approximation In general the consequence we have in mind when we invoke this approximation is that no intermediate species can accumulate to a significant concentration if it is produced by the ratedetermining step or by a step that occurs after the ratedetermining step We do not intend to exclude the accumulation of a species that is at equilibrium with another product Thus in the mechanism we suppose that the conversion of to is ratedetermining and that the interconversion of and is so rapid that their concentrations always satisfy the equilibrium relationship For the purpose at hand we do not consider to be an intermediate is a product that happens to be at equilibrium with the coproduct Case II Suppose that In this case is fast compared to the rate at which is converted to and we say that is the ratedetermining step We can now distinguish three subcases depending upon the way behaves during the course of the reaction Case IIa Suppose that and Then is rapid and essentially quantitative That is within a short time of initiating the reaction all of the stoichiometrically limiting reactant is converted to Letting and recognizing that our assumptions make the massbalance condition becomes After a short time the rate at which is formed becomes or The disappearance of and the formation of follow a firstorder rate law Case IIb If the forward and reverse reactions in the first elementary process are rapid then this process may be effectively at equilibrium during the entire time that is being formed This is the case that and Then throughout the course of the reaction we have Letting and making the further assumption that throughout the reaction the massbalance condition becomes Substituting into the equilibriumconstant expression we find Substituting into we have where The disappearance of A and the formation of D follow a pseudofirstorder rate equation The pseudofirstorder rate constant is a composite quantity that is directly proportional to Case IIc If we suppose that the first step is effectively at equilibrium during the entire time that is being produced as in case IIb but that is not negligibly small compared to we again have With the massbalance condition becomes Eliminating between the massbalance and equilibriumconstant equations gives so that becomes The formation of follows a pseudofirstorder rate equation The disappearance of is also pseudofirstorder but the pseudofirstorder rate constant is different As in Case IIb the pseudofirstorder rate constant is a composite quantity but now its dependence on is more complex The result for Case IIc reduces to that for Case IIb if Case III In the cases above we have assumed that one or more reactions are intrinsically much slower than others are The differential equations for this mechanism can also become much simpler if all three reactions proceed at similar rates but do so in such a way that the concentration of the intermediate is always very small If the concentration of is always very small then we expect the graph of versus time to have a slope that is approximately zero In this case we have so that With becomes As in the previous cases the disappearance of and the formation of follow a pseudofirstorder rate equation The pseudofirstorder rate constant is again a composite quantity which depends on and the values of all of the rate constants Case III illustrates the steadystate approximation in which we assume that the concentration of an intermediate species is much smaller than the concentrations of other species that affect the reaction rate Under these circumstances we can be confident that the timederivative of the intermediates concentration is negligible compared to the reaction rate so that it is a good approximation to set it equal to zero The idea is simply that if the concentration is always small its timederivative must also be small If the graph of the intermediates concentration versus time is always much lower than that of other participating species then its slope will be much less Equating the time derivative of the steadystate intermediates concentration to zero produces an algebraic expression that involves the intermediates concentration Solving this expression for the concentration of the steadystate intermediate makes it possible to greatly simplify the set of simultaneous differential equations that is predicted by the mechanism When there are multiple intermediates to which the approximation is applicable remarkable simplifications can result This often happens when the mechanism involves freeradical intermediates The name steadystate approximation is traditional When we use it we do so on the understanding that the state which is approximately steady is the concentration of the intermediate not the state of the system Since a net reaction is occurring the state of the system is distinctly not constant
