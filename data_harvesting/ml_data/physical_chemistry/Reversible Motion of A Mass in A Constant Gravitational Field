bowling ball ball that can move vertically in the effectively constant gravitational field near the surface of the earth We begin by observing that we develop our description by abstracting from reality We consider idealized models because we want to develop theories that capture the most important features of real systems We ignore less important features In the present example we know that the behavior of the bowling ball will be slightly influenced by its frictional interaction with the surrounding atmosphere We attribute these interactions to a property of air that we call viscosity We assume that this effect can be ignored This causes no difficulty so long as our experiments are too insensitive to observe the effects of this atmospheric drag If necessary of course we could do our experiments inside a vacuum chamber so that the system we study experimentally better meets the assumptions we make in our analysis Alternatively we could expand our theory to include the effects of atmospheric drag To raise an initially stationary bowling ball to a greater height requires that we apply a vertical upward force that exceeds the downward gravitational force on the ball Let height increase in the upward direction and let and be the height and vertical velocity of the ball at time Let the mass of the ball be and let the ball be at rest at time zero Representing the initial velocity and height as and we have and Letting the gravitational acceleration be the gravitational force on the ball is To raise the ball we must apply a vertical force that makes the net force on the ball greater than zero That is we require so that If is constant is constant we find for the height and velocity of the ball at any later time and Let us consider the state of the system when the ball reaches a particular height Let the corresponding time velocity kinetic energy and potential energy at be and respectively Since and we have tau lefth_Srightfracmv_S fracmleftfracf_netmrightt_S f_neth_S The energy we must supply to move the ball from height zero to is equal to the work done by the surroundings on the ball The increase in the energy of the ball is At this input energy is present as the kinetic and potential energy of the ball We have where the kinetic and potential energies are and respectively The ball rises only if the net upward force is positive Then the ball arrives at with a nonzero velocity and kinetic energy If we make smaller and smaller it takes the ball longer and longer to reach when it arrives its velocity and kinetic energy are smaller and smaller However no matter how long it takes the ball to reach when it arrives its potential energy is Now let us consider the energy change in a process in which the ball begins at rest at height zero and ends at rest at At the end we have To effect this change in a real system we must apply a net upward force to the ball to get it moving later we must apply a net downward force to slow the ball in such a way that its velocity becomes zero at exactly the time that it reaches There are infinitely many ways we could apply forces to meet these conditions The net change in the balls energy is the same for all of them We find it useful to use a hypothetical process to calculate this energy change In this hypothetical process the upward force is always just sufficient to oppose the gravitational force on the ball That is so that and from the development above and Of course This is a hypothetical process because the ball would not actually move under these conditions We see that the hypothetical process is the limiting case in a series of real processes in which we make smaller and smaller In all of these processes the potential energy change is If the ball is stationary and the ball remains at rest whatever its height If we make the ball rises If we make the ball falls If and the ball is moving only slowly in either direction a very small change in can be enough to reverse the direction of motion These are the characteristics of a reversible process an arbitrarily small change in the applied force changes the direction of motion The advantage of working with the hypothetical reversible process is that the integral of the applied force over the distance through which it acts is the change in the potential energy of the system While we cannot actually carry out a reversible process we can compute the work that must be done if we know the limiting force that is required in order to effect the change This is true because the velocity and kinetic energy of the ball are zero throughout the process When the process is reversible the change in the potential energy of the ball is equal to the work done on the ball we have Gravitational potential energy is an important factor in some problems of interest in chemistry Other forms of potential energy are important much more often Typically our principal interest is in the potential energy change associated with a change in the chemical composition of a system We are seldom interested in the kinetic energy associated with the motion of a macroscopic system as a whole We can include effects that arise from gravitational forces or from the motion of the whole system in our thermodynamic models but we seldom find a need to do so For systems in which the motion of the whole system is important the laws of mechanics are usually sufficient we find out what we want to know about such systems by solving their equations of motion When we discuss the first law of thermodynamics we write or for the energy change that accompanies some physical change in a system Since chemical applications rarely require that we consider the location of the system or the speed with which it may be moving usually encompasses only work that changes the energy of the system itself Then designates the energy of the macroscopic system itself As noted earlier we often recognize this by calling the energy of the system its internal energy Some writers use the symbol to represent the internal energy intending thereby to make it explicit that the energy under discussion is independent of the systems location and motion
