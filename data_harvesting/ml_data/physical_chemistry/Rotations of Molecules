Motion For Rigid Diatomic and Linear Polyatomic Molecules This Schrödinger equation relates to the rotation of diatomic and linear polyatomic molecules It also arises when treating the angular motions of electrons in any spherically symmetric potential A diatomic molecule with fixed bond length rotating in the absence of any external potential is described by the following Schrödinger equation

momentum operator expressed in polar coordinates above The angles and describe the orientation of the diatomic molecules axis relative to a laboratoryfixed coordinate system and is the reduced mass of the diatomic molecule The differential operators can be seen to be exactly the same as those that arose in the hydrogenlikeatom case discussed earlier in this Chapter Therefore the same spherical harmonics that served as the angular parts of the wave function in the hydrogenatom case now serve as the entire wave function for the socalled rigid rotor These are exactly the same functions as we plotted earlier when we graphed the and orbitals The energy eigenvalues corresponding to each such eigenfunction are given as E_J frachbar JJmu R B JJ and are independent of Thus each energy level is labeled by and is fold degenerate because ranges from to Again this is just like we saw when we looked at the hydrogen orbitals the p orbitals are fold degenerate and the d orbitals are fold degenerate The socalled rotational constant defined as depends on the molecules bond length and reduced mass Spacings between successive rotational levels which are of spectroscopic relevance because as shown in Chapter angular momentum selection rules often restrict the changes in that can occur upon photon absorption to and are given by These energy spacings are of relevance to microwave spectroscopy which probes the rotational energy levels of molecules In fact microwave spectroscopy offers the most direct way to determine molecular rotational constants and hence molecular bond lengths The rigid rotor provides the most commonly employed approximation to the rotational energies and wave functions of linear molecules As presented above the model restricts the bond length to be fixed Vibrational motion of the molecule gives rise to changes in which are then reflected in changes in the rotational energy levels ie there are different values for different vibrational levels The coupling between rotational and vibrational motion gives rise to rotational constants that depend on vibrational state as well as dynamical couplings called centrifugal distortions which cause the total rovibrational energy of the molecule to depend on rotational and vibrational quantum numbers in a nonseparable manner Within this rigid rotor model the absorption spectrum of a rigid diatomic molecule should display a series of peaks each of which corresponds to a specific transition The energies at which these peaks occur should grow linearly with as shown above An example of such a progression of rotational lines is shown in the Figure Figure Typical rotational absorption profile showing intensity vs value of the absorbing level The energies at which the rotational transitions occur appear to fit the formula rather well The intensities of transitions from level to level vary strongly with primarily because the population of molecules in the absorbing level varies with These populations are given when the system is at equilibrium at temperature in terms of the degeneracy of the Jth level and the energy of this level by the Boltzmann formula where is the rotational partition function For low values of the degeneracy is low and the factor is near unity As increases the degeneracy grows linearly but the factor decreases more rapidly As a result there is a value of given by taking the derivative of with respect to and setting it equal to zero at which the intensity of the rotational transition is expected to reach its maximum This behavior is clearly displayed in the above figure The eigenfunctions belonging to these energy levels are the spherical harmonics which are normalized according to int_piint_piY_LMthetaphiY_LMthetaphisintheta dtheta dphi delta_LL delta_mmprime As noted above these functions are identical to those that appear in the solution of the angular part of Hydrogenic atoms The above energy levels and eigenfunctions also apply to the rotation of rigid linear polyatomic molecules the only difference is that the moment of inertia I entering into the rotational energy expression which is for a diatomic is given by where ma is the mass of the atom and is its distance from the center of mass of the molecule to this atom Rotational Motions of Rigid NonLinear Molecules a The Rotational Kinetic Energy The classical rotational kinetic energy for a rigid polyatomic molecule is where the are the three principal moments of inertia of the molecule the eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor This tensor has elements in a Cartesian coordinate system whose origin is located at the center of mass of the molecule that can be computed as I_KK sum_j m_j R_j R_Kj hspacecm textfor K K I_KK sum_j m_j R_Kj R_Kj hspacecm textfor K ne K As discussed in more detail in R N Zare Angular Momentum John Wiley New York the components of the corresponding quantum mechanical angular momentum operators along the three principal axes are The angles and are the Euler angles needed to specify the orientation of the rigid molecule relative to a laboratoryfixed coordinate system The corresponding square of the total angular momentum operator can be obtained as textbfJ textbfJ_a textbfJ_b textbfJ_c hbar fracpartialpartial theta hbarcottheta fracpartialpartial theta hbar fracsintheta leftfracpartialpartial phi fracpartialpartial chi costhetafracpartialpartial phipartial chi right and the component along the lab fixed axis is as we saw much earlier in this text b The Eigenfunctions and Eigenvalues for Special Cases i Spherical Tops When the three principal moment of inertia values are identical the molecule is termed a spherical top In this case the total rotational energy can be expressed in terms of the total angular momentum operator As a result the eigenfunctions of are those of and as well as both of which commute with and with one another is the component of along the labfixed axis and commutes with because and act on different angles The energies associated with such eigenfunctions are EJKM frachbar JJI for all ie quantum numbers ranging from to in unit steps and for all ie quantum numbers ranging from to Each energy level is therefore degenerate because there are possible values and possible values for each The eigenfunctions of and are given in terms of the set of socalled rotation matrices which obey textbfJ_a JMKrangle hbar K JMKrangle These functions are proportional to the spherical harmonics multiplied by which reflects its cdependence ii Symmetric Tops Molecules for which two of the three principal moments of inertia are equal are called symmetric tops Those for which the unique moment of inertia is smaller than the other two are termed prolate symmetric tops if the unique moment of inertia is larger than the others the molecule is an oblate symmetric top An American football is prolate and a Frisbee is oblate Again the rotational kinetic energy which is the full rotational Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the total rotational angular momentum operator and the component of angular momentum along the axis with the unique principal moment of inertia Here the moment of inertia I denotes that moment that is common to two directions that is I is the nonunique moment of inertia As a result the eigenfunctions of are those of and or and of and the corresponding energy levels are EJKM frachbar JJI hbar K leftfracI_a fracIright for prolate tops EJKM frachbar JJI hbar K leftfracI_c fracIright for oblate tops again for and ie or and quantum numbers respectively ranging from to in unit steps Since the energy now depends on these levels are only degenerate due to the different values that arise for each value Notice that for prolate tops because is smaller than the energies increase with increasing for given In contrast for oblate tops since is larger than the energies decrease with for given The eigenfunctions are the same rotation matrix functions as arise for the sphericaltop case so they do not require any further discussion at this time iii Asymmetric Tops The rotational eigenfunctions and energy levels of a molecule for which all three principal moments of inertia are distinct a socalled asymmetric top cannot analytically be expressed in terms of the angular momentum eigenstates and the and quantum numbers In fact no one has ever solved the corresponding Schrödinger equation for this case However given the three principal moments of inertia and a matrix representation of each of the three contributions to the rotational Hamiltonian can be formed within a basis set of the rotationmatrix functions discussed earlier This matrix will not be diagonal because the functions are not eigenfunctions of the asymmetric top However the matrix can be formed in this basis and subsequently brought to diagonal form by finding its eigenvectors and its eigenvalues The vector coefficients express the asymmetric top eigenstates as Because the total angular momentum still commutes with each such eigenstate will contain only one value and hence can also be labeled by a quantum number psi_nJ thetaphichi sum_M K C_n JMK J M Krangle To form the only nonzero matrix elements of within the basis one can use the following properties of the rotationmatrix functions see for example R N Zare Angular Momentum John Wiley New York hbar sqrtJJ KK sqrtJJ K K Each of the elements of and must of course be multiplied respectively by and and summed together to form the matrix representation of The diagonalization of this matrix then provides the asymmetric top energies and wave functions Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools on Theoretical Chemistry Integrated by
