orthogonalization Now there are five equations with six unknowns Arbitrarily choose C whenever there are degenerate eigenvalues there are not unique eigenvectors because the degenerate eigenvectors span a or more dimensional space not two unique directions One always is then forced to choose one of the coefficients and then determine all the rest different choices lead to different final

pgx and pgy SALCAOs The Hamiltonian matrices Fock matrices are given Each of these can be diagonalized to give the following MO energies sg and hartrees su and pux puy pgx pgy It can be seen that the sg orbitals are bonding the su orbitals are antibonding the pux and puy orbitals are bonding and the pgx and pgy orbitals are antibonding Using these approximate energies we can draw the following MO diagram This MO diagram is not an orbital correlation diagram but can be used to help generate one The energy levels on each side C and H can be superimposed to generate the reactant side of the orbital correlation diagram and the center CH levels can be used to form the product side Ignoring the core levels this generates the following orbital correlation diagram a The two F p orbitals top

irreducible representation is A fa f Drawing an energy level diagram using these SALCAOs would result in the following a For nondegenerate point groups one can simply multiply the representations since only one representation will be obtained a Ä b b Constructing a box in this case is unnecessary since it would only contain a single row Two unpaired electrons will result in a singlet S MS and three triplets S MS S MS S MS The states will be BMS BMS BMS and BMS b Remember that when coupling nonequivalent linear molecule angular momenta one simple adds the individual Lz values and vector couples the electron spin So in this case pupu we have ML values of and and The term symbol D is used to denote the spatially doubly degenerate level ML and there are two distinct spatially nondegenerate levels denoted by the term symbol S ML Again two unpaired electrons will result in a singlet S MS and three triplets S MSS MSS MS The states generated are then D ML one state MS D ML one state MS D ML three states MS and D ML three states MS and S ML one state MS S ML one state MS S ML three states MS and and S ML three states MS and c Constructing the box for two equivalent p electrons one obtains ML MS papa papb papb papb From this box one obtains six states D ML one state MS D ML one state MS S ML one state MS S ML three states MS and d It is not necessary to construct a box when coupling nonequivalent angular momenta since vector coupling results in a range from the sum of the two individual angular momenta to the absolute value of their difference In this case dd L and S The term symbols are G G F F D D P P S and S The L and S angular momenta can be vector coupled to produce further splitting into levels J L S L S Denoting J as a term symbol subscript one can identify all the levels and subsequent J states G states G states G states G states F states F states F states F states D states D states D states D states P states P states P state P states S states

There are three states here aaba and abbb c aaab a All the Slater determinants have in common the sasbsasb core and hence this component will not be written out explicitly for each case PMLMS papa apza PMLMS papa aa ipxapya PMLMS papa apza As you can see the symmetries of each of these states cannot be labeled with a single irreducible representation of the Cv point group For example pxapza is xz B and pyapza is yz B and hence the PMLMS state is a combination of B and B symmetries But the three PMLMS functions are degenerate for the C atom and any combination of these three functions would also be degenerate Therefore we can choose new combinations that can be labeled with pure Cv point group labels PxzMS pxapza B PyxMS pyapxa A PyzMS pyapza B Now we can do likewise for the five degenerate D states DMLMS papb ab DMLMS papb ab DMLMS DMLMS DMLMS ab Analogous to the three P states we can also choose combinations of the five degenerate D states which can be labeled with pure Cv point group labels DxxyyMS pxapxb pyapyb A DyxMS pxapyb pyapxb A DzxMS pzapxb pzbpxa B DzyMS pzapyb pzbpya B DzzxxyyMS DMLMS A The only state left is the S SMLMS ab Each of the components of this state are A and hence this state has A symmetry b Forming symmetryadapted AOs from the C and H atomic orbitals would generate the following The bonding nonbonding and antibonding orbitals of CH can be illustrated in the following manner c d e It is necessary to determine how the wavefunctions found in part a correlate with states of the CH molecule PxzMS B sgspxpz ¾¾ snpps PyxMS A sgspxpy ¾¾ snpps PyzMS B sgspypz ¾¾ snss DxxyyMS A ¾¾ snpp sns DyxMS A ¾¾ snspp DzxMS B ¾¾ snspp DzyMS B ¾¾ snss DzzxxyyMS A ¾¾ sns snpp sns Note the C H state to which the lowest A sns CH state decomposes would be sgspy This state sgspy cannot be obtained by a simple combination of the D states In order to obtain pure sgspy it is necessary to combine S with D For example sgspy This indicates that a configuration correlation diagram must be drawn with a barrier near the D asymptote to represent the fact that A CH correlates with a mixture of D and S carbon plus hydrogen The C H state to which the lowest B snspp CH state decomposes would be sgspypx f If you follow the B component of the CP H since it leads to the groundstate products to B CH you must go over an approximately Kcalmole barrier Of course this path produces B CH product Distortions away from Cv symmetry for example to Cs symmetry would make the a and b orbitals identical in symmetry a The b orbitals would maintain their different symmetry going to a symmetry Thus B and A both A in Cs symmetry and odd under reflection through the molecular plane can mix The system could thus follow the A component of the CP H surface to the place marked with a circle on the CCD where it crosses the B surface upon which it then moves and continues to products As a result the barrier would be lowered You can estimate when the barrier occurs late or early using thermodynamic information for the reaction ie slopes and asymptotic energies For example an early barrier would be obtained for a reaction with the characteristics and a late barrier would be obtained for a reaction with the characteristics This relation between reaction endothermicity or exothermicity and the character of the transition state is known as the Hammond postulate Note that the CP H CH reaction of interest here has an early barrier g The reaction CD H CH A should have no symmetry barrier this can be recognized by following the A CD H reactants down to the A CH products This problem in many respects is analogous to problem The B surface certainly requires a two configuration CI wavefunction the ssnpx ppyspx and the snpxs pspxpz The A surface could use the ssn pspy only but once again there is no combination of D determinants which gives purely this configuration pspy Thus mixing of both D and S determinants are necessary to yield the required pspy configuration Hence even the A surface would require a multiconfigurational wavefunction for adequate description Configuration correlation diagram for the reaction CH C CH a CCl is tetrahedral and therefore is a spherical top CHCl has Cv symmetry and therefore is a symmetric top CHCl has Cv symmetry and therefore is an asymmetric top b CCl has such high symmetry that it will not

This is FC SCE in the AO basis The Slater Condon rule for zero spin orbital difference with N electrons in N spin orbitals is E If all orbitals are doubly occupied and we carry out the spin integration we obtain E where i and j now refer to orbitals not spinorbitals If the occupied orbitals obey Ffk ekfk then the expression for E in problem can be rewritten as E We recognize the closed shell Fock operator expression and rewrite this as E I will use the QMIC software to do this problem Lets just start from the beginning Get the starting guess MO coefficients on disk Using the program MOCOEFS it asks us for the first and second MO vectors We input for the first mo this means that the first MO is times the He s orbital plus times the H s orbital this bonding MO is more likely to be heavily weighted on the atom having the higher nuclear charge and for the second Our beginning LCAOMO array looks like and is placed on disk in a file we choose to call mocoefsdat We also put the AO integrals on disk using the program RW_INTS It asks for the unique one and two electron integrals and places a canonical list of these on disk in a file we choose to call ao_integralsdat At this point it is useful for us to step back and look at the set of equations which we wish to solve FC SCE The QMIC software does not provide us with a socalled generalized eigenvalue solver one that contains an overlap matrix or metric so in order to use the diagonalization program that is provided we must transform this equation FC SCE to one that looks like FC CE We do that in the following manner Since S is symmetric and positive definite we can find an Ssuch that SS SS S etc rewrite FC SCE by inserting unity between FC and multiplying the whole equation on the left by S This gives SFSSC SSCE SCE Letting F SFS C SC and inserting these expressions above give FC CE Note that to get the next iterations MO coefficients we must calculate C from C C SC so multiplying through on the left by Sgives SC SSC C This will be the method we will use to solve our fock equations Find Sby using the program FUNCT_MAT this program generates a function of a matrix This program will ask for the elements of the S array and write to disk a file name of your choice a good name might be shalf containing the Sarray Now we are ready to begin the iterative Fock procedure a Calculate the Fock matrix F using program FOCK which reads in the MO coefficients from mocoefsdat and the integrals from ao_integralsdat and writes the resulting Fock matrix to a user specified file a good filename to use might be something like fock b Calculate F SFSusing the program UTMATU which reads in F and Sfrom files on the disk and writes F to a user specified file a good filename to use might be something like fockp Diagonalize F using the program DIAG This program reads in the matrix to be diagonalized from a user specified filename and writes the resulting eigenvectors to disk using a user specified filename a good filename to use might be something like coefp You may wish to choose the option to write the eigenvalues Fock orbital energies to disk in order to use them at a later time in program FENERGY Calculate C by using C SC This is accomplished by using the program MATXMAT which reads in two matrices to be multiplied from user specified files and writes the product to disk using a user specified filename a good filename to use might be something like mocoefsdat c The QMIC program FENERGY calculates the total energy khk klkl kllk and ek khk This is the conclusion of one iteration of the Fock procedure you may continue by going back to part a and proceeding onward d and e Results for the successful convergence of this system using the supplied QMIC software are as follows this data is provided to

iteration n SCF converged and plot this data versus iteration number and do a th order polynomial fit we see the following In looking at the polynomial fit we see that the convergence is primarily linear since the coefficient of the linear term is much larger than those of the cubic and higher terms g The converged SCF total energy calculated using the result of problem is an upper bound to the ground state energy but during the iterative procedure it is not Only at convergence does the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for the Hartree Fock determinant become equal to that given by the equation in problem h Yes the s configuration does dissociate properly because at at R the lowest energy state is He H which also has a s orbital occupancy ie s on He and s on H At convergence the MO

configuration to the previous x CI results in the following x full CI H Evaluating the new matrix elements H H H H H e The eigenvalues are E E and E The corresponding eigenvectors are C C C f We need the nonvanishing matrix elements of the dipole operator in the MO basis These can be obtained by calculating them by hand They are more easily obtained by using the TRANS program Put the e AO integrals on disk by running the program RW_INTS In this case you are inserting z z and z insert for all the e integrals call the output file ao_dipoleints for example The converged MOAO coefficients should be in a file mocoefsdat is fine The transformed integrals can be written to a file name of your choice for example mo_dipoleints These matrix elements are z z z The excitation energies are E E and E E Using the SlaterConden rules to obtain the matrix elements between configurations we obtain Hz Now YzY CTHzC this can be accomplished with the program UTMATU T and YzY CTHzC T g Using the converged coefficients the orbital energies obtained from solving the Fock equations are e and e The resulting expression for the PT firstorder wavefunction becomes s s s s s s h As you can see from part c the matrix element sHss this is also a result of the Brillouin theorem and hence this configuration does not enter into the firstorder wavefunction i s s To normalize we divide by s s In the x CI we obtained s s j The expression for the nd order RSPT is E au Comparing the x CI energy obtained to the SCF result we have au STO total energy STOG total energy G total energy The STOG orbitals were generated as a best fit of primitive Gaussians giving CGTO to the STO So STOG can at best reproduce the STO result The G orbitals are more flexible since there are CGTOs per atom This gives orbitals more parameters to optimize and a lower total energy R HeH Energy H Energy Plotting total energy vs geometry for HeH Plotting total energy vs geometry for H For HeH at R au the eigenvalues of the converged Fock matrix and the corresponding converged MOAO coefficients are E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E Notice that this indicates that orbital is a combination of the s functions on He only dissociating properly to He H For H at R au the eigenvalues of the converged Fock matrix and the corresponding converged MOAO coefficients are E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E Notice that this indicates that orbital is a combination of the s functions on both H atoms dissociating improperly equal probabilities of H dissociating to two neutral atoms or to a proton plus hydride ion The H CI result R Sg Su Su Sg For H at R au the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix and the corresponding determinant amplitudes are determinant sgasgb sgbsua sgasub suasub This shows as expected the mixing of the first Sg sg and the nd Sg su determinants in the first and fourth states and the Su and Su states as the second and third states Also notice that the first Sg state has coefficients note specifically the combination and the second Sg state has the opposite coefficients with the same signs note specifically the combination The combination always gives a higher energy than the combination F atoms have ssp P ground electronic states that are split by spinorbit coupling into P and P states that differ by only eV in energy a The degeneracy of a state having a given J is J and the J state is lower in energy because the p orbital shell is more than half filled I learned this in inorganic chemistry class so qel expkT exp eVkT eV is equivalent to k K so kT T hence qel expkT expT b Q qNN so ln Q N lnq lnN E kT lnQT NkT lnqT Nk expT expT c Using the fact that kTeV at TK make a qualitative graph of N vs T for T ranging from K to K At T K EN is small and equal to k exp exp At T K EN has grown to k exp exp which is approximately k a The difference between a linear and bent transition state would arise in the vibrational and rotational partition functions For the linear TS one has N vibrations recall that one loses one vibration as a reaction coordinate but for the bent TS one has N vibrations For the linear TS one has rotational axes and for the bent TS one has So the ratio of rate constants will reduce to ratios of vibration and rotation partition functions In particular one will have klinearkbent qvibN qrotqvibNqrot qvibqrot b Using qt qr qv I would expect klinearkbent to be of the order of Constructing the Slater determinant corresponding to the state sasa with the rows labeling the orbitals and the columns labeling the electron gives sasa Starting

ML papb S ML S ML MS papa S ML MS S ML MS pbpb We can conveniently couple another s electron to the states generated from the ss configuration SL S with sL S giving L S S states and S states SL S with

SSMS sasasa SSMS sbsbsb Applying S to SSMS yields SSSMS SSMS SSMS Ssasasa So SSMS Applying S to SSMS yields SSSMS SSMS SSMS Ssbsbsb So SSMS It only remains to construct the doublet states which are orthogonal to these quartet states Recall that the orthogonal combinations for systems having three equal components for example when symmetry adapting the sp hybrids in Cv or Dh symmetry give results of and Notice that the quartets are the combinations and therefore the doublets can be recognized as SSMS SSMS SSMS SSMS As illustrated in problem a p configuration two equivalent p electrons gives rise to the term symbols P D and S Coupling an additional electron d to this p configuration will give the desired sspd term symbols PLS with DLS generates L and S with term symbols F FD DP and P DLS

deal with time b MC is capable of doing this although MD is also However MC requires fewer computational steps so I would prefer to use it c MC can do this as could MD Again because MC needs fewer computational steps Id use it Suppose you are carrying out a MonteCarlo simulation involving Ar atoms Further suppose that the potentials are pairwise additive and that your computer requires approximately floating point operations FPOs eg multiply add divide etc to compute the interaction potential between any pair of atoms d For each MC move we must compute only the change in potential energy To do this we need to compute only the change in the pair energies that involve the atom that was moved This will require x FPOs the being the number of atoms other than the one that moved So for a million MC steps I would need x x FPOs At x FPOs per second this will require seconds or a little over eight minutes e Because the statistical fluctuations in MC calculations are proportional to N where N is the number of steps taken I will have to take times as many steps to cut the statistical errors in half So this will require x seconds or seconds f If we have one million rather than one thousand atoms the second calculation of part d would require times as much time This ratio arises because the time to compute the change in potential energy accompanying a MC move is proportional to the number of other atoms So the calculation would take x seconds or about seconds or about hours g We would be taking s s per step MD steps Each step requires that we compute all forcesVRIJ between all pairs of atoms There are x such pairs So to compute all the forces would require xx FPOs x FPOs So we will need x FPOsstep x steps FPOs per second x seconds or about hours h The graduate student is times slower than the Mflop computer so it will take herhim times as long so x seconds or about years First Na has a S ground state term symbol whose degeneracy is S Na has a S ground state whose

vibrational partition functions arising in the adsorbed and gasphase species Recall that krate kTh expEkT qTSVqNOV qClV In the gas phase NO has translations two rotations and one vibration Cl has translations two rotations and one vibration the NOCl TS which is bent has translations three rotations and five vibrations recall that one vibration is missing and is the reaction coordinate In the adsorbed state NO has translations one rotation and three vibrations Cl has translations one rotation and three vibrations the NOCl TS which is bent has translations one rotation and eight vibrations again one vibration is missing and is the reaction coordinate So in computing the partition function ratio qTSVqNOV qClV for the adsorbed and gasphase cases one does not obtain the same number of translational rotational and vibrational factors In particular the ratio of these factors for the adsorbed and gasphase cases gives the ratio of rate constants as follows kadkgas qtransVqvib which should be of the order of using the ratio of partition functions as given Notice that this result suggests that reaction rates can be altered by constraining the reacting species to move freely in lower dimensions even if one does not alter the energetics eg activation energy or thermochemistry Contributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools
