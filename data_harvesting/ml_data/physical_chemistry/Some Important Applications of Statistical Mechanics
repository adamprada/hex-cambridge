because they arise frequently when chemists make use of the tools of statistical mechanics These examples include The basic equations connecting the translational rotational vibrational and electronic properties of isolated ie gasphase molecules to their thermodynamics The most basic descriptions of the vibrations of ions atoms or molecules within crystals The most elementary models for describing cooperative behavior and phase transitions in gassurface and liquidliquid systems The contributions of intermolecular forces to the thermodynamics of gases GasMolecule Thermodynamics The equations relating the thermodynamic variables to the molecular partition functions can be employed to obtain the following expressions for the energy heat capacity Helmholz free energy entropy and chemical

Notice that except for the chemical potential all of these quantities are extensive properties that depend linearly on the number of molecules in the system Except for the chemical potential and the pressure all of the variables appearing in these expressions have been defined earlier when we showed the explicit expressions for the translational vibrational rotational and electronic partition functions These are the working equations that allow one to compute thermodynamic properties of stable molecules ions and even reactive species such as radicals in terms of molecular properties such as geometries vibrational frequencies electronic state energies and degeneracies and the temperature pressure and volume Einstein and Debye Models of Solids These two models deal with the vibrations of crystals that involve motions among the neighboring atoms ions or molecules that comprise the crystal These interfragment vibrations are called phonons In the Einstein model of a crystal one assumes that Each atom ion or molecule from which the crystal is constituted is trapped in a potential well formed by its interactions with neighboring species This potential is denoted with the volumetonumber ratio written to keep in mind that it likely depends on the packing density ie the distances among neighbors within the crystal Keep in mind that f represents the interaction of any specific atom ion or molecule with the other such species So not is the total interaction energy among all of the species the factor of is necessary to avoid double counting Each such species is assumed to undergo local harmonic vibrational motions about its equilibrium position within the local well that traps it If the crystal is isotropic the force constants that characterize the harmonic potential along the and directions are equal if not these parameters may be unequal It is these force constants along with the masses of the atoms ions or molecules that determine the harmonic frequencies of the crystal The interspecies phonon vibrational partition function of the crystal is then assumed to be a product of partition functions one for each atom ion or molecule in the crystal with each partition function taken to be of the harmonic vibrational form There is no factor of in the denominator because unlike a gas of species each of these species atoms ions or molecules are constrained to stay put ie not free to roam independently in the trap induced by their neighbors In this sense the species are distinguishable rather than indistinguishable as they are in the gas case The factor arises when one asks what the total energy of the crystal is aside from its vibrational energy relative to separated species in other words what is the total cohesive energy of the crystal This energy is times the energy of any single species but as noted above divided by to avoid double counting the interspecies interaction energies This partition function can be subjected to the thermodynamic equations discussed earlier to compute various thermodynamic properties One of the most useful to discuss for crystals is the heat capacity which is given by see the vibrational contribution to expressed in Section At very high temperatures this function can be shown to approach which agrees with the experimental observation know as the law of Dulong and Petit However at very low temperatures this expression approaches which goes to zero as approaches zero but not in a way that is consistent with experimental observation That is careful experimental data shows that all crystal heat capacities approach zero proportional to at low temperature the Einstein models approaches zero but not in the form found in experiments So although the Einstein model offers a very useful model of how a crystals stability relates to and how its depends on vibrational frequencies of the phonon modes it does not work well at low temperatures Nevertheless it remains a widely used model in which to understand the phonons contributions to thermodynamic properties as long as one does not attempt to extrapolate its predictions to low In the Debye model of phonons in crystals one abandons the view in which each atom ion or molecule vibrates independently about it own equilibrium position and replaces this with a view in which the constituent species vibrate collectively in wavelike motions Each such wave has a wave length and a frequency that are related to the speed of propagation of such waves in the crystal by The speed is a characteristic of the crystals interspecies forces it is large for stiff crystals and small for soft crystals In a manner much like we used to determine the density of quantum states within a threedimensional box one can determine how many waves can fit within a cubic crystalline box having frequencies between and The approach to this problem is to express the allowed wave lengths and frequencies as where is the length of the box on each of its sides and is an integer This prescription forces all wave lengths to match the boundary condition for vanishing at the box boundaries Then carrying out a count of how many waves have frequencies between and for a box whose sides are all equal gives the following expression The primary observation to be made is that the density of waves is proportional to It is conventional to define the parameter a in terms of the maximum frequency that one obtains by requiring that the integral of over all allowed add up to the total number of interspecies vibrations that can occur This then gives the constant a in terms of and and allows to be written as The Debye model uses this wave picture and computes the total energy of the crystal much as done in the Einstein model but with the sum over vibrational modes replaced by a continuous integral over the frequencies weighted by the density of such states see the vibrational contribution to expressed in Section where the integral over ranges from to nm It turns out that the heat capacity obtained by taking the temperature derivative of this expression for can be written as follows where the socalled Debye function is defined by and the integral is taken from to The important thing to be noted about the Debye model is that the heat capacity as defined above extrapolates to at high temperatures thus agreeing with the law of Dulong and Petit and varies at low temperature as So the Debye heat capacity does indeed vary as at low as careful experiments indicate For this reason it is appropriate to use the Debye model whenever one is interested in properly treating the energy heat capacity and other thermodynamic properties of crystals at temperatures for which is small At higher temperatures it is appropriate to use either the Debye or Einstein models The major difference between the two lies in how they treat the spectrum of vibrational frequencies that occur in a crystal The Einstein model says that only one or at most three if three different values are used frequency occurs nu_J dfracpi sqrtdfrack_Jm each species in the crystal is assumed to vibrate at this frequency In contrast the Debye model says that the species vibrate collectively and with frequencies ranging from n up to the socalled Debye frequency which is proportional to the speed at which phonons propagate in the crystal In turn this speed depends on the stiffness ie the interspecies potentials within the crystal Lattice Theories of Surfaces and Liquids This kind of theory can be applied to a wide variety of chemical and physical problems so it is a very useful model to be aware of The starting point of the model is to consider a lattice containing sites each of which has nearest neighbor sites nb clearly will depend on the structure of the lattice and to imagine that each of these sites can exist in either of two states that we label A and B Before deriving the basic equations of this model let me explain how the concepts of sites and A and B states are used to apply the model to various problems The sites can represent binding sites on the surface of a solid and the two states A and B can represent situations in which the site is either occupied A or unoccupied B by a molecule that is chemisorbed or physisorbed to the site This point of view is taken when one applies lattice models to adsorption of gases or liquids to solid surfaces The sites can represent individual spin molecules or ions within a lattice and the states A and B can denote the a and b spin states of these species This point of view allows the lattice models to be applied to magnetic materials The sites can represent positions that either of two kinds of molecules A and B might occupy in a liquid or solid in which case A and B are used to label whether each site contains an A or a B molecule This is how we apply the lattice theories to liquid mixtures The sites can represent cis and trans conformations in linkages within a polymer and A and B can be used to label each such linkage as being either cis or trans This is how we use these models to study polymer conformations In Figure I show a twodimensional lattice having sites of which are occupied by dark A species and are occupied by lighter B species Figure Twodimensional lattice having sites with A and B species The partition function for such a lattice is written in terms of a degeneracy and an energy as usual The degeneracy is computed by considering the number of ways a total of species can be arranged on the lattice The interaction energy among the A and B species for any arrangement of the A and B on the lattice is assumed to be expressed in terms of pair wise interaction energies In particular if only nearest neighbor interaction energies are considered one can write the total interaction energy of any arrangement as where is the number of nearest neighbor pairs of type IJ and is the interaction energy of an IJ pair The example shown in Figure has and The three parameters that characterize any such arrangement can be reexpressed in terms of the numbers and of A and B species and the number of nearest neighbors per site as follows N_BB N_AB cN_B Note that the sum of these two equations states the obvious fact that twice the sum of AA BB and AB pairs must equal the number of A and B species multiplied by the number of neighbors per species Using the above relationships among and we can rewrite the interaction energy as The reason it is helpful to write in this manner is that it allows us to express things in terms of two variables over which one has direct experimental control and and one variable that characterizes the degree of disorder among the A and B species That is if is small the A and B species are arranged on the lattice in a phaseseparated manner whereas if is large the A and B are well mixed The total partition function of the A and B species arranged on the lattice is written as follows Here and are the partition functions electronic vibrational etc of the A and B species as they sit bound to a lattice site and is the number of ways that species of type A and of type B can be arranged on the lattice such that there are AB type nearest neighbors Of course is the interaction energy discussed earlier The sum occurs because a partition function is a sum over all possible states of the system There are no factors because as in the Einstein and Debye crystal models the A and B species are not free to roam but are tied to lattice sites and thus are distinguishable This expression for can be rewritten in a manner that is more useful by employing the earlier relationships for and where The quantity plays a central role in all lattice theories because it provides a measure of how different the AB interaction energy is from the average of the AA and BB interaction energies As we will soon see if is large and negative ie if the AA and BB interactions are highly attractive phase separation can occur if is positive phase separation will not occur The problem with the above expression for the partition function is that no one has yet determined an analytical expression for the degeneracy factor Therefore in the most elementary lattice theory known as the BraggWilliams approximation one approximates the sum over by taking the following average value of in the expression for This average is formed by taking the number of A sites and multiplying by the number of neighbor sites c and by the fraction of these neighbor sites that would be occupied by a B species if mixing were random This approximation produces Finally we realize that the sum is equal to the number of ways of arranging A species and B species on the lattice regardless of how many AB neighbor pairs there are This number is of course So the BraggWilliams lattice model partition function reduces to The most common connection one makes to experimental measurements using this partition function arises by computing the chemical potentials of the A and B species on the lattice and equating these to the chemical potentials of the A and B as they exist in the gas phase In this way one uses the equilibrium conditions equal chemical potentials in two phases to relate the vapor pressures of A and B which arise through the gasphase chemical potentials to the interaction energy Let me now show you how this is done First we use to compute the A and B chemical potentials on the lattice This gives and an analogous expression for with replacing The expression for the gasphase chemical potentials and given earlier in this Chapter has the form mu kT ln leftleftdfracpi mkThbarright dfrackTpright kT lnleftdfracsqrtpisigma sqrtdfracpi I_AkThbar sqrtdfracpi I_BkThbar sqrtdfracpi I_CkThbarright kT sum_JN

mu_Ag mu_A kT lnp_A where is the vapor pressure of A in atmosphere units and denotes all of the other factors in Likewise the latticephase chemical potentials can be written as a term that contains the and dependence and a term that does not where is the mole fraction of A Of course an analogous expression holds for We now perform two steps We equate the gasphase and latticephase chemical potentials of species A in a case where the mole fraction of A is unity This gives where is the vapor pressure of A that exists over the lattice in which only A species are present We equate the gas and latticephase chemical potentials of A for an arbitrary chemical potential and obtain which contains the vapor pressure of A over the lattice covered by A and B with being the mole fraction of A Subtracting these two equations and rearranging we obtain an expression for how the vapor pressure of A depends on Recall that the quantity is related to the interaction energies among various species as Let us examine that physical meaning of the above result for the vapor pressure First if one were to totally ignore the interaction energies ie by taking one would obtain the well known Raoults Law expression for the vapor pressure of a mixture In Figure I plot the A and B vapor pressures vs The two straight lines are of course just the Raoults Law findings I also plot the vapor pressure for three values of the interaction energy parameter When is positive meaning that the AB interactions are more energetically favorable than the average of the AA and BB interactions the vapor pressure of A is found to deviate negatively from the Raoults Law prediction This means that the observed vapor pressure is lower than is that expected based solely on Raoults Law On the other hand when is negative the vapor pressure deviates positively from Raoults Law Figure Plots of vapor pressures in an A B mixture as predicted in the lattice model with the BraggWilliams approximation An especially important and interesting case arises when the parameter is negative and has a value that makes be more negative than It turns out that in such cases the function suggested in this BraggWilliams model displays a behavior that suggests a phase transition may occur Hints of this behavior are clear in Figure where one of the plots displays both a maximum and a minimum but the plots for and for do not Let me now explain this further by examining the derivative of with respect to Setting this derivative to zero in search of a maximum or minimum and solving for the values of that make this possible one obtains Because is a mole fraction it must be less than unity and greater than zero The above result giving the mole fraction at which will not produce a realistic value of unless If there is only one value of ie that produces a zero slope for there will be two such values given by which is what we see in Figure where the plot displays both a maximum and a minimum What does it mean for to be less than and why is this important For to be negative it means that the average of the AA and BB interactions are more energetically favorable than is the AB interactions It is for this reason that a phase separation is may be favored in such cases ie the A species prefer to be near other A species more than to be near B species and similarly for the B species However thermal motion can overcome a slight preference for such separation That is if is not large enough can overcome this slight preference This is why must be less than not just less than zero So the bottom line is that if the AA and BB interactions are more attractive on average than are the AB interactions one can experience a phase separation in which the A and B species do not remain mixed on the lattice but instead gather into two distinct kinds of domains One domain will be rich in the A species having an value equal to that shown in the right dot in Figure The other domains will be rich in B and have an value of that shown by the left dot As I noted in the introduction to this Section lattice models can be applied to a variety of problems We just analyzed how it is applied within the BraggWilliams approximation to mixtures of two species In this way we obtain expressions for how the vapor pressures of the two species in the liquid or solid mixture display behavior that reflects their interaction energies Let me now briefly show you how the lattice model is applied in some other areas In studying adsorption of gases to sites on a solid surface one imagines a surface containing M sites per unit area A with molecules that have been adsorbed from the gas phase bound to these sites In this case the interaction energy introduced earlier involves only interactions among neighboring adsorbed molecules there are no lateral interactions among empty surface sites or between empty surface sites and adsorbed molecules So we can make the following replacements in our earlier equations N_A rightarrow N_ad where is the number of nearest neighbor pairs of adsorbed species and is the pairwise interaction energy between such a pair The primary result obtained by equating the chemical potentials of the gasphase and adsorbed molecules is Here is the partition function of the gasphase molecules per unit volume is the partition function of the adsorbed molecules which contains the adsorption energy as and is called the coverage ie the fraction of surface sites to which molecules have adsorbed Clearly plays the role that the mole fraction played earlier This socalled adsorption isotherm equation allows one to connect the pressure of the gas above the solid surface to the coverage As in our earlier example something unusual occurs when the quantity is negative and beyond a critical value In particular differentiating the expression for with respect to and finding for what values vanishes one finds Since is a positive fraction this equation can only produce useful values if In this case this means that if the attractions between neighboring adsorbed molecules is strong enough it can overcome thermal factors to cause phaseseparation to occur The kind of phase separation on observes is the formation of islands of adsorbed molecules separated by regions where the surface has little or no adsorbed molecules There is another area where this kind of lattice model is widely used When studying magnetic materials one often uses the lattice model to describe the interactions among pairs of neighboring spins eg unpaired electrons on neighboring molecules or nuclear spins on neighboring molecules In this application one assumes that up or down spin states are distributed among the lattice sites which represent where the molecules are located and are the total number such spins so is a measure of what is called the net magnetization of the sample The result of applying the BraggWilliams approximation in this case is that one again observes a critical condition under which strong spin pairings occur In particular because the interactions between a and a spins denoted and between and spins denoted are equal and opposite the variable characteristic of all lattice models reduces to X E_alphabeta E_alphaalpha E_betabeta J The critical condition under which one expects like spins to pair up and thus to form islands of arich centers and other islands of brich centers is or Virial Corrections to IdealGas Behavior Recall from our earlier treatment of classical partition function that one can decompose the total partition function into a product of two factors Q dfrachNMNint exp Big dfracHy pkTBig dy dp int exp BigdfracUrkTBig dr one of which is the result if no intermolecular potentials are operative The second factor Q_rm inter dfracVN int exp BigdfracUrkTBig dr thus contains all of the effects of intermolecular interactions Recall also that all of the equations relating partition functions to thermodynamic properties involve taking and derivatives of So all such equations can be cast into sums of two parts that arising from and that arising from In this Section we will be discussing the contributions of to such equations The first thing that is done to develop the socalled cluster expansion of is to assume that the total intermolecular potential energy can be expressed as a sum of pair wise additive terms where labels the distance between molecule and molecule This allows the exponential appearing in to be written as a product of terms one for each pair of molecules Each of the exponentials is then expressed as follows the last equality being what defines These functions are introduced because whenever the molecules and are distant from one another and thus not interacting vanishes so approaches unity and thus vanishes In contrast whenever molecules and are close enough to experience strong repulsive interactions is large and positive so approaches These properties make a useful measure of how molecules are interacting if they are not if they are repelling strongly and if they are strongly attracting is large and positive Inserting the functions into the product expansion of the exponential one obtains expBigdfracUkTBig prod_IJ f_IJ sum_IJ f_IJ sum_IJ sum_KL f_IJ f_KL cdots which is called the cluster expansion in terms of the pair functions When this expansion is substituted into the expression for we find where the integral is over all of the molecules center of mass coordinates The integrals involving only one function are all equal ie for any pair the molecules are identical in their interaction potentials and reduce to The integrals over produce which combines with to produce the seen Finally because depends only on the relative positions of molecules and the six dimensional integral over can be replaced by integrals over the relative location of the two molecules r and the position of their center of mass The integral over gives one more factor of and the above cluster integral reduces to with the coming from the angular integral over the relative coordinate Because the total number of molecules is very large it is common to write the factor as The cluster integrals containing two factors can also be reduced However it is important to keep track of different kinds of such factors depending on whether the indices are all different or not For example terms of the form with and all unique reduce again using the equivalence of the molecules and the fact that depends only on the relative positions of and J to dfracN pi V int f_ r_ dr_ int f_ r_ dr_ where again I used the fact that is very large to replace by On the other hand cluster integrals with for example but and different reduce as follows Because depends only on the relative positions of molecules and and depends on the relative positions of and the ninedimensional integral over can be changed to a sixdimensional integral over and an integral over the location of molecule the latter integral produces a factor of when carried out Thus the above cluster integral reduces to There is a fundamental difference between cluster integrals of the type and those involving The former are called unlinked clusters because they involve the interaction of molecules and and a separate interaction of molecules and The latter are called linked because they involve molecule interacting simultaneously with molecules and although and need not be close enough to cause to be nonzero The primary differences between unlinked and linked cluster contributions are The total number of unlinked terms is proportional to while the number of linked terms is proportional to This causes the former to be more important than the latter because they are more numerous The linked terms only become important at densities where there is a significant probability that three molecules occupy nearby regions of space The unlinked terms on the other hand do not require that molecules and be anywhere near molecules and This also causes the unlinked terms to dominate especially at low and moderate densities I should note that a similar observation was made in Chapter when we discussed the configuration interaction and coupledcluster expansion of electronic wave functions That is we noted that doubly excited configurations analogous to are the most important contributions beyond the single determinant and that quadruple excitations in the form of unlinked products of double excitations were next most important not triple excitations The unlinked nature in this case was related to the amplitudes of the quadruple excitations being products of the amplitudes of two double excitations So both in electronic structures and in liquid structure one finds that pair correlations followed by unlinked pair correlations are the most important to consider Clearly the cluster expansion approach to can be carried to higher and higherlevel clusters eg involving or etc Generally one finds that the unlinked terms eg in this example are most important because they are proportional to higher powers of and because they do not require more than binary collisions It is most common however to employ a severely truncated expansion and to retain only the linked terms Doing so for produces at the lower levels Q_rm inter dfrac BigdfracNVBig pi V int f r dr dfrac BigdfracNVBig pi V int f r dr One of the most common properties to compute using a partition function that includes molecular interactions in the cluster manner is the pressure which is calculated as Using and inserting the above expression for produces the following result for the pressure where the socalled virial coefficients and are defined as the factors proportional to and respectively The second virial coefficients expression in terms of the cluster integrals is B_ pi int f r dr pi int BigexpBigdfracUrkTBig Big r dr The third virial coefficient involves higher order cluster integrals The importance of such cluster analysis is that they allow various thermodynamic properties eg the pressure above to be expressed as one contribution that would occur if the system consisted of noninteracting molecules and a second contribution that arises from the intermolecular forces It thus allows experimental measurements of the deviation from ideal ie noninteracting behavior to provide a direct way to determine intermolecular potentials For example by measuring pressures at various values and various temperatures one can determine and thus gain valuable information about the intermolecular
