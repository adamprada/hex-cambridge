of classical thermodynamics relies on the properties of reversible processes we have devoted considerable attention to specifying what we mean by a reversible process and to the relationship between reversible processes and the equilibrium states available to a system In Section we develop this theory The development assumes that we can measure the heat and work exchanged between a system and its surroundings It assumes that we can measure the state functions volume pressure temperature and the amounts moles of chemical substances in a system We define other state functions whose values can be computed from these measurable quantities From observations that we make on systems that are undergoing reversible change we develop numerous relationships among these state functions No real system can change in exactly the manner we have in mind when we talk about a reversible process Strictly speaking any process that actually occurs must be spontaneous The idea of reversible change is clearly an abstraction from reality Nevertheless we can determineto a good approximationthe way in which one variable depends on another in a reversible process We accomplish this by making measurements on a real system whose behavior approximates the ideal of reversibility as closely as possible We express theapproximateresult of any such measurement as a number Normally we view the approximate character of the number to be a consequence of experimental error When we say that we make measurements on a system that is undergoing a reversible change we mean that we are making the measurements on a process that satisfies our definition of reversibility closely enough for the purpose at hand There are two reasons for the fact that reversible processes play an essential role in the development of the equations of thermodynamics The first is that we can measure the entropy change for a process only if the process is reversible The second and subtler reason is that an intensive variable may not have a unique value in a system that is undergoing a spontaneous change If the temperature the pressure or the concentration of a component varies from point to point within the system then that state function does not have a unique value and we cannot use it to model the change This occurs for example when gasoline explodes in a cylinder of a piston engine The system consists of the contents of the cylinder At any given instant the pressure temperature and component concentrations vary from place to place within the cylinder In general no single value of any of these intensive variables is an adequate approximation for use in the thermodynamic equations that characterize the system as a whole To explore this idea further let us think about measuring changes in extensive state functions during a spontaneous process Since we are free to define the system as we please we can choose a definition that makes the volume readily measurable In the pistonengine example there is no ambiguity about the volume of the system at any instant While pointtopoint variability means that the concentrations of the chemical components are not defined for the system as a whole we are confident that there is some specific number of moles of each component present in the system at every instant We can reach this conclusion by imagining that we can instantaneously freeze the composition by stopping all reactions We can then find the number of moles of each component at our leisure If the system is not too inhomogeneous we can devise an alternative procedure for makingin conceptsuch composition measurements We imagine dividing the system into a large number of macroscopic subsystems Each of these subsystems has a welldefined volume We suppose also that each of them has welldefined thermodynamic functions at any given instant that is we assume that the pressure temperature and concentrations are approximately homogeneous within each of these subsystems If this condition is satisfied we can sum up the number of moles of a component in each of the subvolumes to obtain the number of moles of that component in the whole system We can make a similar argument for any extensive thermodynamic function so it applies to the energy entropy enthalpy and the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies As long as the pointtopoint variability within the system is small enough so that a division of the system into macroscopic subsystems produces subsystems that are approximately homogeneous we can find the value for any extensive thermodynamic function in each individual subsystem and for the system as a whole The measurement we propose has the character of a gedanken experiment We can describe a procedure for making the measurement whether we can actually perform the procedure or not This argument does not work for intensive thermodynamic functions It is true that we could produce a weightedaverage value for the temperature by multiplying the temperature of each subsystem by the subsystem volume adding up the products and dividing the sum by the volume of the whole system however the result would not be an intensive property of the whole system For one thing we could produce a different average temperature for every extensive variable by using it rather than the volume as the weighting factor in the averagetemperature computation Moreover no such weightedaverage temperature can reflect the fact that different temperatures in different subsystems result in grossly different reaction rates No single temperature represents the state of the whole system and we can make the same statement about any other intensive thermodynamic function For a nonhomogeneous system that can be subdivided into approximately homogeneous macroscopic subsystems we can measure in principle the values of the systems extensive state functions however its intensive state functions are essentially undefined On the other hand we may be able to assume that an effectively homogeneous subsystem of macroscopic proportions does have welldefined extensive and intensive state functions even if it is not in an equilibrium state While a spontaneously changing system need not be homogenous we commonly encounter systems that are homogeneous to within some arbitrarily small deviation Consider a closed and wellstirred system in which some chemical reaction is occurring slowly We immerse this system in a constanttemperature bath and arrange for the applied pressure to be constant From experience we know that the temperature and pressure within such a system will be essentially constant equal to the bath temperature and the applied pressure respectively and homogeneous throughout the system In such a system the temperature and the pressure of the system are at equilibrium with those imposed by the surroundings The chemical process is not at equilibrium but the component concentrations are homogeneous An important question now arises Are all of the equations of equilibrium thermodynamics applicable to a system in which some processes occur spontaneously That they are not is evident from the fact that we can calculate an entropy change from its defining equation only if the behavior of the system is reversible Nevertheless we will find that the relationships among state functions that we derive for reversible processes can be augmented to describe spontaneous processes that occur in homogeneous systems The necessary augmentation consists of the addition of terms that express the effects of changing composition In Section we develop the fundamental equation which applies to any reversible process in a closed system In Section we infer that the fundamental equation becomes for a spontaneous process in which and are the chemical potentialchemical potential and the change in the number of moles of component respectively The distinction between reversiblereversible process and spontaneous processspontaneous processes plays a central role in our theory We find a group of relationships that express this distinction and we call these relationships criteria for change In Section we find that if and only if the process is reversible while if and only if the process is spontaneous We find a close connection between the criteria for change and the compositiondependent terms that are needed to model the thermodynamic functions during spontaneous processes We find that if and only if the process is reversible while if and only if the process is spontaneous In thinking about spontaneous processes we should also keep in mind that the validity of our general relationships among state functions does not depend on our ability to measure the state functions of any particular state of a system For example we can find relationships among the molar volume and other thermodynamic properties of liquid water Liquid water does not exist at C and bar so we cannot undertake to measure its thermodynamic properties However by using our relationships among state functions and properties that we measure for liquid water where it does exist we can estimate the thermodynamic properties of liquid water at C and bar The results are two steps removed from reality they are the estimated properties of a hypothetical substancehypothetical substance Nevertheless they have predictive value for example we can use them to predict that liquid water at C and bar will spontaneously vaporize to form gaseous water at bar The equations of thermodynamics are creatures of theory We should not expect every circumstance that is described by the theory to exist in reality What we require is that the theory accurately describe every circumstance that actually occurs To develop the equations of classical thermodynamics we consider reversible processes We then find general criteria for change that apply to any sort of change in any system Later we devise criteria based on the changes that occur in the composition of the system In this book we consider such compositionbased criteria only for homogeneous systems An extensive theory has been developed to model spontaneous processes in systems that are not necessarily homogeneous This theory is often called irreversible thermodynamics or nonequilibrium thermodynamics Development of this theory has led to a wide variety of useful insights about various molecular processes However much of what we are calling classical thermodynamics also describes irreversible processes Even as we develop our theory of reversible thermodynamics we use arguments that apply the equations we infer from reversible processes to describe closely related systems that are not at equilibrium
