and Attributions The extension of the harmonic and Morse vibrational models to polyatomic molecules requires that the multidimensional energy surface be analyzed in a manner that allows one to approximate the molecules motions in terms of many nearly independent vibrations In this Section we will explore the tools that one uses to carry out such an analysis of the surface but first it is important to describe how one locates the minimumenergy and transitionstate geometries on such surfaces Finding Local Minima Many strategies that attempt to locate minima on molecular potential energy landscapes begin by approximating the potential energy for geometries collectively denoted in terms of Cartesian coordinates in a Taylor series expansion about some starting point geometry ie the current molecular geometry in an iterative process or a geometry that you guessed as a reasonable one for the minimum or transition state that you are seeking Here is the energy at the current geometry is the gradient of the energy along the coordinate is the secondderivative or Hessian matrix and is the length of the step to be taken along this Cartesian direction An example of an energy surface in only two dimensions is given in the Figure where various special aspects are illustrated For example minima corresponding to stable molecular structures transition states first order saddle points connecting such minima and higher order saddle points are displayed Figure Twodimensional potential surface showing minima transition states and paths connecting them If the only knowledge that is available is and the gradient components eg computation of the second derivatives is usually much more computationally taxing than is evaluation of the gradient so one is often forced to work without knowing the Hessian matrix elements the linear approximation suggests that one should choose step elements that are opposite in sign from that of the corresponding gradient elements if one wishes to move downhill toward a minimum The magnitude of the step elements is usually kept small in order to remain within the trust radius within which the linear approximation to is valid to some predetermined desired precision ie one wants to assure that is not too large When second derivative data is available there are different approaches to predicting what step to take in search of a minimum and it is within such Hessianbased strategies that the concept of stepping along independent modes arises We first write the quadratic Taylor expansion in matrixvector notation with the elements collected into the column vector whose transpose is denoted Introducing the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the symmetric matrix the above equation becomes Because is diagonal we have where are the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix For nonlinear molecules of these eigenvalues will be nonzero for linear molecules will be nonzero The or zero eigenvalues of have eigenvectors that describe translation and rotation of the entire molecule they are zero because the energy surface does not change if the molecule is rotated or translated It can be difficult to properly identify the or translation and rotation eigenvalues of the Hessian because numerical precision issues often cause them to occur as very small positive or negative eigenvalues If the molecule being studied actually does possess internal ie vibrational eigenvalues that are very small eg the torsional motion of the methyl group in ethane has a very small energy barrier as a result of which the energy is very weakly dependent on this coordinate one has to be careful to properly identify the translationrotation and internal eigenvalues By examining the eigenvectors corresponding to all of the low Hessian eigenvalues one can identify and thus separate the former from the latter In the remainder of this discussion I will assume that the rotations and translations have been properly identified and the strategies I discuss will refer to utilizing the remaining or eigenvalues and eigenvectors to carry out a series of geometry steps designed to locate energy minima and transition states The eigenvectors of form the columns of the array that brings to diagonal form Therefore if we define and to be the component of the step and of the gradient along the eigenvector of the quadratic expansion of can be written in terms of steps along the or directions that correspond to nonzero Hessian eigenvalues The advantage to transforming the gradient step and Hessian to the eigenmode basis is that each such mode labeled m appears in an independent uncoupled form in the expansion of This allows us to take steps along each of the directions in an independent manner with each step designed to lower the potential energy when we are searching for minima strategies for finding a transition state will be discussed below For each eigenmode direction one can ask for what size step would the quantity be a minimum Differentiating this quadratic form with respect to and setting the result equal to zero gives that is one should take a step opposite the gradient but with a magnitude given by the gradient divided by the eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix If the current molecular geometry is one that has all positive values this indicates that one may be close to a minimum on the energy surface because all are positive at minima In such a case the step is opposed to the gradient along all or directions much like the gradientbased strategy discussed earlier suggested The energy change that is expected to occur if the step is taken can be computed by substituting into the quadratic equation for This clearly suggests that the step will lead downhill in energy along each eigenmode as long as all of the values are positive For example if one were to begin with a good estimate for the equilibrium geometries of ethylene and propene one could place these two molecules at a distance longer than the expected interfragment equilibrium distance in the van der Waals complex formed when they interact Because both fragments are near their own equilibrium geometries and at a distance at which longrange attractive forces will act to draw them together a strategy such as outlined above could be employed to locate the van der Waals minimum on their energy surface This minimum is depicted qualitatively in Figure a Figure a Van der Waals complex upper right formed between ethylene and propene whose geometry might be located using the prescription outlined above Product of the cycloaddition reaction methylcyclobutane lower right Beginning at one would find that of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are nonzero where is the total number of atoms in the ethylenepropene complex Of these nonzero eigenvalues three will have eigenvectors describing radial and angular displacements of the two fragments relative to one another the remaining will describe internal vibrations of the complex The eigenvalues belonging to the interfragment radial and angular displacements may be positive or negative because you made no special attempt to orient the molecules at optimal angles and you may not have guessed very well at optimal the equilibrium interfragment distance so it would probably be wisest to begin the energyminimization process by using gradient information to step downhill in energy until one reaches a geometry at which all of the Hessian matrix eigenvalues are positive From that point on steps determined by both the gradient and Hessian ie can be used unless one encounters a geometry at which one of the eigenvalues is very small in which case the step along this eigenmode could be unrealistically large In this case it would be better to not take for the step along this particular direction but to take a small step in the direction opposite to the gradient to improve chances of moving downhill Such smalleigenvalue issues could arise for example if the torsion angle of propenes methyl group happened during the sequence of geometry steps to move into a region where eclipsed rather than staggered geometries are accessed Near eclipsed geometries the Hessian eigenvalue describing twisting of the methyl group is negative near staggered geometries it is positive Whenever one or more of the are negative at the current geometry one is in a region of the energy surface that is not sufficiently close to a minimum to blindly follow the prescription along all modes If only one is negative one anticipates being near a transition state at which all gradient components vanish and all but one are positive with one negative In such a case the above analysis suggests taking a step along all of the modes having positive but taking a step of opposite direction eg unless is very small in which case a small step opposite is best along the direction having negative if one is attempting to move toward a minimum This is what I recommended in the preceding paragraph when an eclipsed geometry which is a transition state for rotation of the methyl group is encountered if one is seeking an energy minimum Finding Transition States On the other hand if one is in a region where one Hessian eigenvalues is negative and the rest are positive and if one is seeking to find a transition state then taking steps along all of the modes Having positive eigenvalues and taking along the mode having negative eigenvalue is appropriate The steps will act to keep the energy near its minimum along all but one direction and the step will move the system uphill in energy along the direction having negative curvature exactly as one desires when walking uphill in a streambed toward a mountain pass However even the procedure just outlined for finding a transition state can produce misleading results unless some extent of chemical intuition is used Let me give an example to illustrate this point Lets assume that one wants to find begin near the geometry of the van der Waals complex involving ethylene and propene and to then locate the transition state on the reaction path leading to the cycloaddition products methylcyclobutane as also shown in Figure a Consider employing either of two strategies to begin the walk leading from the van der Waals complex to the desired transition state TS One could find the lowest nontranslation or nonrotation Hessian eigenvalue and take a small step uphill along this direction to begin a streambed walk that might lead to the TS Using the smallest Hessian eigenvalue to identify a direction to explore makes sense because it is along this direction that the energy surface rises least abruptly at least near the geometry of the reactants One could move the ethylene radially a bit say Å closer to the propene to generate an initial geometry to begin the TS search This makes sense because one knows the reaction must lead to interfragment carboncarbon distances that are much shorter in the methylcyclobutane products than in the van der Waals complex The first strategy suggested above will likely fail because the series of steps generated by walking uphill along the lowest Hessian eigenmode will produce a path leading from eclipsed to staggered orientation of propenes methyl group Indeed this path leads to a TS but it is not the cycloaddition TS that we want The takehome lesson here is that uphill streambed walks beginning at a minimum on the reactants potential energy surface may or may not lead to the desired TS Such walks are not foolish to attempt but one should examine the nature of the eigenmode being followed to judge whether displacements along this mode make chemical sense Clearly only rotating the methyl group is not a good way to move from ethylene and propene to methylcyclobutane The second strategy suggested above might succeed but it would probably still need to be refined For example if the displacement of the ethylene toward the propene were too small one would not have distorted the system enough to move it into a region where the energy surface has negative curvature along the reaction path as it must have as one approaches the TS So if the Hessian eigenmodes whose eigenvectors possess substantial interfragment radial displacements are all positive one has probably not moved the two fragments close enough together Probably the best way to then proceed would be to move the two fragments even closer or to move them along a linear synchronous path connecting the reactants and products until one finds a geometry at which a negative Hessian eigenvalues eigenmode has substantial components along what appears to be reasonable for the desired reaction path ie substantial displacements leading to shorter interfragment carboncarbon distances Once one has found such a geometry one can use the strategies detailed earlier eg to then walk uphill along one mode while minimizing along the other modes to move toward the TS If successful such a process will lead to the TS at which all components of the gradient vanish and all but one eigenvalue of the Hessian is positive The takehome lesson of the example is it is wise to try to first find a geometry close enough to the TS to cause the Hessian to have a negative eigenvalue whose eigenvector has substantial character along directions that make chemical sense for the reaction path In either a series of steps toward a minimum or toward a TS once a step has been suggested within the eigenmode basis one needs to express that step in terms of the original Cartesian coordinates so that these Cartesian values can be altered within the software program to effect the predicted step Given values for the or step components nb the step components along the or modes having zero Hessian eigenvalues can be taken to be zero because the would simply translate or rotate the molecule one must compute the To do so we use the relationship and write its inverse using the unitary nature of the matrix to compute the desired Cartesian step components In using the Hessianbased approaches outlined above one has to take special care when one or more of the Hessian eigenvalues is small This often happens when one has a molecule containing soft modes ie degrees of freedom along which the energy varies little or as one moves from a region of negative curvature into a region of positive curvature or vice versa in such cases the curvature must move through or near zero For these situations the expression can produce a very large step along the mode having small curvature Care must be taken to not allow such incorrect artificially large steps to be taken Energy Surface Intersections I should note that there are other important regions of potential energy surfaces that one must be able to locate and characterize Above we focused on local minima and transition states Later in this Chapter and again in Chapter we will discuss how to follow socalled reaction paths that connect these two kinds of stationary points using the type of gradient and Hessian information that we introduced earlier in this Chapter It is sometimes important to find geometries at which two BornOppenheimer energy surfaces and intersect because such regions often serve as efficient funnels for trajectories or wave packets evolving on one surface to undergo socalled nonadiabatic transitions to the other surface Lets spend a few minutes thinking about under what circumstances such surfaces can indeed intersect because students often hear that surfaces do not intersect but instead undergo avoided crossings To understand the issue let us assume that we have two wave functions and both of which depend on coordinates These two functions are not assumed to be exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian but likely are chosen to approximate such eigenfunctions To find the improved functions and that more accurately represent the eigenstates one usually forms linear combinations of and from which a x matrix eigenvalue problem arises leftbeginarraycc H_E H_ H_ H_E endarrayright This quadratic equation has two solutions These two solutions can be equal ie the two state energies can cross only if the square root factor vanishes Because this factor is a sum of two squares each thus being positive quantities this can only happen if two identities hold simultaneously ie at the same geometry and The main point then is that in the dimensional space the two states will generally not have equal energy However in a space of two lower dimensions because there are two conditions that must simultaneously be obeyed and their energies may be equal They do not have to be equal but it is possible that they are It is based upon such an analysis that one usually says that potential energy surfaces in dimensions may undergo intersections in spaces of dimension If the two states are of different symmetry eg one is a singlet and the other a triplet the offdiagonal element vanishes automatically so only one other condition is needed to realize crossing So we say that two states of different symmetry can cross in a space of dimension For a triatomic molecule with internal degrees of freedom this means that surfaces of the same symmetry can cross in a space of dimension ie along a line while those of different symmetry can cross in a space of dimension ie in a plane An example of such a surface intersection is shown in Figure c Figure c Depiction of the and BornOppenheimer surfaces arising when Al combines with to form First considering the reaction of Al s p P with to form AlHA_ as if it were to occur in symmetry the atoms occupied p orbital can be directed in either of three ways If it is directed toward the midpoint of the HH bond it produces an electronic state of symmetry If it is directed out of the plane of the it gives a state of symmetry and if it is directed parallel to the HH bond it generates a state of symmetry The state is as shown in the upper left of Figure c repulsive as the Al atoms s and p orbitals begin to overlap with the hydrogen molecules orbital at large values The state in which the occupied p orbital is directed sideways parallel to the HH bond leads to a shallow van der Waals well at longR but also moves to higher energy at shorter values The ground state of the molecule has its five valence orbitals occupied as follows two electrons occupy a bonding AlH orbital of symmetry two electrons occupy a bonding AlH orbital of symmetry and the remaining electron occupies a nonbonding orbital of character localized on the Al atom and having a symmetry This orbital occupancy of the molecules ground state does not correlate directly with any of the three degenerate configurations of the ground state of which are and as explained earlier It is this lack of direct configuration correlation that generates the reaction barrier show in Figure c Let us now return to the issue of finding the lowerdimensional or space in which two surfaces cross assuming one has available information about the gradients and Hessians of both of these energy surfaces and There are two components of characterizing the intersection space within which One has to first locate one geometry lying within this space and then one has to sample nearby geometries eg that might have lower total energy lying within this subspace where To locate a geometry at which the difference function passes through zero one can employ conventional functional minimization methods such as those detailed earlier when discussing how to find energy minima to locate where but now the function one is seeking to locate a minimum on is the potential energy surface difference Once one such geometry has been located one subsequently tries to follow the seam ie for a triatomic molecule this is the onedimensional line of crossing for larger molecules it is a dimensional space within which the function remains zero Professor David Yarkony has developed efficient routines for characterizing such subspaces D R Yarkony Acc Chem Res The basic idea is to parameterize steps away from in a manner that constrains such steps to have no component along either the gradient of or along the gradient of Because requires having both and taking steps obeying these two constraints allows one to remain within the subspace where and are simultaneously obeyed Of course it is a formidable task to map out the entire or dimensional space within which the two surfaces intersect and this is essentially never done Instead it is common to try to find for example the point within this subspace at which the two surfaces have their lowest energy An example of such a point is labeled RMECP in Figure c and would be of special interest when studying reactions taking place on the lowerenergy surface that have to access the surfacecrossing seam to evolve onto the upper surface The energy at RMECP reflects the lowest energy needed to access this surface crossing Such intersection seam location procedures are becoming more commonly employed but are still under very active development so I will refer the reader to Prof Yarkonys paper cited above for further guidance For now it should suffice to say that locating such surface intersections is an important ingredient when one is interested in studying for example photochemical reactions in which the reactants and products may move from one electronic surface to another or thermal reactions that require the system to evolve onto an excited state through a surface crossing Endnotes This is a series of geometries defined through a linear interpolation using a parameter between the Cartesian coordinates belonging to the equilibrium geometry of the
