exploited on a large scale The steam engine played a major role in the industrial revolution and thus in the development of todays technologyintensive economy It was important also in the development of the basic concepts of thermodynamics A steam engine produces work when hot steam under pressure is introduced into a cylinder driving a piston outward A shaft connects the piston to a flywheel When the connecting shaft reaches its greatest extension the spent steam is vented to the atmosphere Thereafter the flywheel drives the piston inward The economic viability of the steam engine derives in part from the fact that the spent steam can be vented to the atmosphere at the end of each cycle However this is not a necessary feature of heat engines We can devise engines that alternately heat and cool a captive working fluid to convert heat energy into mechanical work Stirling engines are practical devices of this type A Carnot engine is a conceptual engine that exploits the response of a closed system to temperature changes A Carnot engine extracts heat from one reservoir at a fixed high temperature and discharges a lesser amount of heat into a second reservoir at a fixed lower temperature An amount of energy equal to the difference between these increments of heat energy appears in the surroundings as work For one cycle of the Carnot engine let the heat transferred to the system from the hot and cold reservoirs be and respectively We have and Let the net work done on the system be and the net work that appears in the surroundings be We have and For one cycle of the engine and since it follows that The energy input to the Carnot engine is and the useful work that appears in the surroundings is The heat accepted by the lowtemperature reservoir is a waste product in the sense that it represents energy that cannot be converted to mechanical work using this cycle All feasible heat engines share this feature of the Carnot engine In contrast a perpetual motion machine of the second kind converts its entire heat intake to work no portion of its heat intake goes unused The efficiency with which the Carnot engine converts the input energy to useful output energy is therefore We can generalize our consideration of heat engines to include any series of changes in which a closed system exchanges heat with its surroundings at more than one temperature delivers a positive quantity of work to the surroundings and returns to its original state We use the Carnot cycle and the machinebased statement of the second law to analyze systems that deliver pressurevolume work to the surroundings We consider both reversible and irreversible systems We begin by considering reversible Carnot cycles If any system reversibly traverses any closed path on a pressurevolume diagram the area enclosed by the path represents the pressurevolume work exchanged between the system and its surroundings If the area is not zero the system temperature changes during the cycle If the cycle is reversible all of the heat transfers that occur must occur reversibly We can apply our reasoning about reversible cycles to any closed system containing any collection of chemical substances so long as any phase changes or chemical reactions that occur do so reversibly This means that all phase and chemical changes that occur in the system must adjust rapidly to the new equilibrium positions that are imposed on them as a system traverses a Carnot cycle reversibly Figure An ideal gas Carnot cycle Note that the pressure axis is compressed In P is plotted vs V In Figure we describe the operation of a reversible Carnot engine in which the working fluid is an ideal gas We designate the systems initial pressure volume and temperature by and From this initial state we cause the ideal gas to undergo a reversible isothermal expansion in which it absorbs a quantity of heat from a hightemperature heat reservoir at We designate the pressure volume and temperature at the end of this isothermal expansion as and In a second step we reversibly and adiabatically expand the ideal gas until its temperature falls to that of the second lowtemperature heat reservoir We designate the pressure volume and temperature at the end of this adiabatic expansion as and We begin the return portion of the cycle by reversibly and isothermally compressing the ideal gas at the temperature of the cold reservoir We continue this reversible isothermal compression until the ideal gas reaches the pressure and volume from which an adiabatic compression will just return it to the initial state We designate the pressure volume and temperature at the end of this isothermal compression by and During this step the ideal gas gives up a quantity of heat to the lowtemperature reservoir Finally we reversibly and adiabatically compress the ideal gas to its original pressure volume and temperature For the hightemperature isothermal step we have and for the lowtemperature isothermal step we have For the adiabatic expansion and compression we have The corresponding energy and work terms are for the adiabatic expansion and for the adiabatic compression The heatcapacity integrals are the same except for the direction of integration they sum to zero and we have The net work done on the system is the sum of the work for these four steps The heat input occurs at the hightemperature reservoir so that The heat discharge occurs at the lowtemperature reservoir so that For one cycle of the reversible idealgas Carnot engine Because the two adiabatic steps involve the same limiting temperatures the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature and for both steps we see from Section that and The integrals over are the same except for the direction of integration They sum to zero so that and Using this result the second equation for the reversible Carnot engine efficiency becomes Equating our expressions for the efficiency of the reversible Carnot engine we find from which we have Since there is no heat transfer in the adiabatic steps and we can write this sum as If we divide the path around the cycle into a large number of very short segments the limit of this sum as the become very small is where the superscript serves as a reminder that the cycle must be traversed reversibly Now we can define a new function by the differential expression In this expression is the incremental change in that occurs when the system reversibly absorbs a small of increment of heat at a particular temperature For an ideal gas traversing a Carnot cycle we have shown that is of course the entropy function described in our entropybased statement of the second law We now want to see what the machinebased statement of the second law enables us to deduce about the properties of Since the change in is zero when an ideal gas goes around a complete Carnot cycle we can conjecture that is a state function Of course the fact that around one particular cycle does not prove that is a state function If is a state function it must be true that around any cycle whatsoever We now prove this for any reversible cycle The proof has two steps In the first we show that for a machine that uses any reversible system operating between two constanttemperature heat reservoirs to convert heat to work In the second step we show that for any system that reversibly traverses any closed path
