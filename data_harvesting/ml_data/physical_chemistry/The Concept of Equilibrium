say that a system is at equilibrium when no further change is possible When we talk about change we always have in mind some particular property We measure the change in the system by the amount of change in this property When the property stops changing we infer that the system has stopped changing and we say that the system has come to equilibrium Of course we may interest ourselves in a system in which many properties undergo change In such cases we recognize that the system as a whole cannot be at equilibrium until all of these properties stop changing On the other hand we also recognize that the absence of observable change is not enough to establish that a system is at equilibrium with respect to all of the possible changes that it could undergo We know that hydrogen burns readily in oxygen to form water but a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen undergoes no change under ordinary conditions This unchanging mixture is plainly not at equilibrium with respect to the combustion reaction Only when a catalyst or an ignition source is introduced does reaction begin It is also possible indeed probable that a system can be at equilibrium with respect to one process and not be at equilibrium with respect to other processes which while possible simply do not occur under the conditions at hand For example if an aqueous solution of the oxygencarrying protein hemoglobin is added to the hydrogenair system the protein will add or lose coordinated oxygen molecules until the equilibrium composition is reached If our investigation is focused on the proteinoxygenation reaction we do not hesitate to say that the system is at equilibrium The nonoccurrence of the oxygenhydrogen reaction is not relevant to the phenomenon we are studying It is even possible to reach a nonequilibrium state in which the concentrations of the reactants and products are constant Such a system is said to have reached a steady state In order for this to occur the reaction must occur in an open system that is one in which materials are being added or removed there must be continuous addition of reactants and continuous removal of products In Chapter we discuss a simple system in which this can be achieved A closed system is one that can neither gain nor lose material An isolated system is a closed system that can neither gain nor lose energy in consequence its volume is fixed In an isolated system change ceases when equilibrium is reached and conversely We will consider several commonly encountered kinds of change including mechanical motions heat transfers phase changes partitioning of a solute between two phases and chemical reactions Here we review briefly what occurs in each of these kinds of change In Chapter we review the characteristics that each of these kinds of change exhibits at equilibrium A system in mechanical equilibrium is stationary because the net force acting on any macroscopic portion of the system is zero Another way of describing such a situation is to say that the system does not move because of the presence of constraints that prevent movement Two macroscopic objects are in thermal equilibrium if they are at the same temperature We take this to be equivalent to saying that if the two objects are in contact with one another no heat flows between them Moreover if object A is in thermal equilibrium with each of two other objects B and C then we invariably find that objects B and C are in thermal equilibrium with one another This observation is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics It justifies the concept of temperature and the use of a standard systema thermometerto measure temperature For an isolated system to be in phase equilibrium it must contain macroscopic quantities of two or more phases and the amount of each phase present must be unchanging For example at K and bar and in the presence of one atmosphere of air liquid water and ice are in equilibrium the amounts of water and ice remain unchanged so long as the system remains isolated Similarly a saturated aqueous solution of copper sulfate is in equilibrium with solid copper sulfate if the system is isolated the amounts of solid and dissolved copper sulfate remain constant If a system is in phase equilibrium we can remove a portion of any phase without causing any change in the other phases At equilibrium the concentrations of species present in the various phases are independent of the absolute amount of each phase present It is only necessary that some amount of each phase be present To describe this property we say that the condition for equilibrium for is the same irrespective of the amounts of the phases present in the particular system For example if one of the species is present in both a gas phase and a condensed phase we can specify the equilibrium state by specifying the pressure and temperature of the system However we can change the relative amounts of the phases present in this equilibrium state by changing the volume of the system If its volume can change the system is not isolated Partitioning of a solute between two immiscible condensed phases is important in many chemical systems If we add water and chloroform to the same vessel two immiscible liquid phases are formed Elemental iodine is very sparingly soluble in water and substantially more soluble in chloroform If we add a small amount of iodine to the waterchloroform system some of the iodine dissolves in the water and the remainder dissolves in the chloroform layer We say that the iodine is distributed between the two phases When the iodine concentrations become constant we say that the system has reached distribution equilibrium In a chemical reaction one or more chemical substances reactants undergo a change to produce one or more new chemical substances products We are accustomed to representing chemical substances by symbols and representing their reactions by chemical equations Thus for the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate we write A chemical equation like this expresses a stoichiometric relationship between reactants and products Often we invoke it as a symbol for various distinctly different physical situations For example We may view the equation as a symbolic representation of a single solution that contains the four compounds ethyl acetate water acetic acid and ethanoland possibly other substances We may view the equation as a symbolic representation of a relationship between two systems whose proportions are arbitrary The first system comprises ethyl acetate and water The second system comprises acetic acid and ethanol The equation represents the idea that the first system can be converted into the second We may view the symbols on each side of the equation as representing mixtures of the indicated chemical substances in the specified stoichiometric proportions We may view the equation as representing the specified stoichiometric proportions of pure unmixed chemical substances When we are discussing changes in standard thermodynamic properties that accompany a chemical reaction this is the interpretation that we have in mind When we discuss a chemical equation the intended interpretation is normally evident from the context Indeed we often skip back and forth among these interpretations in the course of a single discussion Nevertheless it is important to avoid confusing them By doing experiments we can discover that there is an equation that uniquely defines the position of a chemical reaction at equilibrium an equation that we usually think of as the definition of the equilibrium constant If our measurements are not too accurate or we confine our study to a limited range of concentrations or the system is particularly well behaved we can express the equilibrium constant as a function of concentrations For the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate we find In general for the reaction we find That is at equilibrium the indicated function of reactant concentrations always computes to approximately the same numerical value When our concentration measurements are more accurate we find that we must introduce new quantities that we call chemical activities We can think of an activity as a corrected concentration The correction compensates for the effects of intermolecular attraction and repulsion Denoting the activity of substance as we find that gives a fully satisfactory characterization of the equilibrium states that are possible for systems in which this reaction occurs the equilibrium constant computed as a function of reactant activities always has exactly the same numerical value We can develop the equilibrium constant expression from three distinctly different theoretical treatments We develop it first from some basic ideas about the rates of chemical reactions Then we obtain same result from both the macroscopicbehavior considerations of classical thermodynamics and the molecularproperty considerations of statistical thermodynamics Our most basic concept of equilibrium is based on the observation that change in an isolated system eventually ceases once change ceases it never resumes In this book we call the idea of a static state of an isolated system the primitive equilibrium We also observe that change eventually ceases in a closed system that is not isolated but whose temperature pressure and volume are kept constant Conversely if a system is at equilibrium its temperature pressure and volume are necessarily constant all interactions between such a system and its surroundings can be severed without changing any of the properties of the system We can view any particular equilibrium state as a primitive equilibrium state A system whose temperature pressure or volume is established by interactions between the system and its surroundings is inherently more variable than an isolated system For a given isolated system only one equilibrium state exists for a system that interacts with its surroundings many different equilibrium states may be possible In chemical thermodynamics our goal is to develop mathematical models that specify the equilibrium states available to a system we seek models in which the independent variables include pressure temperature volume and other conditions that can be imposed on the system by its surroundings In this conception an equilibrium system is characterized by a set of points in a variable space We can think of this set of points as a surface or a manifold in the variable space every point in the set is a different primitiveequilibrium state of the system By imposing particular changes on some variables a particular equilibrium system can be made to pass continuously through a series of primitiveequilibrium states For reasons that become apparent as we proceed we use the name Gibbsian equilibrium to denote this more general conception When we talk about equilibrium in thermodynamics we usually mean Gibbsian equilibrium In Chapter we see that the idea of Gibbsian equilibrium is closely related to the idea of a reversible process We also introduce Gibbs phase rule which amounts to a more precise definition from the perspective of classical thermodynamics of what we mean by Gibbsian equilibrium in chemical systems
