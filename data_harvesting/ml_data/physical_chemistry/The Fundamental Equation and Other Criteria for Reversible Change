properties of the system let us consider how some thermodynamic functions change when a process is reversible We consider a closed system and focus on making incremental changes in the state of the system For a reversible process we have The reversible pressurevolume work is If nonpressurevolume work is also possible the reversible work becomes where is the increment of reversible nonpressurevolume work The energy change is any reversible process This equation is of central importance It is sometimes called the combined first and second laws of thermodynamics or the fundamental equation It applies to any closed system that is undergoing reversible change It specifies a relationship among the changes in energy entropy and volume that must occur if the system is to remain at equilibrium while an increment of nonpressurevolume work is done on it The burden of our entire development is that any reversible process must satisfy this equation Conversely any process that satisfies this equation must be reversible For a reversible process at constant entropy we have so that Since is the reversible pressurevolume work and the sum is the net work we have reversible process constant S where the subscript specifies that the entropy is constant For a reversible process in which all of the work is pressurevolume work we have and the fundamental equation becomes reversible process only pressurevolume work For a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the energy must change when the entropy changes by and the volume changes by Now let us apply the fundamental equation to an arbitrary process that occurs reversibly and at constant entropy and constant volume Under these conditions and Therefore at constant entropy and volume a necessary and sufficient condition for the process to be reversibleand hence to be continuously in an equilibrium state as the process takes placeis that reversible process and if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that entropy and volume are constant If we consider an arbitrary reversible process that occurs at constant energy and volume we have and and the fundamental equation reduces to reversible process and if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work In this case as noted in the system is isolated In we note that an isolated system in an equilibrium state can undergo no further change Thus the condition defines a unique or primitive equilibrium state If a closed system behaves reversibly any composition changes that occur in the system must be reversible For chemical applications composition changes are of paramount importance We return to these considerations in Chapter where we relate the properties of chemical substancestheir chemical potentialsto the behavior of systems undergoing both reversible and spontaneous composition changes If a closed system behaves reversibly and only pressurevolume work is possible we see from the fundamental equation that specifying the changes in any two of the three variables and is sufficient to specify the change in the system In particular if energy and entropy are constant the volume is also constant and the system is isolated Thus the state of an equilibrium system whose energy and entropy are fixed is unique specifies a primitive equilibrium state We see that the internal consistency of our model passes a significant test From the entropybased statement of the second law we deduce the same proposition that we introduce in as a heuristic conjecture In Chapter we expand on this idea Starting from the fundamental equation we can find similar sets of relationships for enthalpy the Helmholtz free energy and the Gibbs free energy We define For an incremental change in a system we have Using the fundamental equation to substitute for dE this becomes For a reversible process in which all of the work is pressurevolume work we have reversible process only pressurevolume work For a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the enthalpy must change when the entropy changes by and the pressure changes by If a reversible process occurs at constant entropy and pressure then and At constant entropy and pressure the process is reversible if and only if reversible process If only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that entropy and pressure are constant If we consider an arbitrary reversible process that occurs at constant enthalpy and pressure we have and and the total differential for reduces to reversible process and if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work From we have Using the fundamental equation to substitute for we have For a reversible process in which all of the work is pressurevolume work reversible process only pressurevolume work For a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the Helmholtz free energy must change when the temperature changes by and the volume changes by For a reversible isothermal process we have and from we have reversible isothermal process where we recognize that the reversible pressurevolume work is and the work of all kinds is We see that is the total of all the work done on the system in a reversible process at constant temperature This is the reason that is used as the symbol for the Helmholtz free energy is the initial letter in Arbeit a German noun whose meaning is equivalent to that of the English noun work If a reversible process occurs at constant temperature and volume we have and At constant temperature and volume a process is reversible if and only if reversible process If only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that volume and temperature are constant Of course these conditions exclude all work because constant volume implies that there is no pressurevolume work From and the fundamental equation we have For a reversible process in which all of the work is pressurevolume work reversible process only pressurevolume work For a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the Gibbs free energy must change when the temperature changes by and the pressure changes by For a reversible process that occurs at constant temperature and pressure and At constant temperature and pressure the process will be reversible if and only if any reversible process If only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that temperature and pressure are constant In this section we develop several criteria for reversible change stating these criteria as differential expressions Since each of these expressions applies to every incremental part of a reversible change that falls within its scope corresponding expressions apply to finite changes For example we find for every incremental part of a reversible process in which the entropy has a constant value Since we can find the energy change for a finite amount of the process by summing up the energy changes in every incremental portion it follows that reversible process Each of the other differentialexpression criteria for reversible change also gives rise to a corresponding criterion for a finite reversible change These criteria are summarized in In developing the criteria in this section we stipulate that various combinations of the thermodynamic functions that characterize the system are constant We develop these criteria for systems undergoing reversible change consequently the requirements imposed by reversibility must be satisfied also In particular the system must be composed of homogeneous phases and its temperature must be the same as that of the surroundings The pressure of the system must be equal to the pressure applied to it by the surroundings When we specify that a reversible process occurs at constant temperature we mean that When we specify that a reversible process occur at constant pressure we mean that
