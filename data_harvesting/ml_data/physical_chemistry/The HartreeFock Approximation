Koopmans TheoremOrbital Energies and the Total Energy Unfortunately the Hartree approximation ignores an important property of electronic wavefunctions their permutational antisymmetry The full electronic Hamiltonian is invariant ie is left unchanged under the operation in which a pair of electrons have their labels i j permuted We say that commutes with the permutation operator This fact implies that any solution to must also be an eigenfunction of Because permutation operators are idempotent which means that if one applies twice one obtains the identity it can be seen that the eigenvalues of must be either or That is if then but means that so or As a result of commuting with electron permutation operators and of the idempotency of the eigenfunctions must either be odd or even under the application of any such permutation Particles whose wavefunctions are even under are called Bose particles or Bosons those for which is odd are called Fermions Electrons belong to the latter class of particles The simple spinorbital product function used in Hartree theory does not have the proper permutational symmetry For example the Be atom function is not odd under the interchange of the labels of electrons and instead one obtains However such products of spinorbitals ie orbitals multiplied by or spin functions can be made into properly antisymmetric functions by forming the determinant of an matrix whose row index labels the spin orbital and whose column index labels the electron For example the Be atom function produces the matrix whose determinant is shown below leftbeginarraycccc salpha salpha salpha salpha sbeta sbeta sbeta sbeta salpha salpha salpha salpha sbeta sbeta sbeta sbeta endarrayright nonumber Clearly if one were to interchange any columns of this determinant one changes the sign of the function Moreover if a determinant contains two or more rows that are identical ie if one attempts to form such a function having two or more spinorbitals equal it vanishes This is how such antisymmetric wavefunctions embody the Pauli exclusion principle A convenient way to write such a determinant is as follows where the sum is over all N permutations of the spinorbitals and the notation means that a is affixed to any permutation that involves an odd number of pair wise interchanges of spinorbitals and a sign is given to any that involves an even number To properly normalize such a determinental wavefunction one must multiply it by So the final result is that a wavefunction of the form which is often written in shorthand notation as has the proper permutational antisymmetry Note that such functions consist of as sum of factors all of which have exactly the same number of electrons occupying the same spinorbitals the only difference among the terms involves which electron occupies which spinorbital For example in the function appropriate to the excited state of He one has This function is clearly odd under the interchange of the labels of the two electrons yet each of its two components has one electron is a spinorbital and another electron in a spinorbital Although having to make antisymmetric appears to complicate matters significantly it turns out that the Schrödinger equation appropriate to the spinorbitals in such an antisymmetrized product wavefunction is nearly the same as the Hartree Schrödnger equation treated earlier In fact if one variationally minimizes the expectation value of the electron Hamiltonian for the above antisymmetric product wavefunction subject to the condition that the spinorbitals are orthonormal one obtains the following equation for the optimal In this expression which is known as the HartreeFock equation the same kinetic and nuclear attraction potentials occur as in the Hartree equation Moreover the same Coulomb potential appears However one also finds a socalled exchange contribution to the HartreeFock potential that is equal to and is often written in shorthand notation as Notice that the Coulomb and exchange terms cancel for the case this causes the artificial selfinteraction term that can appear in the Hartree equations unless one explicitly eliminates it to automatically cancel with the exchange term in the HartreeFock equations To derive the above HartreeFock equations one must make use of the socalled SlaterCondon rules to express the Hamiltonian expectation value as langlephi_phi_cdots phi_Nphi_NNHphi_phi_cdots phi_Nphi_NNrangle sum_jNlanglephi_jrfracnablafracerphi_jrrangle fracsum_jkNleft langlephi_jrphi_krfracerrphi_jrphi_krrangle langlephi_jrphi_krfracerrphi_krphi_jrranglerightnonumber This expectation value is a sum of terms the kinetic energy and electronnuclear Coulomb potentials that vary quadratically on the spinorbitals ie as plus another sum the Coulomb and exchange electronelectron interaction terms that depend on the fourth power of the spinorbitals ie as When these terms are differentiated to minimize the expectation value they generate factors that scale linearly and with the third power of the spinorbitals These are the factors and appearing in the HartreeFock equations shown above When the LCAO expansion of each HartreeFock HF spinorbital is substituted into the above HF Schrödinger equation a matrix equation is again obtained where the overlap integral is as defined earlier and the matrix element is Clearly the only difference between this expression and the corresponding result of Hartree theory is the presence of the last term the exchange integral The SCF iterative procedure used to solve the Hartree equations is again used to solve the HF equations It is useful to reflect on the physical meaning of the Coulomb and exchange interactions between pairs of orbitals For example the Coulomb integral appropriate to the two orbitals shown in Figure represents the Coulombic repulsion energy of two charge densities and integrated over all locations and of the two electrons Figure An s and a p Orbital and Their Overlap Region In contrast the exchange integral can be thought of as the Coulombic repulsion between two electrons whose coordinates and are both distributed throughout the overlap region This overlap region is where both and have appreciable magnitude so exchange integrals tend to be significant in magnitude only when the two orbitals involved have substantial regions of overlap Finally a few words are in order about one of the most computer timeconsuming parts of any HartreeFock calculation or those discussed later the task of evaluating and transforming the twoelectron integrals When M GTOs are used as basis functions the evaluation of of these integrals often poses a major hurdle For example with basis orbitals there will be of the order of x such integrals With each integral requiring words of disk storage most integrals need to be evaluated in double precision this would require at least x Mwords of disk storage Even in the era of modern computers that possess Gby disks this is a significant requirement One of the more important technical advances that is under much current development is the efficient calculation of such integrals when the product functions and that display the dependence on the two electrons coordinates r and r are spatially distant In particular socalled multipole expansions of these product functions are used to obtain more efficient approximations to their integrals when these functions are far apart Moreover such expansions offer a reliable way to ignore ie approximate as zero many integrals whose product functions are sufficiently distant Such approaches show considerable promise for reducing the twoelectron integral list to one whose size scales much less strongly with the size of the AO basis and form an important component if efforts to achieve CPU and storage needs that scale linearly with the size of the molecule Koopmans Theorem The HFSCF equations imply that the orbital energies can be written as where represents the kinetic and nuclear attraction energies respectively Thus is the average value of the kinetic energy plus Coulombic attraction to the nuclei for an electron in plus the sum over all of the spinorbitals occupied in of Coulomb minus Exchange interactions of these electrons with the electron in If is an occupied spinorbital the term disappears in the above sum and the remaining terms in the sum represent the Coulomb minus exchange interaction of with all of the other occupied spinorbitals If is a virtual spinorbital this cancelation does not occur because the sum over does not include So one obtains the Coulomb minus exchange interaction of with all of the occupied spinorbitals in Hence the energies of occupied orbitals pertain to interactions appropriate to a total of electrons while the energies of virtual orbitals pertain to a system with electrons This difference is very important to understand and to keep in mind Let us consider the following model of the detachment or attachment of an electron in an electron system In this model both the parent molecule and the species generated by adding or removing an electron are treated at the singledeterminant level The HartreeFock orbitals of the parent molecule are used to describe both species It is said that such a model neglects orbital relaxation ie the reoptimization of the spinorbitals to allow them to become appropriate to the daughter species Within this model the energy difference between the daughter and the parent can be written as follows represents the particular spinorbital that is added or removed for electron detachment and for electron attachment Lets derive this result for the case in which an electron is added to the spinorbital Again using the SlaterCondon rules from Section of this Chapter the energy of the electron determinant with spinorbitals through occupied is which can also be written as Likewise the energy of the electron determinant wavefunction is The difference between these two energies is given by That is the energy difference is equal to minus the expression for the energy of the spinorbital which was given earlier So within the limitations of the HF frozenorbital model the ionization potentials IPs and electron affinities EAs are given as the negative of the occupied and virtual spinorbital energies respectively This statement is referred to as Koopmans theorem it is used extensively in quantum chemical calculations as a means of estimating IPs and EAs and often yields results that are qualitatively correct ie eV Orbital Energies and the Total Energy The total HFSCF electronic energy can be written as and the sum of the orbital energies of the occupied spinorbitals is given by These two expressions differ in a very important way the sum of occupied orbital energies double counts the Coulomb minus exchange interaction energies Thus within the HartreeFock approximation the sum of the occupied orbital energies is not equal to the total energy This finding teaches us that we can not think of the total electronic energy of a given orbital occupation in terms of the orbital energies alone We need to also keep track of the interelectron Coulomb and Exchange energies
