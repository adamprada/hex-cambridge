One of our primary objectives is to understand the ideas that are embodied in these laws We introduce these ideas here using statements of the laws of thermodynamics that are immediately applicable to chemical systems In the next three chapters we develop some of the most important consequences of these ideas In the course of doing so we examine other ways that these laws have been stated The first law deals with the definition and properties of energy The second and third laws deal with the definition and properties of entropy The laws of thermodynamics assert that energy and entropy are state functions In the next chapter we discuss the mathematical properties of state functions Energy and entropy changes are defined in terms of the heat and work exchanged between a system and its surroundings We adopt the convention that heat and work are positive if they increase the energy of the system In a process in which a closed system accepts increments of heat and work from its surroundings we define the changes in the energy and the entropy of the system in terms of and the temperature The meaning of the first law is intimately related to a crucial distinction between the character of energy on the one hand and that of the variables heat and work on the other When we say that energy is a state function we mean that the energy is a property of the system In contrast heat and work are not properties of the system rather they describe a process in which the system changes When we say that the heat exchanged in a process is we mean that units of thermal energy are transferred from the surroundings to the system If the energy of the system increases by this amount and the energy of the surroundings decreases by the same amount has meaning only as a description of one aspect of the process When the process is finished the system has an energy but exists only as an accounting record Like the amount on a cancelled check that records how much we paid for something is just a datum about a past event Likewise is the record of the amount of nonthermal energy that is transferred Because we can effect the same change in the energy of a system in many different ways we have to measure and for a particular process as the process is taking place We cannot find them by making measurements on the system after the process has gone to completion In Section we introduce a superscripted caret to denote a property state function of the surroundings Thus is the energy of the system is the energy of the surroundings is an incremental change in the energy of the system and is an incremental change in the energy of the surroundings If we are careful to remember that heat and work are not state functions it is useful to extend this notation to increments of heat and work If units of energy are transmitted to the system as heat we let be the thermal energy transferred to the surroundings in the same process Then and Likewise we let be the work done on the system and be the work done on the surroundings in the same process so that and Unlike and which are properties of different systems and or and are merely alternative expressions of the same thingthe quantity of energy transferred as heat or work We define the incremental change in the energy of a closed system as The accompanying change in the energy of the surroundings is so that Whereas or is a tautology because it merely defines as the first law asserts that is a fundamental property of nature Any increase in the energy of the system is accompanied by a decrease in the energy of the surroundings and conversely Energy is conserved heat is not work is not The first law of thermodynamics In a process in which a closed system accepts increments of heat and work from its surroundings the change in the energy of the system is Energy is a state function For any process For a reversible process in which a system passes from state A to state B the amount by which the energy of the system changes is the line integral of along the path followed Denoting an incremental energy change along this path as we have We review line integrals in the next chapter The energy change for the surroundings is the line integral of along the path followed by the surroundings during the same process For any process in which energy is exchanged with the surroundings the change in the systems energy is where and are the amounts of thermal and nonthermal energy delivered to the system We can compute from and whether the process is reversible or irreversible In contrast the definition of entropy change applies only to reversible processes In a process in which a system reversibly accepts an increment of heat from its surroundings the entropy change is defined by We introduce the superscript rev to distinguish heat and work exchanged in reversible processes from heat and work exchanged in irreversible irrev or spontaneous spon processes When a system passes reversibly from state A to state B the entropy change for the system is the line integral of along the path followed The entropy change for the surroundings is defined by the same relationship Every system has an entropy The entropies of the system and of its surroundings can change whenever a system undergoes a change If the change is reversible The second law of thermodynamics In a reversible process in which a closed system accepts an increment of heat from its surroundings the change in the entropy of the system is Entropy is a state function For any reversible process and conversely For any spontaneous process and conversely We define the entropy change of the universe by it follows that for any process in which a system passes from a state A to a state B whether the process is reversible or not Since for every part of a reversible process we have for any reversible process Likewise since for every part of a spontaneous process we have for any spontaneous process The third law deals with the properties of entropy at temperatures in the neighborhood of absolute zero It is possible to view the third law as a statement about the properties of the temperature function It is also possible to view it as a statement about the properties of heat capacities A statement in which the third law attributes particular properties to the entropy of pure substances is directly applicable to chemical systems This statement is that of Lewis and Randall third law of thermodynamics If the entropy of each element in some crystalline state be taken as zero at the absolute zero of temperature every substance has a positive finite entropy but at the absolute zero of temperature the entropy may become zero and does so become in the case of perfect crystalline substances The Lewis and Randall statement focuses on the role that the third law plays in our efforts to express the thermodynamic properties of pure substances in useful ways To do so it incorporates a matter of definition when it stipulates that the entropy of each element be taken as zero at the absolute zero of temperature The third law enables us to find thermodynamic properties absolute entropies and Gibbs free energies of formation from which we can make useful predictions about the equilibrium positions of reactions The third law can be inferred from experimental observations on macroscopic systems It also arises in a natural way when we develop the theory of statistical thermodynamics In both developments the choice of zero for the entropy of each element in some crystalline state at absolute zero iswhile arbitrarylogical natural and compellingly convenient
