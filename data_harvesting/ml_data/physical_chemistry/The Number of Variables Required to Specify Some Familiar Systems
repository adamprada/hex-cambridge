itproperties that we can treat as variables in our model In Section we found that the size of the system does not matter when we consider the variables that specify an equilibrium state A halfsize version of an equilibrium system has the same equilibrium properties We can say that only intensive properties are relevant to the question of whether a system is at equilibrium The idea that we can subdivide a system without changing its equilibrium properties is subject to an important qualification We intend that both subsystems be qualitatively equivalent to the original For example if we divide a system at vaporliquid equilibrium into subsystems each subsystem must contain some liquid and some vapor If we subdivide it into one subsystem that is all liquid and another that is all vapor the subsystems are not qualitatively equivalent to the original We can be more precise about the criterion we have in mind An equilibrium system consists of one or more homogenous phases Two systems can be in the same equilibrium condition only if all of the phases present in one are also present in the other If a process changes the number of phases present in a system we consider that the system changes from one kind of equilibrium system to a second one We can describe one kind of equilibrium system by specifying a sufficient number of intensive variables This description will be complete to within a specification of the exact amount of each phase present If we apply these ideas to a macroscopic sample of a pure gas we know that we need four variables to completely describe the state of the gas the number of moles of the gas its pressure its volume and its temperature This assumes that we are not interested in the motion of the container that contains the gas It assumes also that no other extrinsic factorslike gravitational electric or magnetic fields affect the behavior that we propose to model When we do experiments in which the amount pressure volume and temperature of a pure gas vary we find that we can develop an equation that relates the values that we measure We call this an equation of state because it is a mathematical model that describes the state of the system In Chapter we reviewed the ideal gas equation van der Waals equation and the virial equation however we can devise many others Whatever equation of state we develop we know that it must have a particular property At constant pressure and temperature the volume must be directly proportional to the number of moles This means that any equation of state can be rewritten as a function of concentration For the case of an ideal gas we have where the number of moles per unit volume is the gas concentration We see that any equation of state can be expressed as a function of three intensive variables pressure temperature and concentration The existence of an equation of state means that only two of the three intensive variables that describe the gas sample are independent of one another At equilibrium a sample of pure gas has two degrees of freedom Viewed as a statement about the mathematical model this is true because knowledge of the equation of state and any two of the intensive variables enables us to calculate the third variable Viewed as a statement about our experimental observations this is true because so long as the changes are consistent with the system remaining a gas we can change any two of these variables independently That only two are independent is shown experimentally by the observation that we can start with a fixed quantity of gas at any pressure temperature and concentration and find after taking the system through any sequence of changes whatsoever that returning to the original pressure and temperature also restores the original concentration In the experiment or in the mathematical model fixing two of the three intensive variables is sufficient to fix the equilibrium properties of the system Fixing the equilibrium properties means of course that the state of the system is fixed to within an arbitrary factor which can be specified either as the number of moles present or as the system volume Similar results are obtained when we study the pressurevolumetemperature behavior of pure substances in condensed phases At equilibrium a pure liquid or a pure solid has two degrees of freedom If we consider a homogeneous mixture of two nonreacting gases we discover that three variables are necessary to fix the equilibrium properties of the system We must know the pressure and temperature of the system and the concentration of each gas Because the mixture must obey an equation of state determination of any three of these variables is sufficient to fix the value of the fourth Note that we can conclude that three intensive variables are sufficient to determine the equilibrium properties of the system even if we do not have a mathematical model for the equation of state If we experiment with a system in which the liquid and vapor of a pure substance are in phase equilibrium with one another we find that there is only one independent intensive variable Figure illustrates this for water To maintain phase equilibrium the system pressure must be the equilibrium vapor pressure of the substance at the system temperature If we keep the pressure and temperature constant at equilibrium values we can increase or decrease the concentration moles per unit system volume by removing or adding heat In this process we change one variable concentration while maintaining phase equilibrium If we keep the pressure constant and impose a temperature increase vaporization continues the concentration decreases until the liquid phase is completely consumed In this process two variables change and phase equilibrium cannot be maintained To reach a new equilibrium state in which both liquid and gas are present at a higher temperature we must increase the pressure to the new equilibrium vapor pressure the magnitude of the temperature increase completely determines the required pressure increase Two intensive variables change but the changes are not independent If we have pure gas there are two independent intensive variables If we have pure liquid there are two independent intensive variables However if we have liquid and gas in equilibrium with one another there is only one independent intensive variable In the liquid region of the water phase diagram we can vary pressure and temperature and the system remains liquid water Along the liquidgas equilibrium line we can vary the temperature and remain at equilibrium only if we simultaneously vary the pressure so as to remain on the liquidgas equilibrium line Similar statements apply if we contrast varying pressure and temperature for the pure solid to varying the pressure and temperature along the solidliquid or the solidgas equilibrium line At the triple point nothing is variable For a fixed quantity of water the requirement that the system be at equilibrium at the triple point fixes the system pressure temperature and concentration Evidently maintaining a phase equilibrium in a system imposes a constraint that reduces the number of intensive variables that we can control independently The equilibrium between water and ice is completely unaffected by the state of subdivision of the ice The ice can be present in a single lump or as a large number of very small pieces from experience we know that the equilibrium behavior of the system is the same so long as some ice and some water are both present A system contains as many phases as there are kinds of macroscopic homogeneous bounded portions that are either solid liquid or gas If we add a lump of pure aluminum to our icewater system the new system contains three phases water ice and aluminum The equilibrium properties of the new system are the same if the aluminum is added as a groundup powder The powder contains many macroscopic homogeneous bounded portions that are aluminum but each of these portions has the same composition there is only one kind of aluminum particle Molecules on the surface of a substance can behave differently from those in the bulk When a substance is very finely divided the fraction of the molecules that is on the surface can become large enough to have a significant effect on the behavior of the system In this book we do not consider systems whose behavior is surfacearea dependent
