concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium We deduce it above from a simple model for the concentration dependence of elementaryreaction rates In doing so we use the criterion that the time rate of change of any concentration must be zero at equilibrium Clearly this is a necessary condition if any concentration is changing with time the reaction is not at equilibrium However our deduction uses another assumption that we have not yet emphasized We assume that the forward and reverse rates of each elementary step are equal when the overall reaction is at equilibrium This is a special case of the principle of microscopic reversibility Definition Principle of Microscopic Reversibility Any molecular process and its reverse occur with equal rates at equilibrium The principle of microscopic reversibility applies to any molecular process it is inferred from the fact that such processes can be described by their equations of motion if the initial state of the constituent particles can be specified The equations of motion can be either classical mechanical or quantum mechanical We consider the implications of the principle for molecular processes that constitute elementary reactions However the principle also applies to equilibria in other molecular processes notably the absorption and emission of radiation When we apply it to elementary reactions we see that the principle of microscopic reversibility provides a necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium from a reactionmechanism perspective The principle also imposes several significant conditions on the sequences of elementary processes that constitute a mechanism and on their relative rates In the previous section we see that microscopic reversibility provides a sufficient basis for deducing the relationship relating reactant and product concentrations at equilibriumthe equilibrium constant expressionfrom our rate equations for elementary reactions We now want to see that the principle of microscopic reversibility is indeed necessary That is setting for all species involved in the reaction is not in itself sufficient to assure that the system is at equilibrium Figure Cyclic equilibrium We consider the triangular network of elementary reactions shown in Figure This network gives rise to the following reactionrate equations At equilibrium each of these equations must equal zero Since we have three equations in three unknowns it might at first appear that we can solve for the three unknowns and We can see however either from the equations themselves or by considering the physical situation that they represent that only two of these equations are independent That is we have While we cannot solve for and independently we can solve for their ratios which are Since we deduce these equations from the condition that all the time derivatives are zero it might seem that they should represent the criteria for the system of reactions to be at equilibrium Purely as a name for easy reference let us call these equations the cyclic equilibrium set When we consider the reactions one at a time we deduce the following equilibrium relationships For easy reference let us call these equations the oneatatime set Now it cannot be true that both sets of relationships specify a sufficient condition for the system to be at equilibrium To see this let us first suppose that the principle of microscopic reversibility is a sufficient condition for equilibrium Then the oneatatime set of equations must be sufficient to uniquely specify the position of equilibrium It is easy to show that a set of rate constants that satisfies the oneatatime set also satisfies the cyclic set Therefore if microscopic reversibility is a sufficient condition for equilibrium the cyclic network rate equations are necessarily equal to zero at equilibrium In short if we assume that microscopic reversibility is a sufficient condition for equilibrium we encounter no inconsistencies because the cyclic set of equations is satisfied by the same equilibriumconcentration ratios On the other hand if we suppose that setting for all species is a sufficient condition for equilibrium then the cyclic set of equations must be sufficient to uniquely specify the position of equilibrium Let us consider a particular set of rate constants and This set of rate constants satisfies the cyclic set of equations and requires that each of the equilibriumconcentration ratios be equal to In this case the oneatatime set of equations implied by microscopic reversibility cannot be satisfied We have and Therefore That is if we assume that setting for all species is a sufficient condition for equilibrium we must conclude that the principle of microscopic reversibility is false Using the contrapositive If the principle of microscopic reversibility is true it is false that setting for all species is a sufficient condition for equilibrium Figure Potential energy versus reaction coordinate Setting the derivatives for the reaction network equal to zero is not sufficient to assure that the system is at equilibrium It is merely necessary To assure that the network is at equilibrium we must apply the principle of microscopic reversibility and require that each elementary process in the network be at equilibrium The principle of microscopic reversibility requires that any elementary process occur via the same sequence of transitory molecular structures in both the forward and reverse directions Consequently if a sequence of elementary steps is a mechanism for a forward reaction the same sequence of stepstraversed backwardsmust be a mechanism for the reverse reaction The principle does not exclude the possibility that a given reaction can occur simultaneously by two different mechanisms However it does mean that a given reaction cannot have one mechanism in the forward direction and a second different mechanism in the reverse direction In describing reaction mechanisms we assume that the energy of the reacting molecules depends on their progress along the path that they follow during the course of the reaction We call this path the reaction coordinate We suppose that we can plot the energy of the system as a function of the systems position on the path or displacement along the reaction coordinate In the context of such a graph the principle of microscopic reversibility is essentially the observation that the path is the same irrespective of the direction in which it is traversed Two such paths are sketched in Figure In this sketch and are the activation energies for the two forward reactions and are the activation energies for the reverse reactions
