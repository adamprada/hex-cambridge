No headers To form Hamiltonian matrix elements between any pair of Slater determinants constructed from spinorbitals that are orthonormal one uses the socalled SlaterCondon rules These rules express all nonvanishing matrix elements involving either one or two electron operators Oneelectron operators are additive and appear as twoelectron operators are pairwise additive and appear as The SlaterCondon rules give the matrix elements between two determinants and for any quantum mechanical operator that is a sum of one and two electron operators It expresses these matrix elements in terms of oneand twoelectron integrals involving the spinorbitals that appear in and and the operators and As a first step in applying these rules one must examine and and determine by how many if any spinorbitals and differ In so doing one may have to reorder the spinorbitals in one of the determinants to achieve maximal coincidence with those in the other determinant it is essential to keep track of the number of permutations that one makes in achieving maximal coincidence The results of the SlaterCondon rules given below are then multiplied by to obtain the matrix elements between the original and The final result does not depend on whether one chooses to permute or to determine The Hamiltonian is of course a specific example of such an operator that contains both one and twoelectron components the electric dipole operator and the electronic kinetic energy are examples of oneelectron operators for which one takes the electronelectron coulomb interaction is a twoelectron operator for which one takes The two Slater determinants whose matrix elements are to be determined can be written as where the spinorbitals and appear in the first and second determinants respectively and the operators and describe the permutations of the spinorbitals appearing in these two determinants The factors and are the signs associated with these permutations as discussed earlier in Section Any matrix element involving one and twoelectron operators needs to be expressed in terms of integrals involving the spinorbitals in the two determinants and the one and twoelectron operators To simplify the above expression which contains terms in its two summations one proceeds as follows a Use is made of the identity to move the permutation operator to just before the langle P

b Because and contain sums over all electrons in a symmetric fashion any permutation acting on leaves these sums unchanged So commutes with and with This allows the above quantity to be rewritten as c For any permutation operator the operator is just another permutation operator Moreover for any the set of all operators runs over all permutations and the sign associated with the operator is the sign belonging to times the sign associated with So the double sum ie over and over appearing in the above expression for the general matrix element of contains identical sums over the single operator of the sign of this operator multiplied by the effect of this operator on the spinorbital product on the righthand side langle FGrangle fracsqrtNN sum_PQ pq langle phi_phi_cdotsphi_kkcdotsphi_nncdots phi_NN FG PQ phi_phi_cdotsphi_kkcdotsphi_nncdotsphi_NNrangle By assumption as explained earlier the two Slater determinants have been compared and arranged in an order of maximal coincidence and the factor needed to bring them into maximal coincidence has been determined So let us begin by assuming that the two determinants differ by three spinorbitals and let us first consider the terms arising from the identity permutation ie the permutation that alters none of the spinorbitals labels These terms will involve integrals of the form where the threespin orbitals that differ in the two determinants appear in positions and In these dimensional spatial and spin coordinate for each of electrons integrals a Integrals of the form for all or and for all i and or vanish because the spinorbitals appearing in positions and in the two determinants are orthogonal to one another For the operator even integrals with or vanish because there are still two spinorbital mismatches at the other two locations among and For the operator even integrals with or or vanish because two mismatches remain and even with both and or the integrals vanish because one spinorbital mismatch remains The main observation to make is that even for if there are three spinorbital differences neither the nor operator gives rise to any nonvanishing results b If we now consider any other permutation the situation does not improve because any permutation cannot alter the fact that three spinorbital mismatches do not generate any nonvanishing results If there are only two spinorbital mismatches say in locations and the integrals we need to evaluate are of the form and c Again beginning with we can conclude that all of the integrals involving the operator ie and vanish because the two spinorbital mismatch is too much even for or to overcome at least one spinorbital orthogonality integral remains For the operator the only nonvanishing result arises from the and term d The only other permutation that generates another nonvanishing result is the permutation that interchanges and and it produces where the negative sign arises from the factor All other permutations would interchange other spinorbitals and thus generate orthogonality integrals involving other electrons coordinates If there is only one spinorbital mismatch say in location the integrals we need to evaluate are of the form and e Again beginning with the only nonvanishing contribution from the operator is For all other permutations the operator produces no nonvanishing contributions because these permutations generate orthogonality integrals For the operator and the only nonvanishing contributions are where the sum over runs over all of the spinorbitals that are common to both of the two determinants f Among all other permutations the only one that produces a nonvanishing result are those that permute the spinorbital in the kth location with another spinorbital and they produce The minus sign arises from the factor associated with this pair wise permutation operator Finally if there is no mismatch ie the two determinants are identical then g The identity permutation generates from the operator and from the operator h The permutation that interchanges spinorbitals in the kth and jth location produces The summations over and appearing above can alternatively be written as and So in summary once maximal coincidence has been achieved the SlaterCondon SC rules provide the following prescriptions for evaluating the matrix elements of any operator containing a oneelectron part and a twoelectron part If and are identical then where the sums over and run over all spinorbitals in If and differ by a single spinorbital mismatch where the sum over runs over all spinorbitals in except If and differ by two spinorbitals and note that the contribution vanishes in this case If and differ by three or more spin orbitals then or the identity operator the matrix elements if and differ by one or more spinorbitals ie the Slater determinants are orthonormal if their spinorbitals are In these expressions is used to denote the oneelectron integral and or in short hand notation represents the twoelectron integral The notation introduced above gives the twoelectron integrals for the operator in the socalled Dirac notation in which the and indices label the spinorbitals that refer to the coordinates and the and l indices label the spinorbitals referring to coordinates The and denote and with and being the or spin functions If the operators and do not contain any electron spin operators then the spin integrations implicit in these integrals all of the are spinorbitals so each is accompanied by an or spin function and each involves the adjoint of one of the or spin functions can be carried out using thereby yielding integrals over spatial orbitals
