of the second law is such a generalization Let us consider the kinds of familiar observations from which we infer that every equilibrium state of any system is intersected by one and only one adiabat and by one and only one isotherm When only pressurevolume work is possible each pressurevolume point specifies a unique equilibrium state of the system Since temperature is a state function the temperature of this state has one and only one value When another form of work is possible every point specifies a unique state for which the temperature has one and only one value From experience we know that we can produce a new state of the system at the same temperature by exchanging heat and work with it in a concerted fashion We can make this change of state arbitrarily small so that successive equilibrium states with the same temperature are arbitrarily close to one another This succession of arbitrarily close equilibrium states is an isotherm Therefore at least one isotherm intersects any equilibrium state There cannot be two such isotherms If there were two isotherms the system would have two temperatures violating the principle that temperature is a state function In an adiabatic process the system exchanges energy as work but not as heat From experience we know that we can effect such a change with any reversible system The result is a new equilibrium state When we make the increment of work arbitrarily small the new equilibrium state is arbitrarily close to the original state Successive exchanges of arbitrarily small work increments produce successive equilibrium states that are arbitrarily close to one another This succession of arbitrarily close equilibrium states is an adiabat If the same state of a system could be reached by two reversible adiabats involving the same form of work the effect of doing a given amount of this work on an equilibrium system would not be unique From the same initial state two reversible adiabatic experiments could do the same amount of the same kind of work and reach different final states of the system For example in two different experiments we could raise a weight reversibly from the same initial elevation do the same amount of work in each experiment and find that the final elevation of the weight is different Any such outcome conflicts with the observations that underlie our ideas about reversible processes More specifically the existence of two adiabats through a given point in any space violates the machinebased statement of the second law Two such adiabats would necessarily intersect a common isotherm A path along one adiabat the isotherm and the second adiabat would be a cycle that restored the system to its original state This path would enclose a finite area Traversed in the appropriate direction the cycle would produce work in the surroundings By the first law the system would then accept heat as it traverses the isotherm The system would exchange heat with surroundings at a single temperature and produce positive work in the surroundings thus violating the machinebased statement If an adiabatic process that connects two states A and B is reversible we see that the system follows the same path in opposite directions when it does work going from A to B as it does when work is done on it as it goes from B to A From another perspective we can say that the tiling theorem is a consequence of our assumptions about reversible processes Our conception of a reversible process is that the energy pressure temperature and volume are continuous functions of state with continuous derivatives That there is one and only one isotherm for every state is equivalent to the assumption that temperature is a continuous singlevalued function of the state of the system That there is one and only one adiabat for every state is equivalent to the assumption that or generally is a continuous singlevalued function of the state of the system With these ideas in mind let us now observe that any reversible cycle can be described by a closed path in a space whose coordinates are and entropy In Figure we sketch this space with on the abscissa then an isotherm is a horizontal line and line of constant entropy an isentrope is vertical A reversible Carnot cycle is a closed rectangle and the area of this rectangle corresponds to the reversible work done by the system on its surroundings in one cycle Any equilibrium state of the system corresponds to a particular point in this space Any closed path can be tiled arbitrarily densely by isotherms and isentropes Any reversible cycle involving any form of work is represented by a closed path in this space Figure is an alternative illustration of the argument that we make in Section The path in this space is independent of the kind of work done reinforcing the conclusion that for a reversible Carnot cycle producing any form of work The fact that a cyclic process corresponds to a closed path in this space is equivalent to the fact that entropy is a state function Figure A reversible cycle described using coordinates and To appreciate this aspect of the path of a cyclic process in space let us describe the path of the same process in a space whose coordinates are and With on the abscissa isotherms are again horizontal lines and adiabats are vertical lines In this space a reversible Carnot cycle does not begin and end at the same point The path is not closed Similarly the representation of an arbitrary reversible cycle is not a closed figure See Figure The difference between the representations of a reversible cyclic process in these two spaces illustrates graphically the fact that entropy is a state function while heat is not Figure A reversible cycle described using and
