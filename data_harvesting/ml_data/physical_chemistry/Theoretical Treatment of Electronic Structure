theory uses to interpret experimental data relating to such matters and how and why theory can also be used to simulate the behavior of molecules In carrying out simulations the BornOppenheimer electronic energy as a function of the coordinates of the atoms in the molecule plays a central role It is on this landscape that one searches for stable isomers and transition states and it is the second derivative Hessian matrix of this function that provides the harmonic vibrational frequencies of such isomers In the present Chapter I want to provide you with an introduction to the tools that we use to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation to generate and the electronic wave function In essence this treatment will focus on orbitals of atoms and molecules and how we obtain and interpret them For an atom one can approximate the orbitals by using the solutions of the hydrogenic Schrödinger equation discussed in Part of this text Although such functions are not proper solutions to the actual electron Schrödinger equation believe it or not no one has ever solved exactly any such equation for of any atom they can be used as perturbation or variational startingpoint approximations when one may be satisfied with qualitatively accurate answers In particular the solutions of this oneelectron hydrogenic problem form the qualitative basis for much of atomic and molecular orbital theory As discussed in detail in Part these orbitals are labeled by and quantum numbers for the bound states and by and quantum numbers and the energy for the continuum states Much as the particleinabox orbitals are used to qualitatively describe electrons in conjugated polyenes or electronic bands in solids these socalled hydrogenlike orbitals provide qualitative descriptions of orbitals of atoms with more than a single electron By introducing the concept of screening as a way to represent the repulsive interactions among the electrons of an atom an effective nuclear charge can be used in place of in the hydrogenic and formulas to generate approximate atomic orbitals to be filled by electrons in a manyelectron atom For example in the crudest approximation of a carbon atom the two electrons experience the full nuclear attraction so for them whereas the and electrons are screened by the two electrons so for them Within this approximation one then occupies two orbitals with two orbitals with and two orbitals with in forming the full sixelectron product wave function of the lowestenergy state of carbon However such approximate orbitals are not sufficiently accurate to be of use in quantitative simulations of atomic and molecular structure In particular their energies do not properly follow the trends in atomic orbital AO energies that are taught in introductory chemistry classes and that are shown pictorially in Figure Figure Energies of Atomic Orbitals as Functions of Nuclear Charge for Neutral Atoms For example the relative energies of the and orbitals are not adequately described in a model that treats electron repulsion effects in terms of a simple screening factor So now it is time to examine how we can move beyond the screening model and take the electron repulsion effects which cause the interelectronic couplings that render the Schrödinger equation insoluble into account in a more reliable manner Atomic Units The electronic Hamiltonian that appears throughout this text is commonly expressed in the literature and in other texts in socalled atomic units aus In that form it is written as follows Atomic units are introduced to remove all of the h e and me factors from the Schrödinger equation To effect the unit transformation that results in the Hamiltonian appearing as above one notes that the kinetic energy operator scales as whereas the Coulomb potentials scale as and as So if each of the Cartesian coordinates of the electrons and nuclei were expressed as a unit of length multiplied by a dimensionless length factor the kinetic energy operator would involve terms of the form and the Coulomb potentials would appear as and with the and factors now referring to the dimensionless coordinates A factor of which has units of energy since a_ has units of length can then be removed from the Coulomb and kinetic energies after which the kinetic energy terms appear as and the potential energies appear as and Then choosing changes the kinetic energy terms into as a result the entire electronic Hamiltonian takes the form given above in which no me or factors appear The value of the socalled Bohr radius turns out to be Å and the socalled Hartree energy unit which factors out of He is eV or kcalmol Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride
