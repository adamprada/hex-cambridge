a The CI Methodb Perturbation Theoryc The CoupledCluster Methodd The Density Functional Methode Energy Difference Methods There are numerous procedures currently in use for determining the best BornOppenheimer electronic wave function that is usually expressed in the form where is a spinand space symmetryadapted configuration state function CSF that consists of one or more determinants combined to produce the desired symmetry In all such wave functions there are two kinds of parameters that need to be determined the CI coefficients and the LCAOMO coefficients describing the fIk in terms of the AO basis functions The most commonly employed methods used to determine these parameters include a The CI Method In this approach the LCAOMO coefficients are determined first usually via a singleconfiguration HF SCF calculation The CI coefficients are subsequently determined by making the expectation value variationally stationary with chosen to be of the form As with all such linear variational problems this generates a matrix eigenvalue equation to be solved for the optimum coefficients and for the optimal energy The CI wave function is most commonly constructed from spin and spatial symmetry adapted combinations of determinants called configuration state functions CSFs that include The socalled reference CSF that is the SCF wave function used to generate the molecular orbitals CSFs generated by carrying out single double triple etc level excitations ie orbital replacements relative to the reference CSF CI wave functions limited to include contributions through various levels of excitation are denoted S singly D doubly SD singly and doubly SDT singly doubly and triply excited The orbitals from which electrons are removed can be restricted to focus attention on correlations among certain orbitals For example if excitations out of core orbitals are excluded one computes a total energy that contains no core correlation energy The number of CSFs included in the CI calculation can be large CI wave functions including to CSFs are routine and functions with one to several billion CSFs are within the realm of practicality The need for such large CSF expansions can be appreciated by considering i that each electron pair requires at least two CSFs to form the polarized orbital pairs discussed earlier in this Chapter ii there are of the order of electron pairs for a molecule containing electrons hence iii the number of terms in the CI wave function scales as For a molecule containing ten electrons there could be terms in the CI expansion This may be an over estimate of the number of CSFs needed but it demonstrates how rapidly the number of CSFs can grow with the number of electrons The Hamiltonian matrix elements between pairs of CSFs are in practice evaluated in terms of one and two electron integrals over the molecular orbitals Prior to forming the matrix elements the one and two electron integrals which can be computed only for the atomic eg STO or GTO basis must be transformed to the molecular orbital basis This transformation step requires computer resources proportional to the fifth power of the number of basis functions and thus is one of the more troublesome steps in most configuration interaction and most other correlated calculations To transform the twoelectron integrals from this AO basis to the MO basis one proceeds as follows First one utilizes the original AObased integrals to form a partially transformed set of integrals This step requires of the order of operations Next one takes the list and carries out another socalled oneindex transformation This list is then subjected to another oneindex transformation to generate after which is subjected to the fourth oneindex transformation to form the final MObased integral list In total these four transformation steps require computer operations A variant of the CI method that is sometimes used is called the multiconfigurational selfconsistent field MCSCF method To derive the working equations of this approach one minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for a trial wave function consisting of a linear combination of CSFs In carrying out this minimization process one varies both the linear expansion coefficients and the LCAOMO coefficients describing those spinorbitals that appear in any of the CSFs This produces two sets of equations that need to be solved A matrix eigenvalue equation of the same form as arises in the CI method and equations that look very much like the HF equations but in which the he matrix element is sum_etagamma Gammaetagamma langlechi_nur chi_etar fracerr chi_mur chi_gammarrangle langlechi_nur chi_etar fracerr chi_gammar chi_mu rrangle Here replaces the sum that appears in the HF equations with depending on both the LCAOMO coefficients of the spinorbitals and on the expansion coefficients These equations are solved through a selfconsistent process in which initial coefficients are used to form the matrix and solve for the coefficients after which the can be determined and the HFlike equations solved for a new set of coefficients and so on until convergence is reached b Perturbation Theory This method uses the singleconfiguration SCF process to determine a set of orbitals Then with a zerothorder Hamiltonian equal to the sum of the electrons Fock operators perturbation theory is used to determine the CI amplitudes for the other CSFs The MÃ¸llerPlesset perturbation MPPT procedure is a special case in which the above sum of Fock operators is used to define The amplitude for the reference CSF is taken as unity and the other CSFs amplitudes are determined by using as the perturbation This perturbation is the difference between the true Coulomb interactions among the electrons and the meanfield approximation to those interactions where and are the Coulomb and exchange operators defined earlier in this Chapter and the sum over runs over the spinorbitals that are occupied in the HartreeFock wave function that forms the zerothorder approximation to In the MPPT method once the reference CSF is chosen and the SCF orbitals belonging to this CSF are determined the wave function and energy are determined in an orderbyorder manner as is the case in the RSPT discussed in Chapter In fact MPPT is just RSPT with the above fluctuation potential as the perturbation The perturbation equations determine what CSFs to include through any particular order This is one of the primary strengths of this technique it does not require one to make further choices in contrast to the CI treatment where one needs to choose which CSFs to include For example the firstorder wave function correction is where the SCF orbital energies are denoted and represents a CSF that is doubly excited and are replaced by and relative to the SCF wave function The denominators arise from because each of these zerothorder energies is the sum of the orbital energies for all spinorbitals occupied The excited CSFs are the zerothorder wave functions other than the reference CSF Only doubly excited CSFs contribute to the firstorder wave function the fact that the contributions from singly excited configurations vanish in is known at the Brillouin theorem The Brillouin theorem can be proven by considering Hamiltonian matrix elements coupling the reference CSF to singlyexcited CSFs Fim The rules for evaluating all such matrix elements are called SlaterCondon rules and are given later in this Chapter If you dont know them this would be a good time to go read the subsection on these rules before returning here From the SlaterCondon rules we know that the matrix elements in question are given by Here the factor simply permutes the coordinates and to generate the exchange integral The sum of two electron integrals on the righthand side above can be extended to include the terms arising from because vanishes As a result the entire righthand side can be seen to reduce to the matrix element of the Fock operator The matrix elements vanish because the spinorbitals are eigenfunctions of and are orthogonal to each other The MPPT energy is given through second order as in RSPT by and again only contains contributions from the doubly excited CSFs Both and are expressed in terms of twoelectron integrals that are sometimes denoted coupling the virtual spinorbitals and to the spinorbitals from which electrons were excited and as well as the orbital energy differences accompanying such excitations Clearly major contributions to the correlation energy are made by double excitations into virtual orbitals with large integrals and small orbital energy gaps In higher order corrections contributions from CSFs that are singly triply etc excited relative to the HF reference function appear and additional contributions from the doubly excited CSFs also enter The various orders of MPPT are usually denoted MPn eg MP means secondorder MPPT c The CoupledCluster Method As noted above when the HartreeFock wave function is used as the zerothorder starting point in a perturbation expansion the first and presumably most important corrections to this function are the doublyexcited determinants In early studies of CI treatments of electron correlation it was observed that double excitations had the largest coefficients after the SCF wave function which has the very largest Moreover in CI studies that included single double triple and quadruple level excitations relative to the dominant SCF determinant it was observed that quadruple excitations had the next largest amplitudes after the double excitations And very importantly it was observed that the amplitudes of the quadruply excited CSFs could be very closely approximated as products of the amplitudes of the doubly excited CSFs and This observation prompted workers to suggest that a more compact and efficient expansion of the correlated wave function might be realized by writing as where is the SCF determinant and the operator appearing in the exponential is taken to be a sum of operators that create single double etc level excited CSFs when acting on As I show below this socalled coupledcluster CC form for then has the characteristic that the dominant contributions from quadruple excitations have coefficients nearly equal to the products of the coefficients of their constituent double excitations In any practical calculation this sum of operators would be truncated to keep the calculation practical For example if excitation operators higher than were neglected then one would use However even when is so truncated the resultant would contain excitations of higher order For example using the truncation just introduced we would have This function contains single excitations in double excitations in and in triple excitations in and and quadruple excitations in a variety of terms including and as well as even higher level excitations By the design of this wave function the quandruple excitations will have amplitudes given as products of the amplitudes of the double excitations just as were found by earlier CI workers to be most important Hence in CC theory we say that quadruple excitations include unlinked products of double excitations arising from the product the quadruple excitations arising from would involve linked terms and would have amplitudes that are not products of doubleexcitation amplitudes After writing in terms of an exponential operator one is faced with determining the amplitudes of the various single double etc excitations generated by the operator acting on This is done by writing the SchrÃ¶dinger equation as and then multiplying on the left by to obtain The CC energy is then calculated by multiplying this equation on the left by and integrating over the coordinates of all the electrons In practice the combination of operators appearing in this expression is rewritten and dealt with as follows this socalled BakerCampbellHausdorf expansion of the exponential operators can be shown truncate exactly after the fourth power term shown here So once the various operators and their amplitudes that comprise are known is computed using the above expression that involves various powers of the operators The equations used to find the amplitudes eg those of the operator where the are the amplitudes and are the excitation operators that promote two electrons from and into and of the various excitation level are obtained by multiplying the above SchrÃ¶dinger equation on the left by an excited determinant of that level and integrating For example the equation for the doubleexcitations is The zero arises from the righthand side of and the fact that that is the determinants are orthonormal The number of such equations is equal to the number of doubly excited determinants which is equal to the number of unknown amplitudes So the above quartic equations must be solved to determine the amplitudes appearing in the various operators Then as noted above once these amplitudes are known the energy can be computed using the earlier quartic equation Having to solve many coupled quartic equations is one of the most severe computational challenges of CC theory Clearly the CC method contains additional complexity as a result of the exponential expansion form of the wave function and the resulting coupled quartic equations that need to be solved to determine the amplitudes However it is this way of writing that allows us to automatically build in the fact that products of double excitations are the dominant contributors to quadruple excitations and is the dominant component of sixfold excitations not In fact the CC method is today one of the most accurate tools we have for calculating molecular electronic energies and wave functions d The Density Functional Method These approaches provide alternatives to the conventional tools of quantum chemistry which move beyond the singleconfiguration picture by adding to the wave function more configurations ie excited determinants whose amplitudes they each determine in their own way As noted earlier these conventional approaches can lead to a very large number of CSFs in the correlated wave function and as a result a need for extraordinary computer resources The density functional approaches are different Here one solves a set of orbitallevel equations in which the orbitals feel potentials due to the nuclear centers having charges Coulombic interaction with the total electron density and a socalled exchangecorrelation potential denoted The particular electronic state for which the calculation is being performed is specified by forming a corresponding density that in turn is often expressed as a sum of squares of occupied orbitals multiplied by orbitial occupation numbers Before going further in describing how DFT calculations are carried out let us examine the origins underlying this theory The socalled HohenbergKohn theorem states that the groundstate electron density of the atom or molecule or ion of interest uniquely determines the potential in the molecules electronic Hamiltonian ie the positions and charges of the systems nuclei and because H determines all of the energies and wave functions of the system the groundstate density therefore determines all properties of the system One proof of this theorem proceeds as follows determines the number of electrons because Assume that there are two distinct potentials aside from an additive constant that simply shifts the zero of total energy and which when used in and respectively to solve for a ground state produce and that have the same oneelectron density If we think of as trial variational wave function for the Hamiltonian we know that Similarly taking as a trial function for the Hamiltonian one finds that Adding the equations in c and d gives a clear contradiction unless the electronic state of interest is degenerate Hence there cannot be two distinct potentials and that give the same nondegenerate groundstate So the groundstate density uniquely determines and and thus H Furthermore because the eigenfunctions of determine all properties of the ground state then in principle determines all such properties This means that even the kinetic energy and the electronelectron interaction energy of the groundstate are determined by It is easy to see that gives the average value of the electronnuclear plus any additional oneelectron additive potential interaction in terms of the groundstate density However how are the kinetic energy and the electronelectron interaction energy expressed in terms of r There is another point of view that I find sheds even more light on why it makes sense that the groundstate electron density contains all the information needed to determine all properties It was shown many years ago by examining the mathematical character of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation that the groundstate wave function has certain socalled cusps in the neighborhoods of the nuclear centers In particular must obey That is the derivative or slope of the natural logarithm of the true groundstate wave function must be as any of the electrons positions approach the nucleus of charge residing at position Because the groundstate electron density can be expressed in terms of the groundstate wave function as it can be shown that the groundstate density also displays cusps at the nuclear centers as where me is the electron mass and e is the unit of charge So imagine that you knew the true groundstate density at all points in space You could integrate the density over all space to determine how many electrons the system has Then you could explore over all space to find points at which the density had sharp points characterized by nonzero derivatives in the natural logarithm of the density The positions of such points specify the nuclear centers and by measuring the slopes in at each location one could determine the charges of these nuclei through This demonstrates why the groundstate density is all one needs to fully determine the locations and charges of the nuclei as well as the number of electrons and thus the entire Hamiltonian The main difficulty with DFT is that the HohenbergKohn theorem shows the values of etc are all unique functionals of the groundstate ie that they can in principle be determined once is given but it does not tell us what these functional relations are To see how it might make sense that a property such as the kinetic energy whose operator involves derivatives can be related to the electron density consider a simple system of noninteracting electrons moving in a threedimensional cubic box potential The energy states of such electrons are known to be where is the length of the box along the three axes and and are the quantum numbers describing the state We can view as defining the squared radius of a sphere in three dimensions and we realize that the density of quantum states in this space is one state per unit volume in the space Because and must be positive integers the volume covering all states with energy less than or equal to a specified energy is the volume of the sphere of radius Since there is one state per unit of such volume is also the number of states with energy less than or equal to and is called the integrated density of states The number of states with energy between and the density of states is the derivative of If we calculate the total energy for these noninteracting electrons that doubly occupy all states having energies up to the socalled Fermi energy ie the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO we obtain the groundstate energy The total number of electrons can be expressed as which can be solved for in terms of to then express in terms of instead of in terms of This gives the total energy which is also the kinetic energy in this case because the potential energy is zero within the box and because the electrons are assumed to have no interactions among themselves in terms of the electron density It therefore may be plausible to express kinetic energies in terms of electron densities but it is still by no means clear how to do so for real atoms and molecules with electronnuclear and electronelectron interactions operative In one of the earliest DFT models the ThomasFermi theory the kinetic energy of an atom or molecule is approximated using the above kind of treatment on a local level That is for each volume element in space one assumes the expression given above to be valid and then one integrates over all to compute the total kinetic energy where the last equality simply defines the constant Ignoring the correlation and exchange contributions to the total energy this is combined with the electronnuclear and Coulombic electronelectron potential energies to give the ThomasFermi total energy This expression is an example of how is given as a local density functional approximation LDA The term local means that the energy is given as a functional ie a function of which depends only on at points in space but not on at more than one point in space or on spatial derivatives of Unfortunately the ThomasFermi energy functional does not produce results that are of sufficiently high accuracy to be of great use in chemistry What is missing in this theory are the exchange energy and the electronic correlation energy Moreover the kinetic energy is treated only in the approximate manner described earlier ie for noninteracting electrons within a spatially uniform potential Dirac was able to address the exchange energy for the uniform electron gas Coulomb interacting electrons moving in a uniform positive background charge whose magnitude balances the total charge of the electrons If the exact expression for the exchange energy of the uniform electron gas is applied on a local level one obtains the commonly used Dirac local density approximation to the exchange energy with Adding this exchange energy to the ThomasFermi total energy gives the socalled ThomasFermiDirac TFD energy functional Because electron densities vary rather strongly spatially near the nuclei corrections to the above approximations to and are needed One of the more commonly used socalled gradientcorrected approximations is that invented by Becke and referred to as the Becke exchange functional where and is a parameter chosen so that the above exchange energy can best reproduce the known exchange energies of specific electronic states of the inert gas atoms Becke finds to equal A common gradient correction to the earlier local kinetic energy functional is called the Weizsacker correction and is given by Although the above discussion suggests how one might compute the groundstate energy once the groundstate density is given one still needs to know how to obtain Kohn and Sham KS introduced a set of socalled KS orbitals obeying the following equation where the socalled exchangecorrelation potential could be obtained by functional differentiation if the exchangecorrelation energy functional were known KS also showed that the KS orbitals could be used to compute the density by simply adding up the orbital densities multiplied by orbital occupancies here or is the occupation number of the orbital in the state being studied and that the kinetic energy should be calculated as The same investigations of the idealized uniform electron gas that identified the Dirac exchange functional found that the correlation energy per electron could also be written exactly as a function of the electron density of the system for this model system but only in two limiting cases the highdensity limit large and the lowdensity limit There still exists no exact expression for the correlation energy even for the uniform electron gas that is valid at arbitrary values of Therefore much work has been devoted to creating efficient and accurate interpolation formulas connecting the low and high density uniform electron gas One such expression is where is the correlation energy per electron Here and and The parameter is how the density enters since is equal to that is is the radius of a sphere whose volume is the effective volume occupied by one electron A reasonable approximation to the full would contain the Dirac and perhaps gradient corrected exchange functional plus the above but there are many alternative approximations to the exchangecorrelation energy functional Currently many workers are doing their best to cook up functionals for the correlation and exchange energies but no one has yet invented functionals that are so reliable that most workers agree to use them To summarize in implementing any DFT one usually proceeds as follows An atomic orbital basis is chosen in terms of which the KS orbitals are to be expanded Most commonly this is a Gaussian basis or a planewave basis Some initial guess is made for the LCAOKS expansion coefficients of the occupied KS orbitals The density is computed as Often itself is expanded in an atomic orbital basis which need not be the same as the basis used for the and the expansion coefficients of are computed in terms of those of the this new basis It is also common to use an atomic orbital basis to expand which together with is needed to evaluate the exchangecorrelation functionals contribution to The current iterations density is used in the KS equations to determine the Hamiltonian whose new eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are found by solving the KS equations These new are used to compute a new density which in turn is used to solve a new set of KS equations This process is continued until convergence is reached ie until the used to determine the current iterations are the same that arise as solutions on the next iteration Once the converged is determined the energy can be computed using the earlier expression e Energy Difference Methods In addition to the methods discussed above for treating the energies and wave functions as solutions to the electronic SchrÃ¶dinger equation there exists a family of tools that allow one to compute energy differences directly rather than by finding the energies of pairs of states and subsequently subtracting them Various energy differences can be so computed differences between two electronic states of the same molecule ie electronic excitation energies differences between energy states of a molecule and the cation or anion formed by removing or adding an electron ie ionization potentials IPs and electron affinities EAs In the early s the author developed one such tool for computing EAs J Simons and W D Smith Theory of Electron Affinities of Small Molecules J Chem Phys and he called this the equations of motion EOM method Throughout much of the s and s his group advanced and applied this tool to their studies of molecular EAs and electronmolecule interactions Because of space limitations we will not be able to elaborate much in great detail on these methods However it is important to stress that These socalled EOM or Greens function or propagator methods utilize essentially the same input information eg atomic orbital basis sets and perform many of the same computational steps eg evaluation of one and two electron integrals formation of a set of meanfield molecular orbitals transformation of integrals to the MO basis etc as do the other techniques discussed earlier These methods are now rather routinely used when IP or EA information is sought The basic ideas underlying most if not all of the energydifference methods are One forms a reference wave function this can be of the SCF MPn CI CC DFT etc variety the energy differences are computed relative to the energy of this function One expresses the finalstate wave function ie that describing the excited cation or anion state in terms of an operator acting on the reference Clearly the operator must be one that removes or adds an electron when one is attempting to compute IPs or EAs respectively One writes equations which and are expected to obey For example in the early development of these methods the SchrÃ¶dinger equation itself was assumed to be obeyed so and are the two equations One combines with the equations that and obey to obtain an equation that must obey In the above example one a uses in the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for b allows to act from the left on the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for and c subtracts the resulting two equations to achieve or in commutator form One can for example express in terms of a superposition of configurations whose amplitudes have been determined from a CI or MPn calculation and express in terms of operators that cause single double etc level excitations for the IP EA cases is given in terms of operators that remove add remove and singly excite add and singly excite etc electrons Substituting the expansions for and for into the equation of motion EOM and then projecting the resulting equation on the left against a set of functions eg gives a matrix eigenvalueeigenvector equation to be solved for the operator coefficients and the excitation or IP or EA energies Such are the working equations of the EOM or Greens function or propagator methods In recent years these methods have been greatly expanded and have reached a degree of reliability where they now offer some of the most accurate tools for studying excited and ionized states In particular the use of time dependent variational principles have allowed a much more rigorous development of equations for energy differences and nonlinear response properties In addition the extension of the EOM theory to include coupledcluster reference functions now allows one to compute excitation and ionization energies using some of the most accurate ab initio tools
