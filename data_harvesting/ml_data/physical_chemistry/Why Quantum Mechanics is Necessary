bonding reactivity and physical properties of atoms molecules radicals and ions all of whose sizes range from ca Å for atoms and small molecules to a few hundred Å for polymers and biological molecules such as DNA and proteins Sometimes these building blocks combine to form nanoscopic materials eg quantum dots graphene sheets whose dimensions span up to thousands of Å making them amenable to detection using specialized microscopic tools However description of the motions and properties of the particles comprising such small systems has been found to not be amenable to treatment using classical mechanics Their structures energies and other properties have only been successfully described within the framework of quantum mechanics This is why quantum mechanics has to be mastered as part of learning theoretical chemistry We know that all molecules are made of atoms that in turn contain nuclei and electrons As I discuss in this Chapter the equations that govern the motions of electrons and of nuclei are not the familiar Newton equations but a new set of equations called Schrödinger equations When scientists first studied the behavior of electrons and nuclei they tried to interpret their experimental findings in terms of classical Newtonian motions but such attempts eventually failed They found that such small light particles behaved in a way that simply is not consistent with the Newton equations Let me now illustrate some of the experimental data that gave rise to these paradoxes and show you how the scientists of those early times then used these data to suggest new equations that these particles might obey I want to stress that the Schrödinger equation was not derived but postulated by these scientists In fact to date to the best of my knowledge no one has been able to derive the Schrödinger equation From the pioneering work of Bragg on diffraction of xrays from planes of atoms or ions in crystals it was known that peaks in the intensity of diffracted xrays having wavelength l would occur at scattering angles q determined by the famous Bragg equation n lambda d sintheta tag where d is the spacing between neighboring planes of atoms or ions These quantities are illustrated in Figure shown below There are may such diffraction peaks each labeled by a different value of the integer The Bragg formula can be derived by considering when two photons one scattering from the second plane in the figure and the second scattering from the third plane will undergo constructive interference This condition is met when the extra path length covered by the second photon ie the length from points to to is an integer multiple of the wavelength of the photons Figure Scattering of two beams at angle from two planes in a crystal spaced by d The importance of these xray scattering experiments to electrons and nuclei appears in the experiments of Davisson and Germer in who scattered electrons of reasonably fixed kinetic energy from metallic crystals These workers found that plots of the number of scattered electrons as a function of scattering angle displayed peaks at angles that obeyed a Bragglike equation The startling thing about this observation is that electrons are particles yet the Bragg equation is based on the properties of waves An important observation derived from the DavissonGermer experiments was that the scattering angles observed for electrons of kinetic energy could be fit to the Bragg equation if a wavelength were ascribed to these electrons that was defined by where is the mass of the electron and h is the constant introduced by Max Planck and Albert Einstein in the early s to relate a photons energy to its frequency via These amazing findings were among the earliest to suggest that electrons which had always been viewed as particles might have some properties usually ascribed to waves That is as de Broglie has suggested in an electron seems to have a wavelength inversely related to its momentum and to display wavetype diffraction I should mention that analogous diffraction was also observed when other small light particles eg protons neutrons nuclei and small atomic ions were scattered from crystal planes In all such cases Bragglike diffraction is observed and the Bragg equation is found to govern the scattering angles if one assigns a wavelength to the scattering particle according to where is the mass of the scattered particle and is Plancks constant x erg sec The observation that electrons and other small light particles display wave like behavior was important because these particles are what all atoms and molecules are made of So if we want to fully understand the motions and behavior of molecules we must be sure that we can adequately describe such properties for their constituents Because the classical Newtonian equations do not contain factors that suggest wave properties for electrons or nuclei moving freely in space the above behaviors presented significant challenges Another problem that arose in early studies of atoms and molecules resulted from the study of the photons emitted from atoms and ions that had been heated or otherwise excited eg by electric discharge It was found that each kind of atom ie H or C or O emitted photons whose frequencies were of very characteristic values An example of such emission spectra is shown in Figure for hydrogen atoms Figure Emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen with some lines repeated below to illustrate the series to which they belong In the top panel we see all of the lines emitted with their wave lengths indicated in nanometers The other panels show how these lines have been analyzed by scientists whose names are associated into patterns that relate to the specific energy levels between which transitions occur to emit the corresponding photons In the early attempts to rationalize such spectra in terms of electronic motions one described an electron as moving about the atomic nuclei in circular orbits such as shown in Figure Figure Characterization of small and large stable orbits for an electron moving around a nucleus A circular orbit was thought to be stable when the outward centrifugal force characterized by radius and speed on the electron perfectly counterbalanced the inward attractive Coulomb force exerted by the nucleus of charge This equation in turn allows one to relate the kinetic energy to the Coulombic energy and thus to express the total energy of an orbit in terms of the radius of the orbit The energy characterizing an orbit or radius relative to the reference of energy at becomes more and more negative ie lower and lower as becomes smaller This relationship between outward and inward forces allows one to conclude that the electron should move faster as it moves closer to the nucleus since However nowhere in this model is a concept that relates to the experimental fact that each atom emits only certain kinds of photons It was believed that photon emission occurred when an electron moving in a larger circular orbit lost energy and moved to a smaller circular orbit However the Newtonian dynamics that produced the above equation would allow orbits of any radius and hence any energy to be followed Thus it would appear that the electron should be able to emit photons of any energy as it moved from orbit to orbit The breakthrough that allowed scientists such as Niels Bohr to apply the circularorbit model to the observed spectral data involved first introducing the idea that the electron has a wavelength and that this wavelength l is related to its momentum by the de Broglie equation lambda hp The key step in the Bohr model was to also specify that the radius of the circular orbit be such that the circumference of the circle be equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength Only in this way will the electrons wave experience constructive interference as the electron orbits the nucleus Thus the Bohr relationship that is analogous to the Bragg equation that determines at what angles constructive interference can occur is Both this equation and the analogous Bragg equation are illustrations of what we call boundary conditions they are extra conditions placed on the wavelength to produce some desired character in the resultant wave in these cases constructive interference Of course there remains the question of why one must impose these extra conditions when the Newton dynamics do not require them The resolution of this paradox is one of the things that quantum mechanics does Returning to the above analysis and using as well as the forcebalance equation one can then solve for the radii that stable Bohr orbits obey and in turn for the velocities of electrons in these orbits These two results then allow one to express the sum of the kinetic and Coulomb potential energies as Just as in the Bragg diffraction result which specified at what angles special high intensities occurred in the scattering there are many stable Bohr orbits each labeled by a value of the integer Those with small have small radii scaling as high velocities scaling as n and more negative total energies nb the reference zero of energy corresponds to the electron at and with So it is the result that only certain orbits are allowed that causes only certain energies to occur and thus only certain energies to be observed in the emitted photons It turned out that the Bohr formula for the energy levels labeled by of an electron moving about a nucleus could be used to explain the discrete line emission spectra of all oneelectron atoms and ions ie etc sometimes called hydrogenic species to very high precision In such an interpretation of the experimental data one claims that a photon of energy hnu R leftdfracn_i dfracn_fright tag is emitted when the atom or ion undergoes a transition from an orbit having quantum number to a lowerenergy orbit having Here the symbol is used to denote the following collection of factors and is called the Rydberg unit of energy and is equal to eV The Bohr formula for energy levels did not agree as well with the observed pattern of emission spectra for species containing more than a single electron However it does give a reasonable fit for example to the Na atom spectra if one examines only transitions involving only the single s valence electron Moreover it can be greatly improved if one introduces a modification designed to treat the penetration of the Na atoms s and higher orbitals within the regions of space occupied by the s s and p orbitals Such a modification to the Bohr model is achieved by introducing the idea of a socalled quantum defect d into the principal quantum number so that the expression for the dependence of the orbitals changes to Example For example choosing equal to or for Li Na K Rb and Cs respectively in this socalled Rydberg formula one finds decent agreement between the dependence of the energy spacings of the singly excited valence states of these atoms The fact that is larger for Na than for Li and largest for Cs reflects that fact that the s orbital of Na penetrates the s s and p shells while the s orbital of Li penetrates only the s shell and the s orbital of Cs penetrates and shells It turns out this Rydberg formula can also be applied to certain electronic states of molecules In particular for closedshell cations such as protonated alcohols and protonated amines even on side chains of amino acids an electron can be attached into a socalled Rydberg orbital to form corresponding neutral radicals such as or For example in the electron bound to an underlying cation core The lowestenergy state of this Rydberg species is often labeled s because is isoelectronic with the Na cation which binds an electron in its s orbital in its ground state As in the cases of alkali atoms these Rydberg molecules also possess excited electronic states For example the NH radical has states labeled p d s p d f etc By making an appropriate choice of the quantum defect parameter d the energy spacings among these states can be fit reasonably well to the Rydberg formula Equation In Figure a several Rydberg orbitals of are shown Figure a The and Rydberg orbitals of with their outermost contours containing of their electron density The smaller orbitals are supposed to depict CC CN or CO orbitals to give perspective of the Rydberg orbitals sizes These Rydberg orbitals can be quite large their sizes scale as clearly have the s p or d angular shapes and possess the expected number of radial nodes However for molecular Rydberg orbitals and unlike atomic Rydberg orbitals the three five seven etc orbitals are not degenerate instead they are split in energy in a manner reflecting the symmetry of the underlying cations symmetry For example for the three orbitals are degenerate and belong to symmetry in the point group the five orbitals are split into three degenerate and two degenerate e orbitals So the Bohr model works well for oneelectron atoms or ions and the quantum defectmodified Bohr equation describes reasonably well some states of alkali atoms and of Rydberg molecules The primary reason for the breakdown of the Bohr formula is the neglect of electronelectron Coulomb repulsions in its derivation which are qualitatively corrected for by using the quantum defect parameter for Rydberg atoms and molecules Nevertheless the success of the Bohr model made it clear that discrete emission spectra could only be explained by introducing the concept that not all orbits were allowed Only special orbits that obeyed a constructiveinterference condition were really accessible to the electrons motions This idea that not all energies were allowed but only certain quantized energies could occur was essential to achieving even a qualitative sense of agreement with the experimental fact that emission spectra were discrete In summary two experimental observations on the behavior of electrons that were crucial to the abandonment of Newtonian dynamics were the observations of electron diffraction and of discrete emission spectra Both of these findings seem to suggest that electrons have some wave characteristics and that these waves have only certain allowed ie quantized wavelengths So now we have some idea about why Newtons equations fail to account for the dynamical motions of light and small particles such as electrons and nuclei We see that extra conditions eg the Bragg condition or constraints on the de Broglie wavelength could be imposed to achieve some degree of agreement with experimental observation However we still are left wondering what equations can be applied to properly describe such motions and why the extra conditions are needed It turns out that a new kind of equation based on combining wave and particle properties needed to be developed to address such issues These are the socalled Schrödinger equations to which we now turn our attention As I said earlier no one has yet shown that the Schrödinger equation follows deductively from some more fundamental theory That is scientists did not derive this equation they postulated it Some idea of how the scientists of that era dreamed up the Schrödinger equation can be had by examining the time and spatial dependence that characterizes socalled traveling waves It should be noted that the people who worked on these problems knew a great deal about waves eg sound waves and water waves and the equations they obeyed Moreover they knew that waves could sometimes display the characteristic of quantized wavelengths or frequencies eg fundamentals and overtones in sound waves They knew for example that waves in one dimension that are constrained at two points eg a violin string held fixed at two ends undergo oscillatory motion in space and time with characteristic frequencies and wavelengths For example the motion of the violin string just mentioned can be described as having an amplitude at a position along its length at time given by where is its oscillation frequency The amplitudes spatial dependence also has a sinusoidal dependence given by where is the cresttocrest length of the wave Two examples of such waves in one dimension are shown in Figure Figure Fundamental and first overtone notes of a violin string of length In these cases the string is fixed at and at so the wavelengths belonging to the two waves shown are and If the violin string were not clamped at the waves could have any value of However because the string is attached at the allowed wavelengths are quantized to obey where The equation that such waves obey called the wave equation reads where is the speed at which the wave travels This speed depends on the composition of the material from which the violin string is made stiff string material produces waves with higher speeds than for softer material Using the earlier expressions for the and dependences of the wave we find that the waves frequency and wavelength are related by the socalled dispersion equation or This relationship implies for example that an instrument string made of a very stiff material large will produce a higher frequency tone for a given wavelength ie a given value of than will a string made of a softer material smaller For waves moving on the surface of for example a rectangular twodimensional surface of lengths and one finds Hence the waves are quantized in two dimensions because their wavelengths must be constrained to cause to vanish at and as well as at and for all times It is important to note in closing this discussion of waves on strings and surfaces that it is not being a solution to the Schrödinger equation that results in quantization of the wavelengths Instead it is the condition that the wave vanish at the boundaries that generates the quantization You will see this trend time and again throughout this text when a wave function is subject to specific constraints at its inner or outer boundary or both quantization will result if these boundary conditions are not present quantization will not occur Let us now return to the issue of waves that describe electrons moving The pioneers of quantum mechanics examined functional forms similar to those shown above For example forms such as were considered because they correspond to periodic waves that evolve in and under no external or dependent forces Noticing that and using the de Broglie hypothesis in the above equation one finds If is supposed to relate to the motion of a particle of momentum p under no external forces since the waveform corresponds to this case can be related to the energy of the particle by So the equation for can be rewritten as or alternatively Returning to the timedependence of and using one can also show that which using the first result suggests that i BigdfrachpiBig dfracdAdt BigdfrachpiBig dfracm dfracdAdx tag This is a primitive form of the Schrödinger equation that we will address in much more detail below Briefly what is important to keep in mind that the use of the de Broglie and PlanckEinstein connections and both of which involve the constant h produces suggestive connections between and between or alternatively between These connections between physical properties energy and momentum and differential operators are some of the unusual features of quantum mechanics The above discussion about waves and quantized wavelengths as well as the observations about the wave equation and differential operators are not meant to provide or even suggest a derivation of the Schrödinger equation Again the scientists who invented quantum mechanics did not derive its working equations Instead the equations and rules of quantum mechanics have been postulated and designed to be consistent with laboratory observations My students often find this to be disconcerting because they are hoping and searching for an underlying fundamental basis from which the basic laws of quantum mechanics follow logically I try to remind them that this is not how theory works Instead one uses experimental observation to postulate a rule or equation or theory and one then tests the theory by making predictions that can be tested by further experiments If the theory fails it must be refined and this process continues until one has a better and better theory In this sense quantum mechanics with all of its unusual mathematical constructs and rules should be viewed as arising from the imaginations of scientists who tried to invent a theory that was consistent with experimental data and which could be used to predict things that could then be tested in the laboratory Thus far this theory has proven to be reliable but of course we are always searching for a new and improved theory that describes how small light particles move If it helps you to be more accepting of quantum theory I should point out that the quantum description of particles reduces to the classical Newton description under certain circumstances In particular when treating heavy particles eg macroscopic masses and even heavier atoms it is often possible to use Newton dynamics Soon we will discuss in more detail how the quantum and classical dynamics sometimes coincide in which case one is free to use the simpler Newton dynamics So let us now move on to look at this strange Schrödinger equation that we have been digressing about for so long Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools
