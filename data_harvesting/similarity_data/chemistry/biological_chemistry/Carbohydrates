journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry which allow their use or from journals such as from PLOS that are completely open access The papers and topics chosen were selected to assess student understanding of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ASBMB foundational concepts and learning objectives as well as MCAT foundational concepts and objectives These two sets of standards broadly overlap Both ASBMB and the MCAT strongly emphasis scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are perhaps best assessed by openended questions derived from the literature in which students must employ higher level Bloom skills of application and analysis These questions can also be used by students who seek more opportunities to practice interpreting research literature results The ability to apply analyze and evaluate information and concepts are at the heart of scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are central to the new ASBMB and MCAT competency standards The questions in this learning module are designed to assess these competencies using openended responses instead of multiplechoice questions Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper Trypanosoma brucei Glycoproteins Contain Novel Giant PolyNacetyllactosamine Carbohydrate ChainsAbdelmadjid Atrih Julia M Richardson Alan R Prescott and Michael A J Ferguson J Biol Chem Vol Issue January A densely packed layer of a surface glycoprotein covers the surface of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei The parasitic protozoa are transmitted by tsetse fly and causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestockIn the mammalian host T brucei liveand divide extracellularly in the blood lymph and interstitialfluids They have s of genes for the glycoproteins which produce so many variants that the organism can elude the immune system The parasite has a deep invagination of the plasma membrane called the flagellar pocket Endocytosis and secretion occurs from this site Little is known about its unique membrane glycoprotein structures and the endosome vesicles that have undergone endocytosislysosome degratory vesicles that fuse with lysosomes system Something in the pocket binds the lectin ricin and tomato lectin Ricin is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a GalβGlcNAc binding subunit B chain kDa and a toxic subunit A chain ca kDa connected through a disulfide linkage Tomato lectin is known to bind a linear polymer of Nacetyllactosamine polyLacNac which is comprised of up to GalβGlcNAc linked principally by GlcNAcβGalβ links which in mammals is found in both the cell and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins A study was done to exam the flagellar pocket of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei by studying the ricinbinding glycoprotein Ricinbinding glycoproteins were purified as follows a Cell were isolated from blood subjected to hypotonic lysis to release cytosolic components and soluble forms of surface glycoproteins and cell ghost cells without cytoplasm and other soluble contents collected Briefly explain this procedure and how it works with words and pictures b Cell ghosts were solubilized in mL of M urea SDS mM TrisHCl pH Explain the role of each of the added ingredients How do they collectively solubilize the cell ghost c The extract was diluted fold mM TrisHCl pH M NaCl Triton X and protease inhibitors Ricincoupled agarose chromatography beads were added and gently mixed overnight The beads were collected by gentle centrifugation and packed into a column Why was the extract diluted fold before the chromatography beads were added Why did they switch from SDS to Triton X Draw a diagram showing the ricin beads in the column and any interacting species d Bound proteins were eluted from the column after extensive washing Without altering pH or ionic strength how could bounds proteins be eluted Name the eluting agent Aliquots of the eluted fractions were separated by PAGE A membrane was placed on the gel and electrophoresis of the proteins onto the membrane was performed Western Blot The results are shown below Fig Ricin blot analysis of glycoproteins from bloodstream form T brucei Glycoproteins were eluted from a ricinagarose column After electrophoresis glycoproteins were either transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated ricin A and B or stained for carbohydrate with periodic acidSchiff C A lane native extract lane extract reduced with dithiothreitol before electrophoresis B lane reduced extract lane reduced extract after digestion with PNGaseF C reduced extract The positions of molecular mass standards are indicated a Draw a picture showing the electrophoreses protein on the membrane and how it react and is visualized with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated ricin b In gel A explain the chemical effect of dithiothreitol on the proteins which do to alter the migration of the proteins b Why is there only one main band left after treatment with PNGaseF before the electrophoresis Hint Google the enzyme Glycans released from the ricinbinding glycoproteins by PNGaseF were separated by BioGel P gel filtration chromatography Figure BioGel P chromatogram of glycans obtained from ricinbinding glycoproteins Glycans released from ricinbinding glycoproteins by the action of PNGaseF were purified from detergents and salts The monosaccharide compositions of the fractions were determined by GCMS The void volume total polyLacNAc fraction is indicated with a bar Two major fractions were found Which peak has the highest average molecular weight species Give an estimate of the molecular weight range of the glycans found in the void volume of the BioGel P column based on the information from BioRad below The polyLacNAc fraction from the BioGel P column was chromatographed on a HPLC Dionex CarboPac A high pH anion exchange column HPAEC used for the analysis of weakly ionizable carbohydrates The beads in this column consist of μm diameter vinylbenzyl chloridedivinylbenzene macroporous substrate fully functionalized with an alkyl quaternary ammonium group crosslinked The column is equilibrated in solution A mM NaOH and solution B M sodium acetate in M NaOH and bound glycans separated using a linear gradient of solution B Figure Dionex HPAEC separation of total polyLacNAc fractions A HPAEC chromatogram of glycans detected by pulsedamperiometric detection of the total polyLacNAc fraction isolated after BioGel P gel filtration see Figure B HPAEC chromatogram of the glycans of the total polyLacNAc fraction which bind to tomato lectinagarose The VLPL very large poly LacNac is indicated with a bar What is the pH of the column during equilibration and running Why was this column run at this pH The VLPL fraction was subjected to monosaccharide compositional analysis by GC_MS A ul aliquots that was desalted and dissolved in water was mixed with ul of acetonitrile with formic acid and subjected to GCMS It contained Man Gal and GlcNAc in the ration of Is this consistent with the proposed glycan structure It is necessary to know the linkage of the monosaccharide in the VLPL Linkage analysis was done by converting glycans to partially methylated alditol acetates and analyzing them by GCMS The general chemistry involved in the formation of methylated alditol acetates used in methylation analysis is shown below Definitive identification requires in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern the comparison of retention times with those of known standards a Why is methylation of free OH groups by basic CHI required before hydrolysis of the glycosidic links What do methyl group denote b Why is the reduction carried out c Why is a final acetylation carried out What do acetyl groups mark Traditional MS approaches are based on the fragmentation of organic molecules under some kind of impact followed by the differentiation of the resulting particles according to their masstocharge ratio In methylation analysis peaks are identified by a combination of their retention time relative time of elution from the LC column and their electron impact EIMS fragmentation pattern The EI fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted monosaccharides of the same class eg aldohexoses are the same Thus definitive identification requires in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern the comparison of retention times with those of known standards ie all triOmethylhexoses produce the same EIMS spectrum but peracetylated triOmethylgalactitol elutes later than peracetylated triOmethylglucitol This type of analysis indicates which residues are terminal ie they are methylated at every position except OH and OH and how each monosaccharide is substituted the latter reveals inter alia the occurrence of branching points However methylation analysis neither indicates which residues are attached to each other ie does not provide sequence information nor if a particular linkage is of the α or β configuration NCBI The methylation analysis in conjunction with NMR analysis showed large amounts of substitutedβGlcNac and OsubstitutedβGal NMR analysis shows most of the GlcNAc and Gal residues were present as LacNac repeats of approximately Finally fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled ricin was added to fixed tryptosomes and detected by fluorescence microscopy Fig Subcellular localization of ricinbinding glycoproteins in bloodstream form T brucei by fluorescence microscopy Fixed trypanosomes were stained with
