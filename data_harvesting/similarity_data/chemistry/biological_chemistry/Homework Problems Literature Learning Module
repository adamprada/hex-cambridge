the Two Nuclease Domains of the Cas RNAguided Endonuclease This page contains assessmentexam questions using data figures and graphs from research journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry which allow their use or from journals such as from PLOS that are completely open access The papers and topics chosen were selected to assess student understanding of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ASBMB foundational concepts and learning objectives as well as MCAT foundational concepts and objectives These two sets of standards broadly overlap Both ASBMB and the MCAT strongly emphasis scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are perhaps best assessed by openended questions derived from the literature in which students must employ higher level Bloom skills of application and analysis These questions can also be used by students who seek more opportunities to practice interpreting research literature results The ability to apply analyze and evaluate information and concepts are at the heart of scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are central to the new ASBMB and MCAT competency standards The questions in this learning module are designed to assess these competencies using openended responses instead of multiplechoice questions Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper Cut Site Selection by the Two Nuclease Domains of the Cas RNAguided Endonuclease Hongfan Chen Jihoon Choi and Scott BaileyThe Journal of Biological Chemistry Background and Review A promising tool for genome manipulation and regulation in a wide variety of organisms has recently been identified in the RNAguided DNA endonuclease activity of the CRISPRCas clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatCRISPRassociated system CRISPRCas an inheritable prokaryotic immune system protects bacteria and archaea against mobile genetic elements via RNAguided target silencing CRISPRCas systems consist of an array of short direct repeats interspersed by variable invaderderived sequences spacers and a cas operon During invasion small fragments of the invading DNA from phage or plasmids protospacers are incorporated into host CRISPR loci transcribed and processed to generate small CRISPR RNAs crRNA The invading nucleic acid is then recognized and silenced by Cas proteins guided by the crRNAs There are three types of CRISPRCas system each characterized by the presence of a signature gene Programmed DNA cleavage requires the fewest components in the type II CRISPRCas system requiring only crRNA a transactivating crRNA tracrRNA and the Cas endonuclease the signature gene of the type II system The system can be further simplified by fusing the mature crRNA and tracrRNA into a single guide RNA sgRNA In addition to its role in target cleavage tracrRNA also mediates crRNA maturation by forming RNA hybrids with primary crRNA transcripts leading to coprocessing of both RNAs by endogenous RNase III Cas contains two nuclease domains that together generate a doublestrand ds break in target DNA The HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand and the RuvClike nuclease domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand A short signature sequence named the protospacer adjacent motif PAM is characteristic of the invading DNA targeted by the type I and type II CRISPRCas systems The PAM serves two functions It has been linked to the acquisition of new spacer sequences and it is necessary for the subsequent recognition and silencing of target DNA The sequence length and position of the PAM vary depending on the CRISPRCas type and organism PAMs from type II systems are located downstream of the protospacer and contain bp of conserved sequence A variable sequence of up to bp separates the conserved sequence of the PAM from the protospacer This variable region is often included in the definition of the PAM sequence but for simplicity we refer to this variable region as the linker and the conserved sequence as the PAM To date Cas from Streptococcus pyogenes Cas from Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC and Cas from Neisseria meningitidis have been employed as tools for genome editing or regulation For these Cas orthologs the PAMs are GG GGNG and GATT and the linkers are and bp respectively The simplicity of sgRNA design and sequencespecific targeting means the RNAguided Cas machinery has great potential for programmable genome engineering Cas can be employed to generate mutations in cells by introducing dsDNA breaks The capabilities of Cas can be expanded to various genome engineering purposes such as transcription repression or activation with its nickase generated by inactivating one of its two nuclease domains or nuclease null variants Another appealing possibility for the Cas system is to target different Casmediated activities to multiple target sites for example transcriptional repression of one gene but activation of another To achieve this multiple Cas orthologs will need to be employed as a single ortholog cannot concurrently mediate different activities at multiple sites Therefore to broaden our understanding of Cas proteins we have characterized the Cas ortholog from S thermophilus LMG which we refer to as LMG Cas Questions Investigators studied the type II CRISPRCas system of S thermophilus LMG a Figure A shows a Coomassie Bluestained SDSpolyacrylamide gel of Cas Cas DA Cas DA and Cas DADA where D is aspartic acid and A is alanine and DA reflects the site of the specific mutation where D was changed to A Why did they perform this experiment b To confirm the PAM sequence for LMG Cas the authors performed BLAST searches to identify potential protospacers in viral and plasmid genomes that matched any of the spacer sequences from CRISPR This search generated unique target sequences from the genomes of bacteriophage known to infect S thermophilus We then aligned nucleotide segments from the identified target genomes inclusive of the nucleotide protospacer and nucleotide flanking regions Figure b shows B logo plot revealing the PAM for LMG Cas The positions of the protospacer PAM and linker are indicated What is the most likely consensus sequence of the PAM sequence How far is it away from the protospacer c Figure C shows a schematic representation of the CRISPR nucleic acid complexes Label the target DNA crRNA tracrRNA protospacer PAM and linker Draw in a connecting piece of RNA if you wish to create a single guide RNA containing both the crRNA and tracRNA What is the specific PAM sequence in this figure To confirm that the identified PAM was functional investigators needed a selection system They used a transformation assay in which E coli cells containing an exogenous type II CRISPRCas system were resistant to plasmid transformation whereas cells lacking the system are competent for transformation Explain how this system could be used to determine if specific PAM are functional a Figure A shows a schematic representation of transformation assay The target plasmid contained protospacer whose sequence was identical to the first spacer of CRISPR a bp linker and the identified PAM The first control plasmid contained only protospacer whereas the second control plasmid lacked both protospacer and PAM The target and control plasmids were then used to transformed cells in the presence of IPTG and the appropriate antibiotics Why did the investigators add IPTG What difference would you expect to find in the cells in the left panel compared to the right in their assay b Figure B shows plasmid transformation by LMG Cas and sgRNA in E coli cells Transformation efficiency is expressed as cfu per ng of plasmid DNA Average values from at least three biological replicates are shown with error bars representing SD Interpret and explain results c For Figure C the investigators made single nucleotide changes in the PAM sequence of the CRISPR plasmid and studied the effect on plasmid transformation efficiency Interpret he results d For Figure D the effect of the length of the linker length on plasmid transformation efficiency was studied PS denotes the protospacer sequence Interpret the results The investigators then studied their system in vitro by reconstituting the components They monitored DNA cleavage by LMG Cas as a measure of activity a Figure A shows an electrophoresis gel of reaction mixtures containing nm target plasmid nm Cas nm crRNA nucleotide crRNA containing the sequence derived from first spacer of CRISPR nm nucleotide tracrRNA and mm Mg that were incubated for min at oC The agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide Interpret the results Why does the linear control migrate less far than the uncut plasmid b In Figure B a cognate sgRNA was substituted for separate crRNA and tracrRNA molecules Interpret the gel results c In Figure C they studied cleavage in the presence of different sgRNA sequences Explain the results d For figure D the used different active site mutants of Cas The DA mutant was in the RuvClike domain while the HA mutant was in the HNH domain Explain the results What effect does the double mutant have on the activity e In Figure E the authors studied which domain was involved in the cleavage of each strand complementary to the guide DNA or the noncomplementary strand of the target DNA The dsDNA was radiolabeled at the end of the complementary strand left hand gel or the noncomplementary strand right hand gel Reactions were performed as in A and products were separated by denaturing PAGE The cleavage sites are indicated with arrows in the schematic diagram bottom nt nucleotides nt nucleotides Interpret the results f Do mutations in the PAM or changes in linker length have the same effect on DNA interference in vitro as they did in vivo The investigators monitored cleavage of these variant plasmids by recombinant LMG Cas Interpret the results in Figure F g In Figure G cleavage of plasmid targets containing the indicated linker lengths was studied In AC and EF the positions of negatively supercoiled nSC linear L and nicked or open circle OC plasmid are indicated The linear control is a digestion of the plasmid target with the restriction enzyme AgeI h In the mutational analysis they substituted asparatic acid for alanine Draw the structures of the side chains of D and A Why did they choose A to substitute for D What role might D have in catalysis in the wildtype protein To evaluate whether other divalent cations besides Mg can activate DNA cleavage by Cas the authors performed plasmid cleavage assays in the presence of one of the following divalent cations Ca Mn Co Ni and Cu a Figure A shows cleavage of a target plasmid by Cas with either no metal or mm of the indicated metal ions All reactions were treated with mm EDTA prior to metal addition Interpret the results b To identify which domain was activated we assayed the single active site mutants of Cas DA or HA in a reaction buffer containing Ca In both panels the positions of negatively supercoiled nSC linear L and nicked or open circle OC plasmid are indicated The linear control is a digestion of the plasmid target with the restriction enzyme AgeI To determine the effect of PAM sequence and linker length on binding of LMG Cas to DNA targets the authors determined the binding affinity Kd of the CassgRNA complex to endlabeled dsDNA targets using native gel electrophoresis a Why did they not include SDS in the gel b Binding experiments were conducted with the nucleasedeficient mutant of Cas DAHA in the presence of Mg Fixed concentrations of the dsDNA targets were incubated with increasing concentrations of the CassgRNA complex Why did they use the double mutant of Cas c Figure A below shows a representative gel shift assay for CassgRNA and the binding curve measured from the assay From inspection of the graph what is the approximate Kd for the interaction The top wedge indicates increasing concentration of the CassgRNA b A bar graph plotting Kd values for DNA targets with PAM mutations labeled red are shown below B Average values from at least three replicates are shown with error bars representing SD Targets where binding was not observed are shown with Kd values at the lower limit nm PS denotes the protospacer sequence Interpret the results c Next they investigated linker length and binding Figure C shows a bar graph plotting Kd values for DNA targets with different linker lengths labeled red C Average values from at least three
