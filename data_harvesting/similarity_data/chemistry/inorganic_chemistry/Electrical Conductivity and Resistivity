Conductivity vs ResistivityElectrical Transport PropertiesResistivity vs ResistanceReferencesProblemsAnswers to ProblemsContributors Electrical resistivity and conductivity is an important property for materials Different materials have different conductivity and resistivity Electrical conductivity is based on electrical transport properties These can be measured with multiple techniques by using a variety of instruments If electricity easily flows through a material that material has high conductivity Some materials that have high conductivity include copper and aluminum Electrical conductivity is the measure of how easily electricity flows through a material Conductivity vs Resistivity Conductivity and resistivity are inversely proportional to each other When conductivity is low resistivity is high When resistivity is low conductivity is high The equation is as follows where Resistivity is represented by and is measured in Ohmmeters Conductivity is represented by and is measured in Siemens Since conductivity is the measure of how easily electricity flows electrical resistivity measures how much a material resists the flow of electricity Electrical Transport Properties Simply put electricity is the movement of electrons through a material As electrons move through a material it comes into contact with atoms in the material Collisions slow the electrons down Each collision increases the resistivity of the material The easier the electrons continue through a material the fewer collisions that take place and the higher the conductivity When temperature increases the conductivity of metals usually decreases while the conductivity of semiconductors increases This of course assumes that the material is homogenous which is not always the case You can calculate resistivity using the following equation As you already read ρ is the symbol for resistivity is the electric field and has units of Volts per meter Vm J is the current density and has units of amps per meter squared Am The electric field is calculated by dividing the Voltage by the length l that voltage is applied The current density is calculated by the equation below I is the current and is divided by the cross sectional area A over which the current flows Resistivity vs Resistance Resistivity and resistance are two different things Resistivity does not depend on size or shape Resistance however does You can calculate resistance with the equation below R refers to resistance and is measured in Ω is the voltage and is measured in volts I measures the current and its unit is amps A References Electrical Conductivity and Resistivity Heaney Michael Electrical Measurement Signal Processing and Displays Jul Levy Peter M and Shufeng Zhang Electrical Conductivity of Magnetic Multilayered Structures Physical Review Letters Print Problems What is the current density of a material with a resistivity of Ωm and an electric field of Vm If the voltage of V is passed through a substance with a radius of m and a length of m what is the electric field What is the electric field of a material when the current is equal to A the resistance is measured to be Ω the current density equals Am and the length the current flows is m A material has a voltage of V and width of m The material also has a current of A and travels a distance of m What is the conductivity A metal originally has an electron colliding with every fifth atom and increases from a temperature of K to K A semiconductor originally has an electron colliding with every fifth atom and increases from a temperature of K to K What material will have a greater resistivity Why Answers to Problems EJ ρ JEρ Vm Ωm Am EVl Vm Vm EVl VIR EIRl A x Ωm Vm EJ ρ EVl JIA ρVlIA VmAm x m Ωm ρ σ ρ σ Ωm The material that has the greatest resistivity is the metal because as temperature increases metals are more likely to increase in resistivity and semiconductors usually decrease in resistivity as temperature increase Contributors Michael Ford UCD and Alexandra Christman UCD
