Carbon DioxideContributors and Attributions In a modern ab initio electronic structure calculation on a closed shell molecule the electronic Hamiltonian is used with a single determinant wavefunction This wavefunction is constructed from molecular orbitals that are written as linear combinations of contracted Gaussian basis functions The contracted Gaussian functions are composed from primitive Gaussian functions to match Slatertype orbitals STOs The exponential parameters in the STOs are optimized by calculations on small molecules using the nonlinear variational method and then those values are used with other molecules The problem is to calculate the electronic energy from and find the optimum coefficients for each molecular orbital in Equation by using the Self Consistent Field Method and the Linear Variational Method to minimize the energy as was described in the previous chapter for the case of atoms To obtain the total energy of the molecule we need to add the internuclear repulsion to the electronic energy calculated by this procedure The total energy of the molecule can be calculated for different geometries ie bond lengths and angles to find the minimum energy configuration Also the total energies of possible transition states can be calculated to find the lowest energy pathway to products in chemical reactions Exercise For a molecule with three nuclei show that the sums in Equation correctly include all the pairwise potential energy terms without including any twice As we improve the basis set used in calculations by adding more and better functions we expect to get better and better energies The variational principle says an approximate energy is an upper bound to the exact energy so the lowest energy that we calculate is the most accurate At some point the improvements in the energy will be very slight This limiting energy is the lowest that can be obtained with a single determinant wavefunction This limit is called the HartreeFock limit the energy is the HartreeFock energy the molecular orbitals producing this limit are called HartreeFock orbitals and the determinant is the HartreeFock wavefunction Exercise Write a onesentence definition of the HartreeFock wavefunction that captures all the essential features of this function Restricted vs Unrestricted HartreeFock You may encounter the terms restricted and unrestricted HartreeFock The above discussion pertains to a restricted HF calculation In a restricted HF calculation electrons with spin are restricted or constrained to occupy the same spatial orbitals as electrons with spin This constraint is removed in an unrestricted calculation For example the spin orbital for electron could be and the spin orbital for electron in a molecule could be where both the spatial molecular orbital and the spin function differ for the two electrons Such spin orbitals are called unrestricted If both electrons are constrained to have the same spatial orbital eg and then the spin orbital is said to be restricted While unrestricted spin orbitals can provide a better description of the electrons twice as many spatial orbitals are needed so the demands of the calculation are much higher Using unrestricted orbitals is particular beneficial when a molecule contains an odd number of electrons because there are more electrons in one spin state than in the other Carbon Dioxide Now consider the results of a selfconsistent field calculation for carbon monoxide It is well known that carbon monoxide is a poison that acts by binding to the iron in hemoglobin and preventing oxygen from binding As a result oxygen is not transported by the blood to cells Which end of carbon monoxide carbon or oxygen do you think binds to iron by donating electrons We all know that oxygen is more electronrich than carbon vs electrons and more electronegative A reasonable answer to this question therefore is oxygen but experimentally it is carbon that binds to iron A quantum mechanical calculation done by Winifred M Huo published in J Chem Phys provides an explanation for this counterintuitive result The basis set used in the calculation consisted of functions the ls s px py and pz atomic orbitals of C and O Ten molecular orbitals mos were defined as linear combinations of the ten atomic orbitals which are written as where identifies the mo and identifies the atomic orbital basis function The ground state wavefunction is written as the Slater Determinant of the five lowest energy molecular orbitals Equation gives the energy of the ground state where the denominator accounts for the normalization requirement The coefficients in the linear combination are determined by the variational method to minimize the energy The solution of this problem gives the following equations for the molecular orbitals Only the largest terms have been retained here These functions are listed and discussed in order of increasing energy The says this is the first orbital The says it is symmetric with respect to reflection in the plane of the molecule The large coefficient means this is essentially the s atomic orbital of oxygen The oxygen s orbital should have a lower energy than that of carbon because the positive charge on the oxygen nucleus is greater This orbital is essentially the s atomic orbital of carbon Both the and are nonbonding orbitals since they are localized on a particular atom and do not directly determine the charge density between atoms This orbital is a bonding molecular orbital because the electrons are delocalized over C and O in a way that enhances the charge density between the atoms The means this is the third orbital This orbital also illustrates the concept of hybridization One can say the s and p orbitals on each atom are hybridized and the molecular orbital is formed from these hybrids although the calculation just obtains the linear combination of the four orbitals directly without the Ã  priori introduction of hybridization In other words hybridization just falls out of the calculation The hybridization in this bonding LCAO increases the amplitude of the function in the region of space between the two atoms and decreases it in the region of space outside of the bonding region of the atoms This molecular orbital also can be thought of as being a hybrid formed from atomic orbitals The hybridization of oxygen atomic orbitals because of the negative coefficient with sO decreases the electron density between the nuclei and enhances electron density on the side of oxygen facing away from the carbon atom If we follow how this function varies along the internuclear axis we see that near carbon the function is positive whereas near oxygen it is negative or possibly small and positive This change means there must be a node between the two nuclei or at the oxygen nucleus Because of the node the electron density between the two nuclei is low so the electrons in this orbital do not serve to shield the two positive nuclei from each other This orbital therefore is called an antibonding mo and the electrons assigned to it are called antibonding electrons This orbital is the antibonding partner to the orbital These two orbitals are degenerate and correspond to bonding orbitals made up from the px and py atomic orbitals from each atom These orbitals are degenerate because the x and y directions are equivalent in this molecule tells us that these orbitals are antisymmetric with respect to reflection in a plane containing the nuclei This orbital is the sp hybrid of the carbon atomic orbitals The negative coefficient for pC puts the largest amplitude on the side of carbon away from oxygen There is no node between the atoms We conclude this is a nonbonding orbital with the nonbonding electrons on carbon This is not a bonding orbital because the electron density between the nuclei is lowered by hybridization It also is not an antibonding orbital because there is no node between the nuclei When carbon monoxide binds to Fe in hemoglobin the bond is made between the C and the Fe This bond involves the donation of the nonbonding electrons on C to empty d orbitals on Fe Thus mo theory allows us to understand why the C end of the molecule is involved in this electron donation when we might naively expect O to be more electronrich and capable of donating electrons to iron Exercise Summarize how Quantum Mechanics is used to describe bonding and the electronic structure of molecules Exercise Construct an energy level diagram for CO that shows both the atomic orbitals and the molecular orbitals Show which atomic orbitals contribute to each molecular orbital by drawing lines to connect the mos to the aos Label the molecular orbitals in a way that reveals their symmetry Use this energy level diagram to explain why it is the carbon end of the molecule that binds to hemoglobin rather than the oxygen end Contributors and Attributions David M
