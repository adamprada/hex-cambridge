IntroductionLower Coordination NumbersCoordination Number Coordination Number Higher CoordinationCoordination Number Coordination Number Coordination Number Higher Coordination NumbersReferencesProblemsAnswersContributors Coordination numbers from to and the associated coordination complexes are very common especially in transition metal chemistry These complexes can take on a variety of geometries and each individual complex will have unique properties based on its substituents and their arrangement spatially Though there is no set number of ligands ions or bound atoms required for a species to be considered highly coordinated versus general coordination when the coordination number exceeds seven it is generally considered a high coordination number High coordination numbers are of particular interest in solution phase and inorganic chemistry Introduction The coordination number of a specified atom in a chemical species is the number of other atoms directly linked to that specified atom Coordination itself is the formation of a covalent bond the two shared electrons of which have come from only one of the two parts of the molecular entity linked by it as in the reaction of a Lewis acid and a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct alternatively the bonding formed in this way Coordination number is a measure of one of two things In a molecule the coordination number is simply the number of bound atoms to that molecule For an ion the coordination number is the number of ions that are either associated to or can associate with a given ionic species Coordination requires a sigma bond be present or available to be present and so a pi bond does not contribute to the coordination number of a species Lower Coordination Numbers Following are a few examples of more commonly encountered coordination numbers Coordination Number Coordination numbers of two are more common in organic molecules or in non transitionmetal containing species and relatively rare in transition metal containing species Coordination numbers of two result in a linear or collinear spacial arrangement Carbon Dioxide Coordination Number AgNH Coordination Number Coordination Number Coordination number is the most common coordination number especially among transition metal containing species Generally the octahedron is the preferred coordination geometry Other possible coordination geometries exist for coordination number six such as trigonal prismatic CoHO Coordination number Higher Coordination Higher coordination numbers and above exist though they are less common Coordination Number Seven coordinated atoms or molecules results in three main geometries Pentagonal bipyramid Capped octahedron Capped trigonal prism Coordination Number Eight coordinated atoms or molecules results in two main geometries Square antiprism Dodecahedron Coordination Number The only structure yet identified for coordination number systems is the tricrapt trigonal prism Two examples of these structures are ReH and TcH with the representative geometry shown below TcH Coordination number Higher Coordination Numbers Species exist with and coordination numbers Coordination numbers and are unique to complexes involving lanthanides and actinides Coordination number has a structure that is involved in boron chemistry the icosahedron Coordination number is the highest reported coordination number currently being described for PbHe References International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Coordination Number Compendium of Chemical Terminology Internet edition International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Coordination Compendium of Chemical Terminology Internet edition Hermann A Lein M and Schwerdtfeger P The Search for the Species with the Highest Coordination Number Angewandte Chemie International Edition doi anie Housecroft Catherine E Sharpe Alan G Inorganic Chemistry rd Ed Pearson Education Limited Problems What is the coordination number of the nitrate ion NO What is the coordination number around Co in this complex How many different ligands are around Cobalt What coordination number do you expect ThNO to have Draw out a rough structure remember lone pairs are required for coordination What is the likely geometry for this Answers Coordination number Pi Bonds do not contribute to coordination number Coordination number There is one ligand around Cobalt EDTA is hexadentate Coordination number Each NO ligand is bidentate The likely geometry is icosahedral like other coordination number species Contributors Brian Atwood UC Davis
