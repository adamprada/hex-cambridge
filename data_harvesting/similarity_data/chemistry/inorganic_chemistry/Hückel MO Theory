EthyleneContributors Learning Objectives Demonstrate how Hückels theory approximates teh full molecular orbital picture of molecules by treating the bonding and bonding networks independently Molecular orbital theory has been very successfully applied to large conjugated systems especially those containing chains of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds An approximation introduced by Hückel in considers only the delocalized p electrons moving in a framework of bonds This is in fact a more sophisticated version of a freeelectron model The simplest hydrocarbon to consider that exhibits bonding is ethylene ethene which is made up of four hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms Experimentally we know that the HCH and HCC angles in ethylene are approximately This angle suggests that the carbon atoms are sp hybridized which means that a singly occupied sp orbital on one carbon overlaps with a singly occupied s orbital on each H and a singly occupied sp lobe on the other C Thus each carbon forms a set of three bonds two CH sp s and one CC sp sp part a of Figure Figure a The σbonded framework is formed by the overlap of two sets of singly occupied carbon sp hybrid orbitals and four singly occupied hydrogen s orbitals to form electronpair bonds This uses of the valence electrons to form a total of five bonds four CH bonds and one CC bond b One singly occupied unhybridized pz orbital remains on each carbon atom to form a carboncarbon bond Note by convention in planar molecules the axis perpendicular to the molecular plane is the zaxis CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The Hückel approximation is used to determine the energies and shapes of the molecular orbitals in conjugated systems Within the Hückel approximation the covalent bonding in these hydrocarbones can be separated into two independent frameworks the bonding framework and the the bonding framework The wavefunctions used to describe the bonding orbitals in each framework results from different combinations of atomic orbitals The method limits itself to addressing conjugated hydrocarbons and specifically only electron molecular orbitals are included because these determine the general properties of these molecules the sigma electrons are ignored This is referred to as sigmapi separability and is justified by the orthogonality of and orbitals in planar molecules For this reason the Hückel method is limited to planar systems Hückel approximation assumes that the electrons in the bonds feel an electrostatic potential due to the entire bonding framework in the molecule ie it focuses only on the formation of bonds given that the bonding framework has already been formed Conjugated Systems A conjugated system has a region of overlapping porbitals bridging the interjacent single bonds that allow a delocalization of electrons across all the adjacent aligned porbitals These electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom but rather to a group of atoms Ethylene Before considering the Hückel treatment for ethylene it is beneficial to review the general bonding picture of the molecule Bonding in ethylene involves the hybridization of the and atomic orbitals on each carbon atom leaving the orbitals untouched Figure Figure Hybridizing of the carbon atomic orbitals to give hybrid orbitals for bonding to hydrogen atoms in ethylene CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The use of hybrid orbitals in the molecular orbital approach describe here is merely a convenience and not invoking valence bond theory directly An identical description can be extracted using exclusively atomic orbitals on carbon but the interpretation of the resulting wavefunctions is less intuitive For example the ith molecular orbital can be described via hybrid orbitals or via atomic orbitals where and are coefficients of the expansion Either describe will work and both are identical approaches since where are coefficients describing the hybridized orbital The bonding occurs via the mixing of the electrons in the hybrid orbitals on carbon and the electrons in the atomic orbitals of the four hydrogen atoms Figure left resulting in the bonding framework The bonding framework results from the unhybridized orbitals Figure right The independence of these two frameworks is demonstrated in the resulting molecular orbital diagram in Figure Hückel theory is concerned only with describing the molecular orbitals and energies of the bonding framework Figure Molecular orbitals demonstrating the sigmapi separability of the bonding framework blue and the bonding frameworks red of ethylene CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Hückel treatment is concerned only with describing the molecular orbitals and energies of the bonding framework Since Hückel theory is a special consideration of molecular orbital theory the molecular orbitals can be described as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals at carbon with their corresponding coefficients This equation is substituted in the Schrödinger equation with the Hamiltonian and the energy corresponding to the molecular orbital to give If Equation is multiplied by and integrated then where are the Hamiltonian matrix elements see note below and are the overlap integrals If Equation is multiplied by and integrated then Both Equations and can better represented in matrix notation or more simply as a product of matrices All diagonal Hamiltonian integrals are called Coulomb integrals and those of type are called resonance integrals Both integrals are negative and the resonance integrals determines the strength of the bonding interactions The equations described by Equation are called the secular equations and will also have the trivial solution of Within linear algebra the secular equations in Equation will also have a nontrivial solution if and only if the secular determinant is zero or in shorthand notation Everything in Equation is a known number except Since the secular determinant for ethylene is a matrix finding requires solving a quadratic equation after expanding the determinant There will be two values of which satisfy this equation and they are the molecular orbital energies For ethylene one will be the bonding energy and the other the antibonding energy for the orbitals formed by the combination of the two carbon orbitals Equation However if more than two atomic orbitals were used eg in a bigger molecule then more energies would be estimated by solving the secular determinant Solving the secular determinant is simplified within Hückel method via the following four assumptions All overlap integrals are set equal to zero This is quite reasonable since the orbitals are directed perpendicular to the direction of their bonds Figure This assumption is often call neglect of differential overlap NDO All resonance integrals between nonneighboring atoms are set equal to zero All resonance integrals between neighboring atoms are equal and set to All coulomb integrals are set equal to These assumptions are mathematically expressed as Assumptions means that the overlap integral between the two atomic orbitals is Matrix Representation of the Hamiltonian The Coulomb integrals and resonance integrals are often described within the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian specifically within the basis or within the Hückel assumptions The Hückel assumptions reduces Equation in two homogeneous equations if Equation is divided by and then a new variable is defined then Equation simplifies to The trivial solution gives both wavefunction coefficients equal to zero and the other nontrivial solution is determined by solving the secular determinant which when expanded is so Knowing that from Equation the energy levels can be found to be or Since is negative the two energies are ordered Figure For For Figure energies of ethylene with occupation CC BYNC Ümit Kaya To extract the coefficients attributed to these energies the corresponding values can be substituted back into the Secular Equations Equation For the lower energy state This gives and the molecular orbitals attributed to this energy is then based off of Equation where is the normalization constant for this molecular orbital this is the bonding molecular orbital For the higher energy molecular orbital and then This gives and the molecular orbitals attributed to this energy is then based off of Equation where is the normalization constant for this molecular orbital this is the antibonding molecular orbital The normalization constants for both molecular orbitals can obtained via the standard normalization approach ie to obtain These molecular orbitals form the bonding framework and since each carbon contributes one electron to this framework only the lowest molecular orbital is occupied Figure in the ground state The corresponding electron configuration is then Figure Schemetic representation of the molecular orbitals framework for ethylene Notice that the antibonding molecular orbital has one more node than the bonding molecular orbital as expected since it is higher in energy CC BYNC Ümit Kaya HOMO and LUMO are acronyms for highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital respectively and are often referred to as frontier orbitals The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is termed the HOMOLUMO gap Ψ ϕ ϕ psi dfrac sqrt phi _phi _ The D calculated molecular orbitals are shown in Figure Figure Calculated molecular orbitals for ethylene left the bonding orbital psi_ rangle and right the antibonding orbital Limitations of Hückel Theory Hückel theory was developed in the s when computers were unavailable and a simple mathematical approaches were very important for understanding experiment Although the assumptions in Hückel theory are drastic they enabled the early calculations of molecular orbitals to be performed with mechanical calculators or by hand Hückel Theory can be extended to address other types of atoms in conjugated molecules eg nitrogen and oxygen Moreover it can be extended to also treat orbitals and this Extended Hückel Theory is still used today Despite the utility of Hückel Theory it is highly qualitative and we should remember the limitations of Hückel Theory Hückel Theory is very approximate Hückel Theory cannot calculate energies accurately electronelectron repulsion is not calculated Hückel Theory typically overestimates predicted dipole moments Hückel Theory is best used to provide simplified models for understanding chemistry and for a detailed understanding modern ab initio molecular methods discussed
