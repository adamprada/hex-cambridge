IntroductionIonization EnergyElectron AffinitiesExothermic vs endothermic processPeriodic TrendReferencesOutside Links Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron away from an atom which can be written as IE On the periodic table the IE of an atom decreases as you descend from a group and increases as you go across a period also as each molecular orbital is filled or half filled Electron affinity on the other hand is the energy released when an electron is added to the atom On the periodic table electron affinity usually decreases down a group and increases across a period Although these trends often hold truth there are some exceptions to these patterns Introduction Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from its molecular orbital The nth ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the nth electron The ionization energy can predict the atoms reactivity Atoms with lower ionization energies easily lose their valence electrons and become cations which will react with anions to from ionic bonds Ionization Energy The ionization energy is usually determined experimentally It is the energy needed to remove a valence electron off of its molecular orbital of the atom in its neutral state An equation to demonstrate it is shown below X g X g e Example of IE of Magnesium Mgg Mgg e I kJmol IE stands for the first ionization energy the energy the atom requires to expel the first electron from its orbital Similarly the second ionization energy will be the energy needed to expel the second electron Mgg Mgg e I kJmol However IE of Magnesium will be larger than that of IE because it is not energetically favorable to separate an electron from a positively charged ion The general pattern of the ionization energy as they are in regard to the period table is that the IE increases across a period and decreases down a group Because it requires more energy to remove an electron from a stable atom the noble gases are usually associated with the highest IE Because their valence shells are already filled and stablized they will require much more energy to disrupt that stability The first electron that is expelled is the most loosely held to the atom On the other hand the group elements are usually associated with the lowest IE Since only one electron occupies the valence shell of these atoms it will be more energetically favorable for them to lose the electron in order to achieve a full orbital shell However there are few exceptions The IE decreases when crossing from element in group to the element in group The group has halffilled electronic configuration ns np This type of configuration is very stable its hard to remove electron from valence shell Therefore element in group requires greater value of IE than group Another exception is that going from Be group to B group the IE decreases because Be has the filled shell s which is more stable than the electronic configuration of B s p Hence Be will require more IE than B Similarly the IE decreases when going from elements in group to group Electron Affinities Electron affinity often abbreviated as EA is the energy released when an electron is added to a valence shell of the atom Fg e Fg EA kJmol When an electron is added to an atom energy is given off This process is exothermic Atoms like the noble gases will not gain an electron because they are already in their most stable state with a full shell Atoms like F will most likely gain an electron because when a free electron is added to the outer shell of fluorine it will have obtained a full shell Generally atoms increasing across a period will increase in EA also Exothermic vs endothermic process Og e Og EA kJmol Og e Og EA kJmol When an electron is added to an atom the energy change is exothermic because of the attraction of the electron to the nucleus However in the case of EA where the electron is added to an anion the repulsion between the anion and this newly added electron will overwhelm the attraction of the electron to the nucleus Therefore this process will be endothermic as opposed to EA Periodic Trend The general trend of IE and EA along a periodic table References Vedeneyer Vladimir Ivanovich Bond Energies Ionization Potentials and Electron Affinities London Edward Arnold Print Petrucci Ralph General Chemistry Principles and Modern Applications New Jersey Pearson Prentice Hall Outside Links This is not meant for references used for constructing the module but as secondary and unvetted information available at other site Link to outside sources Wikipedia entries should probably be referenced here
