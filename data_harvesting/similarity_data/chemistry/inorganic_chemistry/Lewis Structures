IntroductionBasic Steps for Simple StructuresFormal ChargesLewis structures of Charged MoleculesMultiple Bonds in Lewis StruturesProblemsAnswersReferencesOutside LinksContributors Lewis Structures are very similar to electron dot diagrams except for the fact that shared electrons between atoms are shown as lines Lone pairs of electrons themselves are usually represented by dots around the atoms These diagrams are helpful because they allow us to predict the shape of the molecule and see the positions of each atom relative to the others Introduction In Gilbert Lewis Newton introduced a way to show the bonding of atoms in a molecule though diagrams Creating Lewis Structures is rather simple and only requires a small series of steps and little bit of math Basic Steps for Simple Structures Lewis Structure are very simple to construct and only take a few short steps Make sure to have a paper and pencil handy because you will be drawing these molecules as well as doing some simple math For this module we will use Boron trifluoride as our example First you write the the formula using atomic symbols BF The next step requires you to pick the least electronegative atom to be your central atom In this case boron B will be our central atom Next you must sum of the total amount of valence electrons in the outer most orbital of each atom Boron contains valence electrons while the fluorine atoms contain valence electrons each The total amount of electrons we have to work with is electrons In some cases there may be a charge on the molecule you are working on If this charge is negative then you add the value of that charge to the amount of electrons you totaled up Whereas if the charge is positive then you subtract that value from the amount that you totaled up In this case we do not have a charge on our molecule so we will stick to using electrons The next step requires some drawing Draw out your central atom and place the three fluorine atoms a small distance away from it The fluorine molecules should be an equal distance away from each other Next you must draw a short line connecting the boron atom to each of the fluorine atom These short lines each represent electrons that are being shared between the two bonded atoms Because we have lines in this diagram it means that we have used up of our original electrons leaving us with electrons left These electrons will be used to fill the octets of the atoms surrounding the central atom These electrons will be known as the lone pairs because they are not bonded to another atom You will represent these electrons by using dots around the atom each dot represents one electrons Because each fluorine requires another electrons each to fill their octets this means that we have used up all of our remaining electrons Boron does not fill its octet because it is one of the few exceptions to the rule It is perfectly fine only forming bonds The final structure can be seen in a diagram below Because there are three bonded atoms to a central atom with no lone pairs on it be can also conclude that BF has a trigonal planar geometry with sp hybridization BF is only one of the many simple Lewis Structures There are others that require a little bit more time in creating because they contain a little bit more criteria to complete it Some of the more complex structures may contain charges as well as double or triple bonds There are also many molecules that break the octet rule and can form a total of or bonds to the central atom Formal Charges When drawing Lewis Structures you need to check the structures formal charge Unless a charge is preferred you want the overall charge of the molecule to be Formal Charge of valence electrons of unpaired electrons of paired electrons So the formal charges are FCBoron FCFluorine FCTotal FCBoron FCFluorine If a formal charge is preferred then the final answer should be in brackets with the charge outside of the bracket Lewis structures of Charged Molecules In the case of Triiodide I you notice that there is a negative charge That means that instead of the valence electrons for each I you add one more electron to make it You will then create the structure though the steps that were given above The only additional step required is to put your final structure in brackets with the charge of the molecule outside of the brackets Triiodide can be seen below Multiple Bonds in Lewis Strutures In the case of CO when it comes time to create a lewis structure it seems as though you don not have enough electrons to complete the octets of all the atoms When you run into this problem it usually means that the molecule will contain a double or triple bond There are valence electrons in a CO molecule If you go about the steps that were given to you above you will notice that the octets of the oxygen atoms have been filled but the carbon still needs more electrons What you need to do it move one pair of electrons from each oxygen atom and turn it into a double bond on each side of the carbon The final structure for CO can be seen below Problems Complete the following problems to to evaluate your understanding of this
