D CrystalD Crystal There are many factors to be considered such as covalent character and electronelectron interactions in ionic solids But for simplicity let us consider the ionic solids as a collection of positive and negative ions In this simple view appropriate number of cations and anions come together to form a solid The positive ions experience both attraction and repulsion from ions of opposite charge and ions of the same charge The Madelung constant is a property of the crystal structure and depends on the lattice parameters anioncation distances and molecular volume of the crystal D Crystal Before considering a threedimensional crystal lattice we shall discuss the calculation of the energetics of a linear chain of ions of alternate signs Figure Figure A hypothetical onedimensional lattice Let us select the positive sodium ion in the middle at as a reference and let be the shortest distance between adjacent ions the sum of ionic radii The Coulomb energy of the other ions in this D lattice on this sodium atom can be decomposed by proximity or shells Nearest Neighbors first shell This reference sodium ion has two negative chloride ions as its neighbors on either side at so the Coulombic energy of these interactions is underbrace dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o_textleft chloride ion underbrace dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o_textright chloride ion dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o labeleq Next Nearest Neighbors second shell Similarly the repulsive energy due to the next two positive sodium ions at a distance of is underbrace dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o_textleft sodium ion underbrace dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o_textright sodium ion dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o labeleq Next Next Nearest Neighbors third shell The attractive Coulomb energy due to the next two chloride ions neighbors at a distance is underbrace dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o_textleft chloride ion underbrace dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o_textright chloride ion dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o labeleq and so on Thus the total energy due to all the ions in the linear array is E dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o ldots or We can use the following Maclaurin expansion to simplify the sum in the parenthesis of Equation refeq as to obtain beginalign E dfrace pi epsilon_o r_o left ln right labeleq pt dfrace pi epsilon_o M endalign The first factor of Equation refeq is the Coulomb energy for a single pair of sodium and chloride ions while the factor is the Madelung constant per molecule The Madelung constant is named after Erwin Medelung and is a geometrical factor that depends on the arrangement of ions in the solid If the lattice were different when considering D or D crystals then this constant would naturally differ D Crystal In three dimensions the series does present greater difficulty and it is not possible to sum the series conveniently as in the case of onedimensional lattice As an example let us consider the the crystal In the following discussion assume be the distance between and ions The nearest neighbors of are six ions at a distance r ions at a distance r eight ions at r six ions at r ions at r and so on Thus the electrostatic potential of a single ion in a crystal by approximating the ions by point charges of the surrounding ions For NaCl is a poorly converging series of interaction energies with is the number of charges of the ions eg for NaCl is the charge of an electron is x CJ m The Madelung constant depends on the structure type and Equation is applicable only for the sodium chloride eig rock salt lattice geometry Other values for other structural types are given in Table is the number of anions coordinated to cation and is the numbers of cations coordinated to anion Table Madelung Constants Compound Crystal Lattice M A C Type NaCl

anions coordinated to cation and C is the numbers of cations coordinated to anion There are other factors to consider for the evaluation of lattice energy and the treatment by Max Born and Alfred Lande led to the formula for the evaluation of lattice energy for a mole of crystalline solid The BornLand√© equation Equation is a means of calculating the lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound and derived from the electrostatic potential of the ionic lattice and a repulsive potential energy term where is Avogadro constant is the Madelung constant for the lattice is the charge number of cation is the charge number of anion is elementary charge C is the permittivity of free space is the distance to closest ion is the Born exponent that is typically between and and is determined experimentally is a number related to the electronic configurations of the ions involved Table Table values for select solids AtomMolecule n He Ne Ar Kr Xe LiF LiCl LiBr NaCl NaBr Example Estimate the lattice energy for SOLUTION Using the values giving in the discussion above the estimation is given by Much more should be considered in order to evaluate the lattice energy accurately but the above calculation leads you to a good start When methods to evaluate the energy of crystallization or lattice energy lead to reliable values these values can be used in the BornHable cycle to evaluate other chemical properties for example the electron affinity which is really difficult to determine directly by experiment
