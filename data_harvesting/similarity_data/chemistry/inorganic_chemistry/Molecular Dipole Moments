location as shown below Figure To locate the molecule so specifically we would need to give the and coordinates of each of its atoms ie which is a total of numbers However we note that the molecule looks the same no matter where in space it is located This is called translational invariance and it implies that we can give only the coordinates of one of the atoms relative to the other which is equivalent to giving the vector difference between and or viceversa which we will call the vector which is only numbers This is the same as arbitrarily placing atom A at the origin of our coordinate system We also note that the spatial orientation of the molecule is arbitrary since the molecule looks the same at any viewing angle For a diatomic its orientation can be specified by giving two angles the angle it makes with the zaxis and the angle of its projection onto the plane with the xaxis The choice of these angles is arbitrary This leaves only number left which is the distance between A and B called the molecules bond length This is an internal degree of freedom and is the only important number we need to give in order to convey the geometry of the diatomic In spite of this simplification it is often necessary to specify all of the coordinates of the atoms in a molecule Molecular modeling packages which are becoming increasingly important in chemical research require a full set of coordinates for each atom as input Similarly molecular data banks such as the protein data bank PDB will give molecular structures as files of and coordinates Thus being able to determine a set of coordinates given only bond lengths and bond angles and conversely being able to determine bond lengths and angles from a set of coordinates is an extremely important skill A few examples of how to do this will be illustrated below Example The diatomic How do we determine a set of coordinates for given only its bond length Since its absolute location in space and its orientation are arbitrary any set of coordinates that reproduces the correct bond length will suffice Thus since a diatomic is linear we may place it along one of the axes of our coordinate system with one of the atoms at the origin Figure Now we see that the coordinates of atom will simply be and the coordinates of atom since lies on the xaxis a distance away from will be Clearly this set of coordinates reproduces the correct bond length Thus for the molecule whose bond length is r stackrelcircA a set of coordinates could be in This is just one possibility We could have chosen either atom to be at the origin or anywhere else in space for that matter and chosen the bond to lie along any axis or not along any particular axis as we choose so long as the correct bond length is reproduced Example Water The geometry of water is bent we will see how to determine this later with a bond angle of and an bond length of approximately To determine a set of coordinates for we note that the molecule is planar so we may choose it to lie in the plane We will place the oxygen at the origin with the hydrogens as shown below Figure The coordinates of the oxygen can be written down immediately For each of the hydrogens note that the yaxis bisects the angle giving two right triangles An bond forms the hypotenuse of one of these triangles so that the and coordinates will be determined from the sine and cosine of the angle as can be shown using simple trigonometry To verify that the bond lengths are correctly reproduced we compute the magnitudes of the vector differences and In order to verify that the bond angle is correct we note that the angle between two vectors and is given by the formula where is the dot product of and defined to be Thus the angle is given by Periodic trends in bond lengths and bond energies Within a group of the periodic table bond lengths tend to increase with increasing atomic number Consider the Group elements which corresponds to an increased valence shell size hence increased electronelectron repulsion An important result from experiment which has been corroborated by theory is that bond lengths tend not to vary much from molecule to molecule Thus a bond will have roughly the same value in methane as it will in aspirin Bond dissociation energies were discussed in the last lecture in the context of ionic bonds There we used the symbol measured in This measures the energy required to break a mole of a particular kind of bond A similar periodic trend exists for bond dissociation energies Consider the hydrogen halides Thus as bond lengths increase with increasing there is a corresponding decrease in the bond dissociation energy bonds are an exception to the the rule of constancy of bond lengths across different molecules Because bonds can be single double or triple bonds some differences can occur For example consider the bond in the molecules ethane ethylene and acetylene The greater the bond order ie number of shared electron pairs the greater the dissociation energy The same will be true for any kind of bond that can come in such different flavors eg bonds bonds bonds bonds etc Polar covalent bonds Most real chemical bonds in nature are neither truly covalent nor truly ionic Only homonuclear bonds are truly covalent and nearly perfect ionic bonds can form between group I and group VII elements for example KF Generally however bonds are partially covalent and partially ionic meaning that there is partial transfer of electrons between atoms and partial sharing of electrons In order to quantify how much ionic character and how much covalent character a bond possesses electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bond can be used We have already seen one method for estimating atomic electronegativities the Mulliken method In Linus Pauling came up with another method that forms the basis of our understanding of electronegativity today Paulings method Recall the Mullikens method was based on the arithmetic average of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity Both of these energies are properties of individual atoms hence this method is appealing in its simplicity However there is no information about bonding in the Mulliken method Paulings method includes such information and hence is a more effective approach To see how the Pauling method works consider a diatomic which is polar covalent Let and be the dissociation energies of the diatomics and respectively Since and are purely covalent bonds these two dissociation energies can be used to estimate the pure covalent contribution to the bond Pauling proposed the geometric mean of and this being more sensitive to large differences between these energies than the arithmetic average If is the true bond dissociation energy then the difference is a measure of the ionic contribution Let us define this difference to be Then Pauling defined the electronegativity difference between atoms and to be where is measured in and the constant has units so that the electronegativity difference is dimensionless Thus with some extra input information he was able to generate a table of atomic electronegativities that are still used today Table A To use the electronegativities to estimate degree of ionic character simply compute the absolute value of the difference for the two atoms in the bond As an example consider again the hydrogen halides As the electronegativity difference decreases so does the ionic character of the bond Hence its covalent character increases Electric dipole moment In a nearly perfect ionic bond such as where electron transfer is almost complete representing the molecule as is a very good approximation since the charge on the potassium will be approximately and the charge on the fluorine will be approximately For a polar covalent bond such as in which only partial charge transfer occurs a more accurate representation would be where expressed in units of is known as a partial charge It suggests that a fraction of an electron is transferred although the reality is that there is simply a little more electron density on the more electronegative atom and a little less on the electropositive atom How much charge is actually transferred can be quantified by studying the electric dipole moment of the bond which is a quantity that can be measured experimentally The electric dipole moment of an assembly of charges having positions is defined to be Thus for a diatomic with charges and on atoms and respectively the dipole moment according to the definition would be Hence the magnitude of the dipole moment is where is the bond length As an example consider which has a partial charge on of which means and a bond length of Thus the magnitude of the dipole moment is Thus the units of the dipole moment are Coulomb meters However as this example makes clear this is a very large unit and awkward to work with for molecules A more convenient unit is the Debye defined to be is actually the dipole moment of two charges and separated by a distance of Thus for a diatomic with partial charges and the dipole moment in is given by and the percent ionic character is defined in terms of the partial charge by As an example consider again for which The bond length is Thus its dipole moment will be and its percent ionic character is Experimental importance of the dipole moment The electric dipole moment lies at the heart of a widely used experimental method for probing the vibrational dynamics of a system If a system is exposed to a monochromatic electromagnetic field from a laser then the electric dipole moment couples to the electric field component in such a way that the energy is In general the electric field is a function of space and time having the general wave form where is the frequency of the field with the speed of light and the wavelength and is called the wave vector and the direction of is the direction of wave propagation this will be covered in more detail next semester In most experiments the wavelength is long enough compared to the size of the system studied that one can take the electric field to be spatially constant and consider only the time dependence In this case Thus the electric field varies as a simple cosine function at a single frequency The importance of the coupling between the dipole moment and the timedependent electric field is that the frequency of the field can be varied over a range of natural frequencies in a given chemical system Thus chemical bonds vibrate at a particular natural frequency threeatom bending modes have their characteristic frequency etc What one seeks in this experiment is a report of the natural frequencies in the system since from such a report one can often tell one local chemical environment from another By sweeping through a range of frequencies the coupling of the field to the dipole moment suggests that the local charge distribution will respond to the oscillations of the field at the field frequency Thus if the field frequency is tuned to be that of a bond stretch the charge distribution in the bond will be stimulated and report on the frequency of the bond etc At each frequency the intensity of the response can be measured and a plot of vs is produced Such a plot is called an infrared spectrum The figure below shows the infrared spectrum for liquid water left and for M blue and M red KOH solutions right In the left panel the solid curve is the water spectrum obtained from a computer simulation while the dashed curve is the experimentally obtained spectrum On the right the red and blue curves are from computer simulations while the inset at the upper right is the experimentally measured spectrum The peaks in the spectra occur at particular vibrational frequencies in the system The water spectrum shows very distinct bands while the spectrum of the KOH solutions shows both bands and continuum regions The latter arise from the fact that protons can be transferred from water to hydroxide As the proton moves across a hydrogen bond between water and the hydroxide ion the vibrations in the bond sweep through a range of frequencies as the proton is transferred giving rise to the continuum This feature in the infrared spectra of solutions of strong acids and bases is known as Zundel polarization More information on how we compute these spectra and how the computer simulation are performed can be found in the following research papers H S Lee and M E Tuckerman J Chem Phys Z W Zhu and M E Tuckerman J Phys Chem B
