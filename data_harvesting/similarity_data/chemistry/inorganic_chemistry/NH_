IntroductionMolecular Orbital DiagramSymmetry ElementsCharacter TableReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors NH also known commonly as Ammonia is a colorless gas that carries with it a pungent smell It hydrogen bonds extremely well due to the fact that it has an accessible lone pair making it miscible with water It has a molecular configuration of trigonal pyramidal and with its lone pair experiences a dipole moment making the molecule polar Introduction Molecular Orbital Theory builds on the aspects of VSEPR Theory VB Theory the Pauli Exclusion Principle and Hunds Rule to explain how valence electrons fill in each molecular orbital The Molecular Orbital Theory explains for polyatomic molecules how hybridization occurs Molecular Orbital Theory has advantages over VB Theory in that it can explain paradiamagnetic properties of molecules and easily deduce their bond orders from the coinciding molecular orbital diagrams Molecular Orbital Diagram NH has valence electrons As was already discussed there is one lone pair and NH bonds resulting in a trigonal pyramidal shape Based on knowledge of Molecular Orbital Theory we fill the orbitals to obtain the lowest possible energy Resulting in paired electrons in the ﾏピ ﾏピ PICTURE HERE MO Diagram Symmetry Elements With the resulting predicted trigonal pyramidal shape we can find the primary axis of rotation to be a C and there are Cs We also can see ﾏプs along the NH bonds PICTURE HERE Symmetry elements trig planar model Character Table Cv E C ﾏプ Linear Rotations Quadratic A z xyz A Rz E xyRx Ry xy xyxzyz References This is meant for references used for constructing the module They must be primary and accessible to readers at a library You need at least two different sources here Websites are not allowed DOI links to J Chem Ed are ideal Do not reference class notes Also do not reference textbooks for maximal credit Using the insert citation button to automatically handle references is highly suggested bottom right button on editor toolbar Outside Links This is not meant for references used for constructing the module but as secondary and unvetted information available at other site Link to outside sources Wikipedia entries should probably be referenced here Problems What are the benefits of using MO theory over VB theory What is the predicted molecular geometry based on VSEPR Based on the MO diagram what is NH paramagnetic or diamagnetic Based on the MO diagram what is the bond order for NH What is NH point group characterization Be careful not to copy from existing textbooks Originality is rewarded Make up some practice problems for the future readers Five original with varying difficulty questions and answers are ideal Contributors Name here if anonymous you can avoid this with university affiliation Name here with university affiliation Tags below If no tags exist then add two new ones Vet and the level of the module content eg Fundamental See FAQ for more details
