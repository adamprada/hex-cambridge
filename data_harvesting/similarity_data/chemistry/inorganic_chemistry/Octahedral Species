IntroductionHeading ReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswersContributors In inorganic chemistry an octahedron is classified by its molecular geometry in which its distict shape is described as having six atoms groups of atoms or electron pairs symmetrically arranged around one central atom defining the vertices of an octahedron The prefix octa which means eight comes from the fact that the molecule has eight symmetrical faces All atoms are degrees apart from one another and degrees apart from the atom directly across and opposite from it In regards to identifying each species we will be looking at three separate unique shapes with different numbers of bond pairs and lone pairs This allows us to distinguish and classifiy the octahedrals based on the following shapes octahedral square pyramidal and square planar IntroductionHeading ReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswersContributors Introduction To be able to understand and distinguish the difference between the three types of octahedral species and how they differ from one molecule to the next it is essential to try to visualize shapes geometrically and in D A simple comprehension of geometry is required to be able to imagine molecules in D as well as having basic background knowledge of the concept of bonding pairs and lone pairs This allows one to recognize and see the difference in the molecular design for each individual molecule We will begin by describing the design of an octahedral and then continue on to the next two molecules An octahedral is best described as a central atom symmetrically arranged by six other atoms What makes this molecule different from other species is the fact that it is surrounded by six either the same or different atoms There are six bonding pairs in this molecule and no lone electron pairs The molecule below has no lone pairs of electrons surrounding it thus allowing it to have a distinct shape In a three dimensional sense we may think of a x y and z coordinate plane having both its positive and negative coordinate systems Another way of looking at it would be in the sense that all the faces of the molecule are present through this reference it resembles what would be a three dimensional prism All the atoms are spread apart degrees from each other and from the atom directly across and opposite from it The reson for the spacing is due to the molecule arranging itself in the most stable form possible limiting the bondpair to bondpair interaction Here is basic but clear example of what an octahedral looks like Octahedral bond pairs and electron pairs The next molecule that we will examine is known as a square pyramidal This molecule has a lot of the same characteristics as that of an octahedral in the sense it consist of a central atom that is still symmetrically surrounded by six other atoms What makes this molecule different from the previous molecule is the fact that this molecule does not consist of only bondpair atoms surrounding it There is one pair of electrons that has taken the place of one of the atoms and because these electrons are now present it gives the molecule a distict new look There are five bonding pairs and one electron pair The atoms have to arrange themselves in the most stable form possible not only limiting the bondpair to bondpair interaction but also limiting the bondpair to electronpair interaction The easiest way to visualize what this molecule looks like to visualize the x y and z coordinate plane again but this time remove what would be considered the negative y coordinate axis and put a pair of lone pair electrons in its place The molecule is still considered apart of the octahedral species because it still satisfies the atom requirement but in terms of its shape the electrons effect the shape This allows it to have its new shape If you actually exclude those electrons and lay the molecule on the surface you can see that it looks like a three dimensional pyramid with a square base Again all the atoms and electron pair are degrees apart from each other and from the atom directly across and opposite from it Here is what a square pyramidal would look like Square Pyramidal bond pairs and electron pair The last of the octahedral species is known as a square planar This molecule resembles both of the previous molecules but more similarly resembles a square pyramidal It still has many of the characteristics of a square pyramidal but what makes it different is that rather than having only one pair of electrons replacing the position of an atom there are two pairs of electrons that are replacing the position of two atoms To visualize what this molecule looks like we refer back to the x y and z coordinate system the only difference is this time we are taking away the entire y coordinate and replacing it with electrons on what would be the positive y coordinate axis as well as placing a pair of electrons in what would be considered the negative y coordinate axis The reason for this arrangement goes back to having the molecule arrange itself in the most stable form possible limiting interactions between bondpair to bondpair bondpair to electronpair and electronpair to electronpair If you try visualizing what this would look like it almost resembles a threedimensional X with two pairs of lone electrons Because the lone pairs of electrons are still present that allows this molecule to still be considered an octahedral due to the fact that it still meets the requirements of being surrounded by atoms or groups In regards to its shape the electron pairs cause repulsion thus allowing it to have its new shape The atoms and electrons are still degrees apart from eachother and degrees from the atom directly across and opposite from it Here is what a square planar would look like Square Planar bond pairs and electron pairs Heading Rename to desired subtopic You can delete the header for this section and place your own related to the topic

the way they do What conditions must be met Can two seperate electronpair stand at degrees apart from eachother Why Give one example of a molecules that would fall into the category of a octehedral square pyramidal and square planar Answers The molecules take the arrangment they do due to trying to arrange themselves in the most stable structure possible limiting the interaction between bondpair and electronpair interaction As long as these conditions can be met it is possible for the structure to not only exist but remain stable This again goes back to satisfying the conditions of keeping the molecule as stable as possible by limiting lonepair to lone pair interaction as well as same sign interaction Because electrons hold the same kind of charge they can not be near eachother due to same charge repulsion and so they need to be as far away as possible from eachother so that the molecule may be stable Molecules that would fall into the category of triganol planar based on their molecular geometry would be SF a molecule that falls into the category of a square pyramidal would be BrF and one molecule that would fall into a category of a square planar would be AuCl Contributors
