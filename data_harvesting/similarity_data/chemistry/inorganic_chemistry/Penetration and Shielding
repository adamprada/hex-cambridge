Slaters RulesCalculating SCalculating ZeffSummaryReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective To quantify the shielding effect experienced by atomic electrons We have previously described the concepts of electron shielding orbital penetration and effective nuclear charge but we did so in a qualitative manner In this section we explore one model for quantitatively estimating the impact of electron shielding and then use that to calculate the effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron in an atom The model we will use is known as Slaters Rules JC Slater Phys Rev Slaters Rules The general principle behind Slaters Rule is that the actual charge felt by an electron is equal to what youd expect the charge to be from a certain number of protons but minus a certain amount of charge from other electrons Slaters rules allow you to estimate the effective nuclear charge from the real number of protons in the nucleus and the effective shielding of electrons in each orbital shell eg to compare the effective nuclear charge and shielding d and s in transition metals Slaters rules are fairly simple and produce fairly accurate predictions of things like the electron configurations and ionization energies Slaters Rules Step Write the electron configuration of the atom in the following form s s p s p d s p d f s p Step Identify the electron of interest and ignore all electrons in higher groups to the right in the list from Step These do not shield electrons in lower groups Step Slaters Rules is now broken into two cases the shielding experienced by an s or p electron electrons within same group shield except the s which shield electrons within the n group shield electrons within the n or lower groups shield the shielding experienced by nd or nf valence electrons electrons within same group shield electrons within the lower groups shield These rules are summarized in Figure and Table Figure Graphical depiction of Slaters rules with shielding constants indicated CC BYNC Ãœmit Kaya Shielding happens when electrons in lower valence shells or the same valence shell provide a repulsive force to valence electrons thereby negating some of the attractive force from the positive nucleus Electrons really close to the atom n or lower pretty much just look like protons so they completely negate As electrons get closer to the electron of interest some more complex interactions happen that reduce this shielding Table Slaters Rules for calculating shieldings Group Other electrons in the same group Electrons in groups with principal quantum number n and azimuthal quantum number l Electrons in groups with principal quantum number n Electrons in all groups with principal quantum number n s nsnp nd or nf The shielding numbers in Table were derived semiempirically ie derived from experiments as opposed to theoretical calculations This is because quantum mechanics makes calculating shielding effects quite difficult which is outside the scope of this Module Calculating S Sum together the contributions as described in the appropriate rule above to obtain an estimate of the shielding constant which is found by totaling the screening by all electrons except the one in question where is the number of electrons in a specific shell and subshell and is the shielding of the electrons subject to Slaters rules Table Electrons

elements electrons in the same nd nf group ssp Ignore the group to the right of the d electrons these do not contribute to the shielding constant sp Sd Electrons of Copper Atoms What is the shielding constant experienced by a valence delectron in the copper atom Answer S Calculating Zeff One set of estimates for the effective nuclear charge was presented in Figure Previously we qualitatively described as being less than the actual nuclear charge because of the repulsive interaction between core and valence electrons We can quantitatively represent this difference between and as follows Rearranging this formula to solve for we obtain We can then substitute the shielding constant obtained using Equation to calculate an estimate of for the corresponding atomic electron Example The
