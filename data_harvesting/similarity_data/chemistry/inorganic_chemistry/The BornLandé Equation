IntroductionCalculate Lattice EnergyReferencesProblemsSolution The BornLandé equation is a concept originally formulated in by the scientists Born and Lande and is used to calculate the lattice energy measure of the strength of bonds of a compound This expression takes into account both the Born interactions as well as the Coulomb attractions Introduction Due to its high simplicity and ease the BornLandé equation is commonly used by chemists when solving for lattice energy This equation proposed by Max Born and Alfred Landé states that lattice energy can be derived from ionic lattice based on electrostatic potential and the potential energy due to repulsion To solve for the BornLandé equation you must have a basic understanding of lattice energy Lattice energy decreases as you go down a group as atomic radii goes up lattice energy goes down Going across the periodic table atomic radii decreases therefore lattice energy increases The BornLandé equation was derived from these two following equations the first is the electrostatic potential energy with is Avogadros constant is the Madelung Constant a constant that varies for different structures is the charge of an electron C is the cation charge is the anion charge is the permittivity of free space The second equation is the repulsive interaction with is the repulsion coefficient and is the Born Exponent typically ranges between that is used to measure how much a solid compresses These equations combine to form with is the closest ion distance Calculate Lattice Energy Lattice energy based on the equation from above is dependent on multiple factors We see that the charge of ions is proportional to the increase in lattice energy In addition as ions come into closer contact lattice energy also increases References Johnson D A Metals and Chemical Change Cambridge Royal Society of Chemistry Cotton F Albert and F Albert Cotton Advanced Inorganic Chemistry New York Wiley Problems Which compound has the greatest lattice energy AlF NACl LiF CaCl What is the lattice energy of NaCl Hint you must look up the values for the constants for this compound Calculate the lattice energy of NaCl Solution This question requires basic knowledge of lattice energy Since F gives the compound a positive charge and the Al gives the compound a negative charge the compound has large electrostatic attraction The bigger the electrostatic attraction the greater the lattice energy kJmol again this value is found in a table of constants
