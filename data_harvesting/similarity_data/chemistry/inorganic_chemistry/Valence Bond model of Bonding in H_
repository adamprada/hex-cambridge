Valence Bond Theory OverviewValence Bond Model of HydrogenOutside LinksProblemsContributors Valence Bond model of bonding in H shows the bond between two hydrogen atoms It is the simplest model that explains electron pairing from two separate atoms to form a molecule Valence Bond model of bonding H is the base for understanding the behavior of valence electrons in bonding Valence Bond Theory Overview Valence Bond Theory is a qualitative method for predicting the behavior of electrons in bonding It focuses on the overlap of the outermost orbitals where the valence electrons reside Electrons are thought to be concentrated along the interculear axis causing a density of negatively charged electrons between both atoms Attracted by the nuclei these shared electrons pull together their respective atoms to which the electrons belong and the result is formation of a covalent bond These hydrogens come together because of the electrostatic attraction between the nuclei and the electron desnity between them Based on the the principle of Valence Bond Theory two electrons are required to make a single bond Hydrogen has only one valence outer electron so two hydrogen atoms are needed to make a bond This allows accurate predictions about the shapes of simple molecules In case of H the shape is simply linear Because Valence Bond Theory involves only valence electrons Lewis dot structures are useful in representing a molecule However there are some drawbacks for certain bond predictions such as bond dissociation energy and magnetism Ultimately a different atom which has more valence electrons can pair with other atoms to form a molecule with more than one bond For instance carbon has valence electrons so it can bond with hydrogen atoms resulting a CH molecule Valence Bond Theory is most of the time used in conjuction with the idea of hybridization and VSEPR Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion in other to predict the shape and the bond angles of a molecule Valence Bond Model of Hydrogen The formation of H in Valence Bond Theory In this diagram HA and HB both have one electron that can be accounted for We know that the electron on HA belongs to HA and the electron on HB belongs to HB However When these two hydrogen bond it is impossible to know which electron belongs to HA or HB Also since these two molecules are the same they have equal attraction on the electrons they share This is because their orbitals overlap and they now share the electrons The electrons are allowed to spin in their respective orbitals Draw backs of Valence Bond Theory Although Valence Bond Theory together with hybridization and VSEPR predicts simple structures relatively well it becomes difficult to predict accurate energies of a bond It also fails to predict aspects of magnetism that can be explained by Molecular Orbital Theory References Brown Ian David The Chemical Bond in Inorganic Chemistry the Bond Valence Model Oxford Oxford UP Print Shaik Sason S and Philippe C Hiberty A Chemists Guide to Valence Bond Theory Hoboken NJ WileyInterscience Print Outside Links httpwwwtutornextcommolecularolectrons httpwwwiasacininitiatsci_edvb_articlepdf httpwwwtutornextcomsomecovaleructures Problems Draw the lewis structure of H AIt is similar to the first diagram or HH There is only one bond because each hydrogen only has one valence electron These two electrons pair to form the bond Explain why two hydrogens bond together ATwo hydrogens are able to bond together because they both have one valence electron The electrons are inclined to come together to form a bond between the nuclei of two hydrogen atoms Why is dihydrogen fundamentally important to applying valence bond theory of other molecules AUnderstanding the principles of valence bond theory applied to a hydrogenhydrogen model lays a basis for understanding valence bond theory applied to other molecules Contributors
