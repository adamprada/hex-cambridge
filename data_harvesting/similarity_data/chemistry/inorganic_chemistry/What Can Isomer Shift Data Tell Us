Bioinorganic chemistryContributors Among the drawbacks of the technique are the limited number of gamma ray sources and the requirement that samples be solid in order to eliminate the recoil of the nucleus Mössbauer spectroscopy is unique in its sensitivity to subtle changes in the chemical environment of the nucleus including oxidation state changes the effect of different ligands on a particular atom and the magnetic environment of the sample As an analytical tool Mössbauer spectroscopy has been especially useful in the field of geology for identifying the composition of ironcontaining specimens including meteors and moon rocks In situ data collection of Mössbauer spectra has also been carried out on iron rich rocks on Mars In another application Mössbauer spectroscopy is used to characterize phase transformations in iron catalysts eg those used for FischerTropsch synthesis While initially consisting of hematite FeO these catalysts transform into a mixture of magnetite FeO and several iron carbides The formation of carbides appears to improve catalytic activity however it can also lead to the mechanical breakup and attrition of the catalyst particles which can cause difficulties in the final separation of catalyst from reaction products Mössbauer spectroscopy has also been used to determine the relative concentration change in the oxidation state of antimony Sb during the selective oxidation of olefins During calcination all the Sb ions in an antimonycontaining tin dioxide catalyst transform into the oxidation state Following the catalytic reaction almost all Sb ions revert from the to the oxidation state A significant change in the chemical environment surrounding the antimony nucleus occurs during the oxidation state change which can easily be monitored as an isomer shift in the Mössbauer spectrum This technique has also been used to observe the secondorder transverse Doppler effect predicted by the theory of relativity because of very high energy resolution Bioinorganic chemistry Mossbauer spectroscopy has been widely applied to bioinorganic chemistry especially for the study of ironcontaining proteins and enzymes Often the technique is used to determine the oxidation state of iron Examples of prominent ironcontaining biomolecules are ironsulfur proteins ferritin hemes including the cytochromes These studies are often supplemented by analysis of related model complexes An area of particular interest is the characterization of intermediates involved in oxygen activation by iron proteins Vibrational spectra of iron enrched biomolecules can be acquired using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopyNRVS in which the sample is scanned through a range of synchrotrongenerated Xrays centered at the Mossbauer absorbance frequency Stokes and antistokes peaks in the spectrum correspond to low frequency vibrational many below cm with some below cm Contributors Wikipedia
