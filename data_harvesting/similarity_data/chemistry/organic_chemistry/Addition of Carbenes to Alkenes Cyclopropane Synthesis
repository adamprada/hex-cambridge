Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe and write the detailed mechanism for the formation of a carbene such as dichlorocarbene describe the structure of a carbene in terms of the hybridization of the central carbon atom write an equation for the formation of a substituted cyclopropane from an alkene and a carbene identify the reagents the alkene or both needed to prepare a given substituted cyclopropane by addition of a carbene to a double bond identify the substituted cyclopropane formed from the reaction of a given alkene with the reagents necessary to form a carbene Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below carbene RC carbenoid SimmonsSmith reaction stereospecific Study Notes A carbenoid is best considered to be a reagent which while not actually a carbene behaves as if it were an intermediate of this type Dichlorocarbenes can also form cyclopropane structures and are created in situ from reagents such as chloroform and KOH The detailed mechanism of the formation of dichlorocarbene is given below Note that the deprotonation of chloroform generates the trichloromethanide anion which spontaneously expels the chloride anion The highly strained nature of cyclopropane compounds makes them very reactive and interesting synthetic targets Additionally cyclopropanes are present in numerous biological compounds One common method of cyclopropane synthesis is the reaction of carbenes with the double bond in alkenes or cycloalkenes Methylene HC is simplest carbene and in general carbenes have the formula RC Other species that will also react with alkenes to form cyclopropanes but do not follow the formula of carbenes are referred to as carbenoids Introduction Carbenes were once only thought of as short lived intermediates The reactions of this section only deal with these short lived carbenes which are mostly prepared in situ in conjunction with the main reaction However there do exist so called persistent carbenes These persistent carbenes are stabilized by a variety of methods often including aromatic rings or transition metals In general a carbene is neutral and has valence electrons of which are non bonding These electrons can either occupy the same sp hybridized orbital to form a singlet carbene with paired electrons or two different sp orbitals to from a triplet carbene with unpaired electrons The chemistry of triplet and singlet carbenes is quite different but can be oversimplified to the statement singlet carbenes usually retain stereochemistry while triplet carbenes do not The carbenes discussed in this section are singlet and thus retain stereochemistry The reactivity of a singlet carbene is concerted and similar to that of electrophilic or nucleophilic addition although triplet carbenes react like biradicals explaining why sterochemistry is not retained The highly reactive nature of carbenes leads to very fast reactions in which the rate determining step is generally carbene formation Preparation of methylene The preparation of methylene starts with the yellow gas diazomethane CHN Diazomethane can be exposed to light heat or copper to facilitate the loss of nitrogen gas and the formation of the simplest carbene methylene The process is driven by the formation of the nitrogen gas which is a very stable molecule Carbene reaction with alkenes A carbene such as methlyene will react with an alkene which will break the double bond and result with a cyclopropane The reaction will usually leave stereochemistry of the double bond unchanged As stated before carbenes are generally formed along with the main reaction hence the starting material is diazomethane not methylene In the above case cisbutene is converted to cisdimethylcyclopropane Likewise below the trans configuration is maintained Additional Types of Carbenes and Carbenoids In addition to the general carbene with formula RC there exist a number of other compounds that behave in much the same way as carbenes in the synthesis of cyclopropane Halogenated carbenes are formed from halomethanes An example is dicholorcarbene ClC These halogenated carbenes will form cyclopropanes in the same manner as methylene but with the interesting presence of two halogen atoms in place of the hydrogen atoms Carbenoids are substances that form cyclopropanes like carbenes but are not technically carbenes One common example is the stereospecific SimmonSmith reaction which utilizes the carbenoid ICHZnI The carbenoid is formed in situ via the mixing of a ZnCu couple with CHISince this reacts thesame as a carbene the same methods can be applied to determine the product An example of this is given as problem Outside links httpenWikipediaorgwikiSimmonsSmith_reaction httpenWikipediaorgwikiCarbene Problems Knowing that cycloalkenes react much the same as regular alkenes what would be the expected structure of the product of cyclohexene and diazomethane facilitated by copper metal What would be the result of a SimmonsSmith reaction that used transpentene as a reagent What starting material could be used to form cisdiethylcyclopropane What would the following reaction yield Draw the product of this reaction What type of reaction is this Answers The product will be a bicyclic ring Bicycloheptane The stereochemistry will be retained making a cyclopropane with trans methyl and ethyl groups Transethylmethylcyclopropane The cis configuration will be maintained from reagent to product so we would want to start with cishexene A Simmons Smith reagent or methylene could be used as the carbene or carbenoid The halogenated carbene will react the same as methylene yielding cisdichlorodimethylcyclopropane This is a SimmonsSmith reaction which uses the carbenoid formed by the CHI and ZuCu The reaction results in the same product as if methylene was used and retains stereospecificity Iodine metal and the ZnCu are not part of the product The product is transethylmethylcyclopropane References Vollhardt K Peter C and Schore Neil E Organic Chemistry Structure and Function New York Bleyer Brennan
