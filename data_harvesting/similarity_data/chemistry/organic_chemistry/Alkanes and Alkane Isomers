structure and shorthand structure of each of the first ten straightchain alkanes name each of the first ten straightchain alkanes given its molecular formula Kekulé structure condensed structure or shorthand structure explain the difference in structure between a straight and a branchedchain alkane and illustrate the difference using a suitable example explain why the number of possible isomers for a given molecular formula increases as the number of carbon atoms increases draw all the possible isomers that correspond to a given molecular formula of the type Cn Hn where n is Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below branchedchain alkane constitutional or structural isomer homologous series isomer saturated hydrocarbon straightchain alkane or normal alkane Study Notes A series of compounds in which successive members differ from one another by a CH unit is called a homologous series Thus the series CH CH CH CnHn is an example of a homologous series It is important that you commit to memory the names of the first straightchain alkanes ie from CH to CH You will use these names repeatedly when you begin to learn how to derive the systematic names of a large variety of organic compounds You need not remember the number of isomers possible for alkanes containing more than seven carbon atoms Such information is available in reference books when it is needed When drawing isomers be careful not to deceive yourself into thinking that you can draw more isomers than you are supposed to be able to Remember that it is possible to draw each isomer in several different ways and you may inadvertently count the same isomer more than once Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of singlebonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups Alkanes are often called saturated hydrocarbons because they have the maximum possible number of hydrogens per carbon In Section thealkane molecule ethane was shown to contain a CC sigma bond By adding more CC sigma bond larger and more complexed alkanes can be formed Methane CH ethane CH and propane CH are the beginning of a series of compounds in which any two members in a sequence differ by one carbon atom and two hydrogen atomsnamely a CH unit Any family of compounds in which adjacent members differ from each other by a definite factor here a CH group is called a homologous series The members of such a series called homologs have properties that vary in a regular and predictable manner Figure The Three Simplest Alkanes Methane CH ethane CH and propane CH are the beginning of a series of compounds in which any two members in a sequence differ by one carbon atom and two hydrogen atomsnamely a CH unit Consider the series in Figure The sequence starts with CH and a CH unit is added in each step moving up the series Any family of compounds in which adjacent members differ from each other by a definite factor here a CH group is called a homologous series The members of such a series called homologs have properties that vary in a regular and predictable manner Figure Members of a Homologous Series Each succeeding formula incorporates one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms more than the previous formula The homologous series allows us to write a general formula for alkanes CnHn Using this formula we can write a molecular formula for any alkane with a given number of carbon atoms For example an alkane with eight carbon atoms has the molecular formula CH CH Molecular Formulas Alkanes are the simplest family of hydrocarbons compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only Alkanes only contain carbonhydrogen bonds and carboncarbon single bonds The first six alkanes are as follows Table Molecular formulas for small alkanes methane CH ethane CH propane CH butane CH pentane CH hexane CH You can work out the formula of any of the alkanes using the general formula CnHn Isomerism All of the alkanes containing or more carbon atoms show structural isomerism meaning that there are two or more different structural formulas that you can draw for each molecular formula Isomers from the Greek isos meros meaning made of the same parts are molecules that have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of the atoms in space Alkanes with carbons methane CH ethane CH and propane CH do not exist in isomeric forms because there is only one way to arrange the atoms in each formula so that each carbon atom has four bonds However CH has more than possible structure The four carbons can be drawn in a row to form butane or the can branch to form isobutane The two compounds have different propertiesfor example butane boils at C while isobutane boils at C butane isobutane Likewise the molecular formula CH has three possible isomer The compound at the far left is pentane because it has all five carbon atoms in a continuous chain The compound in the middle is isopentane like isobutane it has a one CH branch off the second carbon atom of the continuous chain The compound at the far right discovered after the other two was named neopentane from the Greek neos meaning new Although all three have the same molecular formula they have different properties including boiling points pentane C isopentane C and neopentane C pentane isopentane neopentane Of the structures show above butane and pentane are called normal alkanes or straightchain alkanes indicating that all contain a single continuous chain of carbon atoms and can be represented by a projection formula whose carbon atoms are in a straight line The other structures isobutane isopentane and neopentane are called called branchedchain alkanes As the number of carbons in an akane increases the number of possible isomers also increases as shown in the table below Table Number of isomers for hydrocarbons Molecular Formula Number of Structural Isomers CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH Akanes can be represented in many different ways The figure below shows some of the different ways straightchain butane can be represented Most often chemists refer to butane by the condensed structure CHCHCHCH or nCH where n denotes a normal straight alkane Note that many of these structures only imply bonding connections and do not indicate any particular geometry The bottom two structures referred to as ball and stick and space filling do show D geometry for butane Because the fourcarbon chain in butane may be bent in various ways the groups can rotate freely about the CC bonds However this rotation does not change the identity of the compound It is important to realize that bending a chain does not change the identity of the compound all of the following represent the same compound butane The nomenclature of straight alkanes is based on the number of carbon atoms they contain The number of carbons are indicated by a prefix and the suffix ane is added to indicate the molecules is an alkane The prefix for three carbons is prop so adding ane the IUPAC name for CH is propane Likewise the prefix for six is hex so the name for the straight chain isomer of CH is called hexane The first ten prefixes should be memorized because these alkane names from the basis for naming many other organic compounds Table The First StraightChain Alkanes Molecular Formula Prefix Condensed Structural Formula Name CH Meth
