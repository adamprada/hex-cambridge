Normal nIso i Secondary SecTertiary tert or tExample Classification of carbon atomsExercisesSolutionsQuestions SolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to recognize and name any alkyl group that can be considered to have been formed by the removal of a terminal hydrogen atom from a straightchain alkane containing ten or fewer carbon atoms explain what is meant by a primary secondary tertiary or quaternary carbon atom represent the various types of organic compounds using the symbol R to represent any alkyl group Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below alkyl group methyl group isopropyl group secbutyl group isobutyl group tertbutyl group primary carbon secondary carbon tertiary carbon quaternary carbon Study Notes The differences among primary secondary tertiary and quaternary carbon atoms are explained in the following discussion A convenient way of memorizing this classification scheme is to remember that a primary carbon atom is attached directly to only one other carbon atom a secondary carbon atom is attached directly to two carbon atoms and so on The IUPAC system requires first that we have names for simple unbranched chains and second that we have names for simple alkyl groups that may be attached to the chains An alkyl group is formed by removing one hydrogen from the alkane chain The removal of this hydrogen results in a stem change from ane to yl to indicate an alkyl group The removal of a hydrogen from methane CH creates a methyl group CH Likewise the removal of a hydrogen from ethane CHCH creates an ethyl group CHCH The nomenclature pattern can continue to provide a series of straightchain alkyl groups from straight chain alkanes with a hydrogen removed from the end Note the letter R is used to designate a generic unspecified alkyl group Table Straight chain alkane and alkyl group names Alkane Name Alkyl Group Name Abbreviation CH Methane CH Methyl Me CHCH Ethane CHCH Ethyl Et CHCHCH Propane CHCHCH Propyl Pr CHCHCHCH Butane CHCHCHCH Butyl Bu CHCHCHCHCH Pentane CHCHCHCHCH Pentyl CHCHCHCHCHCH Hexane CHCHCHCHCHCH Hexyl Prior to the systematic nomenclature developed for organic chemistry prefixes were used to specify the connection point of straightchain and branchedchain alkyl groups Although the modern nomenclature system discussed in the next section is preferred these older terms are still often used especially in solvents and reagents Thus an understanding of these prefixes is important to understanding organic chemistry Notice that the total number of carbons in the alkyl subsistent is still indicated with the prefix yl For methyl and ethyl alkyl groups there is only one possible connection point so connection prefixes are not necessary Starting with a three carbon alkyl group propyl the possibility of multiple connection points necessitates connection prefixes These prefixes are often abbreviated with a letter which is italicized Normal n The prefix n is used to indicate a connection at the end of a straightchain alkane This prefix is not commonly used to just indicate alkyl subsistent as discussed above However it is sometime used to indicate the connection of a functional group onto a straight alkane Iso i Starting with propyl alkyl groups there is the possibility of a connection other than the very end The prefix iso implies that the connection ends with a CHCH group Secondary Sec Starting with butyl straightchain alkyl groups there is the possibility of a connection on the second carbon from the end of the chain These alkyl groups are given the prfix Sec Tertiary tert or t Starting with four carbon alkyl groups there is an isomer which can have a connection endind with a CHC group These alkyl groups get the prefix t Example Using the naming system described above is often used to describe halogens which contain only a few carbons The halogen is shown as bonded to the connection point of the alkyl group Classification of carbon atoms Carbons have a special terminology to describe how many other carbons they are attached to This allows for an easy description of branching in alkanes Also we will find that the number of carbons attached to a given atom will have subtle effects on its chemistry Primary carbons o attached to one other C atom Secondary carbons o are attached to two other Cs Tertiary carbons o are attached to three other Cs Quaternary carbons o are attached to four Cs The figure below use the group R to represent an alkyl group of unspecified length R typically used to represent alkyl groups but an also represent a part of a molecule which is either unspecified or not germane to the discussion This terminology will be used repeatedly in organic chemistry to describe the number of carbons attached to a specific atom however the atom will not always a carbon Example Please indicate the the number of o o o and o carbons in the following molecule The molecule has six Primary carbons o The molecule has one Secondary carbon o The molecule has one Tertiary carbon o The molecule has one Quaternary carbon o Hydrogen atoms are also classified in this manner A hydrogen atom attached to a primary carbon atom is called a primary hydrogen ect Primary hydrogens o are attached to carbons bonded to one other C atom Secondary hydrogens o are attached to carbons bonded to two other Cs Tertiary hydrogens o are attached to carbons bonded to three other Cs It is not possible to have a quaternary hydrogen o Example Please indicate the the number of o o and o hydrogens are in the following molecule The molecule has fifteen Primary o hydrogens The molecule has two Secondary o hydrogens The molecule has one Tertiary o hydrogen Exercises Please indicate the the number of o o o and o carbons in the following molecules a b c Knowing that the ending anol means that there is an OH attached to the alkyl group Please draw a nPentanol b tbutanol c Sechexanol Solutions a The molecule has eight Primary carbons o The molecule has zero Secondary carbon o The molecule has two Tertiary carbon o The molecule has two Quaternary carbon o b The molecule has four Primary carbons o The molecule has zero Secondary carbon o The molecule has zero Tertiary carbon o The molecule has one Quaternary carbon o c The
