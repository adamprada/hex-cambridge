Stability of carbocation intermediatesExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe the geometry of a given carbocation arrange a given series of carbocations in order of increasing or decreasing stability explain the relative stability of methyl primary secondary and tertiary carbocations in terms of hyperconjugation and inductive effects Study Notes Although hyperconjugation can be used to explain the relative stabilities of carbocations this explanation is certainly not the only one and is by no means universally accepted A more common explanation involving the concept of an inductive effect is given below It is a general principle in chemistry that the more a charge is dispersed the more stable is the species carrying the charge Put simply a species in which a positive charge is shared between two atoms would be more stable than a similar species in which the charge is borne wholly by a single atom In a tertiary carbocation the positively charged carbon atom attracts the bonding electrons in the three carboncarbon sigma Ïƒ bonds and thus creates slight positive charges on the carbon atoms of the three surrounding alkyl groups and indeed on the hydrogen atoms attached to them Chemists sometimes use an arrow to represent this inductive release Note These diagrams do not reflect the geometry of the carbocation The overall charge on the carbocation remains unchanged but some of the charge is now carried by the alkyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that is the charge has been dispersed In the tertiary carbocation shown above the three alkyl groups help to stabilize the positive charge In a secondary carbocation only two alkyl groups would be available for this purpose while a primary carbocation has only one alkyl group available Thus the observed order of stability for carbocations is as follows tertiary secondary primary methyl Stability of carbocation intermediates We know that the ratelimiting step of an SN reaction is the first step formation of the this carbocation intermediate The rate of this step and therefore the rate of the overall substitution reaction depends on the activation energy for the process in which the bond between the carbon and the leaving group breaks and a carbocation forms According to Hammonds postulate section B the more stable the carbocation intermediate is the faster this first bondbreaking step will occur In other words the likelihood of a nucleophilic substitution reaction proceeding by a dissociative SN mechanism depends to a large degree on the stability of the carbocation intermediate that forms The critical question now becomes what stabilizes a carbocation So if it takes an electron withdrawing group to stabilize a negative charge what will stabilize a positive charge An electron donating group A positively charged species such as a carbocation is very electronpoor and thus anything which donates electron density to the center of electron poverty will help to stabilize it Conversely a carbocation will be destabilized by an electron withdrawing group Alkyl groups methyl ethyl and the like are weak electron donating groups and thus stabilize nearby carbocations What this means is that in general more substituted carbocations are more stable a tertbutyl carbocation for example is more stable than an isopropyl carbocation Primary carbocations are highly unstable and not often observed as reaction intermediates methyl carbocations are even less stable Alkyl groups are electron donating and carbocationstabilizing because the electrons around the neighboring carbons are drawn towards the nearby positive charge thus slightly reducing the electron poverty of the positivelycharged carbon It is not accurate to say however that carbocations with higher substitution are always more stable than those with less substitution Just as electrondonating groups can stabilize a carbocation electronwithdrawing groups act to destabilize carbocations Carbonyl groups are electronwithdrawing by inductive effects due to the polarity of the CO double bond It is possible to demonstrate in the laboratory see section D that carbocation A below is more stable than carbocation B even though A is a primary carbocation and B is secondary The difference in stability can be explained by considering the electronwithdrawing inductive effect of the ester carbonyl Recall that inductive effects whether electronwithdrawing or donating are relayed through covalent bonds and that the strength of the effect decreases rapidly as the number of intermediary bonds increases In other words the effect decreases with distance In species B the positive charge is closer to the carbonyl group thus the destabilizing electronwithdrawing effect is stronger than it is in species A In the next chapter we will see how the carbocationdestabilizing effect of electronwithdrawing fluorine substituents can be used in experiments designed to address the question of whether a biochemical nucleophilic substitution reaction is SN or SN Stabilization of a carbocation can also occur through resonance effects and as we have already discussed in the acidbase chapter resonance effects as a rule are more powerful than inductive effects Consider the simple case of a benzylic carbocation This carbocation is comparatively stable In this case electron donation is a resonance effect Three additional resonance structures can be drawn for this carbocation in which the positive charge is located on one of three aromatic carbons The positive charge is not isolated on the benzylic carbon rather it is delocalized around the aromatic structure this delocalization of charge results in significant stabilization As a result benzylic and allylic carbocations where the positively charged carbon is conjugated to one or more nonaromatic double bonds are significantly more stable than even tertiary alkyl carbocations Because heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen are more electronegative than carbon you might expect that they would by definition be electron withdrawing groups that destabilize carbocations In fact the opposite is often true if the oxygen or nitrogen atom is in the correct position the overall effect is carbocation stabilization This is due to the fact that although these heteroatoms are electron withdrawing groups by induction they are electron donating groups by resonance and it is this resonance effect which is more powerful We previously encountered this same idea when considering the relative acidity and basicity of phenols and aromatic amines in section Consider the two pairs of carbocation species below In the more stable carbocations the heteroatom acts as an electron donating group by resonance in effect the lone pair on the heteroatom is available to delocalize the positive charge In the less stable carbocations the positivelycharged carbon is more than one bond away from the heteroatom and thus no resonance effects are possible In fact in these carbocation species the heteroatoms actually destabilize the positive charge because they are electron withdrawing by induction Finally vinylic carbocations in which the positive charge resides on a doublebonded carbon are very unstable and thus unlikely to form as intermediates in any reaction Example In which of the structures below is the carbocation expected to be more stable Explain Answer In the carbocation on the left the positive charge is located in a position relative to the nitrogen such that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen can be donated to fill the empty orbital This is not possible for the carbocation species on the right For the most part carbocations are very highenergy transient intermediate species in organic reactions However there are some unusual examples of very stable carbocations that take the form of organic salts Crystal violet is the common name for the chloride salt of the carbocation whose structure is shown below Notice the structural possibilities for extensive resonance delocalization of the positive charge and the presence of three electrondonating amine groups Example Draw a resonance structure of the crystal violet cation in which the positive charge is delocalized to one of the nitrogen atoms Answer When considering the possibility that a nucleophilic substitution reaction proceeds via an SN pathway it is critical to evaluate the stability of the hypothetical carbocation intermediate If this intermediate is not sufficiently stable an SN mechanism must be considered unlikely and the reaction probably proceeds by an SN mechanism In the next chapter we will see several examples of biologically important SN reactions in which the positively charged intermediate is stabilized by inductive and resonance effects inherent in its own molecular structure Example State which carbocation in each pair below is more stable or if they are expected to be approximately equal Explain your reasoning Answer a tertiary vs secondary carbocation b equal c tertiary vs secondary carbocation d positive charge is further from electronwithdrawing fluorine e lone pair on nitrogen can donate electrons by resonance f allylic carbocation positive charge can be delocalized to a second carbon Exercises Questions Q Draw the cationic intermediates that are seen in the following reactions Solutions S Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC
