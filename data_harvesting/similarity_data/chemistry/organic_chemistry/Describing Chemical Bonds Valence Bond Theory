Valence Bond TheoryRepresentative Bond Energies and LengthsExercisesSolutionsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to explain how covalent bonds are formed as a result of the ability of atoms to share electrons describe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of the overlapping of atomic orbitals Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bond strength covalent bond bond length sigma σ bond pi π bond valence bond theory Valence Bond Theory As we have been discussing how to use Lewis structures to depict the bonding in organic compounds we have been very vague so far in our language about the actual nature of the chemical bonds themselves We know that a covalent bond involves the sharing of a pair of electrons between two atoms but how does this happen and how does it lead to the formation of a bond holding the two atoms together Two main models have been developed to described how covalent bonds are formed valence bond theory and molecularly orbital theory Valence bond theory is most often used to describe bonding in organic molecules In this model covalent bonds are considered to form from the overlap of two atomic orbitals on different atoms each orbital containing a single electron The electrons become paired in the orbital overlap bonding the atoms together The simplest example valence bond theory can be demonstrated by the H molecule We can see from the periodic table that each hydrogen atom has a single valence electron If hydrogen atoms come together to form a bond then each hydrogen atom effectively has a share in both electrons and thus each resembles the noble gas helium and is more stable The electrons shared in the orbital overlap are represented by a single dash between the atoms Valence bond theory describes a chemical bond as the overlap of atomic orbitals In the case of the hydrogen molecule the s orbital of one hydrogen atom overlaps with the s orbital of the second hydrogen atom to form a molecular orbital called a sigma bond which contains two electrons of opposite spin The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap ne more characteristic of the covalent bond in H is important to consider at this point The two overlapping s orbitals can be visualized as two spherical balloons being pressed together This means that the bond has cylindrical symmetry if we were to take a crosssectional plane of the bond at any point it would form a circle This type of bond is referred to as a σsigma bond The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap The energy diagram below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms the colored curve changes as they approach each other When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero As the atoms move together their orbitals begin to overlap Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom In addition the electrons begin to repel each other as do the nuclei While the atoms are still widely separated the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions and the energy of the system decreases A bond begins to form As the atoms move closer together the overlap increases so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei At some specific distance between the atoms which varies depending on the atoms involved the energy reaches its lowest most stable value This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is called the the bond lengths between the two atoms The bond is stable because at this point the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration Figure A Plot of Potential Energy versus Internuclear Distance for the Interaction between Two Gaseous Hydrogen Atoms This optimal internuclear distance is the bond length For the H molecule the distance is pm picometers meters Likewise the difference in potential energy between the lowest energy state at the optimal internuclear distance and the state where the two atoms are completely separated is called the bond dissociation energy or more simply bond strength For the hydrogen molecule the HH bond strength is equal to about kJmol This means it would take kJ to break one mole of HH bonds Every covalent bond in a given molecule has a characteristic length and strength In general the length of a typical carboncarbon single bond in an organic molecule is about pm while carboncarbon double bonds are about pm carbonoxygen double bonds are about pm and carbonhydrogen bonds are in the range of to pm The strength of covalent bonds in organic molecules ranges from about kJmol for a carboniodine bond in thyroid hormone for example about kJmole for a typical carbonhydrogen bond and up to over kJmole for a carboncarbon triple bond Representative Bond Energies and Lengths Exercises
