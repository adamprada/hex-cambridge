Objectives After completing this section you should be able to predict the value of ΔH for a gasphase reaction given the necessary bond dissociation energy data predict the dissociation energy of a particular bond given ΔH for a reaction involving the bond and any other necessary bond dissociation energy data outline the limitations of using bond dissociation energies to predict whether or not a given reaction will occur Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bond dissociation energy solvation Study Notes The idea of calculating the standard enthalpy of a reaction from the appropriate bond dissociation energy data should be familiar to you from your firstyear chemistry course Solvation is the interaction between solvent molecules and the ions or molecules dissolved in that solvent The homolytic bond dissociation energy is the amount of energy needed to break apart one mole of covalently bonded gases into a pair of radicals The SI units used to describe bond energy are kiloJoules per mole of bonds kJMol It indicates how strongly the atoms are bonded to each other Introduction Breaking a covalent bond between two partners AB can occur either heterolytically where the shared pair of electron goes with one partner or another or or homolytically where one electron stays with each partner The products of homolytic cleavage are radicals and the energy that is required to break the bond homolytically is called the Bond Dissociation Energy BDE and is a measure of the strength of the bond Calculation of the BDE The BDE for a molecule AB is calculated as the difference in the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants for homolysis Officially the IUPAC definition of bond dissociation energy refers to the energy change that occurs at K and the symbol is However it is commonly referred to as BDE the bond dissociation energy and it is generally used albeit imprecisely interchangeably with the bond dissociation enthalpy which generally refers to the enthalpy change at room temperature K Although there are technically differences between BDEs at K and K those difference are not large and generally do not affect interpretations of chemical processes Bond BreakageFormation Bond dissociation energy or enthalpy is a state function and consequently does not depend on the path by which it occurs Therefore the specific mechanism in how a bond breaks or is formed does not affect the BDE Bond dissociation energies are useful in assessing the energetics of chemical processes For chemical reactions combining bond dissociation energies for bonds formed and bonds broken in a chemical reaction using Hesss Law can be used to estimate reaction enthalpies Example Chlorination of Methane Consider the chlorination of methane the overall reaction thermochemistry can be calculated exactly by combining the BDEs for the bonds broken and bonds formed CH CH H BDECHH Cl Cl BDECl H Cl HCl BDEHCl CH Cl CHCl BDECHCl Because reaction enthalpy is a state function it does not matter what reactions are combined to make up the overall process using Hesss Law However BDEs are convenient to use because they are readily available Alternatively BDEs can be used to assess individual steps of a mechanism For example an important step in free radical chlorination of alkanes is the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane to form a free radical RH Cl R HCl The energy change for this step is equal to the difference in the BDEs in RH and HCl This relationship shows that the hydrogen abstraction step is more favorable when BDERH is smaller The difference in energies accounts for the selectivity in the halogenation of hydrocarbons with different types of CH bonds Table Representative CH BDEs in Organic Molecules RH Do kJmol D kJmol RH Do kJmol D kJmol CHH HCCHH CHCHH CHH CHCHH HCCH CHCH HCCHCHH HCOH CHCHH CHCOH Trends in CH BDEs It is important to remember that CH BDEs refer to the energy it takes to break the bond and is the difference in energy between the reactants and the products Therefore it is not appropriate to interpret BDEs solely in terms of the stability of the radical products as is often done Analysis of the BDEs shown in the table above shows that there are some systematic trends BDEs vary with hybridization Bonds with sp hybridized carbons are weakest and bonds with sp hybridized carbons are much stronger The vinyl and phenyl CH bonds are similar reflecting their sp hybridization The correlation with hybridization can be viewed as a reflection of the CH bond lengths Longer bonds formed with sp orbitals are consequently weaker Shorter bonds formed with orbitals that have more scharacter are similarly stronger CH BDEs vary with substitution Among sp hybridized systems methane has the strongest CH bond CH bonds on primary carbons are stronger than those on secondary carbons which are stronger than those on tertiary carbons Interpretation of CH BDEs for sp Hybridized Carbons The interpretation of the BDEs in saturated molecules has been subject of recent controversy As indicated above the variation in BDEs with substitution has traditionally been interpreted as reflecting the stabilities of the alkyl radicals with the assessment that more highly substituted radicals are more stable as with carbocations Although this is a popular explanation it fails to account fo the fact the bonds to groups other than H do not show the same types of variation R BDERCH BDERCl BDERBr BDEROH CH CHCH CHCH CHC Therefore although CCH bonds get weaker with more substitution the effect is not nearly as large as that observed with CH bonds The strengths of CCl and CBr bonds are not affected by substitution despite the fact that the same radicals are formed as when breaking CH bonds and the COH bonds in alcohols actually increase with more substitution Gronert has proposed that the variation in BDEs is alternately explained as resulting from destabilization of the reactants due to steric repulsion of the substituents which is released in the nearly planar radicals Considering that BDEs reflect the relative energies of reactants and products either explanation can account for the trend in BDEs Another factor that needs to be considered is the electronegativity The Pauling definition of electronegativity says that the bond dissociation energy between unequal partners is going to be dependent on the difference in electrongativities according to the expression where and are the electronegativities and the bond energies are in eV Therefore the variation in BDEs can be interpreted as reflecting variation in the electronegativities of the different types of alkyl fragments There is likely some merit in all three interpretations Since Gronerts original publication of his alternate explanation there have been many desperate attempts to defend the radical stability explanation References Gronert S J Org Chem Further Reading
