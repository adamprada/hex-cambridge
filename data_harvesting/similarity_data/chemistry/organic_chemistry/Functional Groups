completing this section you should be able to explain why the properties of a given organic compound are largely dependent on the functional group or groups present in the compound identify the functional groups present in each of the following compound types alkenes alkynes arenes alkyl and aryl halides alcohols ethers aldehydes ketones esters carboxylic acids carboxylic acid chlorides

single functional group identify which of the compound types listed under Objective above it belongs to draw the structure of a simple example of each of the compound types listed in Objective Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below functional group Study Notes The concept of functional groups is a very important one We expect that you will need to refer back to tables at the end of Section quite frequently at first as it is not really feasible to learn the names and structures of all the functional groups and compound types at one sitting Gradually they will become familiar and eventually you will recognize them automatically Functional groups are small groups of atoms that exhibit a characteristic reactivity A particular functional group will almost always display its distinctive chemical behavior when it is present in a compound Because of their importance in understanding organic chemistry functional groups have specific names that often carry over in the naming of individual compounds incorporating the groups As we progress in our study of organic chemistry it will become extremely important to be able to quickly recognize the most common functional groups because they are the key structural elements that define how organic molecules react For now we will only worry about drawing and recognizing each functional group as depicted by Lewis and line structures Much of the remainder of your study of organic chemistry will be taken up with learning about how the different functional groups tend to behave in organic reactions Drawing abbreviated organic structures Often when drawing organic structures chemists find it convenient to use the letter R to designate part of a molecule outside of the region of interest If we just want to refer in general to a functional group without drawing a specific molecule for example we can use R groups to focus attention on the group of interest The R group is a convenient way to abbreviate the structures of large biological molecules especially when we are interested in something that is occurring specifically at one location on the molecule Common Functional Groups In the following sections many of the common functional groups found in organic chemistry will be described Tables of these functional groups can be found at the bottom of the page Hydrocarbons The simplest functional group in organic chemistry which is often ignored when listing functional groups is called an alkane characterized by single bonds between two carbons and between carbon and hydrogen Some examples of alkanes include methane CH is the natural gas you may burn in your furnace or on a stove Octane CH is a component of gasoline Alkanes Alkenes sometimes called olefins have carboncarbon double bonds and alkynes have carboncarbon triple bonds Ethene the simplest alkene example is a gas that serves as a cellular signal in fruits to stimulate ripening If you want bananas to ripen quickly put them in a paper bag along with an apple the apple emits ethene gas setting off the ripening process in the bananas Ethyne commonly called acetylene is used as a fuel in welding blow torches Alkenes and alkynes Alkenes have trigonal planar electron geometry due to sp hybrid orbitals at the alkene carbons while alkynes have linear geometry due to sp hybrid orbitals at the alkyne carbons Furthermore many alkenes can take two geometric forms cis or trans or Z and E which will be explained in detail in Chapter The cis and trans forms of a given alkene are different molecules with different physical properties there is a very high energy barrier to rotation about a double bond In the example below the difference between cis and trans alkenes is readily apparent Alkanes alkenes and alkynes are all classified as hydrocarbons because they are composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms Alkanes are said to be saturated hydrocarbons because the carbons are bonded to the maximum possible number of hydrogens in other words they are saturated with hydrogen atoms The double and triplebonded carbons in alkenes and alkynes have fewer hydrogen atoms bonded to them they are thus referred to as unsaturated hydrocarbons As we will see in Chapter hydrogen can be added to double and triple bonds in a type of reaction called hydrogenation The aromatic group is exemplified by benzene which used to be a commonly used solvent on the organic lab but which was shown to be carcinogenic and naphthalene a compound with a distinctive mothball smell Aromatic groups are planar flat ring structures and are widespread in nature We will learn more about the structure and reactions of aromatic groups in Chapter Aromatics Functional Groups with Carbon Single Bonds to other Atoms Halides When the carbon of an alkane is bonded to one or more halogens the group is referred to as a alkyl halide or haloalkane The presence of a halogen atom F Cl Br or I is often represented by X due to the similar chemistry of halogens Chloroform is a useful solvent in the laboratory and was one of the earlier anesthetic drugs used in surgery Chlorodifluoromethane was used as a refrigerant and in aerosol sprays until the late twentieth century but its use was discontinued after it was found to have harmful effects on the ozone layer Bromoethane is a simple alkyl halide often used in organic synthesis Alkyl halides groups are quite rare in biomolecules Alcohols and Thiols In the alcohol functional group a carbon is singlebonded to an OH group the OH group by itself is referred to as a hydroxyl Except for methanol all alcohols can be classified as primary secondary or tertiary In a primary alcohol the carbon bonded to the OH group is also bonded to only one other carbon In a secondary alcohol and tertiary alcohol the carbon is bonded to two or three other carbons respectively When the hydroxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring the resulting group is called a phenol The sulfur analog of an alcohol is called a thiol the prefix thio derived from the Greek refers to sulfur Ethers and sulfides In an ether functional group a central oxygen is bonded to two carbons Below are the line and Lewis structures of diethyl ether a common laboratory solvent and also one of the first medical anaesthesia agents In sulfides the oxygen atom of an ether has been replaced by a sulfur atom Amines Amines are characterized by nitrogen atoms with single bonds to hydrogen and carbon Just as there are primary secondary and tertiary alcohols there are primary secondary and tertiary amines Ammonia is a special case with no carbon atoms One of the most important properties of amines is that they are basic and are readily protonated to form ammonium cations In the case where a nitrogen has four bonds to carbon which is somewhat unusual in biomolecules it is called a quaternary ammonium ion Note Do not be confused by how the terms primary secondary and tertiary are applied to alcohols and amines the definitions are different In alcohols what matters is how many other carbons the alcohol carbon is bonded to while in amines what matters is how many carbons the nitrogen is bonded to Carbonyl Containing Functional Groups Aldehydes and Ketones There are a number of functional groups that contain a carbonoxygen double bond which is commonly referred to as a carbonyl Ketones and aldehydes are two closely related carbonylbased functional groups that react in very similar ways In a ketone the carbon atom of a carbonyl is bonded to two other carbons In an aldehyde the carbonyl carbon is bonded on one side to a hydrogen and on the other side to a carbon The exception to this definition is formaldehyde in which the carbonyl carbon has bonds to two hydrogens Carboxylic acids and acid derivatives If a carbonyl carbon is bonded on one side to a carbon or hydrogen and on the other side to a heteroatom in organic chemistry this term generally refers to oxygen nitrogen sulfur or one of the halogens the functional group is considered to be one of the carboxylic acid derivatives a designation that describes a grouping of several functional groups The eponymous member of this grouping is the carboxylic acid functional group in which the carbonyl is bonded to a hydroxyl OH group As the name implies carboxylic acids are acidic meaning that they are readily deprotonated to form the conjugate base form called a carboxylate much more about carboxylic acids in Chapter In amides the carbonyl carbon is bonded to a nitrogen The nitrogen in an amide can be bonded either to hydrogens to carbons or to both Another way of thinking of an amide is that it is a carbonyl bonded to an amine In esters the carbonyl carbon is bonded to an oxygen which is itself bonded to another carbon Another way of thinking of an ester is that it is a carbonyl bonded to an alcohol Thioesters are similar to esters except a sulfur is in place of the oxygen In an acid anhydride there are two carbonyl carbons with an oxygen in between An acid anhydride is formed from combination of two carboxylic acids with the loss of water anhydride an anhydride In an acyl phosphate the carbonyl carbon is bonded to the oxygen of a phosphate and in an acid chloride the carbonyl carbon is bonded to a chlorine Nitriles and Imines In a nitrile group a carbon is triplebonded to a nitrogen Nitriles are also often referred to as cyano groups Molecules with carbonnitrogen double bonds are called imines or Schiff bases Phosphates Phosphorus is a very important element in biological organic chemistry and is found as the central atom in the phosphate group Many biological organic molecules contain phosphate diphosphate and triphosphate groups which are linked to a carbon atom by the phosphate ester functionality Because phosphates are so abundant in biological organic chemistry it is convenient to depict them with the abbreviation P Notice that this P abbreviation includes the oxygen atoms and negative charges associated with the phosphate groups Molecules with Multiple Functional Groups A single compound may contain several different functional groups The sixcarbon sugar molecules glucose and fructose for example contain aldehyde and ketone groups respectively and both contain five alcohol groups a compound with several alcohol groups is often referred to as a polyol Capsaicin the compound responsible for the heat in hot peppers contains phenol ether amide and alkene functional groups capsaicin The male sex hormone testosterone contains ketone alkene and secondary alcohol groups while acetylsalicylic acid aspirin contains aromatic carboxylic acid and ester groups While not in any way a complete list this section has covered most of the important functional groups that we will encounter in biological and laboratory organic chemistry The table found below provides a summary of all of the groups listed in this section plus
