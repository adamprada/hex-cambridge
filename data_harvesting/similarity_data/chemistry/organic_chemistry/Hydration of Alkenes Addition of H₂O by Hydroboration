and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to identify hydroboration followed by oxidation as a method for bringing about the apparently nonMarkovnikov addition of water to an alkene write an equation for the formation of a trialkylborane from an alkene and borane write an equation for the oxidation of a trialkylborane to an alcohol draw the structure of the alcohol produced by the hydroboration and subsequent oxidation of a given alkene determine whether a given alcohol should be prepared by oxymercurationdemercuration or by hydroborationoxidation and identify the alkene and reagents required to carry out such a synthesis write the detailed mechanism for the addition of borane to an alkene and explain the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of the reaction Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below hydroboration Study Notes The two most important factors influencing organic reactions are polar or electronic effects and steric effects HydroborationOxidation is a two step pathway used to produce alcohols The reaction proceeds in an AntiMarkovnikov manner where the hydrogen from BH or BHR attaches to the more substituted carbon and the boron attaches to the least substituted carbon in the alkene bouble bond Furthermore the borane acts as a lewis acid by accepting two electrons in its empty p orbital from an alkene that is electron rich This process allows boron to have an electron octet A very interesting characteristic of this process is that it does not require any activation by a catalyst The Hydroboration mechanism has the elements of both hydrogenation and electrophilic addition and it is a stereospecific syn addition meaning that the hydroboration takes place on the same face of the double bond this leads cis stereochemistry Introduction Hydroborationoxidation of alkenes has been a very valuable laboratory method for the stereoselectivity and regioselectivity of alkenes An Additional feature of this reaction is that it occurs without rearrangement The Borane Complex First off it is very imporatnt to understand little bit about the structure and the properties of the borane molecule Borane exists naturally as a very toxic gas and it exists as dimer of the general formula BH diborane Additionally the dimer BHignites spontaneously in air Borane is commercially available in ether and tetrahydrofuran THF in these solutions the borane can exist as a lewis acidbase complex which allows boron to have an electron octetBHBH The Mechanism Step Part Hydroboration of the alkene In this first step the addittion of the borane to the alkene is initiated and prceeds as a concerted reaction because bond breaking and bond formation occurs at the same time This part consists of the vacant p orbital of the boron electrophile pairing with the electron pair of the bondof the nucleophile Transition state Note that a carbocation is not formed Therefore no rearrangement takes place Part The Anti Markovnikov addition of Boron The boron adds to the less substituted carbon of the alkene which then places the hydrogen on the more substituted carbon Both the boron and the hydrogen add simultaneously on the same face of the double bond syn addition Oxidation of the Trialkylborane by Hydrogen Peroxide Step Part the first part of this mechanism deals with the donation of a pair of electrons from the hydrogen peroxide ion the hydrogen peroxide is the nucleophile in this reaction because it is the electron donor to the newly formed trialkylborane that resulted from hydroboration Part In this second part of the mechanism a rearrangement of an R group with its pair of bonding electrons to an adjacent oxygen results in the removal of a hydroxide ion Two more of these reactions with hydroperoxide will occur in order give a trialkylborate Part This is the final part of the Oxidation process In this part the trialkylborate reacts with aqueous NaOH to give the alcohol and sodium borate If you need additional visuals to aid you in understanding the mechanism click on the outside links provided here that will take you to other pages and media that are very helpful as well Stereochemistry of hydroboration The hydroboration reaction is among the few simple addition reactions that proceed cleanly in a syn fashion As noted above this is a singlestep reaction Since the bonding of the double bond carbons to boron and hydrogen is concerted it follows that the geometry of this addition must be syn Furthermore rearrangements are unlikely inasmuch as a discrete carbocation intermediate is never formed These features are illustrated for the hydroboration of αpinene Since the hydroboration procedure is most commonly used to hydrate alkenes in an antiMarkovnikov fashion we also need to know the stereoselectivity of the second oxidation reaction which substitutes a hydroxyl group for the boron atom Independent study has shown this reaction takes place with retention of configuration so the overall addition of water is also syn The hydroboration of αpinene also provides a nice example of steric hindrance control in a chemical reaction In the less complex alkenes used in earlier examples the plane of the double bond was often a plane of symmetry and addition reagents could approach with equal ease from either side In this case one of the methyl groups bonded to C colored blue in the equation covers one face of the double bond blocking any approach from that side All reagents that add to this double bond must therefore approach from the side opposite this methyl Outside links httpenWikipediaorgwikiHydroborationoxidation bcswhfreemancomvollhardtschtm httpwwwchemhelpercomhydroborationhtml
