equilibrium tautomerism tautomers Study Notes Rapid interconversion between tautomers is called tautomerism however as the two tautomers are in equilibrium the term tautomeric equilibrium may be used This section demonstrates the equilibrium between a ketone and an enol hence the term ketoenol tautomeric equilibrium is appropriate The term enol indicates the presence of a carboncarbon double bond and a hydroxyl ie alcohol group Later in the course you will see the importance of ketoenol tautomerism in discussions of the reactions of ketones carbohydrates and nucleic acids It is important to note that tautomerism is not restricted to ketoenol systems Other examples include imineenamine tautomerism and nitrosooxime tautomerism However at the moment you need only concern yourself with ketoenol tautomerism Notice how hydroboration complements hydration in the chemistry of both alkenes and alkynes Reaction Hydration of Alkynes As with alkeneshydration addition of water to alkynes requires a strong acid usually sulfuric acid and is facilitated by mercuric sulfate However unlike the additions to double bonds which give alcohol products addition of water to alkynes gives ketone products except for acetylene which yields acetaldehyde The explanation for this deviation lies in enolketo tautomerization illustrated by the following equation The initial product from the addition of water to an alkyne is an enol a compound having a hydroxyl substituent attached to a doublebond and this immediately rearranges to the more stable keto tautomer Tautomers are defined as rapidly interconverted constitutional isomers usually distinguished by a different bonding location for a labile hydrogen atom colored red here and a differently located double bond The equilibrium between tautomers is not only rapid under normal conditions but it often strongly favors one of the isomers acetone for example is keto tautomer Even in such onesided equilibria evidence for the presence of the minor tautomer comes from the chemical behavior of the compound Tautomeric equilibria are catalyzed by traces of acids or bases that are generally present in most chemical samples The three examples shown below illustrate these reactions for different substitutions of the triplebond The tautomerization step is indicated by a red arrow For terminal alkynes the addition of water follows the Markovnikov rule as in the second example below and the final product ia a methyl ketone except for acetylene shown in the first example For internal alkynes the triplebond is within a longer chain the addition of water is not regioselective If the triplebond is not symmetrically located ie if R R in the third equation are not the same two isomeric ketones will be formed HCCH HO HgSO HSO HCCHOH HCCHO RCCH HO HgSO HSO RCOHCH RCOCH RCCR HO HgSO HSO RHCCOHR RCOHCHR RCHCOR RCOCHR With the addition of water alkynes can be hydrated to form enols that spontaneously tautomerize to ketones Reaction is catalyzed by mercury ions Follows Markovnikovs Rule Terminal alkynes give methyl ketones The first step is an acidbase reaction where the π electrons of the triple bond acts as a Lewis base and attacks the proton therefore protinating the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents The second step is the attack of the nucleophilic water molecule on the electrophilic carbocation which creates an oxonium ion Next you deprotonate by a base generating an alcohol called an enol which then tautomerizes into a ketone Tautomerism is a simultaneous proton and double bond shift which goes from the enol form to the keto isomer form as shown above in Figure Now lets look at some Hydration Reactions Hydration of Terminal Alkyne produces methyl ketones Just as described in Figure the π electrons will attack a proton forming a carbocation which then gets attacked by the nucleophilic water molecules After deprotination we generate an enol which then tautomerizes into the ketone form shown Hydration of Alkyne As you can see here the π electrons of the triple bond are attacking the proton which forms a covalent bond on the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents Once the hydrogen is bound you have a carbocation which gets attacked by the water molecule Now you have a positive charge on the oxygen which results in a base coming in and deprotinating the molecule Once deprotinated you have an enol which then gets tautomerized Tautomerism is shown here when the proton gets attacked by the double bond π electrons forming a covalent bond between the carbon and the hydrogen on the less substituted carbon Electrons from the Oxygen end up moving to the carbon forming a double bond with carbon and giving itself a positive charge which then gets attacked by the base The base deprotinates the Oxygen resulting in the more stable final product at equilibrium which is a ketone Exercise Draw the structure of the product formed when each of the substances below is
