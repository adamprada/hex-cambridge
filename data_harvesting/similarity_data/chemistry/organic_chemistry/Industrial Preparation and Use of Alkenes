Catalytic Cracking to Form EthyleneEtheneContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to discuss the industrial importance of ethylene ethene and propylene propene describe briefly the industrial process known as thermal cracking Study Notes Among the most important and most abundant organic chemicals produced worldwide are the two simple alkenes ethylene and propylene They are used as the starting materials to synthesize numerous valuable compounds Produced from ethylene ethene Chemical Uses ethanol solvent constituent of cleaning preparations in synthesis of esters acetaldehyde slug killer in the form of methaldehyde CHCHO acetic acid manufacture of vinyl acetate polymers ethyl acetate solvent and cellulose acetate polymers ethylene oxide cellosolves industrial solvents ethylene glycol antifreeze production of DacronOR ethylene dichloride solvent production of vinyl chloride vinyl chloride manufacture of poly vinyl chloridePVC vinyl acetate manufacture of poly vinyl acetate used in paint emulsions plywood adhesives and textiles polyethylene plastic bags toys packaging Produced from propylene propene Chemical Uses isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol cosmetics synthesis of acetone propylene oxide manufacture of polyurethanes polyesters cumene industrial preparation of phenol and acetone polypropylene molded articles eg kitchenware fibres for indooroutdoor carpeting Catalytic Cracking to Form Ethylene Cracking is the name given to breaking up large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller and more useful bits This is achieved by using high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst The source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum These fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking The hydrocarbons are mixed with a very fine catalyst powder These days the catalysts are zeolites complex aluminosilicates these are more efficient than the older mixtures of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide The whole mixture is then blown rather like a liquid through a reaction chamber at a temperature of about C Because the mixture behaves like a liquid this is known as fluid catalytic cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking Although the mixture of gas and fine solid behaves as a liquid this is nevertheless an example of heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants The catalyst is recovered afterwards and the cracked mixture is separated by cooling and further fractional distillation There isnot any single unique reaction happening in the cracker The hydrocarbon molecules are broken up in a fairly random way to produce mixtures of smaller hydrocarbons some of which have carboncarbon double bonds One possible reaction involving the hydrocarbon CH might be Or showing more clearly what happens to the various atoms and bonds This is only one way in which this particular molecule might break up The ethene and propene are important materials for making plastics or producing other organic chemicals The octane is one of the molecules found in petrol gasoline Ethene Cracking is the name given to breaking up large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller and more useful bits This is achieved by using high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst The source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum These fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking There is not any single unique reaction happening in the cracker The hydrocarbon molecules are broken up in a fairly random way to produce mixtures of smaller hydrocarbons some of which have carboncarbon double bonds One possible reaction involving the hydrocarbon CH might be Or showing more clearly what happens to the various atoms and bonds This is only one way in which this particular molecule might break up The ethene and propene are important materials for making plastics or producing other organic chemicals You will remember that during the polymeriation of ethene thousands of ethene molecules join together to make polyethene commonly called polythene The reaction is done at high pressures in the presence of a trace of oxygen as an initiator Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Jim Clark Chemguidecouk
