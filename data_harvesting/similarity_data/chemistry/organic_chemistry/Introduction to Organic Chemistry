Contributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to Define organic chemistry as the study of carboncontaining compounds Explain why the results of the experiments carried out by Chevreul and Wöhler contributed to the demise of the vital force theory Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below organic chemistry All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds The prevalence of carbon compounds in living things has led to the epithet carbonbased life The truth is we know of no other kind of life Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms plants and animals as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially and these substances were thus known as organic compounds Figure All organic compounds contain carbon and most are formed by living things although they are also formed by geological and artificial processes credit left modification of work

Jacob Berzelius a physician by trade first coined the term organic chemistry in for the study of compounds derived from biological sources Up through the early th century naturalists and scientists observed critical differences between compounds that were derived from living things and those that were not In Friedrich Wöhler widely regarded as a pioneer in organic chemistry successfully completed an organic synthesis by heating ammonium cyanate and synthesizing of the biological compound urea a component of urine in many animals in what is now called the Wöhler synthesis Until this discovery it was widely believed by chemists that organic substances could only be formed under the influence of the vital force in the bodies of animals and plants Wöhlers synthesis dramatically proved that view to be false Urea synthesis was a critical discovery for biochemists because it showed that a compound known to be produced in nature only by biological organisms could be produced in a laboratory under controlled conditions from inanimate matter This in vitro synthesis of organic matter disproved the common theory vitalism about the vis vitalis a transcendent life force needed for producing organic compounds The ability to manipulate organic compounds includes fermentation to create wine and the making of soap both of which have been a part of society so long their discovery has been lost in antiquity Evidence has shown the Babylonians as early as BC were creating soap by mixing animal fat with wood ashes It wasnt until the th century that the chemical nature of the creation of soap was discovered by Eugène Chevreul In a reaction now call saponification fats are heated in the presence of a strong base KOH or NaOH to produce fatty acid salts and glycerol The fatty acid salts are the soap which improve waters ability to dissolve grease Although originally defined as the chemistry of biological molecules organic chemistry has since been redefined to refer specifically to carbon compounds even those with nonbiological origin Some carbon molecules are not considered organic with carbon dioxide being the most well known and most common inorganic carbon compound but such molecules are the exception and not the rule Organic chemistry focuses on carbon compounds and following movement of the electrons in carbon chains and rings and also how electrons are shared with other carbon atoms and heteroatoms Organic chemistry is primarily concerned with the properties of covalent bonds and nonmetallic elements though ions and metals do play critical roles in some reactions Why is carbon so special The answer to this question involves carbons special ability to bond with itself which will be discussed in this chapter Carbon is unique in its ability to form a wide variety of compounds from simple to complex There are literally millions of organic compounds known to science from methane which contains one carbon atom to DNA which contains millions of carbons More importantly organic chemistry gives us the ability to make and alter the structure of organic compounds which is the main topic in this book The applications of organic chemistry are myriad and include all sorts of plastics dyes flavorings scents detergents explosives fuels and many many other products Read the ingredient list for almost any kind of food that you eat or even your shampoo bottle and you will see the handiwork of organic chemists listed there The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry In this chapter we discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds how those compounds are classified and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial settings The field of organic chemistry is probably the most active and important field of chemistry at the moment due to its extreme applicability to both biochemistry especially in the pharmaceutical industry and petrochemistry especially in the energy industry Organic chemistry has a relatively recent history but it will have an enormously important future affecting the lives of everyone around the world for many many years to come Contributors and Attributions Paul Flowers University of North Carolina Pembroke Klaus Theopold University of
