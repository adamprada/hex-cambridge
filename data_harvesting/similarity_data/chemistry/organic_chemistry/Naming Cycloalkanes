IUPAC Rules for NomenclatureProblemsAnswers to Practice ProblemsOutside linksReferencesExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to name a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkane given its Kekulé structure shorthand structure or condensed structure draw the Kekulé shorthand or condensed structure for a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkane given its IUPAC name Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below cycloalkane Study Notes Provided that you have mastered the IUPAC system for naming alkanes you should find that the nomenclature of cycloalkanes does not present any particular difficulties Many organic compounds found in nature contain rings of carbon atoms These compounds are known as cycloalkanes Cycloalkanes only contain carbonhydrogen bonds and carboncarbon single bonds The simplest examples of this class consist of a single unsubstituted carbon ring and these form a homologous series similar to the unbranched alkanes Like alkanes cycloalkane molecules are often drawn as skeletal structures in which each intersection between two lines is assumed to have a carbon atom with its corresponding number of hydrogens Cyclohexane one of the most common cycloalkanes is shown below as an example same as same as Cyclic hydrocarbons have the prefix cyclo The IUPAC names molecular formulas and skeleton structures of the cycloalkanes with to carbons are given in Table Note that the general formula for a cycloalkane composed of n carbons is CnHn and not CnHn as for alkanes Although a cycloalkane has two fewer hydrogens than the equivalent alkane each carbon is bonded to four other atoms so are still considered to be saturated with hydrogen Table Examples of Simple Cycloalkanes Cycloalkane Molecular Formula Skeleton Structure Cyclopropane CH Cyclobutane CH Cyclopentane CH Cyclohexane CH Cycloheptane CH Cyclooctane CH Cyclononane CH Cyclodecane CH IUPAC Rules for Nomenclature The naming of substituted cycloalkanes follows the same basic steps used in naming alkanes Determine the parent chain Number the substituents of the ring so that the sum of the numbers is the lowest possible Name the substituents and place them in alphabetical order More specific rules for naming substituted cycloalkanes with examples are given below Determine the cycloalkane to use as the parent If there is an alkyl straight chain that has a greater number of carbons than the cycloalkane then the alkyl chain must be used as the primary parent chain Cycloalkanes substituents have an ending yl If there are two cycloalkanes in the molecule use the cycloalkane with the higher number of carbons as the parent Example The longest straight chain contains carbons compared with cyclopropane which only contains carbons The parent chain in this molecule is decane and cyclopropane is a substituent The name of this molecule is cyclopropylmethyldecane Example Name the cycloalkane structure Solution There are two different cycloalkanes in this molecule Because it contains more carbons the cyclopentane ring will be named as the parent chain The smaller ring cyclobutane is named as a substituent on the parent chain The name of this molecule is cyclobutylcyclopentane When there is only one substituent on the ring the ring carbon attached to the substituent is automatically carbon Indicating the number of the carbon with the substituent in the name is optional Example chlorocyclobutane or cholorocyclobutane propylcyclohexane or propylcyclohexane If there are multiple substituents on the ring number the carbons of the cycloalkane so that the carbons with substituents have the lowest possible number A carbon with multiple substituents should have a lower number than a carbon with only one substituent or functional group One way to make sure that the lowest number possible is assigned is to number the carbons so that when the numbers corresponding to the substituents are added their sum is the lowest possible When naming the cycloalkane the substituents must be placed in alphabetical order Remember the prefixes di tri etc are not used for alphabetization Example NOT In this example the ethyl or the methyl subsistent could be attached to carbon one The ethyl group attachment is assigned carbon because ethyl comes before methyl alphabetically After assigning carbon the cyclohexane ring can be numbered going clockwise or counterclockwise When looking at the numbers produced going clockwise produces lower substituents numbers than when numbered counterclockwise Example Name the following structure using IUPAC rules Solution Remember when dealing with cycloalkanes with more than two substituents finding the lowest possible substituent numbering takes prescient Consider a numbering system with each substituent attachment point as being carbon one Compare them and whichever produces the lowest numbering will be correct Because there are three substituents there are three possible numbering systems The one shown to the left allows for a distinctly lower numbering system Note that alphabetical prioritizing was not used to make this assement The correct name for the molecule is Bromodimethylcyclohesane Example bromochloromethylcyclopentane Notice that b of bromo alphabetically precedes the m of methyl Also notice that the chlorine attachment point is assigned carbon because it comes first alphabetically and the overall sum of numbers would be the same if the methyl attachment carbon was assigned as and the chlorine attachment as Example bromodimethylcyclohexane Although di alphabetically precedes f di is not used in determining the alphabetical order Example fluorodimethylcyclohexane NOT dimethylfluorocyclohexane also fluorodimethylcyclohexane NOT fluorodimethylcyclohexane Although di alphabetically precedes f di is not used in determining the alphabetical order of the substitutents Notice that the attachment point of the two methyl groups is assigned carbon despite the fact that fluorine comes first alphabetically This is because this assignment allows for a lower overall numbering of substituents so assigning alphabetical priority is not necessary Hydrocarbons having more than one ring are common and are referred to as bicyclic two rings tricyclic three rings and in general polycyclic compounds The molecular formulas of such compounds have HC ratios that decrease with the number of rings In general for a hydrocarbon composed of n carbon atoms associated with m rings the formula is CnHn m The structural relationship of rings in a polycyclic compound can vary They may be separate and independent or they may share one or two common atoms Some examples of these possible arrangements are shown in the following table Table Examples of Isomeric CH Bicycloalkanes Isolated Rings Spiro Rings Fused Rings Bridged Rings No common atoms One common atom One common bond Two common atoms Polycyclic compounds like cholesterol shown below are biologically important and typically have common names accepted by IUPAC However the common names do not generally follow the basic IUPAC nomenclature rules and will not be covered here Cholesterol polycyclic Problems Name the following structures Note The structures are complex for practice
