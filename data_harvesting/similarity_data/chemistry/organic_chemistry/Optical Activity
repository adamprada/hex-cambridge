PolarimetryEnantiomeric ExcessSeparation of Chiral CompoundsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe the nature of planepolarized light describe the features and operation of a simple polarimeter calculate the specific rotation of a compound given the relevant experimental data Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below analyzer dextrorotatory levorotatory optically active planepolarized light polarimeter polarizer specific rotation cesfalpha_D Study Notes A polarizer is a device through which only light waves oscillating in a single plane may pass A polarimeter is an instrument used to determine the angle through which planepolarized light has been rotated by a given sample You will have the opportunity to use a polarimeter in the laboratory component of the course An analyzer is the component of a polarimeter that allows the angle of rotation of planepolarized light to be determined Specific rotations are normally measured at C and this property may be indicated by the symbol cesfalpha_D Sometimes the solvent is specified in parentheses behind the specific rotation value for example cesfalpha_D chloroform For liquids the specific rotation may be obtained using the neat liquid rather than a solution in such cases the formula is α D temp neat α ld where α is the observed rotation l is the path length of the cell measured in decimetres dm and d is the density of the liquid Identifying and distinguishing enantiomers is inherently difficult since their physical and chemical properties are largely identical Fortunately a nearly two hundred year old discovery by the French physicist JeanBaptiste Biot has made this task much easier This discovery disclosed that the right and lefthanded enantiomers of a chiral compound perturb planepolarized light in opposite ways This perturbation is unique to chiral molecules and has been termed optical activity Polarimetry Planepolarized light is created by passing ordinary light through a polarizing device which may be as simple as a lens taken from polarizing sunglasses Such devices transmit selectively only that component of a light beam having electrical and magnetic field vectors oscillating in a single plane The plane of polarization can be determined by an instrument called a polarimeter shown in the diagram below Monochromatic single wavelength light is polarized by a fixed polarizer next to the light source A sample cell holder is located in line with the light beam followed by a movable polarizer the analyzer and an eyepiece through which the light intensity can be observed In modern instruments an electronic light detector takes the place of the human eye In the absence of a sample the light intensity at the detector is at a maximum when the second movable polarizer is set parallel to the first polarizer α º If the analyzer is turned º to the plane of initial polarization all the light will be blocked from reaching the detector Chemists use polarimeters to investigate the influence of compounds in the sample cell on plane polarized light Samples composed only of achiral molecules eg water or hexane have no effect on the polarized light beam However if a single enantiomer is examined all sample molecules being righthanded or all being lefthanded the plane of polarization is rotated in either a clockwise positive or counterclockwise negative direction and the analyzer must be turned an appropriate matching angle α if full light intensity is to reach the detector In the above illustration the sample has rotated the polarization plane clockwise by º and the analyzer has been turned this amount to permit maximum light transmission The observed rotations of enantiomers are opposite in direction One enantiomer will rotate polarized light in a clockwise direction termed dextrorotatory or and its mirrorimage partner in a counterclockwise manner termed levorotatory or The prefixes dextro and levo come from the Latin dexter meaning right and laevus for left and are abbreviated d and l respectively If equal quantities of each enantiomer are examined using the same sample cell then the magnitude of the rotations will be the same with one being positive and the other negative To be absolutely certain whether an observed rotation is positive or negative it is often necessary to make a second measurement using a different amount or concentration of the sample In the above illustration for example α might be º or º rather than º If the sample concentration is reduced by then the positive rotation would change to º or º while the negative rotation would change to º and the correct α would be identified unambiguously Since it is not always possible to obtain or use samples of exactly the same size the observed rotation is usually corrected to compensate for variations in sample quantity and cell length Thus it is common practice to convert the observed rotation α to a specific rotation by the following formula where is the specific rotation is the cell length in dm is the concentration in gml designates that the light used is the line from a sodium lamp Compounds that rotate the plane of polarized light are termed optically active Each enantiomer of a stereoisomeric pair is optically active and has an equal but oppositeinsign specific rotation Specific rotations are useful in that they are experimentally determined constants that characterize and identify pure enantiomers For example the lactic acid and carvone enantiomers discussed earlier have the following specific rotations Carvone from caraway αD º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or dcarvone Carvone from spearmint αD º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or lcarvone Lactic acid from muscle tissue αD º this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or dlactic acid Lactic acid from sour milk αD º this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or llactic acid A mixture of enantiomers has no observable optical activity Such mixtures are called racemates or racemic modifications and are designated When chiral compounds are created from achiral compounds the products are racemic unless a single enantiomer of a chiral coreactant or catalyst is involved in the reaction The addition of HBr to either cis or transbutene is an example of racemic product formation the chiral center is colored red in the following equation CHCHCHCH HBr CHCHCHBrCH Chiral organic compounds isolated from living organisms are usually optically active indicating that one of the enantiomers predominates often it is the only isomer present This is a result of the action of chiral catalysts we call enzymes and reflects the inherently chiral nature of life itself Chiral synthetic compounds on the other hand are commonly racemates unless they have been prepared from enantiomerically pure starting materials There are two ways in which the condition of a chiral substance may be changed A racemate may be separated into its component enantiomers This process is called resolution A pure enantiomer may be transformed into its racemate This process is called racemization Enantiomeric Excess The optical purity is a comparison of the optical rotation of a pure sample of unknown stereochemistry versus the optical rotation of a sample of pure enantiomer It is expressed as a percentage If the sample only rotates planepolarized light half as much as expected the optical purity is Because R and S enantiomers have equal but opposite optical activity it naturally follows that a racemic mixture of two enantiomers will have no observable optical activity If we know the specific rotation for a chiral molecule however we can easily calculate the ratio of enantiomers present in a mixture of two enantiomers based on its measured optical activity When a mixture contains more of one enantiomer than the other chemists often use the concept of enantiomeric excess ee to quantify the difference Enantiomeric excess can be expressed as For example a mixture containing R enantiomer and S enantiomer has a enantiomeric excess of R x Example Carvone The specific rotation of Scarvone is measured neat pure liquid sample no solvent The optical rotation of a neat sample of a mixture of R and S carvone is measured at Which enantiomer is in excess and what is its ee What are the percentages of R and Scarvone in the sample Answer The observed rotation of the mixture is levorotary negative counterclockwise and the specific rotation of the pure S enantiomer is given as dextrorotary positive clockwise meaning that the pure R enantiomer must be levorotary and the mixture must contain more of the R enantiomer than of the S enantiomer Rotation RS Mix FractionS Rotation S FractionR Rotation R Let Fraction S x therefore Fraction R x Rotation RS Mix xRotation S xRotation R x x Solve for x x and x Therefore the percentages of R and Scarvone in the sample are and respectively ee more abundant enantiomer Chiral molecules are often labeled according to the sign of their specific rotation as in Scarvone and Rcarvone or carvone for the racemic mixture However there is no relationship whatsoever between a molecules RS designation and the sign of its specific rotation Without performing a polarimetry experiment or looking in the literature we would have no idea that carvone has the R configuration and carvone has the S configuration Separation of Chiral Compounds As noted earlier chiral compounds synthesized from achiral starting materials and reagents are generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers Separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called resolution Since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution is extremely difficult Diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates Reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated For example if a racemic mixture of a chiral alcohol is reacted with a enantiomerically pure carboxylic acid the result is a mixture of diastereomers in this case because the pure R entantiomer of the acid was used the product is a mixture of RR and RS diastereomeric esters which can in theory be separated by their different physical properties Subsequent hydrolysis of each separated ester will yield the resolved enantiomerically pure alcohols The used in this technique are known as Exercises For each of the structures indicated below mark the chiral centres with an asterisk Answer Questions
