Molecular Dipole MomentsDipoles with Differing AtomsAdditional ExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to explain how dipole moments depend on both molecular shape and bond polarity predict whether a molecule will possess a dipole moment from the molecular formula or structure use the presence or absence of a dipole moment as an aid to deducing the structure of a given compound Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below dipole moment Study Notes You must be able to combine your knowledge of molecular shapes and bond polarities to determine whether or not a given compound will have a dipole moment Conversely the presence or absence of a dipole moment may also give an important clue to a compounds structure BCl for example has no dipole moment while NH does This suggests that in BCl the chlorines around boron are in a trigonal planar arrangement while the hydrogens around nitrogen in NH have a less symmetrical arrangement trigonal pyramidal Remember that the CH bond is assumed to be nonpolar Molecular Dipole Moments In molecules containing more than one polar bond the molecular dipole moment is just the vector combination of what can be regarded as individual bond dipole moments Mathematically dipole moments are vectors they possess both a magnitude and a direction The dipole moment of a molecule is therefore the vector sum of the dipole moments of the individual bonds in the molecule If the individual bond dipole moments cancel one another there is no net dipole moment Such is the case for CO a linear molecule Figure Each CO bond in CO is polar yet experiments show that the CO molecule has no dipole moment Because the two CO bond dipoles in CO are equal in magnitude and oriented at to each other they cancel As a result the CO molecule has no net dipole moment even though it has a substantial separation of charge In contrast the HO molecule is not linear Figure it is bent in threedimensional space so the dipole moments do not cancel each other Thus a molecule such as HO has a net dipole moment We expect the concentration of negative charge to be on the oxygen the more electronegative atom and positive charge on the two hydrogens This charge polarization allows HO to hydrogenbond to other polarized or charged species including other water molecules Figure How Individual Bond Dipole Moments Are Added Together to Give an Overall Molecular Dipole Moment for Two Triatomic Molecules with Different Structures a In CO the CO bond dipoles are equal in magnitude but oriented in opposite directions at Their vector sum is zero so CO therefore has no net dipole b In HO the OH bond dipoles are also equal in magnitude but they are oriented at to each other Hence the vector sum is not zero and HO has a net dipole moment The following is a simplified equation for a simple separated twocharge system that is present in diatomic molecules or when considering a bond dipole within a molecule This bond dipole Âµ Greek mu is interpreted as the dipole from a charge separation over a distance between the partial charges and or the more commonly used terms the orientation of the dipole is along the axis of the bond The units on dipole moments are typically debyes D where one debye is equal to x coulomb meters C m in SI units Consider a simple system of a single electron and proton separated by a fix distance The unit charge on an electron is X C and the proton electron are pm apart about the length of a typical covalent bond the dipole moment is calculated as is a key reference value and represents a pure charge of and separated by pm However if the charge separation were increased then the dipole moment increases linearly If the proton and electron were separated by pm If the proton and electron were separated by pm If the proton and electron were separated by pm Example Water The water molecule in Figure can be used to determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment From the electronegativities of oxygen and hydrogen the difference is e for each of the hydrogenoxygen bonds Next because the oxygen is the more electronegative atom it exerts a greater pull on the shared electrons it also has two lone pairs of electrons From this it can be concluded that the dipole moment points from between the two hydrogen atoms toward the oxygen atom Using the equation above the dipole moment is calculated to be D by multiplying the distance between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms by the charge difference between them and then finding the components of each that point in the direction of the net dipole moment the angle of the molecule is The bond moment of OH bond D so the net dipole moment is Dipoles with Differing Atoms In more complex molecules with more than one polar covalent bonds the threedimensional geometry and the compounds symmetry determine whether the molecule has a net dipole moment The manner in which the individual bonds contribute to the dipole moment of the molecule is nicely illustrated by the series of chloromethanes shown below The electronegative chlorine draws electrons towards itself Consider left panel in figure below which as a molecule is not polar in the sense that it doesnt have an end or a side which is slightly negative and one which is slightly positive The whole of the outside of the molecule is somewhat negative but there is no overall separation of charge from top to bottom or from left to right In contrast is a polar molecule right panel in figure above However although a molecule like CHCl has a tetrahedral geometry the atoms bonded to carbon are not identical Consequently the bond dipole moments do not cancel one another and the result is a molecule which has a dipole moment The hydrogen at the top of the molecule is less electronegative than carbon and so is slightly positive This means that the molecule now has a slightly positive top and a slightly negative bottom and so is overall a polar molecule Figure Bond polarities for CCl left and CHClright Electron densities in a molecule and the dipole moments that unbalanced electron distributions can produce are easily visualized with electrostatic potential maps In this example the blue area centered on carbon represents a electrondeficient positive area of the molecule the red area centered on the chlorine represents a electronabundant negative area This charge separation creates a net dipole moment of D which points in the direction of the chlorine In the evenly spaced red areas represent that there is no separation of charge in the molecule has a net dipole moment of zero which makes it a nonpolar molecule Figure Electrostatic potential maps and dipole moments for chloromethane and tetrachloromethane carbon tetrachloride Molecules with asymmetrical charge distributions have a net dipole moment Other examples of molecules with polar bonds are shown in Figure In molecules like BCl and CCl that have only one type of bond and a molecular geometries that are highly symmetrical trigonal planar and tetrahedral the individual bond dipole moments completely cancel and there is no net dipole moment However although a molecule like CHCl has a tetrahedral geometry the atoms bonded to carbon are not identical Consequently the bond dipole moments do not cancel one another and the result is a molecule which has a dipole moment Figure Molecules with Polar Bonds Individual bond dipole moments are indicated in red Due to their different threedimensional structures some molecules with polar bonds have a net dipole moment HCl CHO NH and CHCl indicated in purple whereas others do not because the bond dipole moments cancel BCl CCl PF and SF Table Dipole Moments of Some Compounds Compound Dipole Moment Debyes NaCl measured in the gas phase CHO CHCl HO CHOH NH CHNH CO CCl CH CHCH The table above give the dipole moment of some common substances Sodium chloride has the largest dipole listed D because it is an ionic compounds Even small organic compounds such as formaldehyde CHO D and methanol CHOH D have significant dipole moments Both of these molecules contain the strongly electronegative oxygen atom lone pair electrons which gives rise to considerable dipole moments In contrast many organic molecule have a zero dipole moment despite the fact that they are made up of polar covalent bonds In structures with highly symmetrical molecular geometries the polar bonds and the lone pair electrons can can exactly cancel leaving no overall charge separation Exercise Which of the molecules below have molecular dipole moments Answer Only molecule b does not have a molecular dipole due to its symmetry bond dipoles are equal and in opposite directions Add texts here Exercise Draw out the line structure of the molecule with a molecular formula of CCl Indicate all of the individual bond polarities and predict if the molecule is polar or nonpolar Answer Although the CCl bonds are rather polar the individual bond dipoles cancel one another in this symmetrical structure and does not have a net dipole momentClCCCl Exercise The following molecule has no net dipole moment explain Answer The hydroxyl groups are oriented opposite of one another and therefore the dipole moments would cancel one another out Therefore having a zero netdipole Exercise Within reactions with carbonyls such as a hydride reduction reaction the carbonyl is attacked from the carbon side and not the oxygen side Using knowledge of electronegativity explain why this happens Answer The oxygen is more electronegative than the carbon and therefore creates a dipole along the bond This leads to having a partial positive charge on the carbon and the reduction can take place Exercise Which molecules has a net dipole moment HS NHF BF Answer Strategy For each threedimensional molecular geometry predict whether the bond dipoles cancel If they do not then the molecule has a net dipole moment Solution The total number of electrons around the central atom S is eight which gives four electron pairs Two of these electron pairs are bonding pairs and two are lone pairs so the molecular geometry of HS is bent The bond dipoles cannot cancel one another so the molecule has a net dipole moment Difluoroamine has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry Because there is one hydrogen and two fluorines and because of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen the molecule is not symmetrical and the bond dipoles of NHF cannot cancel one another This means that NHF has a net dipole moment We expect polarization from the two fluorine atoms the most electronegative atoms in the periodic table to have a greater affect on the net dipole moment than polarization from the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen The molecular geometry of BF is trigonal planar Because all the BF bonds are equal and the molecule is highly symmetrical the dipoles cancel one another in threedimensional space Thus BF has a net dipole moment of zero Additional Exercises Determine whether each of the compounds listed below possesses a dipole moment For the polar compounds indicate the direction of the dipole moment Answers Questions Q The following molecule has no dipole moment in the molecule itself explain Q Which of the following molecules has a net dipole
