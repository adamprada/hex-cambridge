Electrophilic AdditionElimination reactionsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to explain the relationship between an addition reaction and an elimination reaction write an equation to describe the dehydrohalogenation of an alkyl halide identify the reagents required to bring about dehydrohalogenation of an alkyl halide write an equation to represent the dehydration of an alcohol identify the reagents required to dehydrate a given alcohol Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below dehydration dehydrohalogenation elimination reaction Study Notes An elimination reaction is a reaction in which two or more atoms one of which is usually hydrogen are removed from adjacent atoms in the reactant resulting in the formation of a multiple bond The relationship between addition reactions and elimination reactions is shown in Figure below Figure Relationship of addition and elimination reactions Electrophilic Addition Alkenes are found throughout nature They form the basis of many natural products such as terpenes which play a variety of roles in the lives of plants and insects The CC bonds of alkenes are very different from the CO bonds that are also common in nature The CC bonds of alkenes are electronrich and nucleophilic in contrast to the electronpoor CO bonds of carbohydrates fatty acids and proteins That difference plays a role in how terpenes form in nature Alkenes or olefins are also a major product of the petroleum industry Reactions of alkenes form the basis for a significant porion of our manufacturing economy Commonly used plastics such as polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene are all formed through the reactions of alkenes These materials continue to find use in our society because of their valuable properties such as high strength flexibility and low weight Alkenes undergo addition reactions like carbonyls do Often they add a proton to one end of the double bond and another group to the other end These reactions happen in slightly different ways however Alkenes are reactive because they have a highlying pair of πbonding electrons These electrons are loosely held being high in energy compared to σbonds The fact that they are not located between the carbon nuclei but are found above and below the plane of the double bond also makes these electrons more accessible Alkenes can donate their electrons to strong electrophiles other than protons too Sometimes their reactivity pattern is a little different than the simple addition across the double bond but that straightforward pattern is what we will focus on in this chapter Elimination reactions Elimination reactions are possible by abstraction of a proton at positions that are next to a potential leaving group This type of elimination can be described by two model mechanisms it can occur in a single concerted step proton abstraction at Cα occurring at the same time as CβX bond cleavage or in two steps CβX bond cleavage occurring first to form a carbocation intermediate which is then quenched by proton abstraction at the alphacarbon These mechanisms termed E and E respectively are important in laboratory organic chemistry but are less common in biological chemistry As explained below which mechanism actually occurs in a laboratory reaction will depend on the identity of the R groups ie whether the alkyl halide is primary secondary tertiary etc as well as on the characteristics of the base Exercises Questions Q In elimination reactions there tends to have a mixture of products What are the two possible alkene products for the reaction of bromomethylpentane with NaOH Q Predict the EZ isomers for the following molecule when reacted with HSO Solutions S S Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
