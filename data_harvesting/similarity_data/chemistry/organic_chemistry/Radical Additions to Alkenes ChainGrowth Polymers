polymerization of an alkene give examples of some common alkene monomers used in the manufacture of chaingrowth polymers identify the alkene monomer used to prepare a specific chaingrowth polymer given the structure of the polymer Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below monomer polymer vinyl monomer Study Notes Vinyl monomers are monomers of the type cesfCHCHX Recall that the vinyl group is cesfCHCH Although benzoyl peroxide is commonly used as an initiator in freeradical polymerization reactions an alternative reagent is azobisisobutyronitrile shown below All the monomers from which addition polymers are made are alkenes or functionally substituted alkenes The most common and thermodynamically favored chemical transformations of alkenes are addition reactions Many of these addition reactions are known to proceed in a stepwise fashion by way of reactive intermediates and this is the mechanism followed by most polymerizations A general diagram illustrating this assembly of linear macromolecules which supports the name chain growth polymers is presented here Since a pibond in the monomer is converted to a sigmabond in the polymer the polymerization reaction is usually exothermic by to kcalmol Indeed cases of explosively uncontrolled polymerizations have been reported It is useful to distinguish four polymerization procedures fitting this general description Radical Polymerization The initiator is a radical and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbon radical Cationic Polymerization The initiator is an acid and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbocation Anionic Polymerization The initiator is a nucleophile and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbanion Coordination Catalytic Polymerization The initiator is a transition metal complex and the propagating site of reactivity is a terminal catalytic complex Radical ChainGrowth Polymerization Virtually all of the monomers described above are subject to radical polymerization Since this can be initiated by traces of oxygen or other minor impurities pure samples of these compounds are often stabilized by small amounts of radical inhibitors to avoid unwanted reaction When radical polymerization is desired it must be started by using a radical initiator such as a peroxide or certain azo compounds The formulas of some common initiators and equations showing the formation of radical species from these initiators are presented below By using small amounts of initiators a wide variety of monomers can be polymerized One example of this radical polymerization is the conversion of styrene to polystyrene shown in the following diagram The first two equations illustrate the initiation process and the last two equations are examples of chain propagation Each monomer unit adds to the growing chain in a manner that generates the most stable radical Since carbon radicals are stabilized by substituents of many kinds the preference for headtotail regioselectivity in most addition polymerizations is understandable Because radicals are tolerant of many functional groups and solvents including water radical polymerizations are widely used in the chemical industry In principle once started a radical polymerization might be expected to continue unchecked producing a few extremely long chain polymers In practice larger numbers of moderately sized chains are formed indicating that chainterminating reactions must be taking place The most common termination processes are Radical Combination and Disproportionation These reactions are illustrated by the following equations The growing polymer chains are colored blue and red and the hydrogen atom transferred in disproportionation is colored green Note that in both types of termination two reactive radical sites are removed by simultaneous conversion to stable products Since the concentration of radical species in a polymerization reaction is small relative to other reactants eg monomers solvents and terminated chains the rate at which these radicalradical termination reactions occurs is very small and most growing chains achieve moderate length before termination The relative importance of these terminations varies with the nature of the monomer undergoing polymerization For acrylonitrile and styrene combination is the major process However methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate are terminated chiefly by disproportionation Another reaction that diverts radical chaingrowth polymerizations from producing linear macromolecules is called chain transfer As the name implies this reaction moves a carbon radical from one location to another by an intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer colored green These possibilities are demonstrated by the following equations Chain transfer reactions are especially prevalent in the high pressure radical polymerization of ethylene which is the method used to make LDPE low density polyethylene The ºradical at the end of a growing chain is converted to a more stable ºradical by hydrogen atom transfer Further polymerization at the new radical site generates a side chain radical and this may in turn lead to creation of other side chains by chain transfer reactions As a result the morphology of LDPE is an amorphous network of highly branched macromolecules Exercises Questions
