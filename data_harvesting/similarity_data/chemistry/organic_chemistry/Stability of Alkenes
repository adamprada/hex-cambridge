IntroductionThe CatalystHeats of HydrogenationReferencesProblems and Review QuestionsAnswersExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to explain why cis alkenes are generally less stable than their trans isomers explain that catalytic reduction of a cis alkene produces the same alkane as the catalytic reduction of the trans isomer explain how heats of hydrogenation ΔHhydrog can be used to show that cis alkenes are less stable than their trans isomers and discuss briefly the limitations of this approach arrange a series of alkenes in order of increasing or decreasing stability describe briefly two of the hypotheses proposed to explain why alkene stability increases with increased substitution Note This problem is a typical example of those instances in science where there is probably no single correct explanation for an observed phenomenon Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below catalytic hydrogenation heat of hydrogenation ΔHhydrog hyperconjugation Study Notes The two alkenes cis cesfCHCHCHCH and cesfCHCCH have similar heats of hydrogenation kJmol and kJmol respectively and are therefore of similar stability However they are both less stable than trans cesfCHCHCHCH kJmol You may wonder why an sp sp bond is stronger than an spsp bond Bond strength depends on the efficiency with which orbitals can overlap In general s orbitals overlap more efficiently than do p orbitals therefore the ss bond in the hydrogen molecule is stronger than the pp bond in fluorine In hybrid orbitals the greater the s character of the orbital the more efficiently it can overlap an sp orbital which has a s character can overlap more effectively than an sp orbital with only s character Alkene hydrogenation is the synaddition of hydrogen to an alkene saturating the bond The alkene reacts with hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst which allows the reaction to occur quickly The energy released in this process called the heat of hydrogenation indicates the relative stability of the double bond in the molecule Introduction The reaction begins with H gas and an alkene a carboncarbon double bond The pi bond in the alkene acts as a nucleophile the two electrons in it form a sigma bond with one of the hydrogen atoms in H With the pi bond broken the other carbon the one that did not newly receive a hydrogen is left with a positive formal charge This is the carbocation intermediate The remaining unreacted hydrogen is now a hydride anion as it was left with two electrons previously in the HH sigma bond Next the electrons of the negatively charged hydride ion form a bond with the positively charged carbon This reaction is exothermic It will occur but it is very slow without a catalyst The Catalyst A catalyst increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy of the reaction Although the catalyst is not consumed in the reaction it is required to accelerate the reaction sufficiently to be observed in a reasonable amount of time Catalysts commonly used in alkene hydrogenation are platinum palladium and nickel The metal catalyst acts as a surface on which the reaction takes place This increases the rate by putting the reactants in close proximity to each other facilitating interactions between them With this catalyst present the sigma bond of H breaks and the two hydrogen atoms instead bind to the metal see in the figure below The bond of the alkene weakens as it also interacts with the metal see below Since both the reactants are bound to the metal catalyst the hydrogen atoms can easily add one at a time to the previously doublebonded carbons see and below The position of both of the reactants bound to the catalyst makes it so the hydrogen atoms are only exposed to one side of the alkene This explains why the hydrogen atoms add to same side of the molecule called synaddition Figure Hydrogenation takes place in the presence of a metal catalyst Note The catalyst remains intact and unchanged throughout the reaction Heats of Hydrogenation The stability of alkene can be determined by measuring the amount of energy associated with the hydrogenation of the molecule Since the double bond is breaking in this reaction the energy released in hydrogenation is proportional to the energy in the double bond of the molecule This is a useful tool because heats of hydrogenation can be measured very accurately The is usually around kcalmol for alkenes Stability is simply a measure of energy Lower energy molecules are more stable than higher energy molecules More substituted alkenes are more stable than less substituted ones due to hyperconjugation They have a lower heat of hydrogenation The following illustrates stability of alkenes with various substituents In disubstituted alkenes trans isomers are more stable than cis isomers due to steric hindrance Also internal alkenes are more stable than terminal ones See the following isomers of butene Figure Transbutene is the most stable because it has the lowest heat of hydrogenation Note In cycloalkenes smaller than cyclooctene the cis isomers are more stable than the trans as a result of ring strain References Fox Marye Anne and James K Whitesell Organic Chemistry rd ed Sudbury MA Janes and Bartlett Publishers Hanson James R Functional
