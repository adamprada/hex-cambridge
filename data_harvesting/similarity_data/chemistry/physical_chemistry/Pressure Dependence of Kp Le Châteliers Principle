is defined for a specific composition all reactants in their standard states and at unit pressure or fugacity changes in pressure have no effect on equilibrium constants for a fixed temperature However changes in pressure can have profound effects on the compositions of equilibrium mixtures To demonstrate the relationship one must recall Daltons law of partial pressures According to this relationship the partial pressure of a component of a gasphase mixture can be expressed It is the combination of mole fractions that describes the composition of the equilibrium mixture Substituting the above expression into the expression for yields This expression can be factored into two pieces one containing the mole fractions and thus describing the composition and one containing the total pressure The second factor is a constant for a given total pressure If the first term is given the symbol the expression becomes In this expression has the same form as an equilibrium constant but is not itself a constant The value of will vary with varying composition and will need to vary with varying total pressure in most cases in order to maintain a constant value of Example Consider the following reaction at equilibrium In which direction will the equilibrium shift if the volume of the reaction vessel is decreased Solution A decrease in the volume will lead to an increase in total pressure Since the equilibrium constant can be expressed as An increase in pressure will lead to an increase in to maintain a constant value of So the reaction will shift to form more of the products and Note This should make some sense since a shift to the side of the reaction with fewer moles of gas will lower the total pressure of the reaction mixture and thus relieving the stress introduced by increasing the pressure This is exactly what is expected according to Le Chateliers principle It should be noted that there are several ways one can affect the total pressure of a gasphase equilibrium These include the introduction or removal of reactants or products perhaps through condensation or some other physical process a change in volume of the reaction vessel or the introduction of an inert gas that does not participate in the reaction itself Changes in the temperature will be discussed in a later section The principle of Le Chateliers can be used as a guide to predict how the equilibrium composition will respond to a change in pressure Le Chateliers principle When a stress is introduced to a system at equilibrium the system will adjust so as to reduce the stress Le Chatliers principle is fairly clear on how to think about the addition or removal of reactants or products For example the addition of a reactant will cause the system to shift to reduce the partial pressure of the reactant It can do this by forming more products An important exception to the rule that increasing the total pressure will cause a shift in the reaction favoring the side with fewer moles of gas occurs when the total pressure is increased by introducing an inert gas to the mixture The reason is that the introduction of an inert gas will affect the total pressures and the partial pressures of each individual species Example A L vessel is charged with atm of A and the following reaction is allowed to come to equilibrium at K with What are the equilibrium partial pressures and mole fractions of A and B If the volume of the container is doubled what are the equilibrium partial pressures and mole fractions of A and B If atm of Ar an inert gas is introduced into the system described in b what are the equilibrium partial pressures and mole fractions of A and B once equilibrium is reestablished Solution Part a First we can use an ICE table to solve part a A B Initial atm Change x x Equilibrium atm x x So for convenience consider to have units of atm Solving for yields values of Clearly while a solution to the mathematical problem is not physically meaningful since the equilibrium pressure of B cannot be negative So the equilibrium partial pressures are given by So the mole fractions are given by Part b The volume is doubled Again an ICE table is useful The initial pressures will be half of the equilibrium pressures found in part a A B Initial atm atm Change x x Equilibrium atm x atm x So the new equilibrium pressures can be found from And the values of that solve the problem are We reject the negative root since it would cause both of the partial pressures to become negative So the new equilibrium partial pressures are And the mole fractions are We can see that the mole fraction of decreased and the mole fraction increased This is the result expected by Le Chatliers principle since the lower total pressure favors the side of the reaction with more moles of gas Part c We introduce atm of an inert gas The new partial pressures are And because the partial pressures of A and B are unaffected the equilibrium does not shift What is affected is the composition and so the mole fractions will change And since Within roundoff error the value obtained is the equilibrium constant So the conclusion is that the introduction of an inert gas even though it increases the total pressure does not induce a change in the partial pressures of the reactants and products so it does not cause the equilibrium to shift Contributors and Attributions Patrick E
