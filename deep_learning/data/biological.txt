logicReferencesContributors and Attributions Belarusian translation German translation by Aleksandr Kastromin Czech translation by Alex Novak What is the rationale for yet another biochemistry book What do I mean by chemical logic Many who have taught chemistry general organic biochemistry from a traditional book invariably believe that the book would be better if it had a different organization or different conceptual framework Few can truly cover the extent of information found in these encyclopedic tomes All textbooks within a specialty area of chemistry have the same topic orders as well Biochemistry Online An Approach Based on Chemical Logic was written in part to deal with issues of topic order and conceptual framework It presents biochemistry in the framework of a higher order organizing principle based in chemical logic and understanding from which topics and order of presentation derive New topics can then be introduced in a fashion which the students perceive not as random but as a logical extension based on a developing understanding Jakubowski H and Owen W The Teaching of Biochemistry An Innovative Course Sequence Based on the Logic of Chemistry J Chemical Education A PowerPoint Slide presentation and a summary of the paper follow Powerpoint Slide Show Biochemistry Based on Chemical Logic Summary The chosen topic order should create a coherent and sequential understanding of biochemistry not a fragmented one without logical connections among topics Textbook authors offer assistance in addressing these concerns in two ways They implicitly suggest an order of presentation by how chapters are arranged and they offer philosophical interpretations to describe biochemistry Scrutiny of the philosophy statements Chemistry is the logic of biological phenomena common molecular patterns and principles underlie the diverse expression of life and molecular logic of life and chapter organization of textbooks reveals commonalties among textbooks This consensus however does not lead to a linkage between philosophy and content The present organization of texts is not derived from the central dogma of biology since in most books protein structure precedes significant discussions of nucleic acid structurefunction Rather it seems to reflect evolving tradition based on historical trends in biochemistry research as evidenced by chapter organization of major biochemistry texts starting from the edition of Harrows Textbook of Biochemistry Early texts commenced with discussions of carbohydrate chemistry followed by lipids and then proteins Texts from the late sixties onward invariably led with protein chemistry and deferred carbohydrate and chemistry until much later Although modern authors speak of a chemical logic it is not evident in textbook organization Biochemistry Online was written to present biochemistry in the framework of a higher order organizing principle based in chemical logic and understanding from which topics and order of presentation derive New topics can then be introduced in a fashion which the students perceive not as random but as a logical extension based on a developing understanding Chemical Logic Throughout the course three major recurring chemical principles become evident structure determines functionactivity binding reactions initiate all biological events and chemical principles such as dynamic equilibria mass action and reaction kinetics and mechanisms derived from the study of small molecules can be applied to the behavior of macromolecules The order of the topics is based on evolving chemical logic Topic Lipid Structure The first topic is lipid and lipid aggregate structurefunction instead of amino acids and proteins as is typically presented Prior to taking a biochemistry course students have had little significant exposure to the chemical properties of macromolecules so beginning with the study of small molecules makes sense Since most lipids are amphiphiles their structural diversity can be simplified by considering them as simple structures with spatially distinct polar and nonpolar ends Single chain and double chain amphiphiles aggregate in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner to form micelle and bilayer structures respectively with the nonpolar parts sequestered from water and associated with themselves and the polar parts solventaccessible This simple model introduces students to the notion that structure mediates properties to the important concept of intermolecular forces and to the thermodynamics of the hydrophobic effect all critical elements ultimately required to understand the much more complicated topic of protein folding and stability The concepts of mass conservation dynamic equilibria and kinetics and chemical potential are used to understand how aggregation at equilibrium depends on amphiphile concentration Lipids serve as useful models to introduce stereochemistry and prochirality as well Likewise it is easier to understand how torsion angle changes in the aliphatic side chains of phospholipid molecule alter acyl chain packing than it is to understand the complexities of a Ramachandran plot From a chemical perspective it is more logical to introduce the spontaneous self assembly of small amphiphilic molecules into large multimolecular aggregates than to start with the physiochemical properties of twenty different amino acid which vary in size and hydrophobicity and proceed to the complexities of intramolecular protein folding reactions Topic Protein Structure The understandings derived from the study of lipids can then be applied to the more complex subject of intramolecular protein folding reactions and protein stability A more expanded and modern view of the hydrophobic effect and associated heat capacity change is presented along with the denaturing effect of chain conformational entropy The role of the hydrophobic effect and Hbonds in protein stability are extrapolated from the behavior of benzene in water and thermodynamic cycles involving the transfer of Nmethylacetamide from water to a nonpolar solvent and from mutational studies Dynamic and linked equilibria considerations along with reaction kinetics are used to describe the varying effects of denaturing urea guanidinium chloride and stabilizing ammonium sulfate glycerol solutes on protein stability as well as the competing processes of protein folding and aggregation in vitro and in vivo Topic Nuclei Acid and Carbohydrate Structure The same principles which determine protein structurefunction can be applied to the study of the structure and stability of nucleic acids complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins Topic Binding Function now necessarily follows Since all biological events are initiated by binding a purely physical process the logic of chemistry suggests it should be studied next Indeed in most textbooks introductory chapters on protein function focus on the binding of dioxygen a simple ligand to myoglobin and hemoglobin Macromoleculedrug interactions as well as cellcell adhesion can be discussed as additional relevant examples The control of gene expression a topic of preeminent importance to modern biologists can be discussed from the logic of chemistry as an essential outcome of the binding of transcription factors and appropriate enzymes to each other and DNA in the active transcription complex It is particularly important to stress how equilibrium and mass conservation principles along with reaction kinetics effectively determine the concentrationdependent behavior of all molecules including the processes of binding and spontaneous structure formation Topic Binding and Transport Binding is an antecedent to the expression of biological activity The simplest expression of activity which involves a simple physical non covalent process is binding and transport of solute molecules across a biological membrane Mathematical analyses of the flux of solute across a membrane catalyzed by a transport protein involves the same assumptions rapid equilibriumsteady state binding and leads to the same equations hyperbolic dependence of flux with outer solute concentration effect of competitive inhibitors as when MichaelisMenten enzyme kinetics mechanisms are modeled Topic Binding and Kinetics The study of enzyme kinetics follows as a logical extension of the expression of molecular function involving the addition of a more complex step namely a chemical transformation Through the study of enzyme kinetics students learn how to obtain a low resolution understanding of the structureactivity of enzymes and of their chemical mechanisms Topic Binding and Chemical Transformations Next the detailed mechanism of specific enzymes whose structures are known is discussed Preceding this the basis for catalysis by small molecules is discussed Following the chemical logic that the properties of macromolecules can be inferred from small molecules students learn that with respect to catalysis enzymes are not different just better than small molecule catalyst as previously described by Jeremy Knowles Topic Energy and Signal Transduction The final sequence involves specific examples of how enzymes can transduce both energy and information signals into useable outputs Energy transduction involving the conversion of light electrochemical gradients or chemical energy into phosphoanhydride bonds is discussed Special attention is paid to biological oxidation reactions Several questions are introduced to provoke discussion and challenge students knowledge of oxidation reactions Students propose reasons to explain the fact that oxidation reactions of organic molecules using dioxygen are thermodynamically but not kinetically favored as well as to explain the need for different types of biological oxidizing agents for energy transduction Signal transduction at the cell membrane serves as an excellent capstone area of study since it incorporates ideas from each sequence References Knowles J Nature Contributors and Attributions Prof Henry Jakubowski College of St BenedictSt Johns

Translation by Kate Bondareva You have probably studied the cell many times either in high school or in college biology classes There are many websites available that review both prokaryotic bacterial archeal and eukaryotic cells see links at bottom This tutorial is designed specifically from the viewpoint of chemistry It explores four classes of biomolecules lipids proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates and describes in a simplified pictorial manner where they are found made and degraded in the cell ie their history It focuses on eukaryotic cells which in contrast to simpler prokaryotic cells have internal organelles surrounded by membranes that compartmentalize chemical reactions First a general overview of the cell is presented Subsequent chapters will concentrate on specific biomolecules Lets think of a cell as a chemical factory which designs imports synthesizes uses exports and degrades a variety of chemicals in the case of cell these include lipids proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates It also must determine or sense the amount of raw and finished chemicals it has available and respond to its own and external needs by ramping up or shutting off production The figure of the cell below and in other linked sites based on it was made available with the kind permission of Liliana Torres Click on the blue hyperlinks for some of the organelles for more detailed information on them Figure A Eukaryotic Cell httptorresbioclanpbworkscomwpageSpikefishAboutCells Use with permission from Liliana Torres Also at wwwanimalportcomanimalcellshtml Design The design for a cell mostly resides in the blueprint for the cell the genetic code which is comprised of the DNA in the cell nucleus and a small amount in the mitochondria Of course the DNA blueprint must be read out transcribed by protein enzymes which themselves were encoded by the DNA The genetic code has the master plan that determines the sequence of all cellular proteins which then catalyze almost all other activities in the cell including catalysis motility architectural structure etc In contrast to DNA RNA and protein polymers the length and sequence of a polysaccharide polymer is not driven by a template but rather by the enzymes that catalyzes the polymerization ImportExport Many of the chemical constituents of the cell arise not from direct synthesis but from import of both small and large molecules The imported molecules must pass through the cell membrane and in some cases through additional membranes if they need to reside inside membranebound organelles Molecules can move into the cell by passive diffusion across the membrane but usually their movement is facilitated by a membrane receptor Molecules can also move up a concentration gradient in a process called active transport Given the amphiphilic nature of the bilayer polar head group exterior nonpolar interior you would expect that polar molecule like glucose would have difficulty in moving across the membrane In fact membrane transport proteins are involved in the movement of both nonpolar and polar molecules transporters carrier proteins and permeases These membrane proteins move specific ligand molecules across a membrane typically down a concentration gradient Computer simulations of the facilitated diffusion of lactose across the membrane is shown in the following link Animation of lactose diffusion through the LacY receptor The link above and immediately below are from the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics group at the Beckman Institute University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign These molecular dynamic simulations were made with VMDNAMDBioCoREJMVother software support developed by the Group with NIH support ion channels These membrane proteins allow the flow of ions across membranes Some are permanently open nongated while others are gated open or closed depending on the presence of ligands that bind the protein channel and the local environment of the protein in the membrane Flow of ions through the channel proceeds in a thermodynamically favored direction which depends on their concentration and voltage gradients across the membrane pores Some membranes nuclear mitochondria assemble proteins such as porins to form large but regulated pores Porins are found in mitochondrial membranes while nucleoporins are found in the nuclear membrane Small molecules can generally pass through these membrane pores while large one are selected based on their tendency to form transient intermolecular attractive forces with the pore proteins The following link shows the diffusion of water through aquaporin animation of water diffusion through the aquaporin channel endocytosis Very large particles for example LDL or Low Density Lipoproteins or viruses can enter a cell through a process called endocytosis Initially the LDL or virus binds to a receptor on the surface of the cell This triggers a series of events which leads to the invagination of the cell membrane at that point This eventually pinches off to form an endosomal vesicle which is surrounded by a protein called clathrin Early endosomes can pick up new proteins and other constituents as well as shed them as they move and mature through the cell During this maturation process protein pumps in the endosome lead to a decrease in the endosomal pH which can lead to conformation changes in protein structure and shedding of proteins Eventually the late endosome reaches and fuses with the lysosome an internal organelle which contains degradative enzymes Undegraded components like viral nucleic acids or cholesterol are delivered to the cell This transport can also go in the reverse direction and recycle receptors to the cell membrane Likewise vesicles pinched off from the Golgi complex can fuse with endosomes with some components surviving the process to reenter the Golgi SynthesizeDegrade Cells have to both synthesize and degrade small molecules as well as larger polymeric protein carbohydrates and nucleic acids The anabolic synthetic and catabolic degradative pathways are often compartmentalized in time and space within a cell For example fatty acid synthesis is carried out in the cytoplasm but fatty acid oxidation is carried out in the mitochondria Proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm or completed in the endoplasmic reticulum for membrane and exported proteins while they are degraded in the lysosome or more importantly in a large multimolecular structure in the cell called the proteasome Lets consider some key characteristics of a cell before we get into the details Cells and their internal compartments have regulated concentrations of ions and hydronium ion As expected the pH of the cytosol the aqueous substance surrounding all the organelles within the cell varies from about depending on the metabolic state of the cell Some organelles have proton transporters that can significantly alter the pH inside an organelle For example the pH inside the lysosome a degradative organelle is about The collapse of the pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is sufficient to drive the thermodynamically unfavored synthesis of ATP Compared to the extracellular fluid the concentration of potassium ion is higher inside the cell while concentrations of sodium chloride and calcium ions are higher on the outside of the cell see table below These concentration gradients are maintained by ion transporters and channels and require energy expenditure ultimately in the form of ATP hydrolysis Changes in these concentrations are integral to the signaling system used by the cell to sense and respond to changes in its external and internal environments Water is found in bulk form as well as bound to macromolecules like proteins and polysaccharides These waters would be expected to have different properties The table below show approximate ion concentrations in the cell Ion Inside mM Outside mM Na K Cl Ca uM Cells have an internal framework that provides architectural and internal structural support The cytoskeletal architecture of a with molecular cables and girderlike structures is not dissimilar from a factory httpwwwcybercomnetcopterstripspicturesfactory_insidejpg httpenWikipediaorgwikiFileFluorescentCellsjpg The internal framework or cytoskeleton of a cell is composed of microfilaments intermediate filaments and microtubules These are comprised of monomeric proteins which self assemble to form the internal architecture Parts of the cytoskeleton can be seen in the photo above taken from Wikipedia Microfilaments of actin monomers which are stained with a redorange fluorophore and microtubules which offer more structural support made of tubulin monomers stained green along with the bluestained nucleus are shown in the image Organelles are supported and organized by the cytoskeleton primarily microtubules Even the cell membrane is supported underneath the inner leaflet by actin stained orange and spectrin microfilaments Motor proteins like myosin that moves along actin microfilaments and dynein and kinesin that move along tubulin microtubules carry cargo vesicles organelles in a directional fashion The cell is not a disorganized collection of molecules and organelles Rather is a highly organized for optimal chemical production use and degradation Cell have a variety of shapes Some circulating immune cells must slip through the cells that line capillary walls to migrate to sites of infection The same process occurs when tumor cells metastasize and escape to other sites in the body In order to do so the cell must drastically change shape a response that requires dissociation of the cytoskeleton polymers into monomers which are available later for repolymerization The cell is an amazingly crowded place In chemistry labs we typically work with dilute solutions of solute molecules in a solvent You have probably heard that the body is comprised of water but the water concentration is obviously dependent on the cellular environment Solute molecules like protein and carbohydrates are densely packed Cells are so crowded that the space between larger molecules like protein is less than the size of protein Studies have shown that the stability of a protein is increased in such condition which would help keep the protein in the folded native state Another consequence of high concentrations is that it would promote the binding or self aggregation of like molecules as well as dislike ones which from an equilibrium perspective would not occur in dilute solutions Hence the study of biomolecules in dilute solutions in the lab may not reveal the actual complexities of interactions and activities of the same molecule in vivo Recently investigators have added a neutral copolymer of sucrose and epichlorhydrine to cells in vitro These particles induced organization of extracellular molecules secreted by cell forming an organized extracellular matrix which induced the organization of the microfilaments on the inside of the cell as well as inducing changes in cell activity In vitro enzyme activity of a key enzyme in glycolysis dramatically increases under crowded conditions Another result of crowding may be the spatial and temporal association of key enzymes in specific metabolic pathways allowing easier diffusion of substrates and products within the colocalized enzymes Figure The crowded cytoplasm of E Coli Ufrom McGuffee SR Elcock AH PLoS Comput Biol e doijournalpcbi open source journal The computer simulation used different types of the most abundant macromolecules of the E coli cytoplasm and individual molecules Rendering of the cytoplasm model at the end of a dynamics simulation RNA is shown as green and yellow This figure was prepared with VMD Cell components undergo phase transitions to form substructures within the cell A perplexing question is how do substructures form within a cell This includes not only the biogenesis of organelles like mitochondria but also smaller particle such as polysaacharide granules lipid droplets proteinRNA particles including the ribosome as well as the nucleolus of the cell nucleus It might be easiest to consider this problem using two examples from the lipid world lipid droplets and membrane rafts You are very familiar with phase transitions that occur when a sparing soluble nonpolar liquid is added to water At a high enough concentration the solubility of the nonpolar liquid is exceeded and a phase transition occur as evidenced by the appearance of two separate liquid phases The same process occurs when triglycerides coalesce into lipid droplets with proteins associated on their outside Another example occurs within a cell membrane when lipids with saturated alkyl chains self associate with membrane cholesterol which contains a rigid planar ring system to form a lipid raft characterized by greater packing efficiency rigidity and thickness that other parts of the membrane These lipid rafts often recruit protein involved in signaling processes within the cell membranes This process of phase separation is also called liquidliquid demixing as two liquidlike substances separate It appears that proteins that interact with RNA are composed of less diverse amino acid and have more flexible more liquidlike structures allowing their preferential interaction with RNA to form large RNAprotein particles like the ribosome and other RNA processing structures in a fashion that mimics liquidliquid demixing All of these interactions are just manifestations of the various intermolecular forces you studied in earlier chemistry classes You have studied lipid protein nucleic acid and carbohydrate structure in introductory biology andor chemistry classes Now follow the following links which will take you to Cell Tutorial chapters that show the life history of these types of molecules in the cell CT L The Cell Lipids CTP The Cell

Baking PowderUsing Baking PowderContributors and Attributions Baking powder is a dependable highquality chemical leavener To be effective all baking powders rely on the reaction between one or more acids on sodium bicarbonate to produce carbon dioxide gas Just as with yeast leavening the presence of carbon dioxide gas creates air bubbles that cause the product to rise There are two main types of baking powders available on the market Continuous or singleaction baking powder Double or multipleaction baking powder The difference between continuous and doubleaction baking powders is simply the rate of reaction Continuousaction baking powder uses one acid which continuously reacts with the soda to release gas steadily throughout the baking process until all the gassing power is spent Doubleaction baking powder contains two different acids which react with soda at different stages of the baking process One acid reacts to give off a small amount of gas at low temperature and the other major acid reacts at baking temperatures to give off the bulk of the gas The Leavening Mechanism of Baking Powder Before baking approximately of the CO gas is released in the cold stage Eightyfive percent of the CO gas is released in the oven starting at approximately C F Some leavening power is apparently lost in the cold stage but there is usually still adequate gassing power in the remaining portion When the baking powder is activated through moisture and heat the gas works its way into the many cells created by the mixing or creaming of the batter and starts to expand them This process comes to a halt when the starch gelatinizes and the cells become rigid This starts at about C F and is more or less complete at around C F After this point some gas may still be created but it simply escapes through the porous structure of the product Using Baking Powder For even distribution throughout the batter baking powder should be sifted with the flour or other dry ingredients For most cakes about baking powder to the weight of the flour produces an optimum result Accurate scaling is important since a little too much may cause the product to collapse Note this is unlike yeast where an overdose will usually simply cause a more rapid rise Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is

coronavirusSARSCoV has a replicase gene with a sequence motifs of papainlikeproteinase and Clike proteinase CLpro SARS CLpro is fullyconserved among all released SARS coronavirus genome sequences Because of its functional indispensability in the coronaviruslife cycle SARS CLpro S has become an attractive target in discoveringnew antiSARS agentsThe crystal structures of CL proteinases from human coronavirus has been determined The reported crystal structures of SARS CLpro and its complexwith an inhibitor revealed substantially pHdependent conformationalchanges and an unexpected model for inhibitor binding It contains the following three domainsdomains I and II residues have an antiparallelβbarrel structure forming a chymotrypsinfold the substratebindingsite is located in a cleft between these two domains whereasresidues form a third compact αhelical domaindomain III connecting to domain II by a long loop residues As the crystal structures of CL proteinases in different coronavirusesgive similar dimeric structures and nearly all side chainsof CLpro involved in the formation of the dimer are conservedit has been proposed that the dimer might be the biological functional form of CLpro From the dimeric structures of coronavirus CLpros it has been also predicted that domainIII might play a role in substrate recognition and be responsiblefor positioning the N terminus of one protomer monomer to interact with the active site of the other protomerThe critical role of domain III in dimerization and enzymaticactivity of SARS CLpro has been shown In addition Lai and coworkers reported that SARS CLpro exists as a monomerdimer mixture at a relatively highprotein concentration approx mgml and is exclusively monomer ata lower protein concentration approx mgml in solution and onlythe dimer was the active form of the proteinase Based on the crystal structures and biochemical studies of several coronavirus CLpros one hypothesis was proposed that the Nterminalresidues might play an important role in both dimerization and enzymatic activity of SARS CLpro However other studies showned that the N terminus was not necessaryfor the dimer formation of SARS CLpro ie the Nterminal deleted SARS CLpro may possibly form a dimer with a new statedifferent from the fulllength proteinase Biochemical and biophysicalstudies of the dimerization and proteolytic

Selenocysteinespecific Translation Factor SelB Alena Paleskava Andrey L Konevega and Marina V Rodnina The Journal of Biological Chemistry doi jbcM Background from article Selenocysteine Sec is the st genetically encoded amino acid identified in selected proteins in all three kingdoms of life In bacteria Sec is encoded by the UGA stop codon in combination with a specific hairpin structure on the mRNA the Sec insertion sequence SectRNASec is delivered to the ribosome by a specialized translation factor SelB a kDa GTPbinding protein that consists of four domains and recognizes both SectRNASec and the Sec insertion sequence SelB shares significant sequence similarity with other translation factors that deliver aminoacyltRNA to the ribosome such as EFTu and eIFeIFB Domains I II and III of SelB have the same secondary elements as the respective domains of EFTu and are highly conserved among all organisms Domain I binds guanine nucleotides and domains I II and III together provide most of the contact surface for SectRNASec binding Domain IV of SelB which consists of four wingedhelix motifs and recognizes the Sec insertion sequence element has no analogs in other translational GTPases and differs in bacteria archaea and eukarya Despite the structural similarities of the nucleotidebinding domains of SelB and EFTu their nucleotidebinding properties are markedly different SelB from Escherichia coli binds GTP with higher affinity than GDP In contrast EFTu binds GTP much more weakly than GDP values of Kd for GTP and GDP are and nm respectively Furthermore the arrangement of domains IIII in EFTu changes dramatically upon GTP hydrolysis which is used to control aminoacyltRNA binding and delivery to the ribosome In contrast crystal structures suggested that domains IIII in SelB from the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis adopt similar GTPlike conformations in the presence of the GTP analog GDPNP or GDP or in the absence of guanine nucleotides This finding is difficult to reconcile with the orders of magnitude differences in the binding affinity of SectRNASec to SelBï½GTP and SelBï½GDP which prompted us to probe the conformational changes of SelB upon binding of different guanine nucleotides in solution In principle a number of techniques can be used to probe conformational rearrangements of proteins upon ligand binding Among them isothermal titration calorimetry ITC is an underexploited method to estimate structural changes by measuring the heat released or absorbed during complex formation The figure below illustrates the components of an ITC system This enthalpy change determined at different temperatures allows calculating the heat capacity change which in turn provides information about conformational changes of macromolecules upon binding their ligands Thus ITC provides a sensitive method to draw the link between the thermodynamic data and structural rearrangement of the molecules The investigators utilized ITC to estimate the magnitude of conformational changes in SelB upon binding of different guanine nucleotides BackgrounReview Questions a Looking at the calorimetry cells above what components would most likely be placed in the reference cell sample cells and syringe b ITC is very sensitive and can detect minute enthalpy changes when a titrant is injected into the reference cell List possible physical and chemical processes which might lead to enthalpy changes on on injection of a titrant into the control cell c What is the most logical control experiment that you would perform How would you correct the experimental derived enthalpy changes for the those see in the control case d Consider the following simple equilibrium for the interaction of a ligand L with a macromolecule M characterized by the dissociation constant Kd as shown below where M is the concentration of the free macromolecule L is the concentration of free ligand and ML is the concentration of complex For dissociable binding interactions Kd is as important as pka for a ionizable proton from an acid An equation for ML as a function of Mo L and Kd is shown above Kd values are typically determined from binding experiment when Mo the total amount of M is much less than free L From the equation of ML above draw a graph of ML vs L on the axes below e Simplify the equation for ML as a function of L for each of the following conditions L Kd L Kd L Kd The equilibrium constant Keq Kd is related to the standard free energy change DG using the following equation f What is the DG at equilibrium Using this information derive an equation that gives the relations between DG and Keq as well as Kd Questions based on article Answer the following questions based on the ITC thermograms for binding of GTP to SelB A and GDP to SelB B below a The titration curves above appear sigmoidal in contrast to the hyperbolic saturation binding curve you drew for a simple M L binding equilibrium Sigmoidal ML vs L binding plots are often associated with cooperative binding interactions Why are these plots NOT hyperbolic even they the enthalpy changes can be best modeled by a simple noncooperative binding of M and L with a stoichiometry of b Is the binding exothermic or endothermic What is the sign of DH b Which one proceeds with a lower dissociation constant Kd c Assuming that the binding is favored which one has a more negative DG Assume equal concentrations of SelB in the sample cell Which one is more favored under standard condition d The change in Gibbs Free energy is also related to the change in enthalpy and entropy as shown in the equation below Can you deduce from simple inspection of the curves above if DS is or Explain The ITC thermograms comparing the binding of GTP A and two analogs of GTP GTPγS B GDPNP C are shown below d Again assuming similar concentration of SelB in the sample C compare the Kds for the interaction of GTPγS and GDPN to SelB e The structures of GTP and the two analogs are shown below Suggests a reason that the investigators used the analogs in their studies f The ITC thermograms be fit to a theoretical model for M and L binding with a stoichiometry of one From this data fit Kd can be determined How would you calculate the DS for the interaction of SelB and GXP The thermodynamic parameters of SelB binding to guanine nucleotides at different temperatures are shown below g Do they confirm your answers to b and d above To determine the effect of change in protonation state on binding of SelB and GXP the effect of different buffer solutions on the binding enthalpy of SelBGTP was studied Figure A below shows binding enthalpy of GTP to SelB in phosphate buffer HEPES buffer and Tris buffer as a function of temperature a Any change in enthalpy accompanying proton release or uptake on binding of a macromolecule to a ligand would be affected by the change in enthalpy on binding of protons to the buffer base To investigate the effect of buffer ionization enthalpy the Each of the buffers has a different DHion which is the enthalpy change on ionization of a proton from the buffer acid State two facts that characterize the graphs b Figure B above shows the dependence of binding enthalpy of SelBGTP interaction y axis on the buffer protonionization enthalpy at ï½C ï½C ï½C and ï½C for different buffers whose enthalpy of ionization are known at different temperature x axis What are the units for the slope of the line What is the actual slope What does this tell you What does the y intercept tell you Why use is the y intercept in this study Figure C above shows the enthalpy change for binding of SelB and GTP corrected for buffer solution protonation changes Standard deviations of measurements are given by error bars in some cases not visible because they are smaller than symbol size Note that the DH is a linear function of temperature The slope of the line has units of kcalmoloC which is heat capacity The change in heat capacity DCp dDHdT can give us insight into the nature of the binding interactions To understand this first consider change in thermodynamic parameter when benzene is transferred from pure benzene to water A graph showing thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature for this transfer reaction is shown below c Is the positive value of DG for transfer of benzene from pure benzene to water in accord with your understanding of physical and chemical properties of benzene Explain d At first glance you might expect that the collective benzenebenzene IMFs and HOHO IMFS might be stronger than benzeneHO IMFs and hence the dissolution of benzene in water might require an input of heat energy to drive it so the process would be endothermic Yet around K it is a bit favored enthalpically to for benzene to dissolve in water What dramatically disfavors it is entropy This is manifestation of the hydrophobic effect which helps drive protein folding so that hydrophobic side chains are buried A key signature of the hydrophobic effect is that the transfer of nonpolar groups to water is associated with a positive DCp Note that taking benzene from benzene is water is characterized by a linearly increasing DH with increasing temperature and hence a positive DCp We will use this idea to analyze the DCp for SelB and GTP binding For graph C above what is the sign of DCp What molecular interpretation can you give to that value The main source of DCp changes on binding arise from loss of water of interacting water from the surfaces of protein and ligand on binding with the main contribution arising from the hydrophoboic effect Another less sizeable contribution to DCp would arise from burying polar residues with the ensuing changes in bound and bulk water interaction potentials The following equation has been used to show the contribution to ΔCp from dissolution of solids compounds in water ΔCp DcapDASAap DcpDASAp where DASAap and DASAp are the apolar and polar solvent accessible surface areas changes respectively Model compounds give values of Dcap and Dcp per mol of SA angstroms squared Table below shows heat capacity changes and accessible surface area for SelB binding to guanine nucleotides ΔCp heat capacity change obtained as ΔHdT ΔASAap and ΔASAp changes in apolar and polar solventaccessible surface areas assuming that all the changes were conferred by either apolar AAap or polar AAp residues respectively with no contribution from the other Ex for GTP in Hepes The values for the buried area were converted into the numbers of amino acids that were removed from the surface using the average ASA for apolar ï½ and polar ï½ amino acids Figure shows the heat capacity changes upon SelB interaction with guanine nucleotides A temperature dependence of binding enthalpy changes upon SelB interactions with GTP GTPγS GDPNP and GDP Standard deviations of measurements are given by error bars which are smaller than the symbol size B bar representation of heat capacity changes upon SelB interactions with guanine nucleotides From graphs A and B and Table above compare the similarities and differences between the free and bound states of SelB with the different ligands To further study the differences in SelB conformations upon binding of GTP GDP and nonhydrolyzable analogs SelB and its complexes were separated by sizeexclusion chromatography which separates on

macromolecule structure and function can be examined and understood by applying principles learned from the study of small molecules to macromolecules The macromolecules we will discuss in class proteins complex carbohydrates and nucleic acids can be understood using principles of organic physical analytical and inorganic chemistry The links below will take you to a description of many of the handouts I have distributed in class This online guide is meant to augment your understanding of what we have discussed in class and not a replacement for class attendance PROTEINS Proteins are polymers of the bifunctional monomer amino acids Amino acids form polymers through a nucleophilic attack by the amino group of an amino acid at the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the carboxyl group of another amino acid The carboxyl group of the amino acid must first be activated to provide a better leaving group than OH We will discuss this activation by ATP latter in the course The resulting link between the amino acids is an amide link which biochemists call a peptide bond In this reaction water is released In a reverse reaction the peptide bond can hence be cleaved by water hydrolysis COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES POLYSACCHARIDES Monosaccharides are the monomeric units which polymerize to form a polysaccharide Monosaccharides are simple sugars polyhydroxyaldehydes or ketones which can cyclize by an intramolecular nucleophilic addition of one of the OH groups on the sugar with the aldehyde or ketone resulting in a hemiacetal or hemiketal Addition of another alcohol from an exogenous alcohol under acidicanhydrous condition results in an acetal If the added alcohol is from another sugar a covalent acetal link between the two sugars results As with peptides the process can be reversed under aqueous conditions through hydrolysis of the acetal link resulting in monomeric sugars Biochemist name the acetal link between sugars a glycosidic bond Click to see figures showing these reactions Cyclization of simple sugars through hemiacetal links Hemiacetalacetal chemistry Examples of complex carbohydrates NUCLEIC ACIDS The monomeric units of nucleic acids consist of a ring cyclized sugar ribose for RNA and deoxyribose for DNA which has been attached at C to an organic base pyrimidine or purine through an acetallike link ie Instead of a nucleophilic alcohol reacting with the ribose hemiacetal a nucleophilic N on the base reacts The link between the monomers requires the activation of the O on C through a triphosphate group The actual link between the monomers is a phosphodiester link which likewise can be hydrolyzed See the figures below Monomers Polymers ROADMAP FOR THE COURSE DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS WE WILL COVER DURING THIS COURSE Powerpoint Biochemistry

Trypanosoma brucei Glycoproteins Contain Novel Giant PolyNacetyllactosamine Carbohydrate ChainsAbdelmadjid Atrih Julia M Richardson Alan R Prescott and Michael A J Ferguson J Biol Chem Vol Issue January A densely packed layer of a surface glycoprotein covers the surface of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei The parasitic protozoa are transmitted by tsetse fly and causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestockIn the mammalian host T brucei liveand divide extracellularly in the blood lymph and interstitialfluids They have s of genes for the glycoproteins which produce so many variants that the organism can elude the immune system The parasite has a deep invagination of the plasma membrane called the flagellar pocket Endocytosis and secretion occurs from this site Little is known about its unique membrane glycoprotein structures and the endosome vesicles that have undergone endocytosislysosome degratory vesicles that fuse with lysosomes system Something in the pocket binds the lectin ricin and tomato lectin Ricin is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a GalβGlcNAc binding subunit B chain kDa and a toxic subunit A chain ca kDa connected through a disulfide linkage Tomato lectin is known to bind a linear polymer of Nacetyllactosamine polyLacNac which is comprised of up to GalβGlcNAc linked principally by GlcNAcβGalβ links which in mammals is found in both the cell and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins A study was done to exam the flagellar pocket of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei by studying the ricinbinding glycoprotein Ricinbinding glycoproteins were purified as follows a Cell were isolated from blood subjected to hypotonic lysis to release cytosolic components and soluble forms of surface glycoproteins and cell ghost cells without cytoplasm and other soluble contents collected Briefly explain this procedure and how it works with words and pictures b Cell ghosts were solubilized in mL of M urea SDS

left after treatment with PNGaseF before the electrophoresis Hint Google the enzyme Glycans released from the ricinbinding glycoproteins by PNGaseF were separated by BioGel P gel filtration chromatography Figure BioGel P chromatogram of glycans obtained from ricinbinding glycoproteins Glycans released from ricinbinding glycoproteins by the action of PNGaseF were purified from detergents and salts The monosaccharide compositions of the fractions were determined by GCMS The void volume total polyLacNAc fraction is indicated with a bar Two major fractions were found Which peak has the highest average molecular weight species Give an estimate of the molecular weight range of the glycans found in the void volume of the BioGel P column based on the information from BioRad below The polyLacNAc fraction from the BioGel P column was chromatographed on a HPLC Dionex CarboPac A high pH anion exchange column HPAEC used for the analysis of weakly ionizable carbohydrates The beads in this column consist of μm diameter vinylbenzyl chloridedivinylbenzene macroporous substrate fully functionalized with an alkyl quaternary ammonium group crosslinked The column is equilibrated in

polyLacNAc fraction which bind to tomato lectinagarose The VLPL very large poly LacNac is indicated with a bar What is the pH of the column during equilibration and running Why was this column run at this pH The VLPL fraction was subjected to monosaccharide compositional analysis by GC_MS A ul aliquots that was desalted and dissolved in water was mixed with ul of acetonitrile with formic acid and subjected to GCMS It contained Man Gal and GlcNAc in the ration of Is this consistent with the proposed glycan structure It is necessary to know the linkage of the monosaccharide in the VLPL Linkage analysis was done by converting glycans to partially methylated alditol acetates and analyzing them by GCMS The general chemistry involved in the formation of methylated alditol acetates used in methylation analysis is shown below Definitive identification requires in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern the comparison of retention times with those of known standards a Why is methylation of free OH groups by basic CHI required before hydrolysis of the glycosidic links What do methyl group denote b Why is the reduction carried out c Why is a final acetylation carried out What do acetyl groups mark Traditional MS approaches are based on the fragmentation of organic molecules under some kind of impact followed by the differentiation of the resulting particles according to their masstocharge ratio In methylation analysis peaks are identified by a combination of their retention time relative time of elution from the LC column and their electron impact EIMS fragmentation pattern The EI fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted monosaccharides of the same class eg aldohexoses are the same Thus definitive identification requires in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern the comparison of retention times with those of known standards ie all triOmethylhexoses produce the same EIMS spectrum but peracetylated triOmethylgalactitol elutes later than peracetylated triOmethylglucitol This type of analysis indicates which residues are terminal ie they are methylated at every position except OH and OH and how each monosaccharide is substituted the latter reveals inter alia the occurrence of branching points However methylation analysis neither indicates which residues are attached to each other ie does not provide sequence information nor if a particular linkage is of the α or β configuration NCBI The methylation analysis in conjunction with NMR analysis showed large amounts of substitutedβGlcNac and OsubstitutedβGal NMR analysis shows most of the GlcNAc and Gal residues were present as LacNac repeats of approximately Finally fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled ricin was added to fixed tryptosomes and detected by fluorescence

RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Dry Curd Cottage CheeseCreamed Cottage CheeseBakers CheeseQuarkRicottaMascarponeContributors and Attributions Cheese is a concentrated dairy product made from fluid milk and is defined as the fresh or matured product obtained by draining the whey after coagulation of casein Cheese making consists of four steps Curdling of the milk either by enzyme rennet or by lactic curdling natural process Draining in which the whey liquid part is drained from the curd firm part Pressing which determines the shape Ripening in which the rind forms and the curd develops flavor Cheese can be classified with some exceptions into five broad categories as follows Examples are given of specific cheeses that may be used in baking Fresh cheese High moisture content and no ripening characterize these products Examples cottage cheese bakers cheese cream cheese quark and ricotta Soft cheeses Usually some rind but with a soft interior Example feta Semisoft cheeses Unripened cheeses of various moisture content Example mozzarella Firm cheeses Wellripened cheese with relatively low moisture content and fairly high fat content Examples Swiss cheddar brick Hard cheeses Lengthy aging and very low moisture content Example Parmesan In baking cheeses have different functions Soft cheeses mixed with other ingredients are used in fillings for pastries and coffeecakes They are used for certain European deepfried goods such as cannoli They may also be used sometimes in combination with a richer cream cheese for cheesecakes All the cheeses itemized under fresh cheese see above are all more or less interchangeable for these functions The coarser cheese may be strained first if necessary The firmer cheeses are used in products like cheese bread quiches pizza and cheese straws A brief description of the cheeses most likely to be used by bakers follows Dry Curd Cottage Cheese This is a soft unripened acid cheese Pasteurized skim milk is inoculated with lacticacidproducing bacteria and a milkclotting enzyme rennet is added Following incubation the milk starts to clot and it is then cut into cubes After gentle cooking the cubes or curds become quite firm At this point the whey is drained off and the curd is washed and cooled with cold water Creamed Cottage Cheese Creamed or dressed cottage cheese consists of dry curd cottage cheese combined with a cream dressing The milk fat content of the dressing determines whether the final product is regular milk fat or low fat to milk fat Bakers Cheese This is a soft unripened uncooked cheese It is made following exactly the same process as for dry curd cottage cheese up to and including the point when the milk clot is cut into cubes This cheese is not cooked to remove the whey from the curd Rather the curd is drained through cloth bags or it may be pumped through a curd concentrator The product is then ready to be packaged The milk fat content is Chemistry of Cooking generally about Quark Quark or quarg is a fresh unripened cheese prepared in a fashion similar to cottage cheese The mild flavor and smooth texture of quark make it excellent as a topping or filling for a variety of dishes Quark is similar to bakers cheese except acid is added to it it is inoculated with lacticacidproducing bacteria and then it is blended with straight cream to produce a smooth spread containing approximately milk fat Today there are lowfat quarks with lower percentage and highfat versions with milk fat adjusted to Quark cheese can often be used in place of sour cream cottage cheese or ricotta cheese Cream Cheese Cream cheese is a soft unripened acid cheese A milkandcream mixture is homogenized and pasteurized cooled to about C F and inoculated with lacticacidproducing bacteria The resulting curd is not cut but it is stirred until it is smooth and then heated to about C F for one hour The curd is drained through cloth bags or run through a curd concentrator Regular cream cheese is fairly high fat but much lighter versions exist now Ricotta Ricotta is a fresh cheese prepared from either milk or whey that has been heated with an acidulating agent added Traditionally lemon juice or vinegar was used for acidulation but in commercial production a bacterial culture is used The curds are then strained and the ricotta is used for both sweet and savory applications Mascarpone Mascarpone is a rich fresh cheese that is a relative of both cream cheese and ricotta cheese Mascarpone is prepared in a similar fashion to ricotta but using cream instead of whole milk The cream is acidified often by the direct addition of tartaric acid and heated to a temperature of C F which results in precipitation of the curd The curd is then separated from the whey by filtration or mechanical means The cheese is lightly salted and usually whipped Note that starter culture and rennet are not used in the production of this type of cheese The highfat content and smooth texture of mascarpone cheese make it suitable as a substitute for cream or butter Ingredient applications of mascarpone cheese tend to focus on desserts The most famous application of mascarpone cheese is in the Italian dessert tiramisu Table provides the composition of various types of cheeses Table Composition of various cheeses by weight Moisture Milk Fat Salt Dry curd

main types of chocolate in decreasing order of cocoa liquor content are Unsweetened bitter chocolate Dark chocolate Milk chocolate White chocolate Unsweetened Chocolate Unsweetened chocolate also

balance of cocoa liquor cocoa butter and sugar Thus it has the attractive rich color and flavor so typical of chocolate and is also sweet enough to be palatable It does not contain any milk solids It can be eaten as is or used in baking Its flavor does not get lost or overwhelmed as in many cases when milk chocolate is used It can be used for fillings for which more flavorful chocolates with high cocoa percentages ranging from to are often usedDark is synonymous with semisweet and extra dark with bittersweet although the ratio of cocoa butter to solids may vary Sweet chocolate has more sugar sometimes almost equal to cocoa liquor and butter amounts to range Semisweet chocolate is frequently used for cooking It is a dark chocolate with less sugar than sweet chocolate Bittersweet chocolate

higher the percentage of cocoa the less sweet the chocolate is Milk Chocolate Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with milk added in the form of milk powder Milk chocolate contains a higher percentage of fat the milk contributes to this and the melting point is slightly lower It is used mainly as a flavoring and in the production of candies and moulded pieces White Chocolate The main

proteinsDairy and soy proteinsFlour proteins glutenContributors and Attributions Coagulation is deﬁned as the transformation of proteins from a liquid state to a solid form Once proteins are coagulated they cannot be returned to their liquid state Coagulation often begins around C F and the process is complete between C and C F and F Within the baking process the natural structures of the ingredients are altered irreversibly by a series of physical chemical and biochemical interactions The three main types of protein that cause coagulation in the bakeshop are outlined below Egg proteins Eggs contain many diﬀerent proteins The white or albumen contains approximately diﬀerent proteins the most predominant being ovalbumin and ovotransferrin The yolk contains mostly lipids fats but also lipoproteins These diﬀerent proteins will all coagulate when heated but do so at diﬀerent temperatures The separated white of an egg coagulates between C and C F and F and the yolk between C and C F and F which is why you can cook an egg and have a fully set white and a still runny yolk These temperatures are raised when eggs are mixed into other liquids For example the coagulation and thickening of an egg milk and sugar mixture as in custard will take place between C and C F and F and will start to curdle at C to C F and F Dairy and soy proteins Casein a semisolid substance formed by the coagulation of milk is obtained and used primarily in cheese Rennet derived from the stomach linings of cattle sheep and goats is used to coagulate or thicken milk during the cheesemaking process Plantbased rennet is also available Chymosin also called rennin is the enzyme used to produce rennet and is responsible for curdling the milk which will then separate into solids curds and liquid whey Milk and milk products will also coagulate when treated with an acid such as citric acid lemon juice or vinegar used in the preparation of fresh ricotta and tartaric acid used in the preparation of mascarpone or will naturally curdle when sour as lactic acid develops in the milk In some cases as in the production of yogurt or crème fraîche acidcausing bacteria are added to the milk product to cause the coagulation Similarly tofu is made from soybean milk that has been coagulated with the use of either salt acid or enzymebased coagulants Flour proteins gluten Two main proteins are found in wheat ﬂour glutenin and gliadin smaller quantities are also found in other grains During mixing and in contact with liquid these two form into a stretchable substance called gluten The coagulation of gluten is what happens when bread bakes that is it is the ﬁrming or hardening of these gluten proteins usually caused by heat which solidify to form a ﬁrm structure

eggs one estimates the weight of the white as g oz and the yolk as g oz The color of the shell which is either a creamy white or brown is relevant to the breed of the hen and there is no other basic difference in the content of the egg or the shell The color of the yolk depends on the diet of the hens Bakers have a preference for eggs with dark yolks Certainly the appearance of cakes made with such eggs is richer Tests have found that although eggs with darker yolks tend to produce moister sponge cakes the cakes are somewhat coarser and less tender Contributors and Attributions Sorangel

highquality chocolate that contains extra cocoa butter The higher percentage of cocoa butter combined with proper tempering gives the chocolate more sheen firmer snap when broken and a creamy mellow flavor Dark milk and white chocolate can all be made as couvertures The total percentage cited on many brands of chocolate is based on some combination of cocoa butter in relation to cocoa liquor In order to be labelled as couverture by European Union regulations the product must contain not less than total dry cocoa solids including not less than cocoa butter and not less than of dry nonfat cocoa solids Couverture is used by professionals for dipping coating moulding and garnishing What the percentages dont tell you is the proportion of cocoa butter to cocoa solids You can however refer to the nutrition label or company information to find the amounts of each All things being equal the chocolate with the higher fat content will be the one with more cocoa butter which contributes to both flavor and mouthfeel This will also typically be the more expensive chocolate because cocoa butter is more valuable than cocoa liquor But keep in mind that just because two chocolates from different manufacturers have the same percentages they are not necessarily equal They could have dramatically differing amounts of cocoa butter and liquor and dissimilar flavors and substituting one for the other can have negative effects for your recipe Determining the amounts of cocoa butter and cocoa liquor will allow you to make informed decisions on chocolate choices Contributors and

crystallization in food Controlling the crystallization process can aﬀect whether a particular product is spreadable or whether it will feel gritty or smooth in the mouth In some cases crystals are something you try to develop in others they are something you try to avoid It is important to know the characteristics and quality of the crystals in diﬀerent food Butter margarine ice cream sugar and chocolate all contain diﬀerent types of crystals although they all contain fat crystals For example ice cream has fat crystals ice crystals and sometimes lactose crystals The fact that sugar solidiﬁes into crystals is extremely important in candy making There are basically two categories of candies crystalline candies that contain crystals in their ﬁnished form such as fudge and fondant and noncrystalline candies that do not contain crystals such as lollipops taﬀy and caramels Recipe ingredients and procedures for noncrystalline candies are speciﬁcally designed to prevent the formation of sugar crystals because they give the resulting candy a grainy texture One way to prevent the crystallization of sucrose in candy is to make sure that there are other types of sugarusually fructose and glucoseto get in the way and slow down or inhibit the process Acids can also be added to invert the sugar and to prevent or slow down crystallization Fats added to certain confectionery items will have a similar eﬀect When boiling sugar for any application the formation of crystals is generally not desired These are some of the things that can promote crystal growth Pot and utensils that are not clean Sugar with impurities in it A scoop used in the ﬂour bin and then used for sugar may have enough particles on it to promote crystallization Water with a high mineral content hard water Too much stirring agitation during the boiling phase Crystallization may be prevented by adding an interferent such as acid lemon vinegar tartaric etc or glucose or corn syrup during the boiling procedure As mentioned above ice cream can have ice and fat crystals that coexist along with other structural elements emulsion air cells and hydrocolloid stabilizers such as locust bean gum that make up the body of the ice cream Some of these components crystallize either partially or completely The bottom line is that the nature of the crystalline phase in the food will determine the quality appearance texture feel in the mouth and stability of the product The texture of ice cream is derived in part from the large number of small ice crystals These small ice crystals provide a smooth texture with excellent meltdown and cooling properties When these ice crystals grow larger during storage recrystallization the product becomes coarse and less enjoyable Similar concerns apply to sugar crystals in fondant and frostings and to fat crystals in chocolate butter and margarine Control of crystallization in fats is important in many food products including chocolate margarine butter and shortening In these products the aim is to produce the appropriate number size and distribution of crystals in the correct shape because the crystalline phase plays such a large role in appearance texture spreadability and ﬂavor release Thus understanding the processes that control crystallization is critical to controlling quality in these products To control crystallization in foods certain factors must be controlled Number and size of crystals Crystal distribution Proper polymorph crystal shape Crystallization is important in working with chocolate The tempering process sometimes called precrystallization is an important step that is used for decorative and moulding purposes and is a major contributor to the mouth feel and enjoyment of chocolate Tempering is a process that encourages the cocoa butter in the chocolate to harden into a speciﬁc crystalline pattern which maintains the sheen and texture for a long time When chocolate isnt tempered properly it can have a number of problems For example it may not ever set up hard at room temperature it may become hard but look dull and blotchy the internal texture may be spongy rather than crisp and it can be susceptible to fat bloom meaning the fats will migrate to the surface and make whitish streaks and blotches Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel

Canadian Food Inspection Agency CFIA is responsible for administering and enforcing the FDR and FDA Here are some of the regulations governing cocoa and chocolate Cocoa butter must be the only fat source Chocolate sold in Canada cannot contain vegetable fats or oils Chocolate must contain chocolate liquor The only sweetening agents permitted in chocolate in Canada are listed in Division of the Food and Drug Regulations Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame sucralose acesulfame potassium and sugar alcohols sorbitol maltitol etc are not permitted Milk andor milk ingredients are permissible Emulsifying agents are permissible as are flavors such as vanilla Cocoa butter and sugar quantities are not defined in the regulations Some semisweet chocolate may be sweeter than socalled sweet chocolate And remember that bittersweet chocolate is not as you might expect sugarless Only if the label states unsweetened do you know that there is no sugar added Products manufactured or imported into Canada that contain nonpermitted ingredients vegetable fats or oils artificial sweeteners cannot legally be called chocolate when sold in Canada A nonstandardized name such as candy must be used Finally lecithin which is the most common emulsifying agent added to chocolate is approved for use in chocolate in North America and Europe but Canadian regulations state that no more than can be added during the manufacturing process of chocolate Emulsifiers like lecithin can help thin out melted chocolate so it flows evenly and smoothly Because it is less expensive than cocoa butter at thinning chocolate it can be used to help lower the cost The lecithin used in chocolate is mainly derived from soy Both GMO genetically modified organism and nonGMO soy lecithin are available Check

to give a cursory overview More details on nucleic acid structure and its role as the carrier of genetic information can be learned from courses and textbook on Molecular Biology This guide is intended to give a cursory overview of this complicated field A The structure of DNA DNA can exist as single doublestranded or mixed forms It is actually a misnomer to call dsDNA a molecule since it really consisted of two different complementary strands held together by IMFs However most people talk about a molecule of dsDNA and so will I In analogy to protein structure dsDNA has a linear sequence primary structure secondary structure right handed double helix and tertiaryquaternary structure it is folded and packed in the cell Structure of DNA and RNA Jsmol DNA Structure Alternative DNA structures The links above show the classic dsDNA helix in which DNA is in the B form Other forms of DNA exists including ADNA and ZDNA Singlestranded sections of DNA can through intramolecular basepairing form stemloop hairpin structures and quadruplex structures found at the ends of chromosomes telomeres Jsmol B A and Z DNA Structure of a chromosome Most people have seen pictures of chromosomes viewed through microscopes Check out this amazing picture of a chromosome taken form Scientific American September Chromosomes consist of one dsDNA molecule Each somatic cell of your body has pairs of chromosomes one member of each pair contributed by your mother and the other by your father In germ cells eggs and sperm there are individual chromosomes not chromosome pairs One pair are the sex chromosomes which can come in two forms X and Y A pair of Xs gives a female and an XY results in a male Figure Human Chromosomes with an extra copy of Chromosome which causes Down syndrome The human genome has about billion base pairs of DNA I am uncertain if that estimate is for all pairs or since each member of a pairs is almost identical it is an estimate of the DNA in one member each of the just different pairs of chromosomes I will assume that it is for one member of each pair Therefore on average each single chromosome of a pair has about million base pairs which consists of one molecule of DNA and lots of proteins bound to it dsDNA is a highly charged molecule and can be view to a first approximation as a long polyelectrolyte with a large negative charge This very large molecule must somehow be packed into a small nucleus These packing problem is solved by coiling DNA and packing it with proteins which usually have a net positive charge The chromosomes are usually dispersed within the nucleus and are not visible with an ordinary microscope When the cell is ready to divide the DNA in the chromosomes replicates and the chromosomes condense in a fashion that they are not visible using an ordinary microscope At this point the chromosomes can be stained with a variety of stains hence the name chromosomes some of which bind differentially to different chromosomes The different chromosomes can hence be distinguished by their size shape and dyebinding properties the later called a spectralkaryotype analysis of chromosomes The standard picture of a chromosome with which you are familiar including the one shown above and below is actually one chromosome of a pair that has just replicated One of the chromosomes will stay will the mother cell and the other will go to the daughter cell These two chromosomes which are aligned and appear joined at their centers are called sister chromatids These large DNAprotein complexes must be further packaged in the nucleus as shown in the Carl Saganesque reducing view of the chromosome a double stranded DNA molecule winds around a core of proteins Figure Packaging of DNA in the Nucleus httpwwwncbinlmnihgovClassMLACourseOriginalHourGeneticschromosomehtml The core is called a nucleosome and can be viewed under an electron microscope if the chromosome is dispersed The nucleosome consists of positively charge proteins called histones In the core are copies each of His A B and The dsDNA winds around the nucleosome core about times The dsDNA then links around other nucleosome in which each nucleosome is connected by a small section of interconnecting spacer DNA to which is bound another histone H Under an electron microscope the DNA looks like a bead on a string The beads are nucleosomes and the string is the dsDNA Figure Nucleosome top and side view Animation How DNA is packed Contributors and Attributions Prof Henry Jakubowski College of St BenedictSt Johns University

Attributions A number of egg products besides whole shell eggs are used in the baking and food service industry By law all egg products other than shell eggs are pasteurized to protect them against salmonella and the low temperature at which they are kept inhibits bacterial activity although under certain conditions they may spoil very rapidly The chief categories of egg products available are Liquid eggs whole eggs and whole eggs with additional yolks Frozen eggs whole eggs egg whites and egg yolks Dried and powdered eggs whole eggs egg whites and meringue powder Liquid and Frozen Eggs Liquid and frozen whole eggs are preferred in large bakeries where cracking and emptying of shells is not economical They are also one of the most economical ways of purchasing eggs Liquid and frozen whole eggs are sometimes fortified by the addition of egg yolks Some bakers feel that liquid or frozen eggs dont yield the same volume in sponge cakes as fresh eggs and there is a certain bias in favor of shell eggs If stored in the freezer at C F or lower liquid and frozen eggs will keep for long periods with minimum loss of quality Thawing should take place in the refrigerator or under cold water without submerging the container Leaving frozen eggs at room temperature to thaw is a bad practice because the outside layers of egg can reach a temperature favorable to bacteria while the centre is still frozen Heat should never be used to defrost eggs Unused portions must be refrigerated and used within hours Frozen egg yolks consist of egg yolks and sugar to prevent the yolk from gelling and to avoid separation of the fat SprayDried Whole Eggs and Egg Whites Dried eggs are used by some bakers as a convenience and cost saver As with frozen eggs some bakers doubt their performance in products such as sponge cakes But dried eggs produce satisfactory results because of the addition of a carbohydrate to the egg before the drying process usually corn syrup which results in foaming comparable to fresh eggs Dried whole eggs should be stored unopened in a cool place not over C F preferably in the refrigerator They are reconstituted by blending kg lb of powdered whole egg with kg lb of cold water The water is added slowly while mixing Once reconstituted dried eggs should be used immediately or refrigerated promptly and used within an hour In mixes such as muffins and cake doughnuts dried eggs can be mixed in with the other dry ingredients and do not have to be reconstituted In layer cake formulas dried eggs are blended with the other dry ingredients before the fat and some water are added followed by the balance of liquid in two stages Spraydried egg whites are reconstituted by mixing kg lb of powdered egg white with kg lb of cold water letting it stand for minutes and then adding kg lb of cold water When used in cake mixes the powdered egg white is blended with the other dry ingredients but only L qt of cold water is used for every kg lb of powdered egg white Chemistry of Cooking Dry Egg Substitutes or Replacements Egg substitutes are made from sweet cheese whey egg whites dextrose modified tapioca starch sodium caseinate and artificial color and flavor They are costcutters and can be used alone or in combination with fresh or dried eggs in cakes cookies and fillings One kg lb of powder is mixed with kg lb of water to replace powdered eggs

mandatory to have all eggs graded by the standards set by Agriculture and AgriFoods Canada AAFC The grade name appears on cartons The grades Canada A and Canada B bear the maple leaf symbol with the grade name inside and Canada C and Nest Run eggs will have the grade name printed in block text The grades indicate the quality of the egg and should not be confused with size Only Canada A are available in different sizes The average large size egg weighs about g oz as indicated in Table Table Canada Grade A egg sizes Size Weight including shell Peewee Less than g oz Small At least g oz Medium At least g oz Large At least g oz Extra Large At least g oz Jumbo g oz or more The Canada grade symbol does not guarantee that the eggs are of Canadian origin but it does guarantee that the products meet Canadian government standards Agriculture Canada inspects all eggprocessing plants to ensure that the products are wholesome and processed according to sanitary standards The pasteurization of packaged egg product is also monitored The criteria for grading eggs are Weight Cleanliness Soundness and shape of shell Shape and relative position of yolk within the egg Size of air cell free of abnormalities Freedom from dissolved yolk and blood spots Canada A Canada A eggs are clean normal in shape with sound shells and have the finest interior quality They are ideal for all uses The yolks are round and compact and surrounded by very thick firm albumen Canada A eggs are a premium quality and in limited supply on the retail market If eggs are not sold within a limited time unsold stocks are returned to the supplier Eggs graded as A must meet the minimum weight for the declared size see Table The size designation for Canada A eggs must appear on the label Canada B Canada B eggs have very slight abnormalities This grade is fine for baking where appearance is not important These eggs must weigh at least g oz There are no size designations on the label for Canada B eggs Canada C Canada C is considered a processing grade and provides a safe outlet for the disposition of cracked eggs Canada C eggs must be shipped to a federally registered processed egg station and pasteurized as a means of controlling the higher risk of salmonella or other microbial contamination that may be found in cracked eggs These eggs are suitable for processing into commercially frozen liquid and dried egg products Sizes are not specified Canada Nest Run Since Canada Nest Run eggs are generally sent for further processing they are usually not washed candled a process

Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Flavors cannot be considered a truly basic ingredient in bakery products but are important in producing the most desirable products Flavoring materials consist of Extracts or essences Emulsions Aromas Spices Note Salt may also be classed as a flavoring material because it intensifies other flavors These and others such as chocolate enable the baker to produce a wide variety of attractively flavored pastries cakes and other bakery products Flavor extracts essences emulsions and aromas are all solutions of flavor mixed with a solvent often ethyl alcohol The flavors used to make extracts and essences are the extracted essential oils from fruits herbs and vegetables or an imitation of the same Many fruit flavors are obtained from the natural parts eg rind of lemons and oranges or the exterior fruit pulp of apricots and peaches In some cases artificial flavor is added to enhance the taste and artificial coloring may be added for eye appeal Both the Canadian and US departments that regulate food restrict these and other additives The flavors are sometimes encapsulated in corn syrup and emulsifiers They may also be coated with gum to preserve the flavor compounds and give longer shelf life to the product Some of the most popular essences are compounded from both natural and artificial sources These essences have the true taste of the natural flavors Aromas are flavors that have an oil extract base They are usually much more expensive than alcoholic extracts but purer and finer in their aromatic composition Aromas are used for flavoring delicate creams sauces and ice creams Emulsions are homogenized mixtures of aromatic oils and water plus a stabilizing agent eg vegetable gum Emulsions are more concentrated than extracts and are less susceptible to losing their flavor in the oven They can therefore be used more sparingly

ADALCysteineAscorbic AcidCalcium PeroxideGlyceridesSodium Stearoyl LactylateContributors and Attributions A number of additives may be found in commercial flours from agents used as dough conditioners to others that aid in the fermentation process Why use so many additives Many of these products are complementary that is they work more effectively together and the end product is as close to ideal as possible Nevertheless in some countries the number of additives allowed in flour are limited For instance in Germany ascorbic acid remains the only permitted additive Some of the additives that are commonly added to flour include those described below Bromate Until the early s bromate was added to flour because it greatly sped up the oxidation or aging of flour Millers in Canada stopped using it after health concerns raised by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA In the United States bromate is allowed in some states but banned in others eg California Azodicarbonamide ADA Approved in the United States since but banned in Europe ADA falls under the food additives permitted in Canada ADA is a fastacting flour treatment resulting in a cohesive dry dough that tolerates high water absorption It is not a bleach but because it helps produce bread with a finer texture it gives an apparently whiter crumb It does not destroy any vitamins in the dough Bakers who want to know if their flours contain ADA or other chemical additives can request the information from their flour suppliers LCysteine An amino acid Lcysteine speeds up reactions within the dough thus reducing or almost eliminating bulk fermentation time In effect it gives the baker a notime dough It improves dough elasticity and gas retention Ascorbic Acid Ascorbic acid was first used as a bread improver in after it was noticed that old lemon juice added to dough gave better results because it improved gas retention and loaf volume Essentially vitamin C ascorbic acid has the advantage of being safe even if too much is added to the dough as the heat of baking destroys the vitamin component The addition of ascorbic acid consistent with artisan bread requirements is now routine for certain flours milled in North America Calcium Peroxide Calcium peroxide not to be confused with the peroxide used for bleaching flour is another doughmaturing agent Glycerides Glycerides are multipurpose additives used in both cake mixes and yeast doughs They are also known as surfactants which is a contraction for surfaceacting agents In bread doughs the main function of glycerides is as a crumbsoftening agent thus retarding bread staling Glycerides also have some dough strengthening properties Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate Approved for use in the United States since this additive improves gas retention shortens proofing time increases loaf volume and works as an antistaling agent Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez

American University Storing FlourFlour TestsColorAbsorptionGluten StrengthAsh ContentBaking QualityContributors and Attributions Flour forms the foundation for bread cakes and pastries It may be described as the skeleton which supports the other ingredients in a baked product This applies to both yeast and chemically leavened products The strength of flour is represented in protein gluten quality and quantity This varies greatly from flour to flour The quality of the protein indicates the strength and stability of the flour and the result in bread making depends on the method used to develop the gluten by proper handling during the fermentation Gluten is a rubberlike substance that is formed by mixing flour with water Before it is mixed it contains two proteins In wheat these two proteins are gliadin and glutenin Although we use the terms protein and gluten interchangeably gluten only develops once the flour is moistened and mixed The protein in the flour becomes gluten Hard spring wheat flours are considered the best for bread making as they have a larger percentage of good quality gluten than soft wheat flours It is not an uncommon practice for mills to blend hard spring wheat with hard winter wheat for the purpose of producing flour that combines the qualities of both Good bread flour should have about gluten Storing Flour Flour should be kept in a dry wellventilated storeroom at a fairly uniform temperature A temperature of about C F with a relative humidity of is considered ideal Flour should never be stored in a damp place Moist storerooms with temperatures greater than C F are conducive to mould growth bacterial development and rapid deterioration of the flour A wellventilated storage room is necessary because flour absorbs and retains odors For this reason flour should not be stored in the same place as onions garlic coffee or cheese all of which give off strong odors Flour Tests Wheat that is milled and blended with modern milling methods produce flours that have a fairly uniform quality all year round and if purchased from a reliable mill they should not require any testing for quality The teacher student and professional baker however should be familiar with qualitative differences in flours and should know the most common testing methods Flours are mainly tested for Color Absorption Gluten strength Baking quality Other tests done in a laboratory are done for Albumen Starch Sugar Dextrin Mineral and fat content Color The color of the flour has a direct bearing on baked bread providing that fermentation has been carried out properly The addition of other ingredients to the dough such as brown sugar malt molasses salt and colored margarine also affects the color of bread To test the color of the flour place a small quantity on a smooth glass and with a spatula work until a firm smooth mass about cm in square is formed The thickness should be about cm in at the back of the plate to a thin film at the front The test should be made in comparison with a flour of known grade and quality both flours being worked side by side on the same glass A creamy white color indicates a hard flour of good gluten quality A dark or greyish color indicates a poor grade of flour or the presence of dirt Bran specks indicate a low grade of flour After making a color comparison of the dry samples dip the glass on an angle into clean water and allow to partially dry Variations in color and the presence of bran specks are more easily identified in the damp samples Absorption Flours are tested for absorption because different flours absorb different amounts of water and therefore make doughs of different consistencies The absorption ability of a flour is usually between and To determine the absorption factor place a small quantity of flour g oz in a bowl Add water gradually from a beaker containing a known amount of water As the water is added mix with a spoon until the dough reaches the desired consistency You can knead the dough by hand for final mixing and determination of consistency Weigh the unused water Divide the weight of the water used by the weight of the flour used The result is the absorption ability in percentage For example Weight of flour used g oz Weight of water used g oz T therefore absorption or Prolonged storage in a dry place results in a natural moisture loss in flour and has a noticeable effect on the dough For example a sack of flour that originally weighed kg lb with a moisture content of may be reduced to kg lb during storage This means that kg lb of water is lost and must be made up when mixing The moisture content of the wheat used to make the flour is also important from an economic standpoint Hard wheat flour absorbs more liquid than soft flour Good hard wheat flour should feel somewhat granular when rubbed between the thumb and fingers A soft smooth feeling indicates a soft wheat flour or a blend of soft and hard wheat flour Another indicator is that hard wheat flour retains its form when pressed in the hollow of the hand and falls apart readily when touched Soft wheat flour tends to remain lumped together after pressure Gluten Strength The gluten test is done to find the variation of gluten quality and quantity in different kinds of flour Hard flour has more gluten of better quality than soft flour The gluten strength and quality of two different kinds of hard flour may also vary with the weather conditions and the place where the wheat is grown The difference may be measured exactly by laboratory tests or roughly assessed by the variation of gluten balls made from different kinds of hard flours For example to test the gluten in hard flour and allpurpose flour mix g oz of each in separate mixing bowls with enough water to make each dough stiff Mix and develop each dough until smooth Let the dough rest for about minutes Wash each dough separately while kneading it under a stream of cold water until the water runs clean and all the starch is washed out Keep a flour sieve in the sink to prevent dough pieces from being washed down the drain What remains will be crude gluten Shape the crude gluten into round balls then place them on a paperlined baking pan and bake at C F for about one hour The gluten ball made from the hard flour will be larger than the one made from allpurpose flour This illustrates the ability of hard flour to produce a greater volume because of its higher gluten content Ash Content Ash or mineral content of flour is used as another measurement of quality Earlier in the chapter we talked about extraction rates as an indicator of how much of the grain has been refined Ash content refers to the amount of ash that would be left over if you were to burn g of flour A higher ash content indicates that the flour contains more of the germ bran and outer endosperm Lower ash content means that the flour is more highly refined ie a lower extraction rate Baking Quality The final and conclusive test of any flour is the kind of bread that can be made from it The baking test enables the baker to check on the completed loaf that can be expected from any given flour Good volume is related to good quality gluten poor volume to young or green flour Flour that lacks stability or power to hold during the entire fermentation may result in small flat bread Flour of this type may sometimes respond to an increase in the amount of yeast More yeast shortens the fermentation time and keeps the dough in better condition during the pan fermentation period Contributors and

procedures produce many different flour streams approximately that vary in quality and chemical analysis These are combined into four basic streams of edible flour with four other streams going to feed Top patent flour This stream is composed of only the purest and most highly refined streams from the mill It is low in ash and is approximately of the flour extracted The term ash indicates the mineral content eg phosphorus of the flour When flour is burned all that is left is the burned mineral elements that constitute ash Second patent flour This flour is composed of streams with an intermediate degree of refinement It has an average ash content of approximately and represents about of the total flour First clear flour This stream contains the balance of the flour that possesses baking properties and is high in ash and protein content It is usually about of the total flour Second clear flour This grade contains the poorest flour streams It is very high in ash approximately and has little or no baking quality It is about of the total flour Feed streams The balance of the streams from the mill are classed as feed Feeds are marketed as bran wheat shorts flour middlings and wheat germ Within the streams of edible flours there are a number of different types of flour used in food preparation Each has different characteristics and with those come different uses as described below AllPurpose Flour General purpose or home use flours are usually a blend of hard spring wheats that are lower in protein gluten content than bread flours They are top patent flours and contain sufficient protein to make good yeast breads yet not too much for good quick breads cakes and cookies Note A word about gluten quality as opposed to gluten quantity The fact that a particular flour contains a high quantity of protein say to does not necessarily mean that it is of high quality It may contain too much ash or too much damaged starch to warrant this classification High quality is more important in many bread applications than high quantity Allpurpose flour is an example of a highquality flour with a protein content of about Graham Flour A US patented flour graham flour is a combination of whole wheat flour slightly coarser with added bran and other constituents of the wheat kernel Bread Flour Bread flour is milled from blends of hard spring and hard winter wheats They average about protein and are slightly granular to the touch This type of flour is sold chiefly to bakers because it makes excellent bread with bakery equipment but has too much protein for home use It is also called strong flour or hard flour and is second patent flour For example the specification sheet on bread flour produced by a Canadian miller might include the following information Ingredients Wheat flour amylase ascorbic acid niacin iron thiamine mononitrate riboflavin azodicarbonamide folic acid Moisture Ash Protein x N Along with this information there is microbiological data and an allergen declaration Note that the formula in parentheses beside Protein is simply the laboratorys way of deriving the protein figure from the nitrogen content Cake Flour Cake flour is milled from soft winter wheats The protein content is about and the granulation is so uniform and fine that the flour feels satiny An exception is a highprotein cake flour formulated especially for fruited pound cakes to prevent the fruit from sinking Clear Flour Clear flour comes from the part of the wheat berry just under the outer covering Comparing it to first patent flour is like comparing cream to skim milk It is dark in colour and has a very high gluten content It is used in rye and other breads requiring extra strength Gluten Flour Gluten flour is made from wheat flour by removing a large part of the starch It contains no more than moisture and no more than starch Pastry Flour Pastry flour is made from either hard or soft wheat but more often from soft It is fairly low in protein and is finely milled but not so fine as cake flour It is unsuitable for yeast breads but ideal for cakes pastries cookies and quick breads SelfRising Flour Selfrising flour has leavening and salt added to it in controlled amounts at the mill Wheat Germ Flour Wheat germ flour consists entirely of the little germ or embryo part of the wheat separated from the rest of the kernel and flattened into flakes This flour should be refrigerated Whole Wheat Flour Whole wheat flour contains all the natural parts of the wheat kernel up to of the total weight of the wheat It contains more protein than allpurpose flour and produces heavier products because of the bran particles Whole Wheat Pastry Flour Whole wheat pastry flour is milled from the entire kernel of soft wheat is low in gluten and is suitable for pastry cakes and cookies Hovis Flour Most of the germ goes away with the shorts and only a small fraction of the total quantity can be recovered in a fairly pure form At the mill a special process developed in England to improve its keeping qualities and flavour cooks this fraction It is then combined with white flour to make Hovis flour which produces a loaf that though small for its weight has a rich distinctive flavour Triticale Flour The worlds first new grain triticale is a hybrid of wheat and rye It combines the best qualities of both grains It is now grown commercially in Manitoba Semolina Semolina is the granular product consisting of small fragments of the endosperm of the durum wheat kernel The equivalent particles from other hard wheat are called farina The commonest form of semolina available commercially is the breakfast cereal Cream of Wheat NoTime Flour The primary goal of all bakers has been to reduce production time and keep costs to a minimum without losing quality flavour or structure After extensive research millers have succeeded in eliminating bulk fermentation for both sponge and straight dough methods Notime flour is flour with additives such as ascorbic acid bromate and cysteine It saves the baker time and labour and reduces floor spac requirements The baker can use his or her own formulas with only minor adjustments Blending Flours Blending of flours is done at the mill and such is the sophistication of the analysis and testing of flours test baking etc that when problems occur it is generally the fault of the baker and not the product Today the millers and their chemists ensure that bakers receive the high grade of flour that they need to produce marketable products for a qualityconscious consumer Due to the vagaries of the weather and its effect on growing conditions the quality of the grain that comes into the mill is hardly ever constant For example if damp weather occurs at harvest time the grain may start to sprout and will cause what is known as damaged starch Through analysis and adjustments in grain handling and blending the miller is able to furnish a fairly constant product Bakers do blend flours however A portion of soft flour may be blended with the bread flour to reduce the toughness of a Danish pastry or sweet dough for example Gluten flour is commonly used in multigrain bread to boost the aeration

Attributions In addition to types of flour you may come across various other terms when purchasing flour These include some terms that refer to the processing and treatment of the flour and others outlining some of the additives that may be added during the milling and refining process Bleached Bleaching and maturing agents are added to whiten and improve the baking quality quickly making it possible to market the freshest flour Even fine wheat flours vary in colour from yellow to cream when freshly milled At this stage the flour produces doughs that are usually sticky and do not handle well Flour improves with age under proper storage conditions up to one year both in color and quality Because storing flour is expensive toward the close of the th century millers began to treat freshly milled flour with oxidizing agents to bleach it and give it the handling characteristics of naturally aged flour Under the category of maturing agents are included materials such as chlorine dioxide chlorine gas plus a small amount of nitrosyl chloride ammonium persulfate and ascorbic acid No change occurs in the nutritional value of the flour when these agents are present There are two classes of material used to bleach flour A common one an organic peroxide reacts with the yellow pigment only and has no effect on gluten quality Chlorine dioxide the most widely used agent in North America neutralizes the yellow pigment and improves the gluten quality It does however destroy the tocopherols vitamin E complex Enriched Iron and three of the most necessary B vitamins thiamin riboflavin and niacin which are partially removed during milling are returned to white flour by a process known as enrichment No change occurs in taste colour texture baking quality or caloric value of the flour Presifted During the milling process flour is sifted many times through microfine silk This procedure is known as presifting The mesh size used for sifting varies from flour to flour There are more holes per square inch for cake flour than for example bread flour so that a cup of cake flour has significantly more minute particles than does a cup of bread flour is liable to be denser and weigh slightly more Sifted flour yields more volume in baked bread than does unsifted flour simply because of the increased volume of air Contributors and Attributions Sorangel

the various functions of fat in baking Tenderizing Agents Used in suﬃcient quantity fats tend to shorten the gluten strands in flour hence their name shortenings Traditionally the best example of such fat was lard Creaming Ability This refers to the extent to which fat when beaten with a paddle will build up a structure of air pockets This aeration or creaming ability is especially important for cake baking the better the creaming ability the lighter the cake Plastic Range Plastic range relates to the temperature at which the fatty acid component melts and over which shortening will stay workable and will stretch without either cracking too cold or softening too warm A fat that stays plastic over a temperature range of C to C F to F would be rated as excellent A dough made with such a fat could be taken from the walkin cooler to the bench in a hot bakeshop and handled interchangeably Butter on the other hand does not have a good plastic range it is almost too hard to work at C F and too soft at C F Lubrication In dough making the fat portion makes it easier for the gluten network to expand The dough is also easier to mix and to handle This characteristic is known as lubrication Moistening Ability Whether in dough or in a cake batter fat retards drying out For this purpose a fat shortening will be superior to either butter or margarine Nutrition As one of the three major food categories fats provide a very concentrated source of energy They contain many of the fatty acids essential for health Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez

Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Fermentation Dough ConditioningFlavorContributors and Attributions Salt has three major functions in baking It affects Fermentation Dough and conditioning Flavor Fermentation Fermentation is salts major function Salt slows the rate of fermentation acting as a healthy check on yeast development Salt prevents the development of any objectionable bacterial action or wild types of fermentation Salt assists in oven browning by controlling the fermentation and therefore lessening the destruction of sugar Salt checks the development of any undesirable or excessive acidity in the dough It thus protects against undesirable action in the dough and effects the necessary healthy fermentation required to secure a finished product of high quality Dough Conditioning Salt has a binding or strengthening effect on gluten and thereby adds strength to any flour The additional firmness imparted to the gluten by the salt enables it to hold the water and gas better and allows the dough to expand without tearing This influence becomes particularly important when soft water is used for dough mixing and where immature flour must be used Under both conditions incorporating a maximum amount of salt will help prevent soft and sticky dough Although salt has no direct bleaching effect its action results in a finegrained loaf of superior texture This combination of finer grain and thin cell walls gives the crumb of the loaf a whiter appearance Flavor One of the important functions of salt is its ability to improve the taste and flavor of all the foods in which it is used Salt is one ingredient that makes bread taste so good Without salt in the dough batch the resulting bread would be flat and insipid The extra palatability brought about by the presence of salt is only partly due to the actual taste of the salt itself Salt has the peculiar ability to intensify the flavor created in bread as a result of yeast action on the other ingredients in the loaf It brings out the characteristic taste and flavor of bread and indeed of all foods Improved palatability in turn promotes the digestibility of food so it can be said that salt enhances the nutritive value of bakery products The lack of salt or too much of it is the first thing noticed when tasting bread In some bread can produce a decidedly salty taste while in others the same amount gives a good taste The difference is often due to the mineralization of the water used in the dough Contributors and Attributions

that forms a gel in contact with water There are two main categories Thermoreversible gel A gel that melts upon reheating and sets upon cooling Examples are gelatin and agar agar Thermoirreversible gel A gel that does not melt upon reheating Examples are cornstarch and pectin Excessive heating however may cause evaporation of the water and shrinkage of the gel Hydrocolloids do not hydrate or dissolve instantly and that hydration is associated with swelling which easily causes lumping It is therefore necessary to disperse hydrocolloids in water Classically this has always been done with cornstarch where a portion of the liquid from the recipe is mixed to form a slurry before being added to the cooking liquid This can also be done with an immersion blender or a conventional blender or by mixing the hydrocolloid with a helping agent such as sugar oil or alcohol prior to dispersion in water Starches Starch gelatinization is the process where starch and water are subjected to heat causing the starch granules to swell As a result the water is gradually absorbed in an irreversible manner This gives the system a viscous and transparent texture The result of the reaction is a gel which is used in sauces puddings creams and other food products providing a pleasing texture Starchbased gels are thermoirreversible meaning that they do not melt upon heating unlike gelatin which we will discuss later Excessive heating however may cause evaporation of the water and shrinkage of the gel The most common examples of starch gelatinization are found in sauce and pasta preparations and baked goods In sauces starches are added to liquids usually while heating The starch will absorb liquid and swell resulting in the liquid becoming thicker The type of starch determines the ﬁnal product Some starches will remain cloudy when cooked others will remain clear Pasta is made mostly of semolina wheat durum wheat ﬂour which contains high amounts of starch When pasta is cooked in boiling water the starch in the pasta swells as it absorbs water and as a result the texture of the pasta softens Starch molecules make up the majority of most baked goods so starch is an important part of the structure Although starches by themselves generally cant support the shape of the baked items they do give bulk to the structure Starches develop a softer structure when baked than proteins do The softness of the crumb of baked bread is due largely to the starch The more protein structure there is the chewier the bread Starches can be fairly straightforward extracts of plants such as cornstarch tapioca or arrowroot but there are also modiﬁed starches and pregelatinized starches available that have speciﬁc uses See Table for a list of diﬀerent thickening and binding agents and their characteristics Table Common starches and gels used in the bakeshop Starch or Gel Ratio Preparation Characteristics and Uses Cornstarch g starch thickens L liquid A slurry mixture of cornstarch and water is mixed and added to a simmering liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens or Cornstarch mixed with sugar and cold liquid added Thickened mixture simmered until no starch taste remains Used to thicken sauces when a clear glossy texture is desired such as dessert sauces and in Asianinspired dishes Translucent thickens further as it cools forms a sliceable gel Sensitive to extended heat exposure so products become thin if held at heat for long periods of time Agar agar g agar agar sets L liquid Powder dissolved in cold water Added to cold or simmering liquid Activates with heat sets when cold Extracted from seaweed Used in Asian desserts and molecular gastronomy cooking Used in place of gelatin in vegetarian dishes Clear ﬁrm texture Does not thin when reheated thickens more when cold Waxy maize waxy rice Dissolved in cold water g starch thickens L liquid Added to hot liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens Used in desserts and dessert sauces Clear does not thicken further as it cools Does not gel at cool temperatures good for cold sauces Quite stable at extreme temperatures heat and freezing Modiﬁed starches Dissolved in cold water g starch thickens L liquid Added to hot liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens Modiﬁed starches are often used in commercially processed foods and convenience products Modiﬁed to improve speciﬁc characteristics eg stability or texture under extreme conditions heat and freezing Translucent thickens further as it cools Pregelatinized starches Powder dissolved in cold liquid g starch thickens L liquid Added to liquid at any temperature Used when thickening liquids that might lose color or ﬂavor during cooking Become viscous without the need for additional cooking Translucent fairly clear shiny does NOT gel when cold Arrowroot Powder dissolved in cold liquid g starch thickens L liquid Added to hot liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens Derived from cassava root Used in Asian cuisines Very clear possesses a gooey texture Translucent shiny very light gel when cold Gelatin g gelatin sets L liquid Powder or sheets leaves dissolved in cold water Added to cold or simmering liquid Activates with heat sets when cold Derived from collagens in bones and meats of animals Used in aspic glazes cold sauces and desserts Clear ﬁrm texture Dissolves when reheated thickens when cold Gelling agents Gelatin is a watersoluble protein extracted from animal tissue and used as a gelling agent a thickener an emulsiﬁer a whipping agent a stabilizer and a substance that imparts a smooth mouth feel to foods It is thermoreversible meaning the setting properties or action can be reversed by heating Gelatin is available in two forms powder and sheet leaf Gelatin is often used to stabilize whipped cream and mousses confectionery such as gummy bears and marshmallows desserts including pannacotta commercial products like JellO lite or lowfat versions of foods including some margarines and dairy products such as yogurt and ice cream Gelatin is also used in hard and soft gel capsules for the pharmaceutical industry Agar agar is an extract from red algae and is often used to stabilize emulsions or foams and to thicken or gel liquids It is thermoreversible and heat resistant It is typically hydrated in boiling liquids and is stable across a wide range of acidity levels It begins to gel once it cools to around ºC ºF and will not melt until it reaches ºC ºF Pectin Pectin is taken from citrus and other tree fruits apples pears etc Pectin is found in many different foods such as jam milkbased beverages jellies sweets and fruit juices Pectin is also used in molecular gastronomy mainly as a gelling agent thickener and stabilizer There are a variety of types of pectin that react diﬀerently according to the ingredients used Lowmethoxyl pectin which is activated with the use of calcium for gelling and highmethoxyl pectin that requires sugar for thickening are the two most common types used in cooking Highmethoxyl pectin is what is traditionally used to make jams and jellies Lowmethoxyl pectin is often used in modern cuisine due to the thermoirreversible gel that it forms and its good reaction to calcium Its natural capability to emulsify and gel creates stable preparations Increasingly cooks bakers and pastry chefs are turning to many diﬀerent gels chemicals and other substances used in commercial food processing as new ingredients to modify liquids or other foods These will be

plants that do not have a woody stem Herbs are available fresh or dried with fresh herbs having a more subtle flavor than dried You need to add a larger quantity of fresh herbs up to more than dry herbs to get the same desired flavor Conversely if a recipe calls for a certain amount of fresh herb you would use about onehalf of that amount of dry herb The most common fresh herbs are basil coriander marjoram oregano parsley rosemary sage tarragon and thyme Fresh herbs should have a clean fresh fragrance and be free of wilted or brown leaves They can be kept for about five days if sealed inside an airtight plastic bag Fresh herbs are usually added near the completion of the cooking process so flavors are not lost due to heat exposure Dried herbs lose their power rather quickly if not properly stored in airtight containers They can last up to six months if properly stored Dried herbs are usually added at the start of the cooking process as their flavor takes longer to develop than

Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper Cut Site Selection by the Two Nuclease Domains of the Cas RNAguided Endonuclease Hongfan Chen Jihoon Choi and Scott BaileyThe Journal of Biological Chemistry Background and Review A promising tool for genome manipulation and regulation in a wide variety of organisms has recently been identified in the RNAguided DNA endonuclease activity of the CRISPRCas clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatCRISPRassociated system CRISPRCas an inheritable prokaryotic immune system protects bacteria and archaea against mobile genetic elements via RNAguided target silencing CRISPRCas systems consist of an array of short direct repeats interspersed by variable invaderderived sequences spacers and a cas operon During invasion small fragments of the invading DNA from phage or plasmids protospacers are incorporated into host CRISPR loci transcribed and processed to generate small CRISPR RNAs crRNA The invading nucleic acid is then recognized and silenced by Cas proteins guided by the crRNAs There are three types of CRISPRCas system each characterized by the presence of a signature gene Programmed DNA cleavage requires the fewest components in the type II CRISPRCas system requiring only crRNA a transactivating crRNA tracrRNA and the Cas endonuclease the signature gene of the type II system The system can be further simplified by fusing the mature crRNA and tracrRNA into a single guide RNA sgRNA In addition to its role in target cleavage tracrRNA also mediates crRNA maturation by forming RNA hybrids with primary crRNA transcripts leading to coprocessing of both RNAs by endogenous RNase III Cas contains two nuclease domains that together generate a doublestrand ds break in target DNA The HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand and the RuvClike nuclease domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand A short signature sequence named the protospacer adjacent motif PAM is characteristic of the invading DNA targeted by the type I and type II CRISPRCas systems The PAM serves two functions It has been linked to the acquisition of new spacer sequences and it is necessary for the subsequent recognition and silencing of target DNA The sequence length and position of the PAM vary depending on the CRISPRCas type and organism PAMs from type II systems are located downstream of the protospacer and contain bp of conserved sequence A variable sequence of up to bp separates the conserved sequence of the PAM from the protospacer This variable region is often included in the definition of the PAM sequence but for simplicity we refer to this variable region as the linker and the conserved sequence as the PAM To date Cas from Streptococcus pyogenes Cas from Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC and Cas from Neisseria meningitidis have been employed as tools for genome editing or regulation For these Cas orthologs the PAMs are GG GGNG and GATT and the linkers are and bp respectively The simplicity of sgRNA design and sequencespecific targeting means the RNAguided Cas machinery has great potential for programmable genome engineering Cas can be employed to generate mutations in cells by introducing dsDNA breaks The capabilities of Cas can be expanded to various genome engineering purposes such as transcription repression or activation with its nickase generated by inactivating one of its two nuclease domains or nuclease null variants Another appealing possibility for the Cas system is to target different Casmediated activities to multiple target sites for example transcriptional repression of one gene but activation of another To achieve this multiple Cas orthologs will need to be employed as a single ortholog cannot concurrently mediate different activities at multiple sites Therefore to broaden our understanding of Cas proteins we have characterized the Cas ortholog from S thermophilus LMG which we refer to as LMG Cas Questions Investigators studied the type II CRISPRCas system of S thermophilus LMG a Figure A shows a Coomassie Bluestained SDSpolyacrylamide gel of Cas Cas DA Cas DA and Cas DADA where D is aspartic acid and A is alanine and DA reflects the site of the specific mutation where D was changed to A Why did they perform this experiment b To confirm the PAM sequence for LMG Cas the authors performed BLAST searches to identify potential protospacers in viral and plasmid genomes that matched any of the spacer sequences from CRISPR This search generated unique target sequences from the genomes of bacteriophage known to infect S thermophilus We then aligned nucleotide segments from the identified target genomes inclusive of the nucleotide protospacer and nucleotide flanking regions Figure b shows B logo plot revealing the PAM for LMG Cas The positions of the protospacer PAM and linker are indicated What is the most likely consensus sequence of the PAM sequence How far is it away from the protospacer c Figure C shows a schematic representation of the CRISPR nucleic acid complexes Label the target DNA crRNA tracrRNA protospacer PAM and linker Draw in a connecting piece of RNA if you wish to create a single guide RNA containing both the crRNA and tracRNA What is the specific PAM sequence in this figure To confirm that the identified PAM was functional investigators needed a selection system They used a transformation assay in which E coli cells containing an exogenous type II CRISPRCas system were resistant to plasmid transformation whereas cells lacking the system are competent for transformation Explain how this system could be used to determine if specific PAM are functional a Figure A shows a schematic representation of transformation assay The target plasmid contained protospacer whose sequence was identical to the first spacer of CRISPR a bp linker and the identified PAM The first control plasmid contained only protospacer whereas the second control plasmid lacked both protospacer and PAM The target and control plasmids were then used to transformed cells in the presence of IPTG and the appropriate antibiotics Why did the investigators add IPTG

RuvClike domain while the HA mutant was in the HNH domain Explain the results What effect does the double mutant have on the activity e In Figure E the authors studied which domain was involved in the cleavage of each strand complementary to the guide DNA or the noncomplementary strand of the target DNA The dsDNA was radiolabeled at the end of the complementary strand left hand gel or the noncomplementary strand right hand gel Reactions were performed as in A and products were separated by denaturing PAGE The cleavage sites are indicated with arrows in the schematic diagram bottom nt nucleotides nt nucleotides Interpret the results f Do mutations in the PAM or changes in linker length have the same effect on DNA interference in vitro as they did in vivo The investigators monitored

the mutational analysis they substituted asparatic acid for alanine Draw the structures of the side chains of D and A Why did they choose A to substitute for D What role might D have in catalysis in the wildtype protein To evaluate whether other divalent cations besides Mg can activate DNA cleavage by Cas the authors performed plasmid cleavage assays in the presence of one of the following divalent cations Ca Mn Co Ni and Cu a Figure A shows cleavage of a target plasmid by Cas with either no metal or mm of the indicated metal ions All reactions were treated with mm EDTA prior to metal addition Interpret the results b To identify which domain was activated we assayed the single active site mutants of Cas DA or HA in a reaction buffer containing Ca In both panels the positions of negatively supercoiled nSC linear L and nicked or open circle OC plasmid are indicated The linear control is a digestion of the plasmid target with the restriction enzyme AgeI To determine the effect of PAM sequence and linker length on binding of LMG Cas to DNA targets the authors determined the binding affinity Kd of the CassgRNA complex to endlabeled dsDNA targets using native gel electrophoresis a Why did they not include SDS in the gel b Binding experiments were conducted with the nucleasedeficient mutant of Cas DAHA in the presence of Mg Fixed concentrations of the dsDNA

Biological Chemistry March doi jbcM BACKGROUND Doublestanded DNA is a polyanion as every phosphate in the backbone is negatively charged To pack it into chromosome in the nucleus DNA is complexed to a variety of proteins In the first stage of packing DNA is wound around a core of positively charged histones protein forming a nucleosome The size of the nucleosome is about the size of RNA polymerase Nucleosome Jmol Java JSMol HTML A For RNA polymerase to transcribe DNA that is packed in a nucleosome what must likely happen to the nucleosome complex The DNA must unwind from the histone core of then nucleosome to allow binding of transcription factors and ultimately RNA polymerase to the regulatory regions of the DNA promoter etc Otherwise DNAdependent RNA polymerization will not occur B The phenotype of a cell depends on the DNA sequence of the cell and the subset of genes that are expressed by that cell The emerging field of epigenetics describes how factors other than the DNA sequence control cell phenotype and heritability of traits Key features in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription are chromatin remodeling packing and covalent modification of DNA Chromatin packing at the level of DNAhistone interactions are critical Key to these interactions are the state of covalent modification of lysine K side chains in protein by histone acetylases HATs which are also called lysine acetylases KATs and histone deacetylases HDACs Two chemical modifications of lysine side chains in histones are shown below a Offer a chemical explanation of why structure b will not be acetylated by KAT b What affect might KAT modification of histone lysine side chains have on transcriptional competency of DNA in nucleosomes Naphthoquinone derivatives are naturally occurring compounds that are present in the Plumbago and Diospyros plant genera and have a variety of biological activities One such derivative plumbagin is a potent inhibitor of a particular lysine acetyltransferase KAT p lysine acetyltransferases BA pCBP Some of the inhibitors are toxic to cells as they react with free RSH groups in cells and generate reactive oxygen species ROS An ideal drug would be nontoxic and an effective inhibitoractivator of a specific enzyme Investigators synthesized a derivative PTK of plumbagin which inhibit p and with much lower toxicity that plumbagin How does it work Fig A To study the toxicity of plumbagin investigators dissolved it in the solvent DMSO Nacetylcysteine NAC which scavenges ROS They added these reagents to three different human cells lines SHSYY HEK and HeLa S as shown below a What effect did plumbagin have on cell toxicity b What effect did NAC have plumbagin cell effects c What did the investigators conduct an experiment just DMSO alone Fig B It has been shown that on DNA oxidative damage or breaks one of the histones HAX is phosphorylated by a kinase pIK Cells were treated as describe below Plu plumbagin_ and subjected to SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis After the electrophoresis a nitrocellluose membrane was placed on top and the proteins in the gel were electrophoresed into the membrane a technique called Western blotting Individual protein band were visualized by adding antibodies that recognized phosphorylated HAXg or histone H without modification followed by reagents that produce a dark band Interpret the results Why did the investigators do blots for unmodified H Fig C What affect did plumbagin have on histone acetylation Immuoblots were performed after plumbagin treatment in the presence or absence of NAC in the indicated cell lines as above using antibodies that recognized acetylated Lys on H HK or histone H without modfication Does Plu inhibit HK acetylation How does NAC affect Plumbagin effect on acetylation Fig D Another inhibitor of HK acetylation isogarcinol IsoGar was studied by western blotting Did NAC have same effect on HK acetylation of cells treated with IsoGAr as those treated with Plu shown in Fig C NAC seems to behave differently in the presence of two acetylation inhibitors These results offer two possibilities for its effects ROS could lead to decrease acetylation of histones and NAC by decreasing ROS restore acetylation Alternatively plumbagin reacts with the RSH of NAC which decreases it effect on KAT and restores acetylation Draw cartoon models that would reflect these two different scenarios using a line with an arrow to indicate activation or promotion of an activity and a line with a blunt end to show inhibition Also use and these symbols Investigators found no increase in ROS with purified KAT in a cell free in vitro produced no free radicals Which of your models is more likely Fig AB To simplify study of these effects the investigators performed in vitro cell free assays in which no ROS superoxide hydrogen peroxide would be produced They studied two different KATs p A and CBP B using HeLa cell core histones with μm plumbagin lanes in A and B either in the presence or absence of NAC DTT and another reducing agent Trolox lane Interpret the results What part of NAC and DTT appear important in their effects on plumbagin inhibition Fig A These data suggest a chemical reaction of NAC and DTT with plumgartin The generic structure of Naphthoquinone derivatives including plumgartin are shown below along with NAC and DTT Fig B The thiol group on NAC is likely to react with a sp C ultimately leading to a product which retains conjugation if possible Draw a mechanism showing how NAC might react with the structure below and show the final products Fig A A variety of Naphthoquinone derivatives were tested to see their effect on p activity in the presence and absence of NAC One lawsone whose structure is given below showed no inhibitory effects as shown below Give a likely chemical explanation for this observation Fig C If they reacted with free thiols then the naphthoquinone derivatives should have an effect on the concentration of free thiols in an in vitro assays Results of one such assay are shown below Compare this graph with the proceeding one What conclusion can you draw Fig not shown The authors used UVVis and fluorescence spectroscopy to study the effect of NAC on the spectra of naphthoquinone analogs What likely effects would you expect to observe on the spectrum of lawsone Fig A The ultimate goal of the investigators was to make a naphthoquinone derivative that was not cytotoxic which presumably results from its interactions with free thiols They synthesized PTK as shown below Why would this reaction produce a potential inhibitor that did not react with free thols in cells FIGURE B Investigators studied the effects of PTK on P acetylation of HeLa core histones with different concentrations of PTK in the absence and presence of NAC Figure B as well the presence of free thiol in the presence or absence of PTK Figure C What can you conclude from these graphs Figure D The figure below shows the UVvisible absorption spectrum of PTK in the in presence or absence of NAC What conclusions can you draw Fig E The figure below shows immunoblotting analysis IB of cell lysates upon h of treatment by PTK using HK acetylation antibodies The concentrations of PTK used are indicated in the figure E Error bars SD What conclusions can you draw from the blots How might PTK inhibit p KAT activity Enzyme kinetic analyses would be useful The enzyme has two substates acetyl CoA and histones Previous studies have shown that substrates bind to p in an ordered mechanism The noncompetitive inhibitor PTK could bind to the free enzyme as well as to the substratebound form resulting in an abortive ternary complex T Presume that added reversible inhibitors behavior in a similar fashion with single and multisubstrate reactions Here are some simple rules that apply to double reciprocal plots v vs S when substrate is kept constant The slope changes when I and S bind to the same form of the enzyme for example E binds both S and I OR I binds to a form of E on the horizontal line which is connected to the form that S binds and I binds first for example I binds to E and then S binds The Y intercept changes when I and S bind to different forms of the enzyme unless I binds first and the binding of I and S are in rapid equilibrium Figure AB Figure A and B below show double reciprocal or LineweaverBurk plots v vs S of p KAT with one substrate fixed and the other varying at different fixed concentrations of inhibitor PTK In Figure A the concentration of core histones was kept constant at μm while increasing the concentration of isotope labeled HacetylCoA from to μm either in the absence no inhibitor or increasing concentrations of PTK and μm The direction of increasing inhibitor concentration is shown by the red arrow In Figure B inhibition of p KAT activity by PTK was studied at a fixed concentration of HacetylCoA μm and increasing concentrations of core histones nm either in the absence of no inhibitor or increasing concentrations of PTK and μm By analogy with single substrate reactions shown below in the linked chemical equations which type of inhibition is displayed by PTK Answer Key Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Honey is a natural food essentially an invert sugar Bees gather nectar and through the enzyme invertase change it into honey Honey varies in composition and flavor depending on the source of the nectar The average

extracted from the comb and strained It is the type used by most bakers Creamed honey has a certain amount of crystallized honey added to liquid honey to give body to the final product Chunk honey consists of pieces of comb honey as well as liquid Granulated honey has been crystallized In the United States honey categories are based on color from white to dark amber Honey from orange blossom is

observable vs denaturant determine the DG in the absence of denaturant for the N to D transition from a graph of an observable vs T determine the DG DH and DS at a given temperature for the N to D transition HOW TO CALCULATE DGO FOR FROM PROTEIN DENATURATION CURVES Multiple methods can be used to investigate the denaturation of a protein These include UV fluorescence CD and viscosity measurement In all these methods the dependent variable y is measured as a function of the independent variable which is often temperature for thermal denaturation curves or denaturant such as urea guanidine hydrochloride concentration From these curves we would like to calculate the standard free energy of unfolding DGO for the protein for the reaction The denaturation curves usually show a sigmoidal cooperative transition from the native to the denatured state The dependent variable can also be normalized to show fractional denaturation fD An idealized example of an experimental denaturation curve is shown in the figure below Figure DENATURATION CURVE FOR PROTEINS A more realistic denaturation curve might show a linear change in the values of the dependent variable fluorescence intensity for example for values of temperature or denaturant concentration well below that at which the protein starts to unfold or above that at which it is unfolded In these cases the mathematical analysis presented below is a bit more complicated For each curve the value of y either A Fluorescence intensity viscosity etc can be thought of as the sum contributed by the native state and from the denatured state which are present in different fractional concentrations from Hence the following equation should be reasonably intuitive where fN is the fraction native and yN is the contribution to the dependent variable y from the native state and fD is the fraction denatured and yD is the contribution to the dependent variable y from the denatured state Conservation give equation Substituting into gives Rearranging this equation gives Notice the right hand side of the equations contains variables that are easily measured By substituting and into the expression for the equilibrium constant for the reaction we get or and Remember that DGOand hence Keq depends only on the intrinsic stability of the native vs denatured state for a given set of conditions They vary as a function of temperature and solvent conditions At low temperature and low ureaguanidine HCl concentration the native state is favored and for the transition DGO ie denaturation is NOT favored At high temperature and ureaguanidine HCl concentration the denatured state is favored and DGO At some value of temperature or ureaguanidine concentration both the native and denatured state would be equally favored At this point Keq and DGO If temperature is the denaturing agent the temperature at this point is called the melting point Tm of the protein which is analogous to the Tm in the heat capacity vs temperature graphs for the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles Figure gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles Figure gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles Ordinarily at a temperature much below the Tm for the protein or at a low urea concentration so little of the protein would be in the D state that it would be extremely difficult to determine the concentration of the protein in the D state Hence it would be difficult to determine the Keq or DGo for the reaction However in the range where the protein denatures either with urea or increasing temperature it is possible to measure fDfNand hence D Go at each urea or temperature Denaturation with chemical perturbants such as urea Calculation of DGo for in the absence of urea A plot of DGo vs urea is linear and given by the following equation which should be evident from the beginning figure in this section b DGD DGDwo urea murea Although it is nice to know the Keq and DG for the transition in the presence of various urea concentrations it would be even more useful to determine those parameters in the absence of urea that is under physiological conditions A comparison of the calculated values of DG in the absence of urea for a series of similar proteins such as those varying by a single amino acid prepared by sitespecific mutagenesis of the normal or wildtype gene would indicate how the mutants were stabilized or destabilized compared to the wildtype protein In experimental cases in which the denaturant is a substance such as urea or guanidine HCl the DGD for the protein in the absence of denaturant ie in water can be determined by extrapolating the straight line to urea Admittedly this is a long extrapolation but with high quality data and a high correlation coefficient for the linear regression analysis of the bestfit line reasonable values can be obtained Denaturation with heat Calculation of DHo and DSo for at room temperature Keq values can be calculated from thermal denaturation curves in the same way as described above using urea as a denaturant by monitoring change in an observable spectra signal for example vs temperature Knowing Keq denoted KD below since at the moment my program wont allow me to change it and DH DS can be calculated from equation below as a semilog plot of lnKeq vs T is a straight line with a slope of DHR and a y intercept of DSR or Hence from Equations and is should be evident that all the major thermodynamics constants DG DH and DS for the transition can be calculated from thermal denaturation curves Equation shows that the derivative of equation with respect to T ie the slope of equation plotted as lnKD vs T is indeed DHR Equation is the van t Hoff equation and the calculated value of the enthalpy change is termed the van t Hoff enthalpy DHvHoff Equation calculates the derivative of lnKeq with respect to T instead of T This method assumes that the denaturation is cooperative no intermediates and that DH is independent of temperature over the narrow range of temperature in which the protein cooperatively unfolds This equation will be useful later when we compare the enthalpies calculated using the van t Hoff equation with those determined directly using differential scanning calorimetry by analyzing a plot of Cp vs T Note that the area under the Cp vs T curve as the protein transitions to the unfolded state has units of kcal The DH for the unfolding is inversely proportional to the width of the curve In contrast to the long extrapolation of the DG vs urea to urea to get DG the y intercept in the absence of urea which has some physical meaning extrapolation of the straight line from the van t Hoff plot from equation to get DSR the y intercept has little meaning since the T value at the y intercept is which occurs when T approaches infinity DS can be calculated at any reasonable temperature from the the calculated value of DG at that temperature and the calculated DHvHoff Thumbnail Structure of human hemoglobin The proteins α and β subunits are in red and blue and the ironcontaining heme groups in green From

explain why single chain amphiphiles generally form micelles while double chain amphiphiles form bilayers describe lipid phases other than micelles and gelliquid crystalline bilayers formed by single and double chain amphiphiles E Why Micelles and Bilayers Micelles and liposomes form spontaneously ie delta G When water is added to dried phospholipids multilamellar vesicles MLVs form with water trapped between the successive polar head groups of the multiple bilayers Sonicating these will produce small unilamellar vesicles SUVs If however an aqueous detergent solution such as betaDoctylglucopyranoside is added to a concentration greater than its CMC mixed micelles of the phospholipid and detergent result By slowly dialyzing away the detergent which is selected on the basis of its high CMC the phospholipids in the micelle aggregate to form a large unilamellar vesicle LUV Various drugs may be encapsulated in the liposome by placing them in solution before the dialysis step Why do single chain amphiphiles form micelles and double chain amphphiles form bilayers As the number of C in the alkyl chain increase the Δμ for HC transferring into a micelle or by analogy for a single chain amphiphile entering a micelle becomes more and more negative The following equation seems to apply to the transfer of a single chain amphiphile into a micelle Δμo μo mic μo aq number NC where NC is the number of carbon atoms in the chain The first positive term depends on the nature of the head group while the second negative term is independent of the head group These and terms brings us back to the principle of opposing forces we discussed when we looked at the intemolecular forces involved in micelle and bilayer formation There are attractive IMFs including van der Waals interactions among the chains and dipoleion and Hbond interactions with water and the head groups There are likewise repulsive interactions arising from steric hindrance with bulky heady groups and ionion repulsions Of course there are also entropic considerations Let us now consider these factors as we explore what might happen to a preformed micelle as we try to put more single chain amphiphiles sca into it Clearly as we increase the number of Cs in the sca the micelles would have a larger radius For a given sca of fixed number of Cs once a spherical micelle is formed it can no longer retain its spherical shape if more scas are added Imagine increasing the diameter of a spherical micelle x A large part of the the inside would have no atoms or be filled with water which would not be favorable Therefore if the micelle is to grow it can do so only by changing shape to something other than a sphere By squeezing a ball one can imagine the the shape could distort to a circular cylinder In this way the acyl chains can still interact The only problem is that head groups will now be closer than they were in the sphere Imagine in a sphere the head groups radiating in a perpendicular direction from the sphere surface As the sphere is distorted to a cylinder the head groups would come closer together and hence they will experience more steric interference If a cylinder can be formed however it could continue to grow as long as needed with no further compression required Imagine now that you further compressed the cylinder into a planar bilayer structure The head groups would be even closer and experience even more repulsion This bilayer will not form since growth can occur in the cylindrical phase without the added repulsion Now consider a double chain amphiphile dca In the case of a sca the number N of head groups HG the number of acyl chains CH Hence the surface area per HG is equal to the area per HC Or AsN HG As N CH For a dca N HG N CH therefore AsN HG AsNCH There is twice the surface area available per head group compared to that of the sca Therefore the dca can tolerate more compression In fact it can easily be compressed to a bilayer which as we saw has much less AsHG The cylindrical form actually has to much space per head group since water can enter the structure The extra closeness of head groups in the bilayer can be tolerated even more since the Dmo for transfer of a dca into a micelle is more negative than that of a sca The AsHG for closed vesicles differs only slightly from that of a truly planar bilayer since the vesicles are so large compared to a micelle Once again we have discovered that structure mediates function We can account for the fact that sca and dca form micelles and bilayers respectively by understanding the structure of the monomers Figure Surface Area per Head Group vs no of C in Amphiphile Globular Cylindrical Planar Forms In reality things are more complicated In this introductory chapter on lipid aggregates I have simplified the nature of the complex lipid structures than can form on aggregation of single and double chain amphiphiles The general rule holds that single chain amphiphiles form micelles and double chain amphiphiles form bilayers However under the right condition single chain fatty acids can from bilayers which makes fatty acids like oleic acid prime candidates for components of the membranes of protocells in the evolution of life from abiotic conditions In addition other lipids phases can be observed What aggregates or phase ultimately forms depends on the structure of the lipid the solvent conditions and the temperature These include the following phases lamellar gel Lb and lamellar liquid crystalline La phases hexagonal HI cylinders packed in the shape of a hexagon with polar heads facing out into water hexagonal HII cylinders packed in the shape of a hexagon with acyl chains pointing out as in reverse micelles and micellar M

SignalingReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objectives Describe how lipid bilayers participate in signal transduction F Introduction to Lipid Signaling Swedish Translation by Valeria Aleksandrova Lipids are not just used as a passive component of membranes or as a source of stored energy They are involved in the process of signal transduction at the cell membrane a process by which the interior components of the cell respond to a signal external to the cell allowing the cell to respond to their local environment Usually a chemical signal on the outside of the cell is the primary messenger that causes the cell to respond Usually the chemical transmitter of information does not get into the cell Rather it binds to surface receptors on the cell membrane surface Somehow the cells senses that a ligand is bound to the outside Enzymes usually in the membrane or at the intracellular surface of the lipid bilayer are activated Many of these enzymes cleave lipids in the membrane The cleaved fragments of the lipid molecules serve as intracellular signals or secondary messengers which can bind to intracellular enzymes to activate intracellular processes The following diagram shows some of the lipid mediators which are generated by the process and signal the cell to respond Figure Lipids More than Grease Mediators in Signal Transduction Recently fatty acid amides have been shown to be potent mediators of neurological processes In one interesting experiment sheep were sleep deprived Reasoning that the brain might release a biochemical signal into cerebrospinal fluid to induce sleep scientists at Scripps removed some of this fluid and isolated a substance that was not found in rested sheep On analysis the structure was shown to be an amide of oleic acid Oleylethanolamide has been shown to bind to the peroxisomeproliferatoractivated receptora PPARa which resides in the nucleus This ligand by affecting gene transcription appears to regulate body weight and the feeling of fullness after eating satiety as it ieads to reduced eating In an analogous fashion people have sought the natural neurotransmitter which binds to the same receptor in the brain as THC the active ingredient of marijuana This was found several years ago and was shown to be the amide of arachidonic acid called anandamide See the figure below for structures Figure Fatty Acid Amides Neurochemical Mediators This fatty acid amide is an examples of a class of lipid derivatives called Nacylethanolamines NAEs These molecules with acyl groups that vary in number of carbons and double bonds are found widely in organisms in nature Naturally occurring anandamide leads to increased food intake after a short period of reduced food intake One of the known physiological effects of THC is increased food consumption the munchies In a recent study Lucanic et al have shown that decreases in NAEs extend the the life span in the small roundworm C elegans which has become a model organism to study genes in eukaryotes Caloric restriction has been shown to increase life span in a variety of organisms In invertebrates anandamide seems to inhibit food intake even in organisms that lack a receptor similar to which cannabinoids binds This might seem paradoxical in that anandamide and THC in humans seems to induce eating However under long periods of caloric restriction low level starvation in rats anandamide levels are suppressed leading to a low energy consuming state In generally it appears that reductions of NAEs occur during periods of caloric restriction Mutant worms which have reduced levels of NAEs through targeted enzyme disruptions that affected either NAE synthesis or degradation have longer life spans If normal wildtype worms were placed under caloric restriction but given EPAethanolamine the most abundant NAE in these worms the did not have an extended lifespan References Lucanic N et al Nacylethanolamine signaling mediates the effect of diet on

applications for vacuumseal processesFruit compressionInfusionsContributors and Attributions Sousvide cooking is about immersing a food item in a precisely controlled water bath where the temperature of the water is the same as the target temperature of the food being cooked Food is placed in a foodgrade plastic bag and vacuumsealed before going into the water bath Temperatures will vary depending on desired end result This allows the water in the bath to transfer heat into the food while preventing the water from coming into direct contact with it This means the water does not chemically interact with the food the flavors of the food remain stronger because the water is unable to dissolve or carry away any compounds in the food Figure Figure Img_ by Derek is licensed under CC BY SAND Sousvide fruits and vegetables Cooking vegetable and fruits sousvide is a great way to tenderize them without losing as many of the vitamins and minerals that are normally lost through blanching or steaming Fruits can also be infused with liquid when cooked at lower temperatures by adding liquid to the bag Sousvide helps preserve the nutrients present in fruits and vegetables by not cooking them above the temperatures that cause the cell walls to fully break down This allows them to tenderize without losing all their structure The bag also helps to catch any nutrients that do come out of the vegetable While time and temperature do not factor into safety for fruits and vegetables they do have a unique effect on their structure There are two components in fruits and vegetables that make them crisp pectin and starch Pectin which is a gelling agent commonly used in jams and jellies for structure breaks down at oC oF at a slower rate than the starch cells do In many cases this allows for more tender fruits and vegetables that have a unique texture to them Custards The term custard spans so many possible ingredients and techniques that it is most useful to think of a custard as simply a particular texture and mouth feel Custards have been made for centuries by lightly cooking a blend of eggs milk and heavy cream but modernist chefs have invented myriad ways to make custards Using the sousvide method to prepare crème anglaise curds ice cream bases custard bases sabayons and dulce de leche is possible The technique offers greater consistency and more control over the texture which can range from airy typical of a sabayon to dense as in a posset For custards eggs will be properly cooked at C oF so if the water bath is set to this temperature no overcooking can happen The one constant among custards is the use of plenty of fat which not only provides that distinctive mouth feel but also makes custard an excellent carrier of fatsoluble flavors and aromas Lighter varieties of custard prepared sousvide style and cooled can be aerated in a whipping siphon into smooth creamy foams Other applications for vacuumseal processes Fruit compression Vacuumcompressing fruits and vegetables is a popular modern technique that can give many plant foods an attractive translucent appearance as shown in the watermelon in Figure and a pleasant surprising texture This technique exploits the ability of a vacuum chamber to reduce surrounding pressure which causes air and moisture within the plant tissue to rapidly expand and rupture the structures within the food When the surrounding pressure is restored to a normal level the labyrinth of airfilled spaces collapses As a result light tends to pass through the food rather than being scattered and diffused which is why vacuumcompressed plant foods appear translucent Causing the porous structure of a plant food to collapse also imparts a somewhat dense toothsome texture that can give a familiar ingredient such as watermelon an entirely new appeal Figure WD th Course by Peter Dillon is licensed under CC BY Infusions When adding liquids the vacuumseal process creates a rapid infusionespecially with more porous foods such as adding spices to cream or herbs to melon This can add flavor and texture in a shorter time than traditional infusions Contributors and Attributions Sorangel

with a water content of to Due to dietary concerns lard has gradually lost much of its former popularity It is still extensively used however for Yeast dough additions Pie pastry Pan greasing Lard has a good plastic range which enables it to be worked in a pie dough at fairly low temperatures try the same thing with butter It has a ﬁbrous texture and does not cream well It is therefore not suitable for cake making Some grades of lard also have a distinctive ﬂavor which is another reason it is unsuitable for cake making Butter Butter is made from sweet neutralized or ripened creams pasteurized and standardized to a fat content of to When cream is churned or overwhipped the fat particles separate from the watery liquid known as buttermilk The separated fat is washed and kneaded in a water wheel to give it plasticity and consistency Color is added during this process to make it look richer and salt is added to improve its keeping quality In Canada the following regulations apply to butter Minimum milk fat by weight Permitted ingredients milk solids salt air or inert gas permitted food color permitted bacterial culture The grade and grade name for butter and butter products is Canada Sweet or unsalted butter is made from a cream that has a very low acid content and no salt is added to it It is used in some baking products like French butter cream where butter should be the only fat used in the recipe Keep sweet butter in the refrigerator From the standpoint of ﬂavor butter is the most desirable fat used in baking Its main drawback is its relatively high cost It has moderate but satisfactory shortening and creaming qualities When used in cake mixing additional time up to ﬁve minutes more should be allowed in the creaming stage to give maximum volume Adding an emulsiﬁer about based on ﬂour weight will also help in cake success as butter has a poor plastic range of C to C F to F Butter and butter products may also be designated as whipped where they have had air or inert gas uniformly incorporated into them as a result of whipping Whipped butter may contain up to added edible casein or edible caseinates Butter and butter products may also be designated as cultured where they have been produced from cream to which a permitted bacterial culture has been added Margarine Margarines are made primarily from vegetable oils to some extent hydrogenated with a small fraction of milk powder and bacterial culture to give a butterlike ﬂavor Margarines are very versatile and include General purpose margarine with a low melting point suitable for blending in dough and general baking Cake margarine with excellent creaming qualities Rollin margarine which is plastic and suitable for Danish pastries Puﬀ pastry rollin which is the most waxy and has the highest melting point Margarine may be obtained white but is generally colored Margarine has a fat content ranging from to with the balance pretty much the same as butter Oil content claims on margarine The claim that margarine contains a certain percentage of a speciﬁc oil in advertisements should always be based on the percentage of oil by weight of the total product All the oils used in making the margarine should be named For example if a margarine is made from a mixture of corn oil cottonseed oil and soybean oil it would be considered misleading to refer only to the corn oil content in an advertisement for the margarine On the other hand the mixture of oils could be correctly referred to as vegetable oils It used to be that you could only buy margarines in solid form full of saturated and trans fat The majority of todays margarines come in tubs are soft and spreadable and are nonhydrogenated which means they have low levels of saturated and trans fat Great care must be taken when attempting to substitute spreadable margarine for solid margarine in recipes Shortenings Since the invention of hydrogenated vegetable oil in the early th century shortening has come almost exclusively to mean hydrogenated vegetable oil Vegetable shortening shares many properties with lard both are semisolid fats with a higher smoke point than butter and margarine They contain less water and are thus less prone to splattering making them safer for frying Lard and shortening have a higher fat content close to compared to about for butter and margarine Cake margarines and shortenings tend to contain a bit higher percentage of monoglycerides that margarines Such highratio shortenings blend better with hydrophilic attracts water ingredients such as starches and sugar Health concerns and reformulation Early in this century vegetable shortening became the subject of some health concerns due to its traditional formulation from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that contain trans fats which have been linked to a number of adverse health eﬀects Consequently a low transfat variant of Crisco brand shortening was introduced in In January all Crisco products were reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans fat per serving and the separately marketed transfat free version introduced in was consequently discontinued Since many other brands of shortening have also been reformulated to remove trans fats Nonhydrogenated vegetable shortening can be made from palm oil Hydrogenated vegetable shortenings Hydrogenated shortenings are the biggest group of fats used in the commercial baking industry They feature the following characteristics They are made from much the same oils as margarine They are versatile fats with good creaming ability Their hydrogenation diﬀers according to the speciﬁc use for which the fat is designed They are fat no water They keep well for six to nine months Variations on these shortenings are emulsiﬁed vegetable shortenings rollin pastry shortenings and deepfrying fats Emulsiﬁed vegetable shortenings Emulsiﬁed vegetable shortenings are also termed highratio fats The added emulsiﬁers mono and diglycerides increase fat dispersion and give added ﬁneness to the baked product They are ideal for highratio cakes where relatively large amounts of sugar and liquid are incorporated The result is a cake Fine in texture Light in weight and of excellent volume Superior in moisture retention good shelf life Tender to eat This is also the fat of choice for many white cake icings Rollin pastry shortenings This type of shortening is also called special pastry shortening SPS These fats have a semiwaxy consistency and oﬀer Large plastic range Excellent extensibility Excellent lifting ability They are primarily used in puﬀ pastry and Danish pastry products where lamination is required They come in various specialized forms with varying qualities and melting points It is all a matter of compromise between cost palatability and leavening power A rollin that does not have palate cling may have a melting point too low to guarantee maximum lift in a puﬀ pastry product DeepFrying Fats Deepfrying fats are special hydrogenated fats that have the following features High smoke point of up to C F High heat stability and resistance to fat breakdown No undesirable ﬂavor on ﬁnished products No greasiness when cold These fats contain an antifoaming agent Vegetable Oils Vegetable oil is an acceptable common name for an oil that contains more than one type of vegetable oil Generally when such a vegetable oil blend is used as an ingredient in another food it may be listed in the ingredients as vegetable oil There are two exceptions if the vegetable oils are ingredients of a cooking oil salad oil or table oil the oils must be speciﬁcally named in the ingredient list eg canola oil corn oil saﬄower oil and using the general term vegetable oil is not acceptable As well if any of the oils are coconut oil palm oil palm kernel oil peanut oil or cocoa butter the oils must be speciﬁcally named in the ingredient list When two or more vegetable oils are present and one or more of them has been modiﬁed or hydrogenated the common name on the principal display panel and in the list of ingredients must include the word modiﬁed or hydrogenated as appropriate eg modiﬁed vegetable oil hydrogenated vegetable oil modiﬁed palm kernel oil Vegetable oils are used in Chemically leavened batters eg muﬃn mixes Dough additives to replace the fat Short sponges to replace the butter or fat Coconut Fat Coconut fat is often used to stabilize butter creams as it has a very small plastic range It has a quite low melting point and its hardness is due to other factors It can be modiﬁed to melt at diﬀerent temperatures generally between C and C F and F The Importance of Melting Points As mentioned above all fats become oils and vice versa depending on temperature Physically fats consist of minute solid fat particles enclosing a microscopic liquid oil fraction The consistency of fat is very important to the baker It is very diﬃcult to work with butter relatively low melting point in hot weather for example At the other extreme fats with a very high melting point are not very palatable since they tend to stick to the palate Fat manufacturers have therefore attempted to customize fats to accommodate the various needs of the baker Fats with a melting range between C and C F and F are considered to be a good compromise between convenience in handling and palatability New techniques allow fats with quite high melting points without unpleasant palatecling Table shows the melting points of some fats Table Melting points of typical fats Type of Fat Melting Point Coconut fat CC FF Regular margarine C F Butter C F Regular shortenings CC FF Rollin shortenings CC FF Rollin margarine CC FF Blending It is probably safe to say that most fats are combinations or blends of diﬀerent oils andor fats They may be all vegetable sources They may be combined vegetable and animal sources A typical ratio is vegetable source to animal this is not a hard and fast rule Formerly blends of vegetable and animal oils and fats were termed compound fats Nowadays this term if used at all may refer also to combinations of purely vegetable origin Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University

RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Malt is the name given to a sweetening agent made primarily from barley The enzymes from the germ of the seeds become active changing much of the starch into maltose a complex sugar Maltose has a distinct flavor and is used for making yeast products such as bread and rolls Malt is considered to be relatively nutritious compared to other sweeteners Malt is available as Flour Malt syrup Malt extract Dried malt The flour is not recommended since it can lead to problems if not scaled precisely Malt syrup is inconvenient to work with as it is sticky heavy and bulky Dried malt is the most practical though it must be kept protected from humidity There are two distinct types of malt Diastatic malt flour is dried at low temperature thus retaining the activity of the diastatic enzymes Nondiastatic malt flour is darker in color It is treated at high temperature which kills the enzymes and the result is nondiastatic malt Crushing malted grain in water produces malt syrup This dissolves the maltose and soluble enzymes The liquid is concentrated producing the syrup If the process is continued a dry crystallized product called dried malt syrup is obtained Malt syrup has a peculiar flavor which many people find desirable It is used in candy malted milk and many other products The alcoholic beverage industry is the largest consumer of malt by far but considerable quantities are used in syrup and dried malt syrup both of which are divided into diastatic and nondiastatic malt Both diastatic and nondiastatic malts add sweetness color and flavor to baked products Both are valuable since they contain malt sugar which is fermented by the yeast in the later stages of fermentation Other sugars such as glucose and levulose are used up rapidly by fermenting yeast in the early stages of fermentation Diastatic malt is made with various levels of active enzymes Malt with medium diastatic activity is recommended Normally bread bakers will find sufficient enzymes in wellbalanced flour from a good mill so it is unnecessary to use diastatic malt When using dry diastatic malt about the same weight should be used as liquid regular diastatic malt Adjustment is made at the factory insofar as the enzyme level is increased in the dry product to compensate Since the dry type contains about less moisture than the liquid type add water to make up the difference if dry diastatic malt is substituted for malt syrup The main uses of malt in the bakery are to Add nutritive value as it is rich in vitamins and essential amino acids Lengthen shelf life through its ability to attract moisture Help fermentation by strengthening the gluten and feeding the yeast Make products more appealing through browning of the crust Add unique flavor to products when used in sufficient quantity Table shows the suggested use levels for malt Table Recommended level of malt for various baked

divided and emulsified mechanically that the milk fat cannot separate on standing The milk fat is forced into tiny droplets As soon as the droplets form milk proteins and emulsifiers form a protective film around each one preventing the fat from reuniting The tiny droplets stay suspended indefinitely and milk fat no longer separates and rises to the top as a cream layer In other words homogenized dairy products are stable emulsions of fat droplets suspended in milk It is also said that homogenized milk is more readily digestible Pasteurization of milk was developed in by the French chemist Louis Pasteur One method of pasteurization is to heat milk to above C F maintain it at this temperature for a set time then cool it immediately to C F or lower This kills all harmful bacteria that carry the potential threat of bovine tuberculosis and fever from cows to humans The two main types of pasteurization used today are hightemperature shorttime HTST also known as flash and higherheat shorter time HHST Ultrahightemperature UHT processing is also used Hightemperature shorttime HTST pasteurization is done by heating milk to C F for seconds Milk simply labelled pasteurized is usually treated with the HTST method Higherheat shorter time HHST milk and milk products are pasteurized by applying heat continuously generally above C F for such time to extend the shelf life of the product under refrigerated conditions This type of heat process can be used to produce dairy products with extended shelf life ESL Ultrahightemperature UHT processing holds the milk at a temperature of C F for four seconds During UHT processing milk is sterilized rather than pasteurized This process allows milk or juice to be stored several months without refrigeration The process is achieved by spraying the milk or juice through a nozzle into a chamber that is filled with hightemperature steam under pressure After the temperature reaches C F the fluid is cooled instantly in a vacuum chamber and packed in a presterilized airtight container Milk labelled UHT has been treated in this way For more information on pasteurization visit the International Dairy Foods Association Attribution

dough stage milk increases water absorption Consequently dough made with milk should come softer from the mixer than dough made with water Other aspects of milk in yeast doughs include Dough may be mixed more intensively Milk yields dough with a higher pH compared to water dough and the fermentation will be slower Fermentation tolerance the ability of the dough to work properly in a range of temperatures will be slightly improved Bench time will be extended as the dough ferments more slowly at this stage Final proof times will be about the same as by this time the yeast has adjusted to the condition of the dough Bread made with milk will color faster in the oven and allowance should be made for this If taken out too early after a superficial examination of crust color it may collapse slightly and be hard to slice The loaf should be expected to have a darker crust color than bread made without milk In the finished product milk will make bread that has Greater volume improved capacity to retain gas Darker crust due to the lactose in the milk Longer shelf life due partly to the milk fat Finer and more cottony grain Better slicing due to the finer grain If skim milk or skim milk powder is used some of the above benefits will not be so evident eg longer shelf life which is a result of the fat in the milk The type of sugar found in milk lactose has little sweetening power and does not ferment so in dough made with skim milk powder sugar has to be added or the fermentation will be very slow While lactose is not fermentable it caramelizes readily in the oven and produces a healthy crust color The recommended amount of skim milk powder used in fermented dough is to based on flour and up in cakes Buttermilk and sour milk are used to make variety breads

culture to sour it Churning milk and separating the liquid left over from the butter There are two methods to produce buttermilk The second method is where buttermilk gets its name but today most of what is commonly called buttermilk is the first type Buttermilk has a higher acid content than regular milk pH of compared with milks pH of The fermented dairy product known ascultured buttermilk is produced from cows milk and has a characteristically sour taste caused by lactic acid bacteria This variant is made using one of two species of bacteria either Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus bulgaricus which creates more tartness in certain recipes The acid in buttermilk reacts with the sodium bicarbonate baking soda to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent Sour Cream Sour cream is made from cream soured by adding lactic acids and thickened naturally or by processing Milk fat content may vary from to The lactic acid causes the proteins in sour cream to coagulate to a gelled consistency gums and starches may be added to further thicken it The added gums and starches also keep the liquid whey in sour cream from separating Use sour cream in cheesecakes coffee cakes and pastry doughs Lowfat and fatfree sour cream are available Lowfat sour cream which is essentially cultured halfandhalf or light cream and usually contains to milk fat is often satisfactory as a substitute for regular sour cream in baking These products are higher in moisture and less rich in flavor than regular sour cream Crème Fraîche Crème fraîche fresh cream is a soured cream containing to milk fat and having a pH of around It is soured with bacterial culture Traditionally it is made by setting unpasteurized milk into a pan at room temperature allowing the cream to rise to the top After about hours the cream is skimmed off During that time natural bacteria in the unpasteurized milk ripens the cream turning it into a mildly sour thickened product An effective substitute can be made by adding a small amount of cultured buttermilk or sour cream to whipping cream and allowing it to stand in a warm spot for hours or more before refrigerating As the cream ripens from the growth of the lactic acid bacteria it thickens and develops a sour flavour This product is similar to sour cream but it has a higher milk fat content Milk Substitutes Milk substitutes are becoming increasingly popular as replacements for straight skim milk powders Innumerable replacement blends are available to the baker Their protein contents range from to some are wet some are dryblended Product types vary from all dairy to mostly cereal Alldairy blends range from mostly dry skim milk to mostly whey A popular blend is whey mixed with soy flour solids and a small quantity of sodium hydroxide to neutralize the whey acidity Dough consistency may be a little softer if the milk in the replacement blend exceeds and this could dictate the need to increase dough mixing by at least half a minute However absorption and formula changes are seldom necessary when switching from dry milk to a blend or from a blend to a blend For nutritional labelling or when using a blend in a nonstandardized product that must carry an itemized ingredient label all blend components must be listed in their proper order on the label The Canadian Food Inspection Agency defines modified milk ingredients as any of the following in liquid concentrated dry frozen or reconstituted form Calciumreduced skim milk Casein This a protein in milk and is used as a binding agent Caseins are also used in wax to shine fruits and vegetables as an adhesive and to fortify bread Caseins contain common amino acids Caseinate This protein is derived from skim milk Bodybuilders sometimes take powder enriched with calcium caseinate because it releases proteins at an even measured pace Cultured milk products These are milk products that have been altered through controlled fermentation including yogurt sour cream and cultured buttermilk Milk serum proteins Ultrafiltered milk The Canadian Food and Drug Regulations define this type of milk as that which has been subjected to a process in which it is passed over one or more semipermeable membranes to partially remove water lactose minerals and watersoluble vitamins without altering the whey proteintocasein ratio and that results in a liquid product Whey This is serum byproduct created in the manufacture of cheese Whey butter Typically oily in composition whey butter is made from cream separated from whey Whey cream This is cream skimmed

evaporated whole evaporated partly skimmed and evaporated skim milks depending on the type of milk used in its production Canadian standards require milk solids and milk fat All types of evaporated milk have a darker color than the original milk because at high temperatures a browning reaction occurs between the milk protein and the lactose After of the water is removed by evaporation the milk is homogenized cooled restandardized and canned It is then sterilized by heating for to minutes at C to C F to F Controlled amounts of disodium phosphate andor sodium citrate preserve the salt balance

Milling of wheat is the process that turns whole grains into flours The overall aims of the miller are to produce A consistent product A range of flours suitable for a variety of functions Flours with predictable performance The very first mill operation is analyzing the grain which determines criteria such as thgeluten content and amylase activity It is at this point that decisions about blending are made Following analysis milling may be divided into three stages Cleaning and conditioning ridding the grain of all impurities and readying it for milling Crushing or breaking breaking down the grain in successive stages to release its component parts Reduction progressive rollings and siftings to refine the flour and separate it into various categories called streams Cleaning Wheat received at the mill contains weeds seeds chaff and other foreign material Strong drafts of air from the aspirator remove lighter impurities The disc separator removes barley oats and other foreign materials From there the wheat goes to the scourers in which it is driven vigorously against perforated steel casings by metal beaters In this way much of the dirt lodged in the crease of the wheat berry is removed and carried away by a strong blast of air Then the magnetic separator removes any iron or steel At this point the wheat is moistened Machines known as whizzers take off the surface moisture The wheat is then tempered or allowed to lie in bins for a short time while still damp to toughen the bran coat thus making possible a complete separation of the bran from the flourproducing portion of the wheat berry After tempering the wheat is warmed to a uniform temperature before the crushing process starts Crushing or Breaking The objectives at this stage are twofold Separate as much bran and germ as possible from the endosperm Maximize the flour from the resulting endosperm Household grain mills create flour in one step grain in one end flour out the other but the commercial mill breaks the grain down in a succession of very gradual steps ensuring that little bran and germ are mixed with any endosperm Although the process is referred to ascrushing flour mills crack rather than crush the wheat with large steel rollers The rollers at the beginning of the milling system are corrugated and break the wheat into coarse particles The grain passes through screens of increasing fineness Air currents draw off impurities from the middlings Middlings is the name given to coarse fragments of endosperm somewhere between the size of semolina and flour Middlings occur after the break of the grain Bran and germ are sifted out and the coarse particles are rolled sifted and purified again This separation of germ and bran from the endosperm is an important goal of the miller It is done to improve doughmaking characteristics and colour As well the germ contains oil and can affect keeping qualities of the flour Reduction In the reduction stage the coarser particles go through a series of fine rollers and sieves After the first crushing the wheat is separated into five or six streams This is accomplished by means of machines called plansifters that contain sieves stacked vertically with meshes of various sizes The finest mesh is as fine as the finished flour and some flour is created at an early stage of reduction Next each of the divisions or streams passes through cleaning machines known apsurifiers a series of sieves arranged horizontally and slightly angled An upcurrent draught of air assists in eliminating dust The product is crushed a little more and each of the resulting streams is again divided into numerous portions by means of sifting The final crushings are made by perfectly smooth steel rollers that reduce the middlings into flour The flour is then bleached and put into bulk storage From bulk storage the flour is enriched thiamine niacin riboflavin and iron are added and either bagged for home and bakery use or made ready for bulk delivery Extraction Rates The extraction rate is a figure representing the percentage of flour produced from a given quantity of grain For example if kg of flour is produced from kg of grain the extraction rate is Extraction rates vary depending on the type of flour produced A whole grain flour which contains all of the germ bran and endosperm can have an extraction rate of close to while white allpurpose flours generally have extraction rates of around Since many of the nutrients are found in the germ and bran flours with a higher extraction rate have a higher nutritional value Contributors

texture of liquids Some of these thickening agents work without heating and are simply blended with the cold liquid such as modiﬁed starch or xanthan gum These allow the creation of sauces and other liquids with a fresh uncooked taste Foams froths and bubbles Liquids can be stabilized with gelatin lecithin and other ingredients and then used to create foams by whipping or using a special dispenser charged with nitrogen gas A wellmade foam adds an additional ﬂavor dimension to the dish without adding bulk and an interesting texture as the foamdissolves in the mouth Figure Figure Dinner in the Dark Dessert by Esther Little is licensed under CC BY SA Espuma Espuma is the Spanish term for froth or foam and it is created with the use of a siphon ISO bottle This is a speciﬁc term since culinary foams may be attained through other means Espuma from a siphon creates foam without the use of an emulsifying agent such as egg As a result it oﬀers an unadulterated ﬂavor of the ingredients used It also introduces much more air into a preparation compared to other culinary aerating processes Espuma is created mainly with liquid that has air incorporated in it to create froth But solid ingredients can be used too these can be liqueﬁed by cooking puréeing and extracting natural juices It should be noted though that the best ﬂavors to work with are those that are naturally diluted Otherwise the espuma tends to lose its ﬂavor as air is introduced into it Stabilizers may be used alongside the liquids to help retain their shape longer however this is not always necessary Prepared liquids can also be stored in a siphon bottle and kept for use The pressure from the bottle will push out the aerated liquid producing the espuma Foam Foam is created by trapping air within a solid or liquid substance Although culinary foams are most recently associated with molecular gastronomy they are part of many culinary preparations that date back to even earlier times Mousse souﬄé whipped cream and froth in cappuccino are just some examples of common foams Common examples of set foams are bread pancakes and muﬃns Foam does not rely on pressure to encase air bubbles into a substance Like espuma foam may also be created with the help of a surfactant and gelling or thickening agents to help it hold shape The production of a culinary foam starts with a liquid or a solid that has been puréed The thickening or gelling agent is then diluted into this to form a solution Once dissolved the solution is whipped to introduce air into it The process of whipping is done until the foam has reached the desired stiﬀness Note that certain ingredients may break down if they are whipped for too long especially without the presence of a stabilizing agent Gels Turning a liquid such as a vegetable juice or raspberry purée into a solid not only gives it a diﬀerent texture but also allows the food to be cut into many shapes enabling diﬀerent visual presentations Figure Regular gelatin can be used as well as other gelling agents such as agar agar which is derived from red algae Figure Papayagelee by hedonistin is licensed under CC BY NC Brittle gels Gelling agents are often associated with jellylike textures which may range from soft to ﬁrm However certain gels produced by speciﬁc agents may not ﬁt this description Rather than forming an elastic or pliable substance brittle gels may also be formed These are gels that are ﬁrm in nature yet fragile at the same time This characteristic is caused by the formation of a gel network that is weak and susceptible to breaking This property allows brittle gels to crumble in the mouth and create a meltinthemouth feeling As a result new sensations and textures are experienced while dining At the same time tastes within a dish are also enhanced due to the ﬂavour release caused by the gel breakdownBrittle gels are made by diluting the gelling agent into a liquid substance such as water milk or a stock This mixture is left to set to attain a gelled end product It should be noted that the concentration of gelling agents used as well as the amount of liquid both aﬀect gelation Agar agar is a common agent used to create brittle gels However when combined with sugar it tends to create a more elastic substance Lowacyl gellan gum locust bean gum and carrageenan also create brittle gels Fluid gels A ﬂuid gel is a cross between a sauce gel and purée It is a controlled liquid that has properties of all three preparations A ﬂuid gel displays viscosity and ﬂuidity at the same time being thick yet still spreadable Fluid gels behave as solids when undisturbed and ﬂow when exposed to suﬃcient agitation They are used in many culinary dishes where ﬂuids need to be controlled and they provide a rich creamy texture A ﬂuid gel is created using a base liquid that can come from many diﬀerent sources The base liquid is commonly extracted from fruits and vegetables taken from stocks or even puréed from certain ingredients The longer the substance is exposed to stress and the more intense the outside stress the more ﬂuidity is gained More ﬂuidity causes a ﬁner consistency in the gel Fluid gels can be served either hot or cold as many of the gelling agents used for such preparations are stable at high temperatures Drying and powdering Drying a food intensiﬁes its ﬂavour and of course changes its texture Eating a piece of apple that has been cooked and then dehydrated until crisp is very diﬀerent from eating a fresh fruit slice If the dehydrated food is powdered it becomes yet another ﬂavour and texture experience When maltodextrin or tapioca maltodextrin is mixed with fat it changes to a powder Because maltodextrin dissolves in water peanut butter or olive oil that has been changed to a powder changes back to an oil in the mouth Freezing In molecular gastronomy liquid nitrogen is often used to freeze products or to create a frozen item without the use of a freezer Liquid nitrogen is the element nitrogen in a liqueﬁed state It is a clear colourless liquid with a temperature of C F It is classiﬁed as a cryogenic ﬂuid which causes rapid freezing when it comes into contact with living tissues The extremely cold temperatures provided by this liqueﬁed gas are most often used in modern cuisine to produce frozen foams and ice cream After freezing food nitrogen boils away creating a thick nitrogen fog that may also add to the aesthetic features of a dish Given the extreme temperature of liquid nitrogen it must be handled with care Mishandling may cause serious burns to the skin Nitrogen must be stored in special ﬂasks and handled only by trained people Aprons gloves and other specially designed safety gear should be used when handling liquid nitrogen Used mainly in the form of a coolant for molecular gastronomy liquid nitrogen is not ingested It is poured directly onto the food that needs to be cooled causing it to freeze Any remaining nitrogen evaporates although suﬃcient time must be provided to allow the liqueﬁed gas to be eliminated and for the dish to warm up to the point that it will not cause damage during consumption Spheriﬁcation Spheriﬁcation is a modern cuisine technique that involves creating semisolid spheres with thin membranes out of liquids Spheres can be made in various sizes and of various ﬁrmnesses such as the caviar shown in Figure The result is a burstinthemouth eﬀect achieved with the liquid Both ﬂavour and texture are enhanced with this culinary technique There are two versions of the spheriﬁcation process direct and reverse In direct spheriﬁcation a ﬂavoured liquid containing either sodium alginate gellan gum or carrageenan is dripped into a water bath that is mixed with calcium either calcium chloride or calcium lactate The outer layer is induced by calcium to form a thin gel layer leaving a liquid centre In this version the spheres are easily breakable and should be consumed immediately Calcium chloride and sodium alginate are the two basic components used for this technique Calcium chloride is a type of salt used in cheese making and sodium alginate is taken from seaweed The sodium alginate is used to gel the chosen liquid by dissolving it directly into the ﬂuid This causes the liquid to become sticky and proper dissolving must be done by mixing The liquid is then left to set to eliminate any bubbles Once ready a bath is prepared with calcium chloride and water The liquid is then dripped into the bath using a spoon or syringe depending on the desired sphere size The gel forms a membrane encasing the liquid when it comes into contact with the calcium chloride Once set the spheres are then removed and rinsed with water to remove any excess calcium chloride In reverse spheriﬁcation a calciumcontaining liquid or ingredients mixed with a soluble calcium salt is dripped into a setting bath containing sodium alginate Surface tension causes the drop to become spherical A skin of calcium alginate immediately forms around the top Unlike in the direct version the gelling stops and does not continue into the liquid orb This results in thicker shells so the products do not have to be consumed immediately Figure White chocolate spaghetti with raspberry sauce and chocolate martini caviar by ayngelina is licensed under CC BY NCND Videos on spheriﬁcation Direct httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvBeRMBvgLk Reverse httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvJPNoUyI Specialty ingredients used in molecular gastronomy There are a number of diﬀerent ingredients used in molecular gastronomy as gelling thickening or emulsifying agents Many of these are available in specialty food stores or can be ordered online Algin Another name for sodium alginate algin is a natural gelling agent taken from the cell walls of certain brown seaweed species Calcium chloride Calcium chloride also known as CaCl is a compound of chlorine and calcium that is a byproduct of sodium bicarbonate baking soda manufacturing At room temperature it is a solid salt which is easily dissolved in water This is very salty and is often used for preservation pickling cheese production and adding taste without increasing the amount of sodium It is also used in molecular gastronomy in the spheriﬁcation technique see above for the production of ravioli spheres pearls and caviar Figure Calcium lactate Calcium lactate is a calcium salt resulting from the fermentation of lactic acid and calcium It is a white crystalline power when solid and is highly soluble in cold liquids It is commonly used as a calcium fortiﬁer in various food products including beverages and supplements Calcium lactate is also used to regulate acidity levels in cheese and baking powder as a food thickener and as a preservative for fresh fruits In molecular gastronomy it is most commonly used for basic spheriﬁcation and reverse spheriﬁcation due to the lack of bitterness in the ﬁnished products Like calcium chloride calcium lactate is used alongside sodium alginate In regular spheriﬁcation it is used in the bath It is also used as a thickener in reverse spheriﬁcation Carob bean gum Carob bean gum is another name for locust bean gum It is often used to stabilize texturize thicken and gel liquids in the area of modern cuisine although it has been a popular thickener and stabilizer for many years Carrageenan Carrageenan refers to any linear sulfated polysaccharide taken from the extracts of red algae This seaweed derivative is classiﬁed mainly as iota kappa and lambda It is a common ingredient in many foods There are a number of purposes that it serves including binding thickening stabilizing gelling and emulsifying Carrageenan can be found in ice cream salad dressings cheese puddings and many more foods It is often used with dairy products because of its good interaction with milk proteins Carrageenan also works well with other common kitchen ingredients and oﬀers a smooth texture and taste that blends well and does not aﬀect ﬂavour More often than not carrageenan is found in powder form which is hydrated in liquid before being used For best results carrageenan powder should be sprinkled in cold liquid and blended well to dissolve although it may also be melted directly in hot liquids Citric acid Classiﬁed as a weak organic acid citric acid is a naturally occurring preservative that can be found in citrus fruits Produced as a result of the fermentation of sugar it has a tart to bitter taste and is usually in powder form when sold commercially It is used mainly as a preservative and acidulent and it is a common food additive in a wide range of foods such as candies and soda Other than extending shelf life by adjusting the acidity or pH of food it can also help enhance ﬂavours It works especially well with other fruits providing a fresh taste In modern cooking citric acid is often used as an emulsiﬁer to keep fats and liquids from separating It is also a common component in spheriﬁcation where it may be used as an acid buﬀer Gellan gum Gellan gum is a watersoluble highmolecularweight polysaccharide gum that is produced through the fermentation of carbohydrates in algae by the bacterium Pseudomonas elodea This fermented carbohydrate is puriﬁed with isopropyl alcohol then dried and milled to produce a powder Gellan gum is used as a stabilizer emulsiﬁer thickener and gelling agent in cooking Aspics and terrines are only some of the dishes that use gellan It comes in both highacyl and lowacyl forms Highacyl gellan gum produces a ﬂexible elastic gel while lowacyl gellan gum will give way to a more brittle gel Like many other hydrocolloids gellan gum is used with liquids The powder is normally dispersed in the chosen liquid to dissolve it Once dissolved the solution is then heated to facilitate liquid absorption and gelling by the hydrocolloid A temperature between C and C F and F will start the dissolution process Gelling will begin upon cooling around C and C F and F Gellan gum creates a thermoirreversible gel and can withstand high heat without reversing in form This makes it ideal for the creation of warm gels Guar gum Guar gum or guaran is a carbohydrate This galactomannan is taken from the seeds of the guar plant by dehusking milling and screening The end product is a pale oﬀwhite loose powder It is most commonly used as a thickening agent and stabilizer for sauces and dressings in the food industry Baked goods such as bread may also use guar gum to increase the amount of soluble ﬁbre At the same time it also aids with moisture retention in bread and other baked items Being a derivative of a legume guar gum is considered to be vegan and a good alternative to starches In modern cuisine guar gum is used for the creation of foams from acidic liquids for ﬂuid gels and for stabilizing foams Guar gum must ﬁrst be dissolved in cold liquid The higher the percentage of guar gum used the more viscous the liquid will become Dosage may also vary according to the ingredients used as well as desired results and temperature Iota carrageenan Iota carrageenan is a hydrocolloid taken from red seaweed Eucheuma denticulatum It is one of three varieties of carrageenan and is used mainly as a thickening or gelling agent Gels produced from iota carrageenan are soft and ﬂexible especially when used with calcium salts It produces a clear gel that exhibits little syneresis Iota is a fastsetting gel that is thermoreversible and remains stable through freezing and thawing In modern cuisine it is used to create hot foams as well as custards and jellies with a creamy texture Like most other hydrocolloids iota carrageenan must ﬁrst be dispersed and hydrated in liquid before use Unlike lambda carrageenan it is best dispersed in cold liquid Once hydrated the solution must be heated to about C F with shear to facilitate dissolution Gelling will happen between C and C F and F depending on the number of calcium ions present Kappa carrageenan Kappa carrageenan is another type of red seaweed extract taken speciﬁcally from Kappaphycus alvarezii Like other types of carrageenan it is used as a gelling thickening and stabilizing agent When mixed with water kappa carrageenan creates a strong and ﬁrm solid gel that may be brittle in texture This particular variety of carrageenan blends well with milk and other dairy products Since it is taken from seaweed it is considered to be vegan and is an alternative to traditional gelling agents such as gelatin Kappa carrageenan is used in various cooking preparations including hot and cold gels jelly toppings cakes breads and pastries When used in molecular gastronomy preparations and other dishes kappa carrageenan should be dissolved in cold liquid Once dispersed the solution must be heated between C and C F and F Gelling will begin between C and C F and F Kappa carrageenan is a thermoreversible gel and will stay stable up to C F Temperatures beyond this will cause the gel to melt and become liquid once again Locust bean gum Locust bean gum also known as LBG and carob bean gum is a vegetable gum derived from Mediterraneanregion carob tree seeds This hydrocolloid is used to stabilize texturize thicken and gel liquids in modern cuisine although it has been a popular thickener and stabilizer for many years It has a neutral taste that does not aﬀect the ﬂavour of food that it is combined with It also provides a creamy mouth feel and has reduced syneresis when used alongside pectin or carrageenan for dairy and fruit applications The neutral behaviour of this hydrocolloid makes it ideal for use with a wide range of ingredients To use locust bean gum it must be dissolved in liquid It is soluble with both hot and cold liquids Maltodextrin Maltodextrin is a sweet polysaccharide that is produced from starch corn wheat tapioca or potato through partial hydrolysis and spray drying This modiﬁed food starch is a white powder that has the capacity to absorb and hold water as well as oil It is an ideal additive since it has fewer calories than sugar and is easily absorbed and digested by the body in the form of glucose Coming from a natural source it ranges from nearly ﬂavourless to fairly sweet without any odour Maltodextrin is a common ingredient in processed foods such as soda and candies In molecular gastronomy it can be used both as a thickener and a stabilizer for sauces and dressings for encapsulation and as a sweetener In many cases it is also used as an aroma carrier due to its capacity to absorb oil It is also often used to make powders or pastes out of fat Sodium alginate Sodium alginate which is also called algin is a natural gelling agent taken from the cell walls of certain brown seaweed species This salt is obtained by drying the seaweed followed by cleaning boiling gelling and pulverizing it A light yellow powder is produced from the process When dissolved in liquids sodium alginate acts as a thickener creating a viscous ﬂuid Conversely when it is used with calcium it forms a gel through a cold process In molecular gastronomy sodium alginate is most commonly used as a texturizing agent Foams and sauces may be created with it It is also used in spheriﬁcation for the creation of pearls raviolis mock caviar marbles and spheres Sodium alginate can be used directly by dissolving it into the liquid that needs to be gelled as in the case of basic spheriﬁcation It may also be used inversely by adding it directly to a bath as in the case of reverse spheriﬁcation This versatile product is soluble in both hot and cold liquids and gels made with it will set at any temperature Soy lecithin Soy lecithin also called just lecithin is a natural emulsiﬁer that comes from fatty substances found in plant tissues It is derived from soybeans either mechanically or chemically and is a byproduct of soybean oil creation The end product is a light brown powder that has low water solubility As an emulsiﬁer it works to blend immiscible ingredients together such as oil and water giving way to stable preparations It can be whisked directly into the liquid of choice Soy lecithin is also used in creating foams airs mousses and other aerated dishes that are long lasting and full of ﬂavour It is used in pastries confections and chocolate to enhance dough and increase moisture tolerance As with most ingredients dosage and concentration for soy lecithin will depend on the ingredients used speciﬁc properties desired in the resulting preparation as well as other conditions Tapioca maltodextrin Tapioca maltodextrin is a form of maltodextrin made from tapioca starch It is a common ingredient in molecular gastronomy because it can be used both as a thickener and stabilizer for sauces and dressings for encapsulation and as a sweetener In many cases it is also used as an aroma carrier due to its capacity to absorb oil It is often used to make powders or pastes out of fat Xanthan gum Xanthan gum is a food additive used as a thickening agent It is produced through the fermentation of glucose As a glutenfree additive it can be used as a substitute in cooking and baking As a thickener when used in low dosages xanthan gum produces a weak gel with high viscosity that is shear reversible with a high pourability It also displays excellent stabilizing abilities that allow for particle suspension Moreover xanthan gum mixes well with other ﬂavours without masking them and provides an improved mouth feel to preparations The presence of bubbles within the thickened liquids often makes way for light and creamy textures It is used in the production of emulsions suspensions raviolis and foams Being a hydrocolloid xanthan gum must be hydrated before use High versatility allows it to be dissolved over a wide range of temperatures acid and alcohol levels Once set xanthan gum may lose some of its eﬀectiveness when exposed to heat Contributors and Attributions Sorangel

Carbonyls Aldehydes and KetonesReaction of Carboxylic Acid DerivativesKinetics of Reactivity of CarbonylsBreaking CC BondsReferencesContributors and Attributions Breaking CX bonds Many of the organic reactions involved in metabolism involve making and breaking bonds to carbon There are ways to break a bond to a CX bond producing either a carbocation carbanion or free radical intermediate all of the which are unstable and reactive Both the carbocation and free radical are electron deficient and the carbanion although not electron deficienct has a negative on C an atom which has a relatively low electronegativity Preferential Stabilization of Reactants Intermediates and Products These unstable intermediates are higher in energy than the reactants and hence the transition state which is even higher in energy than the intermediates must have a structure which resembles the intermediates more than the reactants ie for the charged carbanion and carbocation intermediates there is a developing charge in the transition state The thermodynamics of the reactions is determined by the change in free energy between the intermediates and the reactants while the kinetics of the reaction is determined by the difference in free energy between the transition states and the reactants A catalyst lowers the energy of the transition state without affecting the energies of the reactants or intermediates assuming that these are free and not bound to the catalyst A comparison of the thermodynamic reactivity of molecules of similar structures can be made by determining the relative stability of the reactants and products from structural considerations Consider two reactants R and R which produce products P and P respectively Any structural features that preferentially stabilizes R compared to R or P compared to P but doesnt stabiiize R and P to the same extent will lead to a greater driving force for R P compared to R This is shown graphically below Mechanisms which lead to the stabilization of a reactant intermediate or product include resonance and inductive effects electron release or withdrawing An example of how the comparative acidity of two similar molecules can be determined through a comparison of their structures is shown below for acetic acid and ethanol An example of how an intermediate can be stabilized through resonance is shown below for the keto enol tautomerization reaction which is favored in the direction of the keto form a a weaker acid than the enol An example of how the inductive effect electron release and withdrawal stabilizedestabilize carbocations and cations is shown below Electron withdrawing by the Fs in the negatively charged conjugate base of trifluoracetic acid helps explains its lower pka compared to acetic acid stabilization of the tertiary carbocation below helps explain the preferential formation of the tertiary alcohol Oxidation of Organic Molecules Organic molecules are usually oxidized in two electron steps Two methods can be used to determined if a C atom in an organic molecule has been oxidized If the number of bonds from the C to oxygen increase or the number of bonds to H decrease the C is oxidized More generally if the number of bonds from C to a more electronegative atom increases or the number of binds from C to a less electronegative atom decrease the carbon is oxidized A more powerful method involves determining the oxidation number of the carbon atoms in the reactant and product If the oxidation number becomes more positive the C is oxidized The general rules for determining oxidation numbers of the atoms in a molecule are O is generally H is usually in molecules consisting of one type of atom like O ie a polyatomic element the atoms have an oxidation number of the sum of the oxidation numbers of the atoms in a molecule equals the net charge on the molecule or ion In general the oxidation number can be calculated as follows assign all nonbonded electrons of an atom to that atom assign all bonded electrons to the more electronegative atom of the two atoms bonded assign one electron of a bond to each atom if the two atoms are identical sum up the assigned electrons from Subtract this number from the total number of electrons usually present in the outer shell of the atom the group number The result is the oxidation number An illustration of the sequential two step oxidation of ethane to acetic acid and assigned oxidation numbers A Review of How to Count Electrons Around an Atom Determining Formal Charge and Oxidation Number Reaction of Carbonyls Aldehydes and Ketones When water reacts with an aldehyde in a nucleophilic addition reaction a diol or a geminal diol results This reacts can be catalyzed by base which acts as the nucleophile its a stronger nucleophile than water and adds to the carbonyl C OH is regenerated when the alkoxide produced abstracts a proton from water regenerating OH When an alcohol adds to an aldehyde or ketone a hemiacetal or hemiketal respectively is formed In the presence of an acid catalyst the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen making the carbonyl more electrophilic After the alcohol adds and forms the hemiacetal or hemketal the acid can protonate the OH group leading to its expulsion as water in an acidcatalyzed elimination The carbocation or resonantform oxonium ion can react with another ROH to form an acetal or ketal If the nucleophile is an amine an addition can occur followed by an elimination to form an imine or Schiff base An acetal or ketal are really geminal ethers as water addition to aldehydes or ketones produced geminal diols As with other ethers these geminal ethers are stable to base and are hence often used as protecting groups to keep aldehydes and ketones from undesired reactions in basic solution Acetal formation is favored by excess anhydrous alcohol in acetic condition while acetal breakdown is accelerated by high concentrations of water and the presence of an acid catalyst Why are ethers and hence acetalsketals resistant to bases They are resistant to nucleophilic attack such as by base since the expelled group alkoxide is unstable Epoxides in contrast will react with OH nucleophiles since the epoxide ring is strained and of high energy Ethers can react with acids however which protonate the ether O to form an oxonium ion Nucleophilic attack such as by Br on an adjacent C can occur SN with electrons flowing to the protonated oxonium ion a great electron sink as it departs Reaction of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives Carboxylic acids undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions assisted by the fact that compared to aldehydes and ketones they have good leaving groups With the substitution reaction the stability of the double bond in the carbonyl is retained Two things control the reactivity of these derivatives the stability of the reactants and the stability of the products The stability of the reactants A reactant is less reactive if stabilized by resonance The figure below shows that the order of increased reactivity of reactants is amide ester anhydride acid chloride The nonbonded electron pair on N of the amide being less electronegative than O can delocalize and form a resonant structure with a double bond with the carbonyl C more readily than the O in the ester An electron pair on the bridging O in the anhydride since its ability to from a double bond in a resonance structure is split between the two carbonyls C is less effective in stabiliziing either side than in the This is called competing resonances The reactant less stabilized by resonance is the acid chloride since a nonbonded pair of electrons on the larger chlorine molecule cant delocalize as readily given CCl bond distance Notice this order of decreased stability based on resonance stabilization is also the order of increased electrophilicity of the carbonyl C which is most electrophilic in the absence of electron delocalization from the adjacent N O or Cl The stability of the products If the deprotonated leaving group is considered as one of the products whch differentiates the different reactions then the order of decreased stability of products is Cl RCOO RO RHN Note the pKa of ROH RNH More on the Thermodynamics of carbonyl reactivity What really determines the stability of products compared to reactants is the strength of bonds made and broken during the reaction In nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and ketones the strength of the bond to the nucleophile must be greater than the strength of the pi bond broken in the carbonyl A CCl bond strength is kcalmol compared to a pi CO bond strength of kcalmol Hence a Cl is not likely to add to a carbonyl C Consider the hydration of formaldehyde carbonyl with Hs acetaldehyde with H and methyl group and acetone with methyl groups The ΔGo for hydration of these is and kcalmol respectively showing that increased electron release toward the carbonyl C which makes it less electrophilic and more stable decreases the reactivity of the carbonyl In nucleophilic substitution the leaving group anion must be more stable than the nucleophile Kinetics of Reactivity of Carbonyls The relative kinetic reactivity of various carbonyls toward nucleophiles follows the order of electrophilicity of the C ie the extent of the positive charge on the carbonyl C The slow step in a nucleophilic attack is breaking the pi carbonyl bond If the reactant is stabilized by resonance in ways that reduces the electrophicity of the carbonyl C the reaction is slowed Nucleophiilicity really is a measure of the affinity of an atom or ion on an electrophilic C which is similar to basicity which is a measure of the affinity of an atom or ion for a proton Halides are not good nucleophiles for reactions with acid derivatives since the halide like Cl is a better leaving group than the actual leaving group Making CC Bonds Metabolism can be divided into catabolic breaking down and anabolic synthetic reactions To obtain energy sugars and fatty acids are converted to carbon dixoide Hence CC bonds must be broken In contrast CC bonds must be synthesized in photosynthesis In all reactions electrons from bond broken flow to atoms where bonds will be made Flow is from a source a pair of electrons possibly with a negative charge to a sink a slightly or fully positive atom Heres a couple ways to make a CC bond react two carbon centered radicals free radical mechanisms are uncommon biologically react a carbocation with a carbanion A carbocation is unstable unless incorporated into a molecule in which it is stable so instead of using them the carbonyl C is used as the electrophilic carbon Instability of carbocations is reflected in their propensity to rearrangement Taking into account the resonance form of the CO carbonyl bond in with a positive on C and a negative on O the net charge on the carbonyl is about A stabalized carbanion often stabilized as a enolate resonant form is used as the negatively charged carbon One method of making a CC bond is an aldol condensation in which a carbanion formed the deprotonation of a CH alpha to a carbonyl which is stabilized by the enolate resonance form acts as a nucleophile which addes to a carbonyl C in an aldehyde or ketone In another CC bond synthesis reaction a Claisen Condensation a carbanion formed the deprotonation of a CH alpha to a carbonyl which is stabilized by the enolate resonance form acts as a nucleophile which substitutes at a carbonyl C in an ester Breaking CC Bonds In addition to a retroaldol condensation a common method to break a CC is through a decarboxylation reaction at a betaketo acid Notice that the analogous reaction at an alpha keto acid is unlikely since the electrons from the CC bond that is cleaved have no sink to which to flow References Sole et al Fleeting Molecules Extend Their Stay about carbenes Science pg On the

Mined Rock Salt In some countries salt is mined from salt beds approximately m to m ft to ft below Earths surface Sometimes impurities such as clay make it impossible to use rock salt without purification Purification makes it possible to get the desired flavor and color thus making it edible Edible salt is highly refined pure and snow white Salt from Salt Brines Salt can also be mined from natural salt beds by using water to extract the salt in the form of a brine which saves having to construct a mine Holes are drilled approximately cm in in diameter until the salt deposits are reached A pipe is then driven into the salt beds and another pipe is driven inside the larger pipe further into the deposits Pressurized water is forced through the outer pipe into the salt beds and then pumped back out through the smaller pipe to the refineries Through separation of the impurities eventually all water in the brine will evaporate leaving crystallized salt which then can be dried sifted and graded in different sizes Ocean Sea and Lake Salt In some countries especially those with dry and warm climates salt is recovered straight from the ocean or salt lakes The salt water is collected in large shallow ponds also calledsalt gardens where through the heat of the sun the water slowly evaporates Moving the salt solution from one pond to another until the salt crystals become clear and the water has evaporated eliminates impurities The salt is then purified dried completely crushed sifted and graded Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American

PulsesContributors and Attributions Several other types of grains are commonly used in baking In particular corn and oats feature predominantly in certain types of baking quick breads and cookies respectively for instance but increasingly rice flour is being used in baked goods particularly for people with gluten sensitivities or intolerances The trend to whole grains and the influence of different ethnic cultures has also meant the increase in the use of other grains and pulses for flours used in breads and baking in general Corn Corn is one of the most widely used grains in the world and not only for baking Corn in used in breads and cereals but also to produce sugars such as dextrose and corn syrup starch plastics adhesives fuel ethanol and alcohol bourbon and other whisky It is produced from the maize plant the preferred scientific and formal name of the plant that we callcorn in North America There are different varieties of corn some of which are soft and sweet corn you use for eating fresh or for cooking and some of which are starchy and are generally dried to use for baking animal feed and popcorn Varieties Used in Baking Cornmeal has a sandy texture and is ground to fine medium and coarse consistencies It has most of the husk and germ removed and is used is recipes from the American South eg cornbread and can be used to add texture to other types of breads and pastry Stoneground cornmeal has a texture not unlike whole wheat flour as it contains some of the husk and germ Stone ground cornmeal has more nutrients but it is also more perishable In baking it acts more like cake flour due to the lack of gluten Corn flour in North America is very finely ground cornmeal that has had the husk and germ removed It has a very soft powdery texture In the UK and Australia corn flour refers to cornstarch Cornstarch is the starch extracted from the maize kernel It is primarily used as a thickener in baking and other cooking Cornstarch has a very fine powdery consistency and can be dissolved easily in water As a thickening agent it requires heat to set and will produce products with a shiny clear consistency Blue cornmeal has a light blue or violet colour and is produced from whole kernels of blue corn It is most similar to stoneground cornmeal and has a slightly sweet flavour Rice Rice is another of the worlds most widely used cereal crops and forms the staple for much of the worlds diet Because rice is not grown in Canada it is not regulated by the Canadian Grain Commission Varieties Used in Baking Rice flour is prepared from finely ground rice that has had the husks removed It has a fine slightly sandy texture and provides crispness while remaining tender due to its lack of gluten For this reason many glutenfree breads are based on rice flours or blends that contain rice flour Short grain or pearl rice is also used in the pastry shop to produce rice pudding and other desserts Oats Oats are widely used for animal feed and food production as well as for making breads cookies and dessert toppings Oats add texture to baked goods and desserts Varieties Used in Baking Bakers will most often encounter rolled oats which are produced by pressing the dehusked whole kernels through rollers Oat bran and oat flour are produced by grinding the oat kernels and separating out the bran and endosperm Whole grain oat flour is produced by grinding the whole kernel but leaving the ground flour intact Steelcut oats are more commonly used in cooking and making breakfast cereals and are the chopped oat kernels Other Grains and Pulses A wide range of additional flours and grains that are used in ethnic cooking and baking are becoming more and more widely available in Canada These may be produced from grains such as kamut spelt and quinoa pulses such as lentils and chickpeas and other crops such as buckwheat that have a grainlike consistency when dried Increasingly with allergies and intolerances on the rise these flours are being used in bakeshops as alternatives to wheatbased products for customers with special dietary needs Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University

Prof Henry Jakubowski College of St BenedictSt Johns University Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Extraction of Rye FlourContributors and Attributions Rye is a hardy cereal grass cultivated for its grain Its use by humans can be traced back over years Once a staple food in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe rye declined in popularity as wheat became more available through world trade A crop well suited to northern climates rye is grown on the Canadian Prairies and in the northern states such as the Dakotas and Wisconsin Rye flour is the only flour other than wheat that can be used without blending with wheat flour to make yeastraised breads Nutritionally it is a grain comparable in value to wheat In some cases for example its lysine content an amino acid is even biologically superior The brown grain is cleaned tempered and milled much like wheat grain One difference is that the rye endosperm is soft and breaks down into flour much quicker that wheat As a result it does not yield semolina so purifiers are seldom used The bran is separated from the flour by the break roller and the flour is further rolled and sifted while being graded into chop meal light flour medium flour and dark flour Chop This is the millers name for the coarse stock after grinding in a break roller mill Meal Like chop meal is made of extraction obtained by grinding the entire rye kernel Light rye flour This is obtained from the centre of the rye kernel and is low in protein and high in starch content It can be compared to white bread flour and is used to make light rye breads Medium rye flour This is straight flour and consists of all the kernels after the bran and shorts have been removed It is light grey in colour has an ash content of and is used for a variety of sourdough breads Dark rye flour This is comparable to first clear wheat flour It has an ash content of and a protein content of It is used primarily for heavier types of rye bread The lighter rye flours are generally bleached usually with a chlorine treatment The purpose of bleaching is to lighten the colour since there is no improvement on the gluten capability of the flour Extraction of Rye Flour The grade of extraction of rye flour is of great importance to the yield of the dough and the creation of a particular flavour in the baked bread Table shows the percentage of the dry substances of rye flour by grade of extraction Table Table of extraction for rye flour Substance Grade of Extraction Ash Fat Protein Sugar Starch Crude fibre Pentosans Undefinable Note that ash fibre and pentosans are higher in the extraction rate flour and starch is lower Pentosans are gummy carbohydrates that tend to swell when moistened and in baking help to give the rye loaf its cohesiveness and structure The pentosan level in rye flour is greater than that of wheat flour and is of more significance for successful rye bread baking Rye flours differ from wheat flours in the type of gluten that they contain Although some dark rye flours can have a gluten content as high as this is only gliadin The glutenin which forms the elasticity in dough is absent and therefore doughs made only with rye flour will not hold the gas produced by the yeast during fermentation This results in a small and compact loaf of bread Starch and pentosans are far more important to the quality of the dough yield than gluten Starch is the chief component of the flour responsible for the structure of the loaf Its breadmaking ability hinges on the age of the flour and the acidity While rye flour does not have to be aged as much as wheat flour it has both a best after and a best before date Three weeks after milling is considered to be good When the rye flour is freshly milled the starch gelatinizes sets quickly at a temperature at which amylases are still very active As a result bread made from fresh flour may be sticky and very moist At the other extreme as the starch gets older it gelatinizes less readily the enzymes cannot do their work and the loaf may split and crack A certain amount of starch breakdown must occur for the dough to be able to swell The moisture content of rye flour should be between and The less water in the flour the better its storage ability Rye should be stored under similar conditions to wheat flour Differences between Rye and Wheat Here is a short list of the differences between rye and wheat Rye is more easily pulverized Rye does not yield semolina Gluten content in rye is not a significant doughmaking factor Starch is more important for bread making in rye flour than in wheat flour The pentosan level in rye flour is higher and more important for bread making Rye flour has greater water binding capability than wheat flour due to its starch and pentosan content In summary both wheat and rye have a long history in providing the staff of life They are both highly nutritious North American mills have stateoftheart technology that compensates for crop differences thus ensuring that the baker has a reliable and predictable raw material Flour comes in a great variety of types specially formulated so that the baker

Examples of dessert saucesApplying dessert saucesContributors and Attributions Sauces enhance desserts by both their flavor and their appearance just as savory sauces enhance meats fish and vegetables Crème anglaise chocolate sauce caramel sauce and the many fruit sauces and coulis are the most versatile One or another of these sauces will complement nearly every dessert Examples of dessert sauces Caramel sauce A proper caramel flavor is a delicate balance between sweetness and bitterness As sugar cooks and begins to change color a flavor change will occur The darker the sugar the more bitter it will become Depending on the application for the finished caramel it can be made mild or strong At this point a liquid is added This liquid will serve several roles it will stop the cooking process it can add richness and flavor and it will soften the sauce The fluidity of the finished sauce will depend on the amount of liquid added to it and the temperature it is served at Dairy products such as cream milk or butter will add richness use water for a clear sauce use fruit purées to add different flavor elements Chocolate sauce Sometimes called fudge sauce chocolate sauce is generally made from cream or milk butter and chocolate and can be served hot or cold The proportion of each of the ingredients will affect the thickness of the final product Compote French for mixture a compote is cooked fruit served in its own cooking liquid usually a sugar syrup Compotes can be made with fresh frozen or dried fruits and served hot or cold Coulis French for strained liquid a coulis is most often an uncooked strained purée Flavors remain pure and the colors bright One of the drawbacks of using a coulis is that it may separate quickly when used as a plating sauce Its best to use à la minute Crème anglaise French for English custard crème anglaise is a rich pourable custard sauce that can be served hot or cold over cake fruits or other desserts Made with eggs sugar and milk or cream it is stirred over heat until it thickens into a light sauce However its a delicate operation too much heat turns it into scrambled eggs It should not get above C F during the cooking process Vanilla is the classic flavoring but coffee spices chocolate or liqueurs can be added With additional yolks and heavy cream it becomes the custard used for French ice cream With additional yolks gelatin whipped cream and flavoring it becomes Bavarian cream Curd A curd is creamy and fruit based with citrus and berry flavors being the most popular Made from fruit juices eggs butter and sugar cooked in a process similar to crème anglaise curds can be thick pourable sauces or spreads Fruit butter Fruit butter is a spread made from whole fruits cooked reduced and puréed if you dont want any chunks in it until very thick It does not contain any butter the term refers to the consistency Fruit sauce A fruit sauce is a fruit purée cooked and thickened with a starch It is normally served cold Hard sauce This traditional sauce for Christmas pudding or any steamed pudding is made by combining butter sugar and flavorings often liqueurs It is normally piped into shapes and chilled then placed on the warm dessert just before serving Sabayon Sabayon is a mixture of egg yolks flavoring and sugar beaten over simmering water until thick then beaten until cool It is traditionally flavored with sweet white wine or liquor then served over fresh fruit and grilled when it is called a gratin The Italian version of this is called azabaglione and isflavored with Madeira wine Whipped cream This very popular dessert topping can be served plain sweetened or flavoredCrème chantilly a classic version of this is a combination of whipped cream sugar and vanilla Applying dessert sauces Except in the case of some homestyle or frozen desserts sauces are usually not ladled over the dessert because doing so would mar the appearance Instead the sauce is applied in a decorative fashion to the plate rather than the dessert Many different styles of plate saucing are available Pouring a pool of sauce onto the plate is knownfloaosding Although plate flooding often looks old fashioned today it can still be a useful technique for many desserts Flooded plates can be made more attractive by applying a contrasting sauce and then blending or feathering the two sauces decoratively with a pick or the end of a knife For this technique to work the two sauces should be at about the same fluidity or consistency Rather than flooding the entire plate it may be more appropriate for some desserts to apply a smaller pool of sauce to the plate as this avoids overwhelming the dessert with too much sauce A variation of the flooding technique is outlining where a design is piped onto the plate with chocolate and allowed to set The spaces can then be flooded with colorful sauces A squeeze bottle is useful for making dots lines curves and streaks of sauce in many patterns Or just a spoon is needed to drizzle random patterns of sauce onto a plate Another technique for saucing is applying a small amount of sauce and streaking it with a brush an offset spatula or the back of a spoon Sauces are a great way to highlight flavors Choose ones that will create balance on the plate not just for color but with all the components A tart berry sauce will complement a rich cheesecake or chocolate dessert because sourness acid will cut through fat making it taste lighter than it is A sweet sauce served with a sweet dessert will have the overall effect of hiding flavors in both Hold back on sweetness in order to intensify other flavors Many modern presentations may have a minimal amount of sauce Sometimes this is done just for aesthetic reasons and not for how it will complement the dessert Think of the dish and the balance of the components This is the most important factor flavor first presentation second Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Many ingredients are used to enhance the taste of foods These ingredients can be used to provide both seasoning and flavoring Seasoning means to bring out or intensify the natural flavor of the food without changing it Seasonings are usually added near the end of the cooking period The most common seasonings are salt pepper and acids such as lemon juice When seasonings are used properly they cannot be tasted their job is to heighten the flavors of the original ingredients Flavoring refers to something that changes or modifies the original flavor of the food Flavoring can be used to contrast a taste such as adding liqueur to a dessert where both the added flavor and the original flavor are perceptible Or flavorings can be used to create a unique flavor in which it is difficult to discern what the separate flavorings are Spice blends used in pumpkin pies are a good example of this Knowing how to use seasonings and flavorings skillfully provides cooks and bakers with an arsenal with which they can create limitless flavor combinations Flavoring and seasoning ingredients include wines spirits fruit zests extracts essences and oils However the main seasoning and flavoring ingredients are classified as herbs and spices Knowing the difference between herbs and spices is not as important as knowing how to use seasonings and flavorings skillfully In general fresh seasonings are added late in the cooking process while dry ones tend to be added earlier It is good practice to underseason during the cooking process and then add more seasonings particularly if you are using fresh ones just before presentation This is sometimes referred to as layering When baking it is difficult to add more seasoning at the end so testing recipes to ensure the proper amount of spice is included is a critical process Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez

Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions When sodium bicarbonate baking soda is moistened and heated it releases carbon dioxide gas If it is moistened and heated in the presence of sufficient acid it will release twice as much gas as if it is moistened and heated without the presence of an acid Slightly acidic ingredients provide the mix with some of the necessary acids for the release of carbon dioxide gas Examples are Honey Molasses Ginger Cocoa Bran For this reason some of the mixes contain baking powder only while others contain a combination of baking powder and baking soda If an excessive amount of baking soda is used in a cake batter without the presence of sufficient acid the normally white cake crumb will have a yellowishbrown color and a strong undesirable smell of soda The gas evolves very fast at the beginning of baking when thepH level is still on the acidic side pH of around to Once the soda neutralizes the acid the dough or batter quickly becomes alkaline and the release of gas is reduced Mixes and doughs leavened with baking soda must be handled without delay or the release of the gas may be almost exhausted before the product reaches the oven The darker color of the crumb found on the bottom half of a cake or muffins is caused by the partial dehydration of the batter that is heated first during baking In spiced honey cookies and gingerbread baking soda is used alone to give them quick color during baking and yet keep the products soft In chocolate cakes baking soda is used in conjunction with baking powder to keep the pH at a desirable level However it is important to know whether the cocoa powder you are using is natural or treated by the Dutch process In the Dutch process some of the acid in the cocoa is already neutralized and there is less left for the release of gas in the mix This means more baking powder and less baking soda is used Baking soda in a chocolate mix not only counteracts the acid content in the baked cake but also improves the grain and color of the cake A darker and richer chocolate color is produced if the acid level is sufficient to release all the carbon dioxide gas On the other hand the reddish coarse opengrained crumb in devils food cake is the result of using baking soda as the principal leavening agent The level of baking soda depends on the nature of the product and on the other ingredients in the formula Cookies for example with high levels of fat and sugar do not require much if any leavening Table provides the recommended amounts of baking soda for different products Note that the percentages appear small compared to the level of baking powder suggested because baking powder contains both an acid agent and a leavening agent Table Recommended amounts of baking soda Product Amount of Baking Soda of flour weight Cookies Cakes Cake doughnuts Pancakes Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez

analogy of sourcesink write a reasonable mechanism which shows electron flow during the reaction With the exception of the first reaction all require a vitamin derivative to facilitate electron flow Imagine reaction one occurring spontaneously in solution in the absence of an enzyme although enzymes exists to catalyze this reaction The rest of the reactions involve vitamin derivatives as part of an enzymecatalyzed reaction Draw plausible mechanisms for each of the reactions below showing the flow of electrons from a source to a sink The source might often be a pair of electrons on an anion which was formed by prior removal of a proton from the atom by a general base A sink could be a carbonyl O which receives a pair of electrons from one of the double CO bonds of the carbonyl As a bond is made to the carbonyl one of the double bonds must break with the electrons going temporarily if the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution reaction to the carbonyl O an excellent sink since it is

that pyridoxal phosphate was created to provide satisfaction and enlightenment to those enzymologists and chemists who enjoy pushing electrons for no other coenzyme is involved in such a wide variety of reactions in both enzyme and model systems which can be reasonably interpreted in terms of the chemical properties of the coenzyme Most of these reactions are made possible by a common structural feature That is electron withdrawal toward the cationic nitrogen atom of the imine and into the electron sink of the pyridoxal ring from the alpha carbon atom of the attached amino acid activates all

a cartoon and words the changes in the LUV on addition of SMase and of TX The same experiment was repeated addition of SMase to the LUVs but instead of monitoring SM hydrolysis glycoylneuraminic acid cleavage from the added GM was studied Aliquots of the vesicle suspension were removed at fixed timesafter the addition of sphingomyelinase and analyzed for theGM product of neuraminidase activity The results are shown in Figure B below Figure B GM ganglioside hydrolysis by entrapped neuraminidase Average values SE n Describe the main difference in the results shown in graph b compared to A Explain using a cartoon and words the changes in the LUV on addition of SMase and of TX How was added GM which is found in the outer leaflet cleaved by neuramidase which is encapsulated One explanation was that some encapsulated neuramidase leaked from the inside to the outside and the GM cleaved in the above experiment was in the outer leaftletTo determine if neuraminidase was present on the outside of the LUVs its activity against SMase treated vesicles as describe above was determined The LUVs were filtered through membrane with small pores allowing free neuramidase to pass through but not encapsulated LUV They assayed the neuramidase using a soluble substrate of the enzyme NacetylneuraminylGalGlu The results are shown in Figure A Figure A Fraction of released neuraminidase in the time course of sphingomyelinase action Free neuraminidase was separated from the vesicles by filtration Average values SE n Does the constant presence of neuramindase present from minutes suggest constant leakage from the LUVs or an leakage arising from the filtration method Note that the value at minutes the moment of SMase addition is the same at later times Explain Are the results consistent with the cleavage of GM shown in figure B from leaked neuramindase Vesiclescontaining GM but not sphingomyelinase or internal neuraminidasewere treated with neuraminidase at the concentration found inthe filtrates above Figure B hydrolyzed GM ganglioside when LUVs not containing neuraminidase were treated with the same amount of neuraminidase that was released in the experiment in A Average values of two closely similar experiments O data of Figure B SMase added to LUVs with encapsulated neuraminidase replotted for comparison Compare the times course of GM hydrolysisis totally different from the one depending on sphingomyelinaseactivity Suggest a hypothesis to account for the enhanced hydrolysis of GM in the presence of SMase Draw a cartoon diagram in your explanation In another experiment antibody that binds and neutralizes the activity of neuraminidase was added to preformed LUVs and experiment repeated The graphs below the two cases Figure C GM ganglioside hydrolysis by LUVs with encapsulated neuraminidase with and without antineuraminidase antibody added to the LUV suspension Average values SE n The paper did not define the symbols but one is in the absence of added antibody and the other in the presence of added antibody The curves differ little Using the data presented in Graphs draw a cartoon and explain the sequence of events in the cleavage of GM by neuraminidase LUVs identical to those made above but with the added fluorophore NBDPE were prepared The structure of NBDPE is shown below After the LUVs were made the liposomes were treated with the membraneimpermeant sodium dithionite which reduces NBD fluorescence Excess dithionitewas removed immediately by gel filtration Note any remaining flourescence is from inner leaflet NBDPE LUVs were then treated withsphingomyelinase Enzyme activity was the same as describedin Figure A Aliquots were removed from the reaction mixtureat regular intervals and mixed with an impermeant nonspecific antibody IgG labeled with another fluorophore rhodamine When NBD is excited with UV light it fluorescence emission wavelength overlaps the excitation wavelength of rhodamine If the two fluorphores are close enough excitation of NBD can lead to rhodamine fluorescence emission in a process called fluorescence resonance energy transfer Figure Excitation Emission ___Spectra of NBD green and rhodamine blue Results are shown in the Figure below Control experiments also shown in the figureindicated that in the absence of sphingomyelinase NBDPE fluorescenceremained invariant with time Figure Sphingomyelin hydrolysis as in Figure A time course of NBDPE fluorescence intensity O time course of RhoIgG fluorescence intensity triangles are the respective controls in the absence of sphingomyelinase Compare the relative changes see in the presence of SMase with the relative lack of change in its absence Are these results consistent with the results from the other experiments

AllspiceAniseCarawayCardamomCinnamonCassiaClovesGingerMaceNutmegPoppy SeedSesame or Benne SeedVanillaContributors and Attributions Spices are aromatic substances obtained from the dried parts of plants such as the roots shoots fruits bark and leaves They are sold as seeds blends of spices whole or ground spices and seasonings The aromatic substances that give a spice its particular aroma and flavor are the essential oils The flavor of the essential oil or flavoring compound will vary depending on the quality and freshness of the spice The aromas of ground spices are volatile This means they lose their odor or flavoring when left exposed to the air for extended periods They should be stored in sealed containers when not in use Whole beans or unground seeds have a longer shelf life but should also be stored in sealed containers Allspice Allspice is only one spice yet it has a flavor resembling a blend of cloves nutmeg and cinnamon At harvest time the mature but still green berries from the allspice trees a small tropical evergreen are dried in the sun During drying they turn reddishbrown and become small berries The berries are about cm in in diameter and contain dark brown seeds Allspice is grown principally in Jamaica and to a lesser degree in Mexico Allspice is available whole or ground Bakers usually use ground allspice in cakes cookies spices and pies Anise Anise is the small greengrey fruit or seed of a plant of the parsley family The plant grows to a height of cm in and has fine leaves with clusters of small white flowers It is native to Mexico and Spain with the latter being the principal producer Anise seeds are added to pastries breads cookies and candies Caraway Caraway is the dried fruit or seed of a biennial plant of the parsley family harvested every second year primarily in the Netherlands It is also produced in Poland and Russia The manybranched hollowstemmed herb grows up to cm in high and has small white flowers Caraway is a small crescentshaped brown seed with a pleasant aroma but somewhat sharp taste Although it is most familiar in rye bread caraway is also used in cookies and cakes Cardamom Native to India Sri Lanka and Guatemala cardamom is the fruit or seed of a plant of the ginger family The threesided creamywhite flavorless pod holds the tiny aromatic dark brown seeds It is available in whole and ground pod removed Cardamom in ground form flavors Danish pastries and coffee cakes Christmas baking and Easter baking such as hot cross buns Cinnamon Cinnamon comes from the bark of an aromatic evergreen tree It is native to China Indonesia and Indochina Cinnamon may be purchased in ground form or as cinnamon sticks Ground cinnamon is used in pastries breads puddings cakes candy and cookies Cinnamon sticks are used for preserved fruits and flavoring puddings Cinnamon sugar is made with approximately g oz of cinnamon to kg lb of granulated sugar Cassia Cassia sometimes known as Chinese cinnamon is native to Assam and Myanmar It is similar to cinnamon but a little darker with a sharper taste It is considered better for savory rather than sweet foods It is prized in Germany and some other countries as a flavor in chocolate Cloves Cloves are the dried unopened buds of a tropical evergreen tree native to Indonesia The flavor is characterized by a sweet pungent spiciness The nailshaped whole cloves are mainly used in cooking but the ground version of this spice heightens the flavor of mincemeat baked goods fruit pies and plum pudding Ginger Ginger is one of the few spices that grow below the ground It is native to southern Asia but is now imported from Jamaica India and Africa The part of the ginger plant used is obtained from the root Ground ginger is the most commonly used form in baking in fruitcakes cookies fruit pies and gingerbread Candied ginger is used in pastries and confectionery Mace Originating in the East and West Indies mace is the fleshy growth between the nutmeg shell and outer husk yelloworange in color It is usually sold ground but sometimes whole mace blades of mace is available Mace is used in pound cakes breads puddings and pastries Nutmeg Nutmeg is the kernel or seed of the nutmeg fruit The fruit is similar to the peach The fleshy husk grooved on one side splits releasing the deepbrown aromatic nutmeg It is available whole or ground Ground nutmeg is used extensively in custards cream puddings spice cakes gingerbread and doughnuts Poppy Seed Poppy seed comes from the Netherlands and Asia The minute bluegrey kidneyshaped seeds are so small they seem to be round Poppy seeds are used in breads and rolls cakes and cookies and fillings for pastries Sesame or Benne Seed Sesame or benne seeds are the seeds of the fruit of a tropical annual herb grown in India China and Turkey The seeds are tiny shiny and creamywhite with a rich almondlike flavor and aroma Bakers use sesame seeds in breads buns coffee cakes and cookies Vanilla The Spaniards named vanilla The word derives from vaina meaning pod Vanilla is produced from an orchidtype plant native to Central America The vanilla beans are cured by a complicated process which helps explain the high cost of genuine vanilla The cured pods should be black in color and packed in airtight boxes Imitation vanilla extracts are made from a colorless crystalline synthetic compound called vanillin Pure vanilla extract is superior to imitation vanilla Artificial vanilla is more intense than real vanilla by a factor of to and must be used sparingly To use vanilla beans split the pod down the middle to scrape out the seeds The seeds are the flavoring agents Alternatively the split pod can be simmered in the milk or cream used in dessert preparation Its flavoring power is not spent in one cooking and it can be drained kept frozen and reused A vanilla bean kept in a container of icing sugar imparts the flavor to the sugar all ready for use in cookies and cakes Vanilla extract is volatile at temperatures starting at C F and is therefore not ideal for flat products such as cookies It is suitable for cakes where the interior temperature does not get so high Vanilla beans and vanilla extract are used extensively by bakers to flavor a wide range of desserts and other items Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel

Transition Is Required for Activity of the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein StAR Bo Y Baker Dustin C Yaworsky and Walter L Miller J Biol Chem Vol Issue December Steroids synthesis requires cholesterol which get converted to pregnenolone by an enzyme in the inner mitochondrial membrane IM A regulatory protein which we will call SR is found in the outer mitochondrial membrane OM and is involved in cholesterol movement from the OM to the IM Mutations in SR can cause congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia a potentially lethal disease The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a MW preprotein whose N terminal leader sequence targets SR to the mitochondria Upon translocation of the protein to the IM the leader is cleaved by proteolysis and is removed from the final active protein The Cterminus must be critical for its function since mutations in this region causes the hyperplasia discussed above Models of SR suggest that it is similar to related protein that have a βbarrel structure with a hydrophobic binding pocket which can bind cholesterol If the first Nterminal amino acids are removed from the precursor preprotein the protein N SR retains activity When added to LUVs with a lipid composition similar to the OM only the Cterminal alpha helical end of the protein is protected from added proteases suggesting that that end inserts into the OM effectively tethering the protein to the OM Using spectral analysis and proteolysis of the protein it appears that the protein may adopt a molten globule state at both low pH or when bound to a LUV A conformation change appears to be induced when the protein interacts with protonated head groups of the LUV The Cterminal helix is more protected from proteolysis at pH compared to Modeling studies based on xray structures of homologous proteins show that the access channel to the hydrophobic binding site in the protein is not large enough to pass cholesterol These results show that the protein must change conformations to elicit its biological activity The experiments described below were done to determine if a conformational change occurs in the protein on interaction with lipids and whether a molten globule state of the protein is formed A model structure of N SR is shown below in Figure A It has a tightly folded Nterminal domain and a more loosely folded Cterminal domain A molecular dynamics simulation of the protein under different protonation states was done in a bath of water molecules in order to simulate possible conformational changes in the protein The first charge state was defined to be neutral simulating pH Next they changed the protonation state of amino acids to reflect expected charges under acidic pH condition which might promote a change to the molten globule state In a last trial they left the majority of the protein under neutral pH condition but changed just the charge state of the Cterminal helix to acidic pH conditions FIGURE Modeling and molecular

promote access of cholesterol to sterol binding pocket in the protein In an attempt to run an additional control for their in silico molecular dynamics experiment the authors found two pairs of amino acids with the amino acids in each pair being approximately angstroms from each other in the C helix and adjacent loop The two pairs were Ser Ser and Asp Ala They changed them to Cys and created in silico the following mutation pairs in single letter code SCSC and DCAC Note DA mutant places the C closer to the end of the C helix than in the SS mutant where the C is position Why did they believe that changes these amino acids to Cys would not dramatically change the folding of the protein Energy minimization results showed that the Cα backbone of the Cterminal helix or Ω loop did not change What would the likely effect be on the local structure in the vicinity of the pair How would the molecular dynamics simulation in the top panel of C change The mutants described above where made using

Chemically sugar consists of carbon C oxygen O and hydrogen H atoms and is classified as a carbohydrate There are three main groups of sugars classified according to the way the atoms are arranged together in the molecular structure These groups are the following Monosaccharides or simple sugars Dextrose glucose is the major monosaccharide Others are levulose or fructose found in honey and many fruits and galactose which is a milk sugar Such sugars do not readily crystallize Mono means one indicating that the sugar consists of only one molecule Disaccharides or complex sugars Sucrose common sugar is the primary example of a disaccharide Maltose found in cereals and lactose found in milk are others Polysaccharides Examples are starches dextrins and cellulose Bakers are not concerned with polysaccharides but rather with the monosaccharides and disaccharides The latter two both sweeten but they cannot be used interchangeably because they have different effects on the end product These differences are touched on later in the book Sugar Names It is helpful to understand some of the conventions of the names of different sugars Note that sugar names often end in ose sucrose dextrose maltose lactose etc Sucrose is the chemical name for sugar that comes from the cane and beet sugar plants Note that glucose is the chemical name for a particular type of sugar What is sometimes confusing is that glucose occurs naturally as a sugar molecule in substances such as honey but it is also produced industrially from the maize plant corn The Canadian Food and Drug Regulations FDR govern the following definitions Sugars All monosaccharides and disaccharides Used for nutrition labelling purposes Sweetening agent Any food for which a standard is provided in Division of the Food and Drug Regulation or any combination of these Includes sugar sucrose sugar syrups and molasses derived from sugar cane or sugar beet dextrose glucose and syrups honey and lactose Excludes sweeteners considered to be food additives Sweetening ingredient Any sugar invert sugar honey dextrose glucose or glucose solids or any combination of these in dry or liquid form Designed for sweetening fruits vegetables and their products and substitutes Maple syrup The syrup obtained by the concentration of maple sap or by the dilution or solution of a maple product other than maple sap in potable water Sweetener Any food additive listed as a sweetener Includes both sugar alcohols and high intensity sweeteners such as acesulfamepotassium aspartame and sucralose Sugar alcohols Food additives that may be used as sweeteners Includes isomalt lactitol maltitol maltitol syrup mannitol sorbitol sorbitol syrup xylitol and erythritol Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American

raw sugar that arrives at the ports is not legally edible being full of impurities At the refinery the raw brown sugar goes through many stages Washing and boiling Filtering to remove impurities Evaporation to the desired crystal size under vacuum to avoid caramelization Centrifuging in which the fluid is spun off leaving the crystals Drying in a rotating drum with hot air Packaging in various sizes depending on the intended market Sugar beet undergoes identical steps after the initial processing which involves Slicing the beets and extracting the sugar with hot water Removing impurities Filtration Concentration in evaporators From here the process is identical to the final steps in cane processing See Figure which illustrates the process Some of the sugar passes through a machine that presses the moist sugar into cubes and wraps and packages them still other sugar is made into icing sugar The sugar refining process is completely mechanical and machine operators hands never touch the sugar Brown and yellow sugars are produced only in cane sugar refineries When sugar syrup flows from the centrifuge machine it passes through further filtration and purification stages and is reboiled in vacuum pans such as the two illustrated in Figure The sugar crystals are then centrifuged but not washed so the sugar crystals still retain some of the syrup that gives the product its special flavour and colour During the whole refining process almost scientific checks for quality control are made while workers in research laboratories at the refineries constantly carry out experiments to improve the refining processand the final product Sugar is carefully checked at the mills and is guaranteed to have a high purity Government standards both in the United States and Canada require a purity of at least sucrose Are animal ingredients included in white sugar Bone char often referred to as natural carbon is widely used by the sugar industry as a decolourizing filter which allows the sugar cane to achieve its desirable white colour Other types of filters involve granular carbon or an ionexchange system rather than bone char Bone char is made from the bones of cattle and it is heavily regulated by the European Union and the USDA Only countries that are deemed BSEfree can sell the bones of their cattle for this process Bone char is also used in other types of sugar Brown sugar is created by adding molasses to refined sugar so companies that use bone char in the production of their regular sugar also use it in the production of their brown sugar Confectioners sugar refined sugar mixed with cornstarch made by these companies also involves the use of bone char Fructose may but does not typically involve a bonechar filter Bone char is not used at the sugar beet factory in Taber Alberta or in Montreals cane refinery Bone char is used only at the Vancouver cane refinery All products under the Lantic trademark are free of bone char For the products under the Rogers trademark all Taber sugar beet products are also free of bone char In order to differentiate the Rogers Taber beet products from the Vancouver cane products you can verify the inkedjet code printed on the product Products with the code starting with the number are from Taber Alberta while products with the code starting with the number are from Vancouver If you want to avoid all refined sugars there are alternatives such as sucanat and turbinado sugar which are not filtered with bone char Additionally beet sugar though normally refined never involves the use of bone

maltitol mannitol and xylitol Please see the Health Canada website for more information on sugar substitutes Bakers must be careful when replacing sugar sucrose with these sugar substitutes in recipes Even though the sweetness comparison levels may be similar or less it is generally not possible to do straight for substitution Sugar sucrose plays many roles in a recipe It is a bulking agent It absorbs moisture It is a tenderizer It adds moisture and extends shelf life It adds color caramelization Sugar substitutes may not work in a recipe in the same way More information on sugar

RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Sugar is the third most used ingredient in the bakeshop Sugar has several functions in baking The most recognized purpose is of course to sweeten food but there are many other reasons sugar is used in cooking and baking It can be used for browning effect both caramelization and the Maillard reaction on everything from breads to cookies to cakes Browning gives a pleasant colour and flavour to the finished product Caramelization results from the action of heat on sugars At high temperatures the chemical changes associated with melting sugars result in a deep brown colour and new flavours The Maillard reaction results from chemical interactions between sugars and proteins at high heat An amino group from a protein combines with a reducing sugar to produce a brown colour in a variety of foods eg brewed coffee fried foods and breads It acts as the most important tenderizing agent in all baked goods and one of the factors responsible for the spread in cookies It helps delay the formation of gluten which is essential for maintaining a soft or tender product It makes an important contribution to the way we perceive the texture of food For example adding sugar to ice cream provides body and texture which is perceived as smoothness This addition helps prevent lactose crystallization and thus reduces sugar crystal formation that otherwise causes a grainy texture sometimes associated with frozen dairy products It preserves food when used in sufficient quantity In baking it increases the effectiveness of yeast by providing an immediate and more usable source of nourishment for the yeasts growth This hastens the leavening process by producing more carbon dioxide which allows the dough to rise at a quicker and more consistent rate Just as there are many functions of sugar in the bakeshop there are different uses for the various types of sugar as well Fine granulated sugar is most used by bakers It generally dissolves easily in mixes and is pure enough for sugar crafters to boil for pulled sugar decorations Coarse granulated sugar may be used for a topping on sugar cookies puff pastry and Danish pastries as it doesnt liquefy or caramelize so readily In some European countries an extra coarse sugar called hail a literal translation is used for this purpose Icing or powdered sugar is used in icings and fillings and in sifted form as a top decoration on many baked goods Brown or yellow sugars are used where their unique flavor is important or in bakeries where an old fashioned or rustic image is projected Brown sugar can usually be substituted for white sugar without technical problems in sugarbatter mixes such as cakes and muffins and in bread dough Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons

process called replication before a cell divides The replication of DNA allows each daughter cell to contain a full complement of chromosomes Animation of Replication Transcription For a given gene only one strand of the DNA serves as the template for transcription An example is shown below The bottom blue strand in this example is the template strand which is also called the minus strand or the sense strand It is this strand that serves as a template for the mRNA synthesis The enzyme RNA polymerase sythesizes an mRNA in the to direction complementary to this template strand The opposite DNA

A A C G G G A U G G A A A G G As weve learned more about the structure of DNA RNA and proteins it become clear that transcription and translation differ in eukaryotes and prokaryotes Specifically eukaryotes have intervening sequences of DNA introns within a given gene that separating coding fragments of DNA exons A primary transcript is made from the DNA and the introns are sliced out and exons joined in a contiguous stretch to form messenger RNA which leaves the nucleus Translation occurs in the cytoplasm Remember prokaryotes do not have a nucleus Animation of Transcription Animation of mRNA Splicing Translation If information in a mRNA sequence is decoded to form a protein In this process a triplet of nucleotides a codon in the RNA has the information of a single amino acid Translation occurs on a large RNAprotein complex called the ribosome An intermediary transfer RNA tRNA molecule becomes covalently linked to a single amino acid by the enzyme tRNAacyl synthetase This charged tRNA binds through a complementary anticodon region to the triplet codon in the tRNA The ribosometRNA complex ratchets down the mRNA allowing a new charged tRNA complex to bind at an adjacent site The two adjacent amino acids form a peptide bond in a process driven by ATP cleavage This process repeats until a stop codon appears in the mRNA sequence The genetic code shows the relationship between the triplet mRNA codon and the amino acid which corresponds to it in the growing peptide chain Figure CodonAnticodon interactions between mRNA and tRNA Figure Central Dogma Differences in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Animation of Translation As was mentioned in the Protein Chapter amino acid section two other amino acids occasionally appear in proteins excluding amino acids altered through posttranslational modification One is selenocysteine which is found in Arachea eubacteria and animals The other is just recently found is pyrrolysine found on Arachea These new amino acids derive from modification of SertRNA and probably LystRNA after the tRNA is charged with the normal amino acid to produce selenocystRNA and pyrrolystRNA respectively The pyrrolystRNA recognizes the mRNA codon UAG which is usually a stop codon while selenocystRNA recognizes UGA also a stop condon Clearly only a small fraction of stop codons in mRNA sequences would be recognized by this usual tRNA complex What determines that recognition is unclear What is a gene The definition of a gene can differ depending on whom you ask The world gene has literally become a cultural icon of our day Can our genes explain what it is to be human The definition of a gene has changed with time Figure A view of genes and their products Simplicity to Complexity Eukaryotic genes contain exons coding regions and introns intervening sequencings that are transcribed to produce a primary transcript In a posttranscriptional process introns are spliced out by the splicesome to produce a messenger RNA mRNA which is translated into a protein sequence See diagram above Over the last years as our understanding of biochemistry has increased the definition of a gene has evolved from the basis of inheritable traits certain regions of chromosomes a segment of a chromosome that produces one enzyme a segment of a chromosome that produces one protein a segment of a chromosome that produces a functional product The last definition was necessary since some gene products that have function structural and catalytic are RNA molecules The last definition also includes regulatory regions of the chromosome involved in transcriptional control Snyder and Gerstein have developed five criteria that can be used in gene identification which is important as the complete genomes of organisms are analyzed for genes identification of an open reading frame ORF this would include a series of codons bounded by start and stop codons This gets progressively harder to do if the gene has a large number of exons imbedded in long introns specific DNA features within genes these would include a bias towards certain codons found in genes or splice sites to remove intron RNA comparing putative gene sequences for homology with known genes from different organisms but avoiding sequences that might be conserved regulatory regions identification of RNA transcripts or expressed protein which does not require DNA sequence analysis as the top three steps do inactivating chemically or through specific mutagenesis a gene product RNA or protein New findings make it even more complicated to define a gene especially if the transcripts of a gene region are studied Cheng et al studied all transcripts from different human chromosomes and different cell lines They found a large number of different transcripts many of which overlapped Splicing often occur between nonadjacent introns Transcripts were found from both strands and were from regions containing introns and exons Other studies found up to of transcripts continued through the end of gene into other genes of the entire mouse genome which is comprised of only exons is transcribed New Functions for Introns Recent studies have shown that not all of the DNA interspersed between coding sections of eukaryotic DNA introns are devoid of information content Some of the intron DNA information ultimately gets transcribed and ultimately translated into protein structure Introns with this property can be classified in two ways Group introns found commonly in yeast algae viruses and plant mitochondria and chloroplasts After they have been spliced out of transcribed RNA these RNA sequences ultimately get translated into proteins with endonuclease activity These translated proteins differ from typical protein restriction enzymes which bind and cleave DNA at specific DNA sites of about six base pairs leading to many cleavages of chromosomal DNA given the high probability of finding such sites in a large genome Group protein introns recognize specific sequences of base pairs which would be found randomly distributed in the genome only once in about billion base pairs These Group introns are prime candidates for genetic engineering to produce mutant enzymes which could cut only one specific site in the human genome allowing insertion of novel therapeutic DNA sequences into a specific location This would alleviate the problem faced in recent DNA therapy regimes in which a therapeutic DNA is inserted into a virus which inserts randomly into the host DNA potentially leading to mutagenesis of host DNA These endonucleases are often called homing endonucleases Group Intron also form endonucleases with DNA sequence recognition sites of base pairs Both the endonuclease and its RNA coding sequences are involved in ultimate insertion of intron DNA carried on a plasmid into a specific site in host DNA The RNA which is easier to engineer than proteins facilitates specific insertion of intron DNA into host DNA Such insertions can be used to knockout specific genes with high specificity A DNA sequence can be added by linking a gene of interest to the intron DNA of the plasmid Another form of novel junk DNA involves the transcription and ultimate translation of a gene whose structure predicts should be larger than the actual protein which results Posttranslational modification of proteins through select proteolyis is common A subset of some mature proteins result from selective removal of an internal piece of the nascent protein an intein from the N terminal Nextinand C terminal Cextein of the protein and subsequent religation of the Nextein and Cextein through peptide bond formation Intein sequence can even be engineered to connect two different discrete proteins which is stable at low temperatures but n which the intein is spliced out at higher temperatures The splicing of the N and Cextins occur before the intein is removed This process occurs during protein folding and requires no enzymes The biological role if any of inteins is not clear However they can be used in the laboratory in the production and purification of eukaryotic proteins in bacterial whose expression in the absence of an intein produces a protein that is toxic to the bacterial cell or difficult to purify Figure Mechanism of Intein Splicing Powerpoint Animation of Protein Splicing from New England Biolabs The Intein

versatility means that product formulas may be adjusted once the properties of eggs are understood For example in French butter cream egg whites may be substituted in the summer for whole eggs to give a more stable and bacteriafree product egg white is alkaline with pH A yolk or two may be worked into a sweet short paste dough to improve its extensibility Sponge cake formulas can be adjusted for example with the addition of egg yolks in jelly rolls to improve rolling up If a recipe is changed by replacing some or all of the eggs with water two factors must be remembered Water replacement is about of the egg content since egg solids constitute about of the egg Leavening ability is lessened and must be made up by the addition of chemical leavening Other uses of eggs are Leavening They will support many times their own weight of other ingredients through their ability to form a cell structure either alone or in combination with flour The egg white in particular is capable of forming a large mass of cells by building a fine protein network Moistening and binding The fat in eggs provides a moistening effect and the proteins present coagulate when heated binding ingredients together Thickening Eggs are valuable thickeners in the cooking of chiffon pie fillings and custard Emulsifying Lecithin present in the yolk is a natural emulsifier and assists in making smooth batters Customer appeal Eggs enhance the appearance of products through their colour and flavour and they improve texture and grain Structure Eggs bind with other ingredients primarily flour creating the supporting structure for other ingredients Shelf life The shelf life of eggs is extended through the fat content of the yolk Nutrition Eggs are a valuable food in every respect Note however that of the lipid in egg yolk is cholesterol which may be a concern to some people Developments in poultry feed claim to have reduced or eliminated this cholesterol level Tenderizing The fat in eggs acts like a shortening and improves the tenderness of the baked cake Keep these points in mind when using eggs Spots in eggs are due to blood fragments in the ovary Such eggs are edible and may be used The albumen or egg white is soluble in cold water congeals at C F and remains insoluble from then on Cover leftover yolks or whites tightly and refrigerate Add a little water on top of yolks or mix in sugar to prevent crusting Do not return unused portions to the master container Use clean utensils to dip egg products from their containers Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez

carbon dioxide gas which lifts and aerates the dough To mellow and condition the gluten of the dough so that it will absorb the increasing gases evenly and hold them at the same time In baked products yeast increases the volume and improves the flavor texture grain color and eating quality When yeast water and flour are mixed together under the right conditions all the food required for fermentation is present as there is enough soluble protein to build new cells and enough sugar to feed them Activity within the yeast cells starts when enzymes in the yeast change complex sugar into invert sugar The invert sugar is in turn absorbed within the yeast cell and converted into carbon dioxide gas and alcohol Other enzymes in the yeast and flour convert soluble starch into malt sugar which is converted again by other enzymes into fermentable sugar so that aeration goes on from this continuous production of carbon dioxide Proper Handling of Yeast Compressed yeast ages and weakens gradually even when stored in the refrigerator Fresh yeast feels moist and firm and breaks evenly without crumbling It has a fruity fresh smell which changes to a sticky mass with a cheesy odor It is not always easy to recognize whether or not yeast has lost enough of its strength to affect the fermentation and the eventual outcome of the baked bread but its working quality definitely depends on the storage conditions temperature humidity and age The optimum storage temperature for yeast is C F At this temperature it is still completely effective for up to two months Yeast does not freeze at this temperature Other guidelines for storing yeast include Rotating it properly and using the older stock first Avoiding overheating by spacing it on the shelves in the refrigerator Yeast needs to breathe since it is a living fungus The process is continuous proceeding slowly in the refrigerator and rapidly at the higher temperature in the shop When respiration occurs without food the yeast cells starve weaken and gradually die Yeast that has been frozen and thawed does not keep and should be used immediately Freezing temperatures weaken yeast and thawed yeast cannot be refrozen

into flour By the time of Christ Rome had more than bakeries and Roman legions introduced wheat throughout their empire Improved milling processes were needed because even when wheat was milled twice and bolted sifted through silk gauze the result was still a yellowish flour of uneven texture and flecked with germ and bran In the second half of the th century there were great changes in the flour milling process An American inventor Edmund LaCroix improved the process with a purifier to separate the middlings bran germand other coarse particles from the particles that form smoothtextured white flour In recent years the demand for whole grain milling has increased because whole grain food products have proved to be more nutritious than products made from white flour More information on whole grain and artisan milling is provided later in this section In Canada largescale wheat growing didnt occur until after the Prairies were settled in the s Hard wheat such as Red Fife Marquis and Selkirk earned Canada a position as the granary for Britain and many other European countries Today most of the wheat grown in Western Canada is the hard Red Spring variety Soft wheats such as soft red and soft white are primarily grown in Quebec and Ontario Many of the original wheat growers have passed on their farms to the next generations while others branched out to organic farming and milling One of these farms Nunweilers has a heritage that goes back to the early s when the original wheat in Canada Red Fife and Marquis was grown on this farm Today the major wheat growing areas of North America are in the central part of the continent in the Great Plains of the United States and the Canadian Prairies From Nebraska south winter wheat can be grown while to the north through

ReferencesContributors and Attributions Introduction In this short chapter you will learn how modern molecular biologists manipulate DNA the blueprint for all of life The four letter alphabet A G C and T that makes up DNA represents a language that when transcribed and translated leads to the myriad of proteins that make us who we are as a species and as individuals Lets continue with the metaphor that DNA is a language To master that language as with any other language we need to be able to read write copy and edit that language If you were using a word processor to find one line in a hundred page document or one article from one book out of the Library of Congress you would also need a way to search the large print base available You might want to compare two different copies of files to see if they differ from each other From the lab and this online discussion and problem set you will learn how modern scientists read write copy edit search and compare the language of the genome These abilities acquired over the last twenty years have revolutionized our understanding of life and have given us the potential to alter for good or evil life itself DNA in human chromosomes exists as one long double stranded molecule It is too long to physically study and manipulate in the lab Using a battery of enzymes the DNA of chromosomes can be chemically cleaved into smaller fragments which are more readily manipulable Similar techniques are used to sequence proteins which require overlapping polypeptide fragments to be made After the fragments have been made they must be separated from each other in order to study them DNA fragments can be separated on the basis of some structural feature that differentiates the fragments from each other Polarity can not be used since all DNA fragments have negatively charged phosphates in the sugar phosphate backbone of the molecule Although each fragment would have a unique sequence it would be hard to separate all the different fragments by for instance attaching some molecule that binds to a unique sequence in the major groove of a given fragment to a big bead and using that bead to separate out that one unique fragment You would need a different bead for each unique fragment The best way to separate the fragments from each other is to base the separation on the actual size of the fragment by using electrophoresis on an agarose or polyacrylamide gel A carbohydrate extract called agarose is made from algae Water is added to the extract which is then heated The carbohydrate extract dissolves in the water to form a viscous solution The agarose solution is poured into a mold like warm jello and is allowed to solidify A plastic comb with wide teeth was placed in the agarose when it was still liquid When the agarose is solid the comb can be removed leaving in its place little wells A solution of DNA fragments can be placed in the wells The agarose slab with sample is covered with a buffer solution and electrodes placed at each end of the slab The negative electrode is placed near the well end of the agarose slab while the positive electrode is placed at the other end If a voltage is applied across the agarose slab the negatively charged DNA fragments will move through the agarose gel toward the positive electrode This migration of charged molecules in solution toward an oppositely charged electrode is called electrophoresis Pretend you are one of the fragments To you the gel looks like a tangle cobweb You sneak your way through the openings in the web as you move straight forward to the positive electrode The larger the fragment the slower you move because it is hard to get through the tangled web Conversely the shorter the fragment the faster you move Using this technique and its many modifications oligonucleotides differing by just one nucleotides can be separated from each other In electrophoresis of DNA fragments a fluorescent uncharged dye ethidium bromide is added to the buffer solution This dye literally intercalates inbetween the base pairs of DNA which imparts a fluorescent yellowgreen color to the DNA when UV light is shown on the agarose gel A Reading DNA We will discuss one method of reading the sequence of DNA This method developed by Sanger won him a second Nobel prize To sequence a single stranded piece of DNA the complementary strand is synthesized Four different reaction mixtures are set up Each contain all radioactive deoxynucleotides dATP dCTP dGTP dTTP required for the reaction and DNA polymerase In addition dideoxyATP ddATP is added to one reaction tube The dATP and ddATP attach randomly to the growing end of the complementary stranded If ddATP is added no further nucleotides can be added after since its end has an H and not a OH Thats why they call it dideoxy The new chain is terminated If dATP is added the chain will continue to grow until another A needs to be added Hence a whole series of discreet fragments of DNA chains will be made all terminated when ddATP was added The same scenario occurs for the other tubes which contain dCTP and ddCTP dTTP and ddTTP and dGTP and ddGTP respectively All the fragments made in each tube will be placed in separate lanes for electrophoresis where the fragments will separate by size Didexoynucleotides Figure Didexoynucleotides PROBLEM You will pretend to sequence a single stranded piece of DNA as shown below The new nucleotides are added by the enzyme DNA polymerase to the primer GACT in the to direction You will set up reaction tubes Each tube contains all the dXTPs In addition add ddATP to tube ddTTP to tube ddCTP to tube and ddGTP to tube For each separate reaction mixture determine all the possible sequences made by writing the possible sequences on one of the unfinished complementary sequences below Cut the completed sequences from the page determine the size of the polynucleotide sequences made and place them as they would migrate based on size in the appropriate lane of a imaginary gel which you have drawn on a piece of paper Lane will contain the nucleotides made in tube etc Then draw lines under the positions of the cutout nucleotides to represent DNA bands in the gel Read the sequence of the complementary DNA synthesized Then write the sequence of the ssDNA that was to be sequenced T C A A C G A T C T G A STAND TO SEQUENCE G A C T primer G A C T primer G A C T primer G A C T primer G A C T primer G A C T primer G A C T primer G A C T primer Since the DNA fragments have no detectable color they can not be directly visualized in the gel Alternative methods are used In the one described above radiolabeled ddXTPs where used Once the sequencing gel is run it can be dried and the bands visualized by radioautography also called autoradiography A place of xray film is placed over the dried gel in a dark environment The radiolabeled bands will emit radiation which will expose the xray film directly over the bands The film can be developed to detect the bands In a newer technique the primer can be labeled with a flourescent dye If a different dye is used for each reaction mixture all the reaction mixtures can be run in one lane of a gel Actually only one reaction mix containing all the ddXTPs together need be performed The gel can then be scanned by a laser which detects fluorescence from the dyes each at a different wavelength Figure DNA sequencing using different fluorescent primers for each ddXTP reaction One recent advance in sequencing allows for realtime determination of a sequence The four deoxynucleotides are each labeled with a different fluorphore on the phosphate not the base as above A tethered DNA polymerase elongates the DNA on a template releasing the fluorophore into solution ie the fluorophore is not incorporated into the DNA chain The reaction takes place in a visualization chamber called a zero mode waveguide which is a cylindrical metallic chamber with a width of nm and a volume of zeptoliters x L It sits on a glass support through which laser illumination of the sample is achieved Given the small volume nonincorporated fluorescently tagged deoxynucleotides diffuse in and out in the microsecond timescale When a deoxynucleotide is incorporated into the DNA its residence time is in the millisecond time scale This allows for prolonged detection of fluorescence which give a high signal to noise ratio Newer technology in which sequence is done by moving DNA through pores in membranes could bring sequencing down to genome or less Animation of Sanger Sequencing Nanopore sequencing B Writing DNA Oligonucleotide can be synthesized on a solid bead By adding one nucleotide at a time the sequence and length of the oligonucleotide can be controlled C Copying DNA Several methods exists for copying a sequence of DNA millions of times Most methods make use of plasmids which are found in bacteria and viruses which can infect any cell The DNA of the plasmid or virus is engineered to contain a copy of a specific DNA sequence of interest The plasmid or virus is then reintroduced into the cell where amplification occurs Initially a DNA containing a gene or regulatory sequence of interest is cut at specific places with an enzyme called a restriction endonuclease or restriction enzyme for short The enzyme doesnt cleave DNA any old place but rather at restricted places in the sequence much as an endoprotease cleaves a protein after a given amino acid within a protein chain Instead of cleaving one strand as in proteins the restriction endonuclease must cleave both strands of dsDNA It can cut the strands cleanly to leave blunt ends or in a staggered fashion to leave small tails of ssDNA Multiple such sites exist at random in the genome The gene of interest must be flanked on either side by such a sequence The same enzyme is used to cleave the plasmid or virus DNA Figure Cleaving DNA with the Restriction Enzyme EcoR The foreign fragment of DNA can then be added to the plasmid or viral DNA as shown to make a recombinant DNA molecule This technique of DNA cloning is the basis for the entire field of recombinant DNA technology Figure Cloning a Restriction Fragment into a Plasmid Animation of Gene Splicing The plasmid can be added to bacteria which take it up in a process called transformation The plasmid can be replicated in the bacteria which will copy the DNA fragment of interest Typically the plasmid carries a gene that can make the bacteria resistant to an antibiotic Only bacteria that carry the plasmid and presumably the insert will grow To isolate the desired fragment the plasmids are isolated from bacteria and cleaved with the same restriction enzyme to remove the desired fragment after which it can be purified In addition the bacteria can be induced to express the protein from the foreign gene In lab we will transform bacteria with a plasmid containing the gene for human adipoctye acid phosphatase beta HAAPB and induce expression of the gene A similar method can be used to copy DNA in which the foreign fragment is recombined with the DNA of bacteriophage a virus which infects bacteria like E Coli The recombinant DNA can be packaged into actual viruses as shown below When the virus infects the bacteria it instructs the cells to make millions of new viruses hence copying the foreign fragment of interest Sometimes cloning or copying a fragment of DNA is not what an investigator really wants If the genomic DNA comes from a human cell for instance the gene will contain introns If you put this DNA into a plasmid or bacteriophage the introns go with it Bacteria can replicate this DNA but often one wants not to just copy amplify the DNA but also transcribe it into RNA and then translate it into protein Bacteria however can not splice out the intron RNA so mature mRNA can not be made If one could clone into the bacteria DNA without the introns this problem would not exist One such possible method exists in which you start with the actual mRNA for a protein of interest In this technique a dsDNA copy is made from a ssmRNA molecule Such dsDNA is called cDNA for complementary or copy DNA This can then be cloned into a plasmid or bacteriophage vector and amplified as described above COPYING DNA FROM A MRNA CONSTRUCTION OF A CDNA LIBRARY insert In the mid s a new method was developed to copy amplify DNA in a test tube It doesnt require a plasmid or a virus It just requires a DNA fragment some primers small polynucleotides complementary to sections of DNA on each strand and straddling the section of DNA to be amplified Just add to this mixture dATP dCTP dGTP dTTP and a heat stable DNA polymerase from the organism Thermophilus aquaticus which lives in hot springs and off you go The mixture is first heated to a temperature which will cause the DsDNA strands to separate The temperature is cooled allowing a large stoichimetric excess of the primers to anneal to the ssDNA The heat stable Taq polymerase from Thermophilus aquaticus polymerizes DNA from the primers The temperature is raised again allowing dsDNA strand separation On cooling the primers anneal again to the original and newly synthesized DNA from the last cycle and synthesis of DNA occurs again This cycle is repeated as shown in the diagram This chain reaction is called the polymerase chain reaction PCR The target DNA synthesized is amplified a million times in cycles or a billion times in cycles which can be done in a few hours Figure Copying DNA in the test tube the polymerase chain reaction PCR Animation of PCR D Editing DNA During our studies of protein structure we spent much time discussing how specific amino acids could be covalently modified to either identify the presence of the amino acid or in an attempt to modify the activity of the protein A newer and revolutionary technique has emerged in the last years Using recombinant DNA technology the gene that encodes the protein can be altered at one or more nucleotide in a way which would either change one or more amino acids or add or delete one or more amino acids This technique called sitespecific mutagenesis is used extensively by protein chemist to determine the importance of a given amino acid in the folding structure and activity of a protein The techniques is described in the diagram below Figure Site Specific Mutagenesis E Searching DNA Where on a chromosome is the gene that codes for a given protein One way to find the gene is to synthesize a small oligonucleotide probe which is complementary to part of the actual DNA sequence of the gene determined from previous experiments Attach a fluorescent molecule to the DNA probe Then take a cell preparation in which the chromosomes can be seen under the microscope To the cell add base which unwinds the double stranded DNA helix add the fluorescent probe to the cell and allow double stranded DNA to reform The fluorescent probe will bind to the chromosome at the site of the gene to which the DNA is complementary Hybridization is the process whereby a singlestranded nucleotide sequence the target binds through Hbonds to another complementary nucleotide sequence the probe What if you dont know the nucleotide sequence of the gene but you know the amino acid sequence of the protein as in the example shown below From the genetic code table you could predict the possible sequence of all possible RNA molecule which are complementary to the DNA in the gene Since some of the amino acids have more than one codon there are many possible sequences of DNA which could code for the protein fragment The link below shows all possible corresponding mRNA sequences that could code for a short amino acid sequence The mer sequence of minimal degeneracy in the nucleotide sequence should be used as possible genomic probe F COMPARING DNA The DNA sequence of each individual must be different from every other individual in the world with the exception of identical twins The difference must be less than the difference between a human and a chimp which are identical Let us say that each of have DNA sequences that are identical as compared to some normal human Given that we have about billion base pairs of DNA that means we are all different in about x which is about million base pairs different This means that on the average we have one nucleotide difference for each base pairs of DNA Some of these are in genes but most are probably in between DNA and many have been shown to be clustered in areas of highly repetitive DNA at the ends of chromosomes called the telomeres and in the middle called the centromeres Now remember that their are restriction enzyme sites interspersed randomly along the DNA as well If some of the differences in the DNA among individuals occurs within the sequences where the DNA is cleaved by restriction enzymes then in some individuals a particular enzyme wont cleave at the usual site but at a more distal site Hence the size of the restriction enzyme fragments should differ for each person Each persons DNA when cut by a battery of restriction enzymes should give rise to a unique set of DNA fragments of sizes unique to that individual Each persons DNA has a unique Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism RFLP How could you detect such polymorphism You already know how to cut sample DNA with restriction enzymes and then separate the fragments on an agarose gel An additional step is required however since thousands of fragments could appear on the gel which would be observed as one large continuous smear If however each fragment could be reacted with a set of small radioactive DNA probes which are complementary to certain highly polymorphic sections of DNA like teleomeric DNA and then visualized only a few sets of discrete bands would be observed in the agarose gel These discrete bands would be different from the DNA bands seen in another individuals gene treated the same way This technique is called Southern Blotting and works as shown below DNA fragments are electrophoresed in an agarose gel The ds DNA fragments are unwound by heating and then a piece of nitrocellulose filter paper is placed on top of the gel The DNA from the gel transfers to the filter paper Then a small radioactive oligonucleotide probe complementary to a polymorphic site on the DNA is added to the paper It binds only to the fragment containing DNA complementary to the probe The filter paper is dried and a piece of xray film is placed over the sheet Also run on the gel and transferred to the sheet are a set of radioactive fragments which are not complementary to the probe which serve as a set of markers to ensure that the gel electrophoresis and transfer to the filter paper was correct This technique is shown on the next page along with a RFLP analysis from a particular family When this technique is used in forensic cases such as the OJ Simpson trial or in paternity cases it is called DNA fingerprinting With present techniques investigators can state unequivocally that the odds of a particular pattern not belong to a suspect are in the range of one million to one The xray film

a significant part Remember dispersion forces are short range and become most significant under conditions of closest packing Opposing folding is the chain conformational entropy just described Since proteins are so marginally stable even one unpaired buried ionic side chain or unpaired buried H bond donors and acceptors in the protein may be enough to unravel the native structure leading to the

Cornstarch Cornstarch is the most common thickening agent used in the industry It is mixed with water or juice and boiled to make ﬁllings and to give a glossy semiclear ﬁnish to products Commercial cornstarch is made by soaking maize in water containing sulphur dioxide The soaking softens the corn and the sulphur dioxide prevents possible fermentation It is then crushed and passed to water tanks where the germ ﬂoats oﬀ The mass is then ground ﬁne and still in a semiﬂuid state passed through silk screens to remove the skin particles After ﬁltration the product which is almost starch is dried Cornstarch in cold water is insoluble granular and will settle out if left standing However when cornstarch is cooked in water the starch granules absorb water swell and rupture forming a translucent thickened mixture This phenomenon is called gelatinization Gelatinization usually begins at about C F reaching completion at the boiling point The commonly used ingredients in a starch recipe aﬀect the rate of gelatinization of the starch Sugar added in a high ratio to the starch will inhibit the granular swelling The starch gelatinization will not be completed even after prolonged cooking at normal temperature The result is a ﬁlling of thin consistency dull color and a cereal taste Withhold some of the sugar from the cooking step in such cases and add it after gelatinization of the starch has been completed Other ingredients such as egg fat and dry milk solids have a similar eﬀect Fruits with high acidity such as rhubarb will also inhibit starch setting Cook the starch paste ﬁrst and add the fruit afterward In cooking a ﬁlling about kg lb of sugar should be cooked with the water or juice for every g oz of starch used as a thickener Approximately g oz of starch is used to thicken L of water or fruit juice The higher the acidity of the fruit juice the more thickener required to hold the gel Regular cornstarch thickens well but makes a cloudy solution Another kind of cornstarch waxy maize starch makes a more ﬂuid mix of great clarity Pregelatinized Starches Pregelatinized starches are mixed with sugar and then added to the water or juice They thicken the ﬁlling in the presence of sugar and water without heating This is due to the starch being precooked and not requiring heat to enable it to absorb and gelatinize There are several brands of these starches on the market eg Clear Jel and they all vary in absorption properties For best results follow the manufacturers guidelines Do not put pregelatinized starch directly into water as it will form lumps immediately Note If fruit ﬁllings are made with these precooked starches there is a potential for breakdown if the ﬁllings are kept Enzymes in the uncooked fruit may attack the starch and destroy some of the gelatinized structure For example if you are making a weeks supply of pie ﬁlling from fresh rhubarb use a regular cooked formula Arrowroot Arrowroot is a highly nutritious farinaceous starch

gel It has a melting point much higher than gelatin and its jellying power is eight times greater It is used in pie ﬁllings and to some extent in the stiﬀening of jams It is a permitted ingredient in some dairy products including ice cream at One of its largest uses is in the production of materials such as piping jelly and marshmallow Algin Sodium Alginate Extracted from kelp this gum dissolves in cold water and a concentration to give a ﬁrm gel It has the disadvantage of not working well in the presence of acidic fruits It is popular in uncooked icings because it works well in the cold state and holds a lot of moisture It reduces stickiness and prevents recrystallization Carrageenan or Irish Moss Carrageenan is another marine gum extracted from red seaweed It is used as a thickening agent in various products from icing stabilizers to whipping cream at an allowable rate of to Gelatin Gelatin is a glutinous substance made from the bones connective tissues and skins of animals The calcium is removed and the remaining substance is soaked in cold water Then it is heated to C to C F F The partially evaporated liquid is defatted and coagulated on glass plates and then poured into moulds When solid the blocks of gelatin are cut into thin layers and dried on wire netting Gelatin is available in sheets of leaf gelatin powders granules or ﬂakes Use it at a ratio Like some of the other gelling agents acidity adversely aﬀects its gelling capacity The quality of gelatin often varies because of diﬀerent methods of processing and manufacturing For this reason many bakers prefer leaf gelatin because of its reliable strength Gum Arabic or Acacin This gum is obtained from various kinds of trees and is soluble in hot or cold water Solutions of gum arabic are used in the bakery for glazing various kinds of goods particularly marzipan fruits Gum Tragacanth This gum is obtained from several species of Astragalus lowgrowing shrubs found in Western Asia It can be purchased in ﬂakes or powdered form Gum tragacanth was once used to make gum paste and gum paste wedding ornaments but due to high labour costs and a prohibitive price for the product its use nowadays is uncommon Pectin Pectin is a mucilaginous substance gummy substance extracted from plants occurring naturally in pears apples quince oranges and other citrus fruits It is used as the gelling agent in

LipidsTriglyceridesFatty AcidsRancidOxidationAntioxidantsSaturatedUnsaturatedHydrogenationEmulsiﬁcation Emulsiﬁed ShorteningsStabilitySmoke PointFat BreakdownContributors and Attributions Fats and oils are organic compounds that like carbohydrates are composed of the elements carbon C hydrogen H and oxygen O arranged to form molecules There are many types of fats and oils and a number of terms and concepts associated with them which are detailed further here Lipids In baking lipids are generally a synonym for fats Baking books may talk about the lipid content of eggs for example Triglycerides Triglycerides is another chemical name for the most common type of fats found in the body indicating that they are usually made up of three tri fatty acids and one molecule of glycerol glycerine is another name as shown in Figure The mono and diglycerides that are used as emulsiﬁers have one and two fatty acids respectively Figure Composition of fats triglycerides Fatty Acids Each kind of fat or oil has a different combination of fatty acids The nature of the fatty acid will determine the consistency of the fat or oil For example stearic acid is the major fatty acid in beef fat and linoleic acid is dominant in seed oils Fatty acids are deﬁned as short medium or long chain depending on the number of atoms in the molecule The reason that some fat melts gradually is that as the temperature rises each fatty acid will in turn soften as its melting point is reached Fats that melt all of a sudden mean that the fatty acids are of the same or similar type and have melting points within a narrow range An example of such a fat is coconut fat one second it is solid the next liquid Table shows the characteristics of three fatty acids Table Characteristics of Fatty Acids Type of Fatty Acid Melting Point Physical State at room temperature Stearic C F Solid Oleic C F Liquid Linoleic C F Liquid Rancid Rancid is a term used to indicate that fat has spoiled The fat takes on an unpleasant ﬂavor when exposed to air and heat Unsalted butter for example will go rancid quickly if left outside the refrigerator especially in warm climates OxidationAntioxidants Oxidation exposure to air causes rancidity in fats over time This is made worse by combination with certain metals such as copper This is why doughnuts are never fried in copper pans Some oils contain natural antioxidants such as tocopherols vitamin E is one kind but these are often destroyed during the processing As a result manufacturers add synthetic antioxidants to retard rancidity BHA and BHT are synthetic antioxidants commonly used by fat manufacturers SaturatedUnsaturated Saturated and unsaturated refer to the extent to which the carbon atoms in the molecule of fatty acid are linked or bonded saturated to hydrogen atoms One system of fatty acid classiﬁcation is based on the number of double bonds double bonds saturated fatty acids Stearic acid is a typical longchain saturated fatty acid Figure Figure Stearic Acid double bond monounsaturated fatty acids Oleic acid is a typical monounsaturated fatty acid Figure Figure Oleic Acid or more double bonds polyunsaturated fatty acids Linoleic acid is a typical polyunsaturated fatty acid Figure Figure Linoleic Acid Saturated fat is a type of fat found in food For many years there has been a concern that saturated fats may lead to an increased risk of heart disease however there have been studies to the contrary and the literature is far from conclusive The general assumption is that the less saturated fat the better as far as health is concerned For the fat manufacturer however low saturated fat levels make it diﬃcult to produce oils that will stand up to the high temperatures necessary for processes such as deepfrying Hydrogenation has been technologys solution Hydrogenation will be discussed later in the chapter Saturated fat is found in many foods Animal foods like beef chicken lamb pork and veal Coconut palm and palm kernel oils Dairy products like butter cheese and whole milk Lard Shortening Unsaturated fat is also in the foods you eat Replacing saturated and trans fats see below with unsaturated fats has been shown to help lower cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease Unsaturated fat is also a source of omega and omega fatty acids which are generally referred to as healthy fats Choose foods with unsaturated fat as part of a balanced diet using the US Department of Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines Even though unsaturated fat is a good fat having too much in your diet may lead to having too many calories which can increase your risk of developing obesity type diabetes heart disease and certain types of cancer There are two main types of unsaturated fats Monounsaturated fat which can be found in Avocados Nuts and seeds like cashews pecans almonds and peanuts Vegetable oils like canola olive peanut saﬄower sesame and sunﬂower Polyunsaturated fat which can be found in Fatty ﬁsh like herring mackerel salmon trout and smelt Fish oils Nuts and seeds like cashews pecans almonds and peanuts Vegetable oils like canola corn ﬂaxseed soybean and sunﬂower Hydrogenation Simply put hydrogenation is a process of adding hydrogen gas to alter the melting point of the oil or fat The injected hydrogen bonds with the available carbon which changes liquid oil into solid fat This is practical in that it makes fats versatile Think of the diﬀerent temperature conditions within a bakery during which fat must be workable think of the diﬀerent climatic conditions encountered in bakeries Trans Fat Trans fat is made from a chemical process known as partial hydrogenation This is when liquid oil is made into a solid fat Like saturated fat trans fat has been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol levels which may in turn increase your risk for heart disease Unlike saturated fat trans fat also lowers HDL or good cholesterol A low level of HDLcholesterol is also a risk factor for heart disease Until recently most of the trans fat found in a typical American diet came from Fried foods like doughnuts baked goods including cakes pie crusts biscuits frozen pizza cookies and crackers stick margarine and other spreads The US Food and Drug Administration FDA speciﬁcally prescribe what information must be displayed on a label The trans fat content of food is one piece of core nutrition information that is required to be declared in a nutrition facts table More information on a nutrition facts table and labeling details can be found in wwwfdagovfoodingredientspucmhtm Emulsiﬁcation Emulsiﬁed Shortenings Emulsiﬁcation is the process by which normally unmixable ingredients such as oil and water can be combined into a stable substance Emulsiﬁers are substances that can aid in this process There are natural emulsiﬁers such as lecithin found in egg yolks Emulsiﬁers are generally made up of monoglycerides and diglycerides and have been added to many hydrogenated fats improving the fats ability to Develop a uniformly ﬁne structure Absorb a high percentage of sugar Hold in suspension a high percentage of liquid Emulsiﬁed shortenings are ideal for cakes and icings but they are not suitable for deepfrying Stability Stability refers to the ability of a shortening to have an extended shelf life It refers especially to deepfrying fats where a smoke point see below of C to C F to F indicates a fat of high stability Smoke Point The smoke point is the temperature reached when fat ﬁrst starts to smoke The smoke point will decline over time as the fat breaks down see below Fat Breakdown The technical term for fat breakdown is hydrolysis which is the chemical reaction of a substance with water In this process fatty acids are separated from their glycerol molecules and accumulate over time in the fat When their concentration reaches a certain point the fat takes on an unpleasant taste and continued use of the fat will yield a nasty ﬂavor The moisture which is at the root of this problem comes from the product being fried This is why it is a good reason to turn oﬀ the fryer or turn it to standby between batches of frying foods such as doughnuts Another cause of fat breakdown is excessive ﬂour on the product or particles breaking oﬀ the product Attribution Figure Stearic Acide Retrieved from

about to based on the flour used Some authorities recommend that the amount of salt used should be based on the actual quantity of water used in making the dough namely about g per L oz per qt of water During the hot summer months many bakers find it advantageous to use slightly more salt than in the winter as a safeguard against the development of any undesirable changes in the dough fermentation Salt should never be dissolved in the same water in which yeast is dissolved It is an antiseptic and dehydrates yeast cells and can even kill part of them which means that less power is in the dough and a longer fermentation is needed In bread made by the sponge dough method and in liquid fermentation systems a small amount of salt included in the first stage strengthens the gluten Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Many bakers add compressed yeast directly to their dough A more traditional way to use yeast is to dissolve it in lukewarm water before adding it to the dough The water should never be higher than C F because heat destroys yeast cells In general salt should not come into direct contact with yeast as salt dehydrates the yeast Table indicates the reaction of yeast at various temperatures It is best to add the dissolved yeast to the flour when the dough is ready for mixing In this way the flour is used as a buffer Buffers are ingredients that separate or insulate ingredients which if in too close contact might start to react prematurely In sponges where little or no salt is used yeast buds quickly and fermentation of the sponge is rapid Table How yeast reacts at different temperatures Temperature Reaction C C F F slow reaction C C F F normal reaction C C F F fast reaction C F terminal death point Never leave compressed yeast out for more than a few minutes Remove only the amount needed from the refrigerator Yeast lying around on workbenches at room temperature quickly deteriorates and gives poor results One solution used by some bakeries to eliminate steps to the fridge is to have a small portable cooler in which to keep the yeast on the bench until it is needed Yeast must be kept wrapped at all times because if it is exposed to air the edges and the corners will turn brown This condition is known as air burn Contributors and

Attributions Viscous means sticky and the term viscosity refers to the way in which the chocolate ﬂows Chocolate comes in various viscosities and the confectioner chooses the one that is most appropriate to his or her needs The amount of cocoa butter in the chocolate is largely responsible for the viscosity level Emulsiﬁers like lecithin can help thin out melted chocolate so it ﬂows evenly and smoothly Because it is less expensive than cocoa butter at thinning chocolate it can be used to help lower the cost of chocolate Molded pieces such as Easter eggs require a chocolate of less viscosity That is the chocolate should be somewhat runny so it is easier to ﬂow into the moulds This is also the case for coating cookies and most cakes where a thin attractive and protective coating is all that is needed A somewhat thicker chocolate is advisable for things such as ganache and ﬂavoring of creams and ﬁllings Where enrobers machines to dip chocolate centers are used the chocolate may also be thinner to ensure that there is an adequate coat of couverture Viscosity varies between manufacturers and a given type of chocolate made by one manufacturer may be available in more than one viscosity Bakers sometimes alter the viscosity depending on the product A vegetable oil is sometimes used to thin chocolate for coating certain squares This makes it easier to cut afterwards Chips Chunks and Other Baking Products Content and quality of chocolate chips and chunks vary from one manufacturer to another This chocolate is developed to be more heat stable for use in cookies and other baking where you want the chips and chunks to stay whole Ratios of chocolate liquor sugar and cocoa butter diﬀer All these variables aﬀect the ﬂavor Chips and chunks may be pure chocolate or have another fat substituted for the cocoa butter Some high quality chips have up to chocolate liquor but in practice liquor content over tends to smear in baking so high ratios defeat the purpose Many manufacturers package their chips or chunks by count ct size This refers to how many pieces there are in kg of the product As the count size number increases the size of the chip gets smaller With this information you can choose the best size of chip for the product you are producing Other chocolate products available are chocolate sprinkles or hail used as a decoration chocolate curls rolls or decorative shapes for use on cakes and pastries and chocolate sticks or batons which are often baked inside croissants Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University

RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Effects on BakingContributors and Attributions Effects on Baking Most municipal supplies of water contain chlorine which is used to ensure the purity of the water Some cities add fluoride to their water supply to stop tooth decay Neither chlorine nor fluoride is present in large enough quantities to affect dough in any way In addition most municipal water is treated to reduce excessive acidity since this could be corrosive for the water lines It is therefore unlikely that bakers using municipal water need to be concerned about extremely acidic water Soft water is another matter as it can lead to sticky dough An addition of yeast food or a reduction in dough water will help Alkaline water tends to tighten the dough and retard fermentation since enzymes work best in slightly acidic dough If there is a possibility of water problems a sample should be forwarded to a laboratory for a complete analysis

and artisan milling is the type of milling that was practiced before the consumer market demanded smooth white flours that are refined and have chemical additives to expedite aging of flours Artisan milling produces flours that are less refined and better suited to traditional breads but also contain little to no additives and have higher nutritional content For that reason demand for these types of flour is on the rise Artisan millers also known as micro millers process many nonstream grains including spelt kamut buckwheat and other nongluten grains and pulses This offers bakers opportunities to work with different grains and expand their businesses Artisan flours are readily available directly from millers or through a distributor Knowing the origin of the grains and the quality of the ingredients in baking is important for artisan bakers Whole grain flours are on the increase as consumers become more aware of their benefits Whole grain flour as the name suggests is made from whole grains Many artisan millers purchase their grains directly from growers This method of purchasing establishes trustworthy working relationships with the grain growers and promotes transparency in grain growing and food safety practices Grain growers that sell their grains to artisan millers apply conventional or organic growing practices Grain growers and millers have to go through vigorous processes to obtain the certified organic certification for their grains or products which guarantees that no chemical additives have been used How organic grain is processed varies Stone milling and impact hammer milling methods are typical when minimal refined whole grain flour is preferred Information on several American artisan millers that produce various whole grain flours can be found Faitrebid Mills Hayden Flour Mills and Baker Miller Chicago Organic flours have gained popularity in the baking industry As consumers become more aware of them we see the demand swinging back toward whole grain and artisan milling as a preference Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a

Types of YeastCompressed YeastActive Dry YeastContributors and Attributions Yeast is a microscopic unicellular fungus that multiplies by budding and under suitable conditions causes fermentation Cultivated yeast is widely used in the baking and distilling industries History tells us that the early Chaldeans Egyptians Greeks and Romans made leavened bread from fermented doughs This kind of fermentation however was not always reliable and easy to control It was Louis Pasteur a French scientist who lived in the th century who laid the foundation for the modern commercial production of yeast as we know it today through his research and discoveries regarding the cause and prevention of disease Types of Yeast Wild yeast spores are found floating on dust particles in the air in flour on the outside of fruits etc Wild yeasts form spores faster than cultivated yeasts but they are inconsistent and are not satisfactory for controlled fermentation purposes Compressed Yeast Compressed yeast is made by cultivating a select variety which is known by experiment to produce a yeast that is hardy consistent and produces a fermentation with strong enzymatic action These plants are carefully isolated in a sterile environment free of any other type of yeast and cultivated on a plate containing nutrient agar or gelatin Wort a combination of sterilized and purified molasses or malt nitrogenous matter and mineral salts is used to supply the food that the growing yeast plants need to make up the bulk of compressed yeast After growing to maturity in the fermentation tank the yeast is separated from the used food or wort by means of centrifugal machines The yeast is then cooled filtered pressed cut wrapped and refrigerated It is marketed in g lb blocks or in large kg lb bags for wholesale bakeries Figure illustrates the process of cultivating compressed yeast and Table summarizes its composition Figure Cultivating compressed yeast Table Average composition of fresh compressed yeast Water to Protein to Fat to Carbohydrate to Mineral Matter to Active Dry Yeast Active dry yeast is made from a different strain than compressed yeast The manufacturing process is the same except that the cultivated yeast is mixed with starch or other absorbents and dehydrated Its production began after World War II and it was used mainly by the armed forces homemakers and in areas where fresh yeast was not readily available Even though it is a dry product it is alive and should be refrigerated below C F in a closed container for best results It has a moisture content of about Storage without refrigeration is satisfactory only for a limited period of time If no refrigeration is available the yeast should be kept unopened in a cool dry place It should be allowed to warm up to room temperature slowly before being usedDry yeast must be hydrated for about minutes in water at least four times its weight at a temperature between C and C F andF The temperature should never be lower than C F and dry yeast should never be used before it is completely dissolved It takes about g oz of dry yeast to replace kg lb of compressed yeast and for each kilogram of dry yeast used an additional kilogram of water should be added to the mix This product is hardly if ever used by bakers having been superseded by instant yeast see below Instant Dry Yeast Unlike instant active dry yeast that must be dissolved in warm water for proper rehydration and activation instant dry yeast can be added to the dough directly either by Mixing it with the flour before the water is added Adding it after all the ingredients have been mixed for one minute This yeast can be reconstituted Some manufacturers call for adding it to five times its weight of water at a temperature of C to C F to F Most formulas suggest a ratio when replacing compressed yeast with instant dry Others vary slightly with some having a ratio In rich Danish dough it takes about g oz and in bread dough about g to g oz to oz of instant dry yeast to replace kg lb of compressed yeast As well a little extra water is needed to make up for the moisture in compressed yeast Precise instructions are included with the package basically it amounts to the difference between the weight of compressed yeast that would have been used and the amount of dry yeast used Instant dry yeast has a moisture content of about and is packed in vacuum pouches It has a shelf life of about one year at room temperature without any noticeable change in its gassing activity After the seal is broken the content turns into a granular powder which should be refrigerated and used by its bestbefore date as noted on the packaging Instant dry yeast is especially useful in areas where compressed yeast is not available However in any situation it is practical to use and has the advantages of taking up less space and having a longer shelf life than compressed yeast Cream Yeast Creamy yeast is a soft slurrytype yeast that is used only in large commercial bakeries and is pumped into the dough Yeast Food Yeast food is used in bread production to condition the dough and speed up the fermentation process It consists of a blend of mineral salts such as calcium salt or ammonium salt and potassium iodate It has a tightening effect on the gluten and is especially beneficial in dough where soft water is used The addition of yeast food improves the general appearance and tasting quality of bread The retail baker does not use it much Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of
