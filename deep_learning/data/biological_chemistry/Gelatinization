a substance that forms a gel in contact with water There are two main categories Thermoreversible gel A gel that melts upon reheating and sets upon cooling Examples are gelatin and agar agar Thermoirreversible gel A gel that does not melt upon reheating Examples are cornstarch and pectin Excessive heating however may cause evaporation of the water and shrinkage of the gel Hydrocolloids do not hydrate or dissolve instantly and that hydration is associated with swelling which easily causes lumping It is therefore necessary to disperse hydrocolloids in water Classically this has always been done with cornstarch where a portion of the liquid from the recipe is mixed to form a slurry before being added to the cooking liquid This can also be done with an immersion blender or a conventional blender or by mixing the hydrocolloid with a helping agent such as sugar oil or alcohol prior to dispersion in water Starches Starch gelatinization is the process where starch and water are subjected to heat causing the starch granules to swell As a result the water is gradually absorbed in an irreversible manner This gives the system a viscous and transparent texture The result of the reaction is a gel which is used in sauces puddings creams and other food products providing a pleasing texture Starchbased gels are thermoirreversible meaning that they do not melt upon heating unlike gelatin which we will discuss later Excessive heating however may cause evaporation of the water and shrinkage of the gel The most common examples of starch gelatinization are found in sauce and pasta preparations and baked goods In sauces starches are added to liquids usually while heating The starch will absorb liquid and swell resulting in the liquid becoming thicker The type of starch determines the ﬁnal product Some starches will remain cloudy when cooked others will remain clear Pasta is made mostly of semolina wheat durum wheat ﬂour which contains high amounts of starch When pasta is cooked in boiling water the starch in the pasta swells as it absorbs water and as a result the texture of the pasta softens Starch molecules make up the majority of most baked goods so starch is an important part of the structure Although starches by themselves generally cant support the shape of the baked items they do give bulk to the structure Starches develop a softer structure when baked than proteins do The softness of the crumb of baked bread is due largely to the starch The more protein structure there is the chewier the bread Starches can be fairly straightforward extracts of plants such as cornstarch tapioca or arrowroot but there are also modiﬁed starches and pregelatinized starches available that have speciﬁc uses See Table for a list of diﬀerent thickening and binding agents and their characteristics Table Common starches and gels used in the bakeshop Starch or Gel Ratio Preparation Characteristics and Uses Cornstarch g starch thickens L liquid A slurry mixture of cornstarch and water is mixed and added to a simmering liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens or Cornstarch mixed with sugar and cold liquid added Thickened mixture simmered until no starch taste remains Used to thicken sauces when a clear glossy texture is desired such as dessert sauces and in Asianinspired dishes Translucent thickens further as it cools forms a sliceable gel Sensitive to extended heat exposure so products become thin if held at heat for long periods of time Agar agar g agar agar sets L liquid Powder dissolved in cold water Added to cold or simmering liquid Activates with heat sets when cold Extracted from seaweed Used in Asian desserts and molecular gastronomy cooking Used in place of gelatin in vegetarian dishes Clear ﬁrm texture Does not thin when reheated thickens more when cold Waxy maize waxy rice Dissolved in cold water g starch thickens L liquid Added to hot liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens Used in desserts and dessert sauces Clear does not thicken further as it cools Does not gel at cool temperatures good for cold sauces Quite stable at extreme temperatures heat and freezing Modiﬁed starches Dissolved in cold water g starch thickens L liquid Added to hot liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens Modiﬁed starches are often used in commercially processed foods and convenience products Modiﬁed to improve speciﬁc characteristics eg stability or texture under extreme conditions heat and freezing Translucent thickens further as it cools Pregelatinized starches Powder dissolved in cold liquid g starch thickens L liquid Added to liquid at any temperature Used when thickening liquids that might lose color or ﬂavor during cooking Become viscous without the need for additional cooking Translucent fairly clear shiny does NOT gel when cold Arrowroot Powder dissolved in cold liquid g starch thickens L liquid Added to hot liquid while whisking until it dissolves and the liquid thickens Derived from cassava root Used in Asian cuisines Very clear possesses a gooey texture Translucent shiny very light gel when cold Gelatin g gelatin sets L liquid Powder or sheets leaves dissolved in cold water Added to cold or simmering liquid Activates with heat sets when cold Derived from collagens in bones and meats of animals Used in aspic glazes cold sauces and desserts Clear ﬁrm texture Dissolves when reheated thickens when cold Gelling agents Gelatin is a watersoluble protein extracted from animal tissue and used as a gelling agent a thickener an emulsiﬁer a whipping agent a stabilizer and a substance that imparts a smooth mouth feel to foods It is thermoreversible meaning the setting properties or action can be reversed by heating Gelatin is available in two forms powder and sheet leaf Gelatin is often used to stabilize whipped cream and mousses confectionery such as gummy bears and marshmallows desserts including pannacotta commercial products like JellO lite or lowfat versions of foods including some margarines and dairy products such as yogurt and ice cream Gelatin is also used in hard and soft gel capsules for the pharmaceutical industry Agar agar is an extract from red algae and is often used to stabilize emulsions or foams and to thicken or gel liquids It is thermoreversible and heat resistant It is typically hydrated in boiling liquids and is stable across a wide range of acidity levels It begins to gel once it cools to around ºC ºF and will not melt until it reaches ºC ºF Pectin Pectin is taken from citrus and other tree fruits apples pears etc Pectin is found in many different foods such as jam milkbased beverages jellies sweets and fruit juices Pectin is also used in molecular gastronomy mainly as a gelling agent thickener and stabilizer There are a variety of types of pectin that react diﬀerently according to the ingredients used Lowmethoxyl pectin which is activated with the use of calcium for gelling and highmethoxyl pectin that requires sugar for thickening are the two most common types used in cooking Highmethoxyl pectin is what is traditionally used to make jams and jellies Lowmethoxyl pectin is often used in modern cuisine due to the thermoirreversible gel that it forms and its good reaction to calcium Its natural capability to emulsify and gel creates stable preparations Increasingly cooks bakers and pastry chefs are turning to many diﬀerent gels chemicals and other substances used in commercial food processing as new ingredients to modify liquids or other foods These will be outlined in detail in the section on molecular gastronomy Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel
