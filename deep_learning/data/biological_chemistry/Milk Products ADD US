The usual minimum standard for cream is fat content though it ranges between and Cream in this range may be sold as half and half coffee cream or table cream Whipping cream is about to in milk fat content Cream with or higher is called heavy cream This percentage of fat is not a mandated standard much less than this and the cream simply will not whip For best whipping results the cream should be to hours old and be cold A stabilizer some sugar and flavour may be added during whipping Before adding stabilizer check the ingredients on the carton some whipping creams nowadays have added agents such as carrageenan in which case an additional stabilizer may not be necessary Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States except for that of light cream In Canada what the US calls light cream is referred to most commonly as half and half In Canada light cream is lowfat cream usually with to fat You can make your own light cream by blending milk with halfandhalf In Quebec country cream is sold which contains milk fat If you are usinga recipe that calls for country cream you may substitute cream If you have recipes from the UK you might see references to double cream This is cream with about milk fat which is not readily available in Canada except in some specialty stores Use whipping cream or heavy cream instead Table lists some of the common cream types and their uses Table Cream types and fat content Name Minimum Milk Fat Additional Definition Main Uses Whipping cream Heavy cream has at least milk fat Whips well can be piped custards cream fillings confectionary products Table cream Coffee cream Added to coffee poured over puddings used in sauces Halfandhalf Cereal cream Added to coffee custards and ice cream mixes Light cream Added to coffee Buttermilk Inoculating milk with a specific culture to sour it Churning milk and separating the liquid left over from the butter There are two methods to produce buttermilk The second method is where buttermilk gets its name but today most of what is commonly called buttermilk is the first type Buttermilk has a higher acid content than regular milk pH of compared with milks pH of The fermented dairy product known ascultured buttermilk is produced from cows milk and has a characteristically sour taste caused by lactic acid bacteria This variant is made using one of two species of bacteria either Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus bulgaricus which creates more tartness in certain recipes The acid in buttermilk reacts with the sodium bicarbonate baking soda to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent Sour Cream Sour cream is made from cream soured by adding lactic acids and thickened naturally or by processing Milk fat content may vary from to The lactic acid causes the proteins in sour cream to coagulate to a gelled consistency gums and starches may be added to further thicken it The added gums and starches also keep the liquid whey in sour cream from separating Use sour cream in cheesecakes coffee cakes and pastry doughs Lowfat and fatfree sour cream are available Lowfat sour cream which is essentially cultured halfandhalf or light cream and usually contains to milk fat is often satisfactory as a substitute for regular sour cream in baking These products are higher in moisture and less rich in flavor than regular sour cream Crème Fraîche Crème fraîche fresh cream is a soured cream containing to milk fat and having a pH of around It is soured with bacterial culture Traditionally it is made by setting unpasteurized milk into a pan at room temperature allowing the cream to rise to the top After about hours the cream is skimmed off During that time natural bacteria in the unpasteurized milk ripens the cream turning it into a mildly sour thickened product An effective substitute can be made by adding a small amount of cultured buttermilk or sour cream to whipping cream and allowing it to stand in a warm spot for hours or more before refrigerating As the cream ripens from the growth of the lactic acid bacteria it thickens and develops a sour flavour This product is similar to sour cream but it has a higher milk fat content Milk Substitutes Milk substitutes are becoming increasingly popular as replacements for straight skim milk powders Innumerable replacement blends are available to the baker Their protein contents range from to some are wet some are dryblended Product types vary from all dairy to mostly cereal Alldairy blends range from mostly dry skim milk to mostly whey A popular blend is whey mixed with soy flour solids and a small quantity of sodium hydroxide to neutralize the whey acidity Dough consistency may be a little softer if the milk in the replacement blend exceeds and this could dictate the need to increase dough mixing by at least half a minute However absorption and formula changes are seldom necessary when switching from dry milk to a blend or from a blend to a blend For nutritional labelling or when using a blend in a nonstandardized product that must carry an itemized ingredient label all blend components must be listed in their proper order on the label The Canadian Food Inspection Agency defines modified milk ingredients as any of the following in liquid concentrated dry frozen or reconstituted form Calciumreduced skim milk Casein This a protein in milk and is used as a binding agent Caseins are also used in wax to shine fruits and vegetables as an adhesive and to fortify bread Caseins contain common amino acids Caseinate This protein is derived from skim milk Bodybuilders sometimes take powder enriched with calcium caseinate because it releases proteins at an even measured pace Cultured milk products These are milk products that have been altered through controlled fermentation including yogurt sour cream and cultured buttermilk Milk serum proteins Ultrafiltered milk The Canadian Food and Drug Regulations define this type of milk as that which has been subjected to a process in which it is passed over one or more semipermeable membranes to partially remove water lactose minerals and watersoluble vitamins without altering the whey proteintocasein ratio and that results in a liquid product Whey This is serum byproduct created in the manufacture of cheese Whey butter Typically oily in composition whey butter is made from cream separated from whey Whey cream This is cream skimmed from whey sometimes used as a substitute for sweet cream and butter Any component of milk that has been altered from the form in which it is found in milk Milk Powder Milk powder is available in several different forms whole milk skim milk nonfat dry milk buttermilk or whey They are all processed similarly the product is first pasteurized then concentrated with an evaporator and finally dried spray or roller dried to produce powder Whole milk powder must contain no less than milk solids and must not exceed moisture The milk fat content must be no less than Vitamins A and D may be added and the emulsifying agent lecithin may also be added in an amount not exceeding Skim milk powder nonfat dry milk must contain no less than milk solids and must not exceed moisture or fat Buttermilk powder must contain no less than milk solids and must not exceed moisture or fat Whey powder consists primarily of carbohydrate lactose protein several different whey proteins mainly lactalbumins and globulins various minerals and vitamins Whey powder is a valuable addition to the functional properties of various foods as well as a source of valuable nutrients because it contains approximately of the nutrients in the original milk Table compares the composition of milk and two powdered milk products Table Comparison of fresh and powdered milk

milk add it to the water and whisk in immediately Delaying this or adding water to the milk powder will usually result in clogging Water temperature should be around C F Evaporated Milk Sometimes called concentrated milk this includes evaporated whole evaporated partly skimmed and evaporated skim milks depending on the type of milk used in its production Canadian standards require milk solids and milk fat All types of evaporated milk have a darker color than the original milk because at high temperatures a browning reaction occurs between the milk protein and the lactose After of the water is removed by evaporation the milk is homogenized cooled restandardized and canned It is then sterilized by heating for to minutes at C to C F to F Controlled amounts of disodium phosphate andor sodium citrate preserve the salt balance and prevent coagulation of the milk that might occur at high temperatures and during storage Sweetened Condensed Milk Sweetened condensed milk is a viscous sweetcolored milk made by condensing milk to onethird of its original volume which then has sugar added It contains about sugar a minimum of milk fat and not less than total milk solids Attribution
