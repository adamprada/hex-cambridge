Many of the organic reactions involved in metabolism involve making and breaking bonds to carbon There are ways to break a bond to a CX bond producing either a carbocation carbanion or free radical intermediate all of the which are unstable and reactive Both the carbocation and free radical are electron deficient and the carbanion although not electron deficienct has a negative on C an atom which has a relatively low electronegativity Preferential Stabilization of Reactants Intermediates and Products These unstable intermediates are higher in energy than the reactants and hence the transition state which is even higher in energy than the intermediates must have a structure which resembles the intermediates more than the reactants ie for the charged carbanion and carbocation intermediates there is a developing charge in the transition state The thermodynamics of the reactions is determined by the change in free energy between the intermediates and the reactants while the kinetics of the reaction is determined by the difference in free energy between the transition states and the reactants A catalyst lowers the energy of the transition state without affecting the energies of the reactants or intermediates assuming that these are free and not bound to the catalyst A comparison of the thermodynamic reactivity of molecules of similar structures can be made by determining the relative stability of the reactants and products from structural considerations Consider two reactants R and R which produce products P and P respectively Any structural features that preferentially stabilizes R compared to R or P compared to P but doesnt stabiiize R and P to the same extent will lead to a greater driving force for R P compared to R This is shown graphically below Mechanisms which lead to the stabilization of a reactant intermediate or product include resonance and inductive effects electron release or withdrawing An example of how the comparative acidity of two similar molecules can be determined through a comparison of their structures is shown below for acetic acid and ethanol An example of how an intermediate can be stabilized through resonance is shown below for the keto enol tautomerization reaction which is favored in the direction of the keto form a a weaker acid than the enol An example of how the inductive effect electron release and withdrawal stabilizedestabilize carbocations and cations is shown below Electron withdrawing by the Fs in the negatively charged conjugate base of trifluoracetic acid helps explains its lower pka compared to acetic acid stabilization of the tertiary carbocation below helps explain the preferential formation of the tertiary alcohol Oxidation of Organic Molecules Organic molecules are usually oxidized in two electron steps Two methods can be used to determined if a C atom in an organic molecule has been oxidized If the number of bonds from the C to oxygen increase or the number of bonds to H decrease the C is oxidized More generally if the number of bonds from C to a more electronegative atom increases or the number of binds from C to a less electronegative atom decrease the carbon is oxidized A more powerful method involves determining the oxidation number of the carbon atoms in the reactant and product If the oxidation number becomes more positive the C is oxidized The general rules for determining oxidation numbers of the atoms in a molecule are O is generally H is usually in molecules consisting of one type of atom like O ie a polyatomic element the atoms have an oxidation number of the sum of the oxidation numbers of the atoms in a molecule equals the net charge on the molecule or ion In general the oxidation number can be calculated as follows assign all nonbonded electrons of an atom to that atom assign all bonded electrons to the more electronegative atom of the two atoms bonded assign one electron of a bond to each atom if the two atoms are identical sum up the assigned electrons from Subtract this number from the total number of electrons usually present in the outer shell of the atom the group number The result is the oxidation number

Number Reaction of Carbonyls Aldehydes and Ketones When water reacts with an aldehyde in a nucleophilic addition reaction a diol or a geminal diol results This reacts can be catalyzed by base which acts as the nucleophile its a stronger nucleophile than water and adds to the carbonyl C OH is regenerated when the alkoxide produced abstracts a proton from water regenerating OH When an alcohol adds to an aldehyde or ketone a hemiacetal or hemiketal respectively is formed In the presence of an acid catalyst the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen making the carbonyl more electrophilic After the alcohol adds and forms the hemiacetal or hemketal the acid can protonate the OH group leading to its expulsion as water in an acidcatalyzed elimination The carbocation or resonantform oxonium ion can react with another ROH to form an acetal or ketal If the nucleophile is an amine an addition can occur followed by an elimination to form an imine or Schiff base An acetal or ketal are really geminal ethers as water addition to aldehydes or ketones produced geminal diols As with other ethers these geminal ethers are stable to base and are hence often used as protecting groups to keep aldehydes and ketones from undesired reactions in basic solution Acetal formation is favored by excess anhydrous alcohol in acetic condition while acetal breakdown is accelerated by high concentrations of water and the presence of an acid catalyst Why are ethers and hence acetalsketals resistant to bases They are resistant to nucleophilic attack such as by base since the expelled group alkoxide is unstable Epoxides in contrast will react with OH nucleophiles since the epoxide ring is strained and of high energy Ethers can react with acids however which protonate the ether O to form an oxonium ion Nucleophilic attack such as by Br on an adjacent C can occur SN with electrons flowing to the protonated oxonium ion a great electron sink as it departs Reaction of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives Carboxylic acids undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions assisted by the fact that compared to aldehydes and ketones they have good leaving groups With the substitution reaction the stability of the double bond in the carbonyl is retained Two things control the reactivity of these derivatives the stability of the reactants and the stability of the products The stability of the reactants A reactant is less reactive if stabilized by resonance The figure below shows that the order of increased reactivity of reactants is amide ester anhydride acid chloride The nonbonded electron pair on N of the amide being less electronegative than O can delocalize and form a resonant structure with a double bond with the carbonyl C more readily than the O in the ester An electron pair on the bridging O in the anhydride since its ability to from a double bond in a resonance structure is split between the two carbonyls C is less effective in stabiliziing either side than in the This is called competing resonances The reactant less stabilized by resonance is the acid chloride since a nonbonded pair of electrons on the larger chlorine molecule cant delocalize as readily given CCl bond distance Notice this order of decreased stability based on resonance stabilization is also the order of increased electrophilicity of the carbonyl C which is most electrophilic in the absence of electron delocalization from the adjacent N O or Cl The stability of the products If the deprotonated leaving group is considered as one of the products whch differentiates the different reactions then the order of decreased stability of products is Cl RCOO RO RHN Note the pKa of ROH RNH More on the Thermodynamics of carbonyl reactivity What really determines the stability of products compared to reactants is the strength of bonds made and broken during the reaction In nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and ketones the strength of the bond to the nucleophile must be greater than the strength of the pi bond broken in the carbonyl A CCl bond strength is kcalmol compared to a pi CO bond strength of kcalmol Hence a Cl is not likely to add to a carbonyl C Consider the hydration of formaldehyde carbonyl with Hs acetaldehyde with H and methyl group and acetone with methyl groups The Î”Go for hydration of these is and kcalmol respectively showing that increased electron release toward the carbonyl C which makes it less electrophilic and more stable decreases the reactivity of the carbonyl In nucleophilic substitution the leaving group anion must be more stable than the nucleophile Kinetics of Reactivity of Carbonyls The relative kinetic reactivity of various carbonyls toward nucleophiles follows the order of electrophilicity of the C ie the extent of the positive charge on the carbonyl C The slow step in a nucleophilic attack is breaking the pi carbonyl bond If the reactant is stabilized by resonance in ways that reduces the electrophicity of the carbonyl C the reaction is slowed Nucleophiilicity really is a measure of the affinity of an atom or ion on an electrophilic C which is similar to basicity which is a measure of the affinity of an atom or ion for a proton Halides are not good nucleophiles for reactions with acid derivatives since the halide like Cl is a better leaving group than the actual leaving group Making CC Bonds Metabolism can be divided into catabolic breaking down and anabolic synthetic reactions To obtain energy sugars and fatty acids are converted to carbon dixoide Hence CC bonds must be broken In contrast CC bonds must be synthesized in photosynthesis In all reactions electrons from bond broken flow to atoms where bonds will be made Flow is from a source a pair of electrons possibly with a negative charge to a sink a slightly or fully positive atom Heres a couple ways to make a CC bond react two carbon centered radicals free radical mechanisms are uncommon biologically react a carbocation with a carbanion A carbocation is unstable unless incorporated into a molecule in which it is stable so instead of using them the carbonyl C is used as the electrophilic carbon Instability of carbocations is reflected in their propensity to rearrangement Taking into account the resonance form of the CO carbonyl bond in with a positive on C and a negative on O the net charge on the carbonyl is about A stabalized carbanion often stabilized as a enolate resonant form is used as the negatively charged carbon One method of making a CC bond is an aldol condensation in which a carbanion formed the deprotonation of a CH alpha to a carbonyl which is stabilized by the enolate resonance form acts as a nucleophile which addes to a carbonyl C in an aldehyde or ketone In another CC bond synthesis reaction a Claisen Condensation a carbanion formed the deprotonation of a CH alpha to a carbonyl which is stabilized by the enolate resonance form acts as a nucleophile which substitutes at a carbonyl C in an ester Breaking CC Bonds In addition to a retroaldol condensation a common method to break a CC is through a decarboxylation reaction at a betaketo acid Notice that the analogous reaction at an alpha keto acid is unlikely since the electrons from the CC bond that is cleaved have no sink to which to flow References Sole et al Fleeting Molecules Extend Their Stay about carbenes Science pg On the
