and Attributions Learning Objectives explain the general role of cofactors in enzymecatalyzed reactions identify from their structures thiamine nicotinamide and pyridoxal cofactors draw mechanisms to show how thiamine pyrophosphate facilitates decarboxylation of αketoacids as a cofactor in enzymecatalyzed reactions draw mechanisms to show how nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide facilitates oxidation oxidative decarboxylaitn and oxidative deamination reactions as a cofactor in enzymecatalyzed reactions draw mechanisms to show how pyridoxal phosphate facilitates cleavage of all bonds to the αcarbon in amino acids as a cofactor in enzymecatalyzed reactions To make and break bonds electrons have to be moved In drawing reaction mechanisms we showed how electrons moved from sources to sinks In many enzymecatalyzed reactions vitamin derivatives are uses as substrates or cofactors or coenzymes to facilitate the flow of electrons in bond making and breaking For each of the reactions below using the analogy of sourcesink write a reasonable mechanism which shows electron flow during the reaction With the exception of the first reaction all require a vitamin derivative to facilitate electron flow Imagine reaction one occurring spontaneously in solution in the absence of an enzyme although enzymes exists to catalyze this reaction The rest of the reactions involve vitamin derivatives as part of an enzymecatalyzed reaction Draw plausible mechanisms for each of the reactions below showing the flow of electrons from a source to a sink The source might often be a pair of electrons on an anion which was formed by prior removal of a proton from the atom by a general base A sink could be a carbonyl O which receives a pair of electrons from one of the double CO bonds of the carbonyl As a bond is made to the carbonyl one of the double bonds must break with the electrons going temporarily if the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution reaction to the carbonyl O an excellent sink since it is so electronegative An even better sink is a positive N of an iminium ion examples of which are show below The cofactors encountered in enzyme catalyzed reactions are often vitamin derivatives We will study more about some of these later Just the business parts of the cofactors are shown below RX TYPE SPONTANEOUS DECARBOXYLATION OF βKETO ACIDS No cofactor required although nucleophilic catalysis by an amine through Schiff Base formation will speed up the reaction RX TYPE DECARBOXYLATION OF αKETO ACIDS requires thiamine pyrophosphate TPP a derivative of thiamine vitamin B a deficiency of which causes beriberi TPP is covalently attached to the enzyme such as in pyruvate dehydrogenase and alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase The first part of the reaction The number of arrows leading to product

use NAD before water in the mechanism Jmol Updated Glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase NAD Jmol Java JSMol HTML PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE ENZYMES Pyridoxal phosphate PLP is a derivative of the vitamin B or pyridoxal Deficiencies cause convulsions chronic anemia and neuropathy It assists in many reactions catalyzed by PLPdependent enzymes The PLP is bound covalently to lysine residues in a Schiff base linkage aldimine In this form it reacts with many free amino acids as substrates to replace the Schiff base to Lys of the enzyme with a Schiff base to the amino acid substrate First a review of Schiff Base formation PLP Structure and Covalent Attachment to Enzyme For reactions assume that the amino acid substrate is in a Schiff base with PLP William Jencks in his classic text Catalysis in Chemistry wrote It has been said that God created an organism especially adapted to help the biologist find an answer to every question about the physiology of living systems if this is so it must be concluded that pyridoxal phosphate was created to provide satisfaction and enlightenment to those enzymologists and chemists who enjoy pushing electrons for no other coenzyme is involved in such a wide variety of reactions in both enzyme and model systems which can be reasonably interpreted in terms of the chemical properties of the coenzyme Most of these reactions are made possible by a common structural feature That is electron withdrawal toward the cationic nitrogen atom of the imine and into the electron sink of the pyridoxal ring from the alpha carbon atom of the attached amino acid activates all three of the substitutents of this carbon for reactions which require electron withdrawal from this atom Molecular Modeling PLP Tyrosine Aminotransferase Jmol from PDB RX TYPE αDECARBOXYLATION OF AMINO ACIDS RX TYPE BETAELIMINATION FROM SERINE Example Serine dehydratase hint remove H on αC first then OH RX TYPE RACEMIZATION OF AMINO ACIDS hint remove H on αC first PLP enzymes also catalyze transamination reactions an example of which is shown below Amino Acid αketo acid αketo acid Amino Acid For example First Asp bound to PLP through a Schiff base link loses the αH forms a ketimine through a tautomerization reactions which ultimately hydrolyzes to form the released oxalacetate and pyridoxamine The pryidoxamine reacts with αketoglutarate in the reverse of the first three reactions to from Glu RX TYPE ACETYLATION The acetic anhydride of biological acetylation reactions is acetylCoA a derivative of the vitamin pantathenic acid which contains a free thiol It is acetylated at the thiol in many metabolic reactions to produce acetylCoA containing a thioester bond a biological acetylating reagent This molecule can be cleaved in an exergonic fashion due in part to the weak bond between the acetyl C and the Sk leading to transfer of the acetyl group We have previously discussed the importance of histone Lys acetylation by histone acetylases in the control of gene expression RX TYPE METHYL TRANSFERASES An additional posttranslational modification of histone proteins methylation is yet another method in which gene transcription is control Natures methylating agent is Sadenosine methionine a derivative of methione which is methylated by yet another vitamin derivative tetrahydrofolate from folic acid SAM is a substrate for methylating enzymes that transfer a methyl group to proteins and DNA The reaction below envisions the methylation of a protein at a Lys side chain RX TYPE CARBOXYLATIONS TO BE ADDED Contributors and Attributions Prof
