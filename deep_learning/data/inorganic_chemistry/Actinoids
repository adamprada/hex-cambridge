The fifteen elements from actinium Ac to lawrencium Lr are called actinoids Table The general symbol of these elements is An All the actinoid elements are radioactive and very poisonous Actinoids that exist in nature in considerable amounts are thorium Th protactinium Pa and uranium U and thorium and uranium are actually isolated from ores and find application Plutonium metal Pu is produced in large quantities in nuclear reactors and its economical efficiency as a fuel for conventional nuclear reactors and fast breeder reactors as well as its safety are being examined As isolable amounts of the elements after americium Am are small and their radioactivity is very high study of their chemical properties is very limited Table Properties of actinoids Atomic number Name Symbol Electron configuration M radius pm Main isotope Actinium Ac ds Ac Thorium Th ds Ac Protactinium Pa fds Th Uranium U fds U U Neptunium Np fs Np Plutonium Pu fs Pu Pu Americium Am s AmAm Curium Cm fds Cm Cm Berkelium Bk fs Bk Californium Cf fs Cf Einsteinium Es fs Fermium Fm fs Mendelevium Md fs Nobelium No fs Lawrencium Lr fds The process of radioactive disintegration of radioactive elements into stable isotopes is of fundamental importance in nuclear chemistry If the amount of a radionuclide which exists at a certain time is N the amount of disintegration in unit time is proportional to N Therefore radioactivity is integration of the equation leads to where N is the number of atoms at zero time and the time during which the radioactivity becomes half of N is the half life Exercise How does a nuclide change with Î± disintegration and disintegration Answer Because an atomic nucleus of helium atom He is emitted by disintegration of a nuclide its atomic number Z becomes Z and its mass number A changes to A In disintegration an electron is emitted and Z becomes a nuclide Z Isolation of thulium Thulium is a rare earth element with the least abundance except promethium and there were remarkable difficulties in isolating it as a pure metal P T Cleve discovered the element in but it was only when the isolation of the metal of almost satisfying purity was reported C James of the United States tried many minerals and found that three ores ytterspar euzenite and columbite produced from an island in the northern Norway were the best source In order to obtain a purer metal of thulium chromates of the mixed rareearth metals obtained by the treatment of a large amount of the ores by sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid oxalic acid and barium chromate were recrystallized repeatedly from water and wateralcohol In those days identification of an element by spectroscopy was already possible and recrystallizations were repeated times over several months proving that it was not possible to obtain purer metal Chemists are requested to repeat monotonous operations even now but it is not likely that patience of this sort still exists This may hinder the progress of our understanding of the chemistry of rare earth elements Although actinoids are similar to lanthanoids in that their electrons fill the f orbitals in order their chemical properties are not uniform and each element has characteristic properties Promotion of f d electrons does not require a large amount of energy and examples of compounds with acid ligands are known in which all the f d s and p orbitals participate in bonding Trivalent compounds are the most common but other oxidation states are not uncommon Especially thorium protactinium uranium and neptunium tend to assume the or higher oxidation state Because their radioactivity level is low thorium and uranium which are found as minerals can be handled legally in a normal laboratory Compounds such as ThO ThCl UO UCl UCl UCl UF etc find frequent use Especially uranium hexafluoride UF is sublimable and suitable for gas diffusion and undergoes a gas centrifuge process for the separation of U Thorium is an oxophilic element similar to the lanthanoids problems What is the reason for the relatively easy separation of cerium and europium among the lanthanoids which were difficult to isolate Calculate the radioactivity after a period of times as long as the halflife of a given material
