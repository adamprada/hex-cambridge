No headers In studying redox chemistry it is important to begin by learning to balance electrochemical reactions Simple redox reactions for example H I HI can be balanced by inspection but for more complex reactions it is helpful to have a foolproof systematic method The ionelectron method allows one to balance redox reactions regardless of their complexity We illustrate this method with two examples Example I is oxidized to IO by MnO which is reduced to Mn How can this reaction be balanced In the ionelectron method we follow a series of four steps Step A Write out the unbalanced reaction and identify the elements that are undergoing redox MnO I IO Mn The elements undergoing redox are Mn and I Step B Separate the reaction into two half reactions balancing the element undergoing redox in each MnO Mn I IO Step A Balance the oxygen atoms by adding water to one side of each half reaction MnO Mn HO HO I IO Step B Balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H ions H MnO Mn HO The left side has a net charge of and the right side has a net charge of HO I IO H The left side has a net charge of and the right side has a net charge of Step C Balance the overall charge by adding electrons H e MnO Mn HO The left side has a charge of while the right side has a charge of They are balanced HO I IO H e The left side has a charge of while the right side has a charge of They are balanced Note We did not need to explicitly determine the oxidation states of Mn or I to arrive at the correct number of electrons in each half reaction Step Combine the half reactions so that there are equal numbers of electrons on the left and right sides H e MnO Mn HO HO I IO H e H e HO MnO I IO Mn HO e H Cancel the H electrons and water H e HO MnO I IO Mn HO e H The overall balanced reaction is therefore H MnO I IO Mn HO Check your work by making sure that all elements and charges are balanced Step If the reaction occurs under basic conditions we add OH to each side to cancel H H OH MnO I IO Mn HO OH The H OH will become HO so the overall balanced reaction is HO MnO I IO Mn OH Again it is a good idea to check and make sure that all of the elements are balanced and that the charge is the same on both sides If this is not the case you need to find the error in one of the earlier steps Example Redox reaction of SO and HO SO HO SO HO Which elements are undergoing redox S and O Step Write out half reactions balancing the element undergoing redox SO SO HO HO Step A Balance oxygen already balanced Step B Balance hydrogen SO SO HO H HO Step C Balance charge by adding electrons SO SO e HO H e HO Step Combine the half reactions so that there are equal numbers of electrons on the left and right sides already equal Overall balanced reaction SO HO H SO HO Note that again we did not need to know the formal oxidation states of S or O in the reactants and products in order to balance the reaction In this case assigning the oxidation states would be rather complex because SO and SO both contain sulfur in more than one oxidation state
