No headers Many layered dichalcogenides such as TiS and ZrS have the CdI structure In these compounds as we have noted above the metal ions are octahedrally coordinated by S Interestingly the structures of MoS and WS while they are also layered are different In these cases the metal is surrounded by a trigonal prism of sulfur atoms NbS TaS MoSe MoTe and WSe also have the trigonal prismatic molybdenite structure which is shown below alongside a platy crystal of MoS The coordination of the metal ions by a trigonal prism of chalcogenide ions is sterically unfavorable relative to octahedral coordination There are close contacts between the chalcogenide ions which are eclipsed in the stacking sequence AbABaBAbABaB where indicates the van der Waals gap between layers What stabilizes this structure The molybdenite structure occurs most commonly in MX compounds with a d or d electron count The figure below compares the splitting of dorbital energies in the octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments The trigonal prismatic structure is stabilized in MoS by filling the lowest energy band the dz The dz orbital which points vertically through the triangular top and bottom faces of the trigonal prism has the least interaction with the sulfide ligands and therefore the lowest energy The dxz and dyz orbitals which point at the ligands have the highest energy The dz orbital is lower in energy in this structure than the tg orbitals are in the octahedral structure of TiS dorbital splittings and energy bands in TiS and MoS MoS is a semiconductor with a eV gap between its filled and empty bands Because it has an unfilled tg band TiS is relatively easy to reduce by intercalation with Li For this reason LiTiS was one of the first intercalation compounds studied by Stanley Whittingham who developed the concept of the nonaqueous lithium ion battery in the early s Because it has a filled dz band MoS is harder to reduce but it can be intercalated by reaction with the powerful reducing agent nbutyllithium to make LixMoS x Atoms in the van der Waals planes of these compounds are relatively unreactive which gives MoS its good oxidative stability and enables its application as a high temperature lubricant Atoms at the edges of the crystals are however more reactive and in fact are catalytic High surface area MoS which has a high density of exposed edge planes is used as a hydrodesulfurization catalyst and is also of increasing interest as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of water to hydrogen Layered metal dichalcogenides including MoS WS and SnS can form closed nanostructures that take the shape of multiwalled onions and multiwalled tubes These materials were discovered by the group of Reshef Tenne in shortly after the discovery of carbon nanotubes Since then nanotubes have been synthesized from many other materials including vanadium and manganese oxides The pyrite FeS crystal structure The structure is related to NaCl with Fe and S ions occupying the cation and anion sites Although early TiS and late PtS transition metal disulfides have layered structures a number of MS compounds in the middle of the transition series such as MnS FeS and RuS have threedimensionally bonded structures For example FeS has the pyrite structure which is related to the NaCl structure The reason is that FeS is not FeS but is actually FeS where S is the disulfide anion which contains a single bond like the peroxide anion O S is too strong a reducing agent to exist in the same compound with Fe which is a strong oxidizing agent Because FeS is actually FeS it is a compound and adopts a structure
