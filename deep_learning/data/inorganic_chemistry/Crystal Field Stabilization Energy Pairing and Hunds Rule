Magnetism of transition metal complexesColors and spectra of transition metal complexes The splitting of the dorbitals into different energy levels in transition metal complexes has important consequences for their stability reactivity and magnetic properties Let us first consider the simple case of the octahedral complexes MHO where M Ti V Cr Because the complexes are octahedral they all have the same energy level diagram The Ti V and Cr complexes have one two and three delectrons respectively which fill the degenerate tg orbitals singly The spins align parallel according to Hunds rule which states that the lowest energy state has the highest spin angular momentum For each of these complexes we can calculate a crystal field stabilization energy CFSE which is the energy difference between the complex in its ground state and in a hypothetical state in which all five dorbitals are at the energy barycenter For Ti there is one electron stabilized by ΔO so Similarly CFSE ΔO and ΔO for V and Cr respectively For Cr complexes which have four delectrons the situation is more complicated Now we can have a high spin configuration tgeg or a low spin configuration tgeg in which two of the electrons are paired What are the energies of these two states High spin Low spin where P is the pairing energy Energy difference ΔO P The pairing energy P is the energy penalty for putting two electrons in the same orbital resulting from the electrostatic repulsion between electrons For d elements a typical value of P is about cm The important result here is that a complex will be low spin if ΔO P and high spin if ΔO P Because ΔO depends on both the metals and the ligands it determines the spin state of the complex Rules of thumb d complexes are high spin with weak field ligands and low spin with strong field ligands High valent d complexes eg Co complexes tend to be low spin large ΔO d and d complexes are always low spin large ΔO Note that high and low spin states occur only for d metal complexes with between and delectrons Complexes with to delectrons can accommodate all electrons in individual orbitals in the tg set Complexes with or delectrons will always have completely filled tg orbitals and electrons in the eg set dorbital energy diagrams for high and low spin Co complexes d Examples of high and low spin complexes CoHO contains a d metal ion with a weak field ligand This complex is known to be high spin from magnetic susceptibility measurements which detect three unpaired electrons per molecule Its orbital occupancy is tgeg We can calculate the CFSE as CoCN is also an octahedral d complex but it contains CN a strong field ligand Its orbital occupancy is tgeg and it therefore has one unpaired electron In this case the CFSE is Magnetism of transition metal complexes Compounds with unpaired electrons have an inherent magnetic moment that arises from the electron spin Such compounds interact strongly with applied magnetic fields Their magnetic susceptibility provides a simple way to measure the number of unpaired electrons in a transition metal complex If a transition metal complex has no unpaired electrons it is diamagnetic and is weakly repelled from the high field region of an inhomogeneous magnetic field Complexes with unpaired electrons are typically paramagnetic The spins in paramagnets align independently in an applied magnetic field but do not align spontaneously in the absence of a field Such compounds are attracted to a magnet ie they are drawn into the high field region of an inhomogeneous field The attractive force which can be measured with a Guoy balance or a SQUID magnetometer is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility χ of the complex The effective magnetic moment of an ion µeff in the absence of spinorbit coupling is given by the sum of its spin and orbital moments In octahedral d metal complexes the orbital angular momentum is largely quenched by symmetry so we can approximate We can calculate µs from the number of unpaired electrons n using Here µB is the Bohr magneton ehπme x JT This spinonly formula is a good approximation for firstrow transition metal complexes especially high spin complexes The table below compares calculated and experimentally measured values of µeff for octahedral complexes with unpaired electrons Ion Number of unpaired electrons Spinonly moment μB observed moment μB Ti V Cu V Ni V Cr Co Mn Cr Fe Mn Fe The small deviations from the spinonly formula for these octahedral complexes can result from the neglect of orbital angular momentum or of spinorbit coupling Tetrahedral d d d and d complexes tend to show larger deviations from the spinonly formula than octahedral complexes of the same ion because quenching of the orbital contribution is less effective in the tetrahedral case Summary of rules for high and low spin complexes d complexes Can be high or low spin depending on the ligand d d d d d and d complexes Always low spin because ΔO is large Maximum CFSE is for d and d cases eg Cr Ni with weak field ligands HO O F and for dd with strong field ligands Fe Ru Os Co Rh Ir IrvingWilliams series For M complexes the stability of the complex follows the order Mg Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn This trend represents increasing Lewis acidity as the ions become smaller going left to right in the periodic table as well as the trend in CFSE This same trend is reflected in the hydration enthalpy of gasphase M ions as illustrated in the graph at the right Note that Ca Mn and Zn which are d dhigh spin and d aquo ions respectively all have zero CFSE and fall on the same line Ions that deviate the most from the line such as Ni octahedral d have the highest CFSE Colors and spectra of transition metal complexes Transition metal complexes often have beautiful colors because as noted above their dd transition energies can be in the visible part of the spectrum With octahedral complexes these colors are faint the transitions are weak because they violate the Laporte selection rule According to this rule g g and u u transitions are forbidden in centrosymmetric complexes dorbitals have g gerade symmetry so dd transitions are Laporteforbidden However octahedral complexes can absorb light when they momentarily distort away from centrosymmetry as the molecule vibrates Spin flips are also forbidden in optical transitions by the spin selection rule so the excited state will always have the same spin multiplicity as the ground state The spectra of even the simplest transition metal complexes are rather complicated because of the many possible ways in which the delectrons can fill the tg and eg orbitals For example if we consider a d complex such as Vaq we know that the two electrons can reside in any of the five dorbitals and can either be spinup or spindown There are actually different such arrangements called microstates that do not violate the Pauli exclusion principle for a d complex Usually we are concerned only with the six of lowest energy in which both electrons occupy individual orbitals in the tg set and all their spins are aligned either up or down From left VHO lilac VHO green VOHO blue and VOHO yellow We can see how these microstates play a role in electronic spectra when we consider the dd transitions of the CrNH ion This ion is d so each of the three tg orbitals contains one unpaired electron We expect to see a transition when one of the three electrons in the tg orbitals is excited to an empty eg orbital Interestingly we find not one but two transitions in the visible The reason that we see two transitions is that the electron can come from any one of the tg orbitals and end up in either of the eg orbitals Let us assume for the sake of argument that the electron is initially in the dxy orbital It can be excited to either the dz or the dxy orbital higher energy lower energy The first transition is at higher energy shorter wavelength because in the excited state the configuration is dyzdxzdz All three of the excited state orbitals have some zcomponent so the delectron density is piled up along the zaxis The energy of this transition is thus increased by electronelectron repulsion In the second case the excited state configuration is dyzdxzdxy and the delectrons are more symmetrically distributed around the metal This effect is responsible for a splitting of the dd bands by about cm We can show that all other possible transitions are equivalent to one of these two by symmetry and hence we see only two visible absorption bands for Cr complexes
