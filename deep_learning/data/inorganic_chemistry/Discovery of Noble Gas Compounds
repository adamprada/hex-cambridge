No headers In at the University of British Columbia Neil Bartlett was working with the powerful oxidizer PtF and because of an accidental leak in his vacuum line noticed the compounds reaction with O to generate a solid with formula PtFO The formula suggested Pt in the oxidation state which was clearly unreasonable because PtF was known to be a more powerful oxidizer than either molecular fluorine F or molecular oxygen O Bartlett noticed that the Xray powder diffraction pattern of the compound was similar to that of CsAsF a salt with the CsCl structure in which octahedral AsF ions occupy the chloride ion sites This led Bartlett to propose a formulation of OPtF for his new compound Magnetic susceptibility data subsequently confirmed the presence of the paramagnetic O cation which see Chapter has a bond order of This formulation implies that PtF was a strong enough oxidizing agent to oxidize molecular oxygen But just how strong an oxidizer is PtF Its electron affinity could be estimated by using a BornHaber cycle filling in the lattice energy of OPtF by means of Kapustinskiis formula The electron affinity EA for PtF can be calculated as EA kJmol To put it in perspective this is kJmol more exothermic than the electron affinity of atomic fluorine kJ PtF was by far the strongest oxidizer that had ever been made Crystals of xenon difluoride XeF which is made by photolysis of a gas mixture of Xe and F XeF is used as a selective etchant for SiO in certain microelectronic fabrication processes Prior to Neil Bartletts discovery of the first xenon compound in it was believed that elements in group VIII He Ne Ar Kr Xe could not form chemical compounds Since then chemists have discovered a rich family of noble gas compounds containing Xe Kr or Ar Bartlett recognized that Xe has ionization energy of kJ which is very close to the ionization energy of O Since Xe should be about the same size as O the lattice energy should be about the same with Xe in the cation site of the OPtF structure Since all of the other terms in the BornHaber cycle for the reaction of Xe with PtF are the same Bartlett concluded that XePtF like OPtF should be a stable compound He purchased a lecture bottle of xenon gas and reacted the two compounds producing an orange solid While the product initially formed in the reaction may in fact be XePtF the Xe free radical is a powerful Lewis acid and reacts further with excess PtF The ultimate product of the reaction is formulated XeFPtF a salt which contains Xe in the oxidation state and Pt in the oxidation state This was an important discovery because it shattered the dogmatic notion which derived from the octet rule that elements in group VIII could not form bonds with other elements The name of this group was changed from the inert gases to the noble gases Subsequently many compounds of Xe and a few of Kr and even Ar which is much harder to oxidize were synthesized and characterized
