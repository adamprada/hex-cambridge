No headers The standard state is defined as the one corresponding to C K unit activity for all the substances in an electrochemical zerocurrent cell under bar of pressure Pa For a reaction in which H ions participate the standard state is pH approximately mol acid In the hydrogen electrode used as the standard of electrode potential atm of hydrogen gas aH is slowly contacted with a platinumblack electrode immersed in a strong acid solution of activity aH The potential is expressed as and by definition E in the standard state The hydrogen electrode in the standard state is called the standard hydrogen electrode or NHE Although reduction potential is usually expressed with reference to the NHE standard the hydrogen electrode is inconvenient to handle Therefore a saturated calomel SCE or an Ag AgCl electrode is used as a reference electrode for everyday electrochemical measurements and experimental potentials are measured against these electrodes or converted into NHE values When the NHE value is set to the SCE value is V and the AgAgCl value is V A redox reaction takes place only when redox partners exist and a reactant can be either an oxidant or reductant depending on its reaction partner The relative redox capability can be expressed numerically by introducing the reduction potentials E of imaginary halfreactions Table The free energy change of a reaction is related to E where n is the number of transferred electrons and F the Faraday constant C mol Table Standard reduction potentials at C Couple E V Fg e F aq HOaq H aq e HOl Ceaq e Ceaq MnO aq H aq e Mnaq HOl Clg e Cl aq Og H aq e HOl Brl e Br aq Feaq e Feaq AgCls e Ags Cl aq Cuaq e Cu aq H aq e Hg Snaq e Sns Feaq e Fes Znaq e Zns Alaq e Als Mgaq e Mgs Na aq e Nas Li aq e Lis For example the two reactions beginsplit H aq e rightarrow H_ g qquad Delta G_ FE_ Zn aq e rightarrow Zn s qquad Delta G_ FE_ endsplit do not occur independently but if both H aq and Zn s are present the redox reaction takes place The equation for the actual reaction is complete when the latter equation is subtracted from the former The free energy change of the whole redox reaction is the difference between for the respective halfreactions Because halfreactions are not real and they are used in pairs the free energy change of H is set to zero for convenience Since the experimental value of is kJ equals kJ Potential corresponding to of a halfreaction is called the standard reduction potential Therefore The standard potentials of various halfreactions are determined using similar procedures to that mentioned above Table The E s of redox reactions can be calculated by combining E of these halfreactions If E of a redox reaction is positive is negative and the reaction occurs spontaneously Consequently instead of the free energy change the difference in reduction potentials can be used to judge the thermodynamic spontaneity of a reaction The higher the reduction potential of a reagent the stronger its oxidation ability The positive or negative signs are based on the expedient of setting the reduction potential of a proton to and it should be understood that a positive sign does not necessarily mean oxidizing and a negative sign reducing The series arranged in the order of redox power is called the electrochemical series
