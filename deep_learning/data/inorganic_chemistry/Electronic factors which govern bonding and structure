and structure of a compound are determined by electronic properties such as the power of constituent atoms to attract or repel electrons the molecular orbitals occupied by valence electrons etc Geometrical arrangements of atoms are also influenced by the electronic interactions between nonbonding electrons Here some fundamental concepts are described a Effective nuclear charge Since the positive nuclear charge is generally offset by the negative charge of the internal electrons in the electron shell inside the valence electrons the nuclear charge that valence electrons feel is smaller than the integer charge Ze for an atomic number Z This reduction is expressed by the shielding constant and the net nuclear charge is called the effective nuclear charge Zeff e The effective nuclear charge varies with different electron orbitals and distances from the nucleus b Ionization energy Ionization energy is defined as the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the atom in a gaseous phase g as shown in the following equation Ionization energy is expressed in units of electron volt eV where eV kJ mol The st ionization energy which removes the outermost electron is the smallest and the nd and rd ionization energies which further ionize cations increase rapidly The ionization enthalpy which is the standard enthalpy change of the ionization process and is used in thermodynamic calculations is the ionization energy multiplied by RT R is the universal gas constant J K mol and T is temperature kJ eV at room temperature The difference between these two parameters is small The st ionization energy varies periodically with atomic number across the periodic table with the lower left cesium Cs being the smallest and the upper right helium He the largest It is understandable that alkali metals generally have the lowest ionization energies because they are stabilized by removal of an s electron to attain the rare gas configuration Rare gas elements have stable electronic structures and their ionization energies are the largest Although the ionization energy increases almost monotonically from alkali metals to rare gases in each period there are reversals at several places such as nitrogen N and oxygen O and phosphorus P and sulfur S The st ionization energies are given in Table Table Electronic parameters of atoms eV I st ionization energy

Xe Cs Ba La Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi c Electron affinity Electron affinity is the negative of the electrongain enthalpy Heg of an atom in a gas phase as shown in the following equation and denoted by Ae Heg Table It may be regarded as the ionization enthalpy of an anion Since halogen atoms achieve rare gas electron configurations if an electron is added to them their electron affinities are large d Electronegativity Electronegativity is one of the most fundamental atomic parameters which expresses numerically the tendency to attract electrons to atoms in a molecule It is very useful in explaining differences in bonding structure and reaction from the standpoint of atomic properties Various schemes have been proposed to explain the theoretical basis of the power of electron attraction and studies are still actively seeking new numerical values of electronegativity The Pauling scale introduced first in is still the most frequently used and subsequent new numerical values have been justified if they are close to those of Pauling L Pauling defined electronegativity as the quantitative ionic character of bonds Originally the following equation was proposed as a formula to define the ionic character of the bond between atoms A and B where D is the bond energy of a covalent bond However it turned out that is not necessarily positive and Pauling modified the definition and redefined it as the ionic character of the AB bond Furthermore electronegativity was defined in such a way that the difference of the electronegativities of atoms A and B is proportional to the square root of the ionic character Here the coefficient is so determined that the electronegativity of hydrogen H becomes when bond energies are expressed in kcal mol Since Pauling electronegativities increase the higher the oxidization states of an atom these values correspond to the highest oxidization number of each element The electronegativities calculated using recent values of bond energies are shown in Table H Li Be Na Mg K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Cs Ba Lanthanoid Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Fr Ra Actinoid He B C N O F Ne Al Si P S Cl Ar Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Kr Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Xe Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Po At Rn A L Allred and E G Rochow defined electronegativity as the electric field Zeff r on the atomic surface They added a constant in order to make the electronegativity as near as possible to the Pauling values by using r for the covalent bond radius of atoms It turns out that elements with small covalent radii and large effective nuclear charges have large electronegativities Table R Mulliken defined electronegativity as the average of the ionization energy I and electron affinity Ae as follows Figure As ionization energy is the energy of electronic excitation from the HOMO and electron affinity the energy of electron addition to the LUMO refer to Section e in this definition electronegativity can also be called the average value of the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO Those elements which are hard to ionize and easy to attract electrons have large values Although the electronegativity is defined for the atoms in a valence state in a molecule and has the dimensions of energy it is treated as a dimensionless number Table Figure Mulliken electronegativity Although the definition of Mulliken is intelligible since it is directly related to atomic orbitals generally the values of Pauling or AllredRochow are used As these values are not much different the Pauling electronegativity is appropriate when choosing only one Electronegativity values change not only by definition but are also considerably affected by the bonding state of atoms and they should be used with considerable caution The electronegativities of the constituent atoms are fundamental to explaining the differences in bonding structure and reactions of compounds Therefore theoretical chemists continue in their efforts firmly to extend the foundations of this parameter Exercise Describe the numerical tendency of electronegativities of the elements in the periodic table Answer They increase toward the right and decrease down the table Namely the electronegativity of alkali metal Cs is the smallest and that of fluorine F is the largest e Molecular orbitals The wave functions of electrons in an atom are called atomic orbitals Since the probability of finding electrons in a molecular orbital is proportional to the square of a wave function the electron map looks like a wave function A wave function has domains of positive and negative amplitude called lobes The overlapping positive lobes or negative lobes of the wave functions of atoms in a molecule amplify each other to form a bond but the positive and negative lobes cancel each other forming no bond The extent of this interference effect corresponds to the magnitude of the overlap integral in quantum chemistry In the formation of a molecule atomic orbitals overlap to generate a molecular orbital which is the wave function of the electrons in the molecule The number of molecular orbitals is the sum of the atomic orbitals and these molecular orbitals are classified into bonding nonbonding or antibonding molecular orbitals by the extent of their participation in the bond between atoms The conditions of the formation of a bonding molecular orbital are as follows Conditions of the formation of bonding molecular orbitals The lobes of the atomic orbitals of the constituent atoms are suitable for an overlap The positive or negative sign of the overlapping lobes is the same The energy levels of atomic orbitals are close The simplest case where a molecular orbital is constructed from atomic orbitals A and B is explained here A bonding molecular orbital is formed between A and B if the above mentioned conditions and are satisfied but if the sign of one of the atomic orbitals is reversed condition is not satisfied and an antibonding molecular orbital in which the signs of the overlapping lobes are different Figure results The energy level of a bonding orbital is lower and the level of an antibonding orbital is higher than those of the constituent atomic orbitals The larger the energy difference of a bonding and an antibonding orbital the stronger the bond When there is no bonding or antibonding interaction between A and B the resultant molecular orbital is a nonbonding orbital Electrons occupy the molecular orbitals in order of lowest to highest energy levels The highest occupied molecular orbital is called the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied one the LUMO Kenichi Fukui Nobel prize named these orbitals frontier orbitals Two or more molecular orbitals of equal energy are called degenerate orbitals The symbol of a nondegenerate orbital is a or b a doubly degenerate orbital e and triply degenerate orbital t The symbol g gerade is attached as a suffix to the centrosymmetric orbital and u ungerade to the orbital which changes sign under inversion around an inversion center The number before the symmetry symbol is used in order of energy to distinguish orbitals of the same degeneracy Additionally they are named sigma or pi orbitals according to the orbital character A sigma orbital has rotation symmetry around the bond axis and a pi orbital has a nodal plane Therefore sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of ss pp sd pd and dd orbitals Figure and pi bonds the overlap of pp pd and dd orbitals Figure Figure Construction of molecular orbitals Figure The molecular orbitals Figure The molecular orbitals When the wave functions of two atoms are set to and a molecular orbital is a linear combination of the atomic orbitals LCAO expressed as Only the atomic orbitals of the valence electron shell are used in the simplest molecular orbital method Construction of a molecular orbital is illustrated below for the simplest case of the twoatom molecules All the levels below the HOMO are occupied by electrons and the levels above the LUMO are empty In a hydrogen molecule H the overlap of the s orbital of each hydrogen atom forms a bonding orbital if the lobes have equal sign and an antibonding orbital if they have opposite signs and two electrons occupy the bonding orbital Figure Figure The molecular orbitals of H The arrows indicate the electron spins In the twoatom molecules of the nd period from lithium Li to fluorine F if the z axis is set as a bond axis and are formed by the overlap of s orbital of each atom and and from pz orbitals and and from px and py The orbital energy levels for the molecules from Li to N are ordered as and electrons occupy the levels sequentially from the bottom The example of an N molecule with ten valence electrons is shown in Figure Since the ordering of orbitals is somewhat different in O and F in which the orbital comes under that of the molecular orbital of the oxygen molecule O is illustrated in Figure The th and th electrons among the valence electrons occupy the doubly degenerate orbital in the ground state and they have parallel spins under Hunds rule and hence an oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons Figure Molecular orbitals of N Figure Molecular orbitals of O The molecular orbitals of two different atoms are formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals with different energy levels The energy level of the orbital of the atom with larger electronegativity generally is lower and the molecular orbitals are more characteristic of the atomic orbital with the nearer energy level Therefore the bonding orbitals have the character of the atom with the larger electronegativity and the antibonding orbitals that of the atom with the smaller electronegativity For example five molecular orbitals in hydrogen fluoride HF are formed from the s orbital of hydrogen and the s and p orbitals of fluorine as shown in Figure The bonding orbital has the s character of fluorine and the antibonding orbital the s character of hydrogen Since hydrogen has only one s orbital the overlap with the p orbital of fluorine with character is not effective and the fluorine p orbital becomes a nonbonding orbital Since HF has eight valence electrons this nonbonding orbital is the HOMO Figure Molecular orbitals of HF In carbon monoxide CO carbon and oxygen have s and p orbitals resulting in both sigma and pi bonds and a triple bond is formed between the atoms Although molecular orbitals in this case are qualitatively the same as those of the isolectronic nitrogen molecule N and electrons occupy the orbital up to the energy level of each orbital differs from that of the nitrogen molecule The bonding orbital has the s character of oxygen because of its larger electronegativity and the bonding orbital also has the p character of oxygen The antibonding and orbitals have the p character of carbon Figure Figure Molecular orbitals of CO The bond order between atoms is a half of the number of electrons in the bonding orbitals minus those of the antibonding orbitals For example in N or CO it is equal to and is consistent with the Lewis structure Exercise Why are the atomic orbitals of oxygen atom in the molecular orbital diagram of carbon monoxide CO lower than those of carbon Answer It is because the electronegativity of oxygen is larger than that of carbon problems Using the Pauling equation calculate the electronegativity of chlorine from the bond energies of the hydrogen molecule H kJ mol chlorine molecule Cl kJ mol and hydrogen chloride HCl molecule kJ mol and electronegativity of hydrogen Why are the energy levels in the orbitals of sigma character and in those of pi character in the molecular orbital diagram of N or O Great theory and evaluation Lewis valence electron theory proposes that a covalent bond is formed with an electron pair and that there are eight valence electrons around each atom This is a very important concept with which we understand the bonds between the main group elements However the theory was not held in high enough regard for a Nobel prize to be awarded to Lewis One of the reasons of this disregard seems to be that chemists in the United States Lewis homeland ignored his theory at first and that a Nobel prize laureate Langmuir extended Lewiss theory which was later known as the LewisLangmuir theory N Bohr the eminent physicist who had great influence on the Nobel prize selection evaluated Langmuirs adsorption theory more highly which suggests that physicists considered Lewis theory too simplistic There is a similar story about the transition state theory of H Eyring Physicists and theoretical chemists who liked mathematical treatment of chemical phenomena thought Eyrings theory too unsophisticated For this reason the most important concept in chemical kinetics was not considered for a Nobel prize It is an episode in the history of chemistry which reminds us of the comment of R Hoffmann who pointed out that simple concepts are more important than deceptively complicated mathematical theories
