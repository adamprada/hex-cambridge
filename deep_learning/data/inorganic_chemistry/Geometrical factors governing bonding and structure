Atomic and ionic radiiLattice enthalpyMadelung constantd Structure of metal crystalsIonic CrystalRadius ratioVariation of the solid structure expression Two parameters radii and the electron attracting power of atoms or ions determine the bonding structure and reaction of elementary substances and compounds Much effort has been devoted to finding numerical values for these two factors applicable to all materials It is hoped that the chemical properties of a known compound and of a still nonexistent new material can be predicted with a combination of suitable numerical values Firstly geometrical factors will be described Table Atomic radii pm H Li Be B C N O F Na Mg Al Si P S Cl K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Cs Ba La Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Atomic and ionic radii The electron density in atoms gradually approaches but never reaches zero as the distance from the nucleus increases Therefore strictly speaking the radius of an atom or ion is indeterminable However it is possible to determine the bond distance between atomic nuclei experimentally Atomic radii determined experimentally are one of the most important atomic parameters describing the structural chemistry of compounds It is reasonable to define the metal radius of a bulk metal as half of the distance between metal atoms Half of the distance between atoms is defined also as the covalent radius of a covalent elementary substance Table Table Ionic radii in pm Li Be B N O F Na Mg Al P S Cl K Ca Ga As Se Br Rb Sr In Te I Cs Ba Tl Numbers in parentheses are the coordination number of the ions Since the cations and anions of different elements in an ionic compound are bonded by electrostatic interactions the bond distance is the sum of ionic radii assigned to the cation and anion The standard ionic radius of one species is fixed first and is then subtracted from the distance between ions to decide the radius of the partner ion As the standard the radius of O ion in a number of oxides is set to pm pm m R D Shannon Cationic radii in oxides are the difference between the bond distance and pm After cation radii in oxides are decided other anion radii can be calculated by subtraction of the cation radii from the distances between the atoms in ionic compounds By applying such methods to many ionic compounds ionic radii have been compiled in such a way that experimental and calculated values are generally consistent Table Even ionic compounds have some covalent contribution and it is not expected that calculated and experimental bond distances will agree exactly Even if the ionic radius assigned to a standard ion is changed we can still compile a set of ionic radii that are consistent across many compounds Other examples of the proposed radii of O ion are pm V M Goldschmidt or pm J C Slater We must also be mindful that the cationanion distances of the same ion pair become larger as the coordination number of opposite ions increases Therefore in any discussion of the structural features of ionic compounds from a viewpoint of ionic radii a set of the ionic radii calculated using the same standard radius for the compounds with the same coordination number should be used Exercise Which ionic radius is larger Cs or F Answer Cs pm F pm The anion radius is not always larger The metal and covalent radii also called the atomic radii become smaller in the same period of the periodic table as the group of the element goes to the right and then increase again in the next period The lanthanide contraction is responsible for the th period d elements having almost the same atomic radii as those of the th period d ones In the periodic table the lanthanide elements are inserted before the d elements The atomic radii of lanthanide elements decrease noticeably as the effective nuclear charge increases because the screening effects of the f orbitals of lanthanide elements are weak due to their orbital shapes Consequently the atomic radii of the elements following lanthanides are very similar to those of the d elements Lattice enthalpy Although the stability of a crystal at constant temperature and pressure depends on the Gibbs free energy change of the crystals formation from its constituent ions the stability of a crystal is determined mostly by the enthalpy change alone since the lattice formation is very exothermic and the entropy term is negligibly small refer to Section Lattice enthalpy is defined as the standard enthalpy change of the reaction in which an ionic crystal decomposes into gaseous ions s is solid g is gas and L is lattice Lattice enthalpy is indirectly calculated from the values of the enthalpy change at each stage using a BornHaber cycle Figure Namely a closed cycle is formed using enthalpy data standard enthalpy of formation of an ionic crystal from elements sublimation enthalpy of an elementary solid or atomization enthalpy Î—ion which is the sum of the ionization enthalpy of cation formation and electron acquisition enthalpy of anion formation Lattice enthalpy is calculated using the relation that enthalpy change in a cycle is zero Figure BornHaber cycle of KCl Madelung constant The total Coulomb potential energy that exists between the ions in an ionic crystal consisting of ions A and B should be the sum of the individual Coulomb potential energies Vab Since the locations of the ions in the crystal lattice are decided by the structure type the total Coulomb potential between all ions is calculated by setting the distance between the ions to d A is the Madelung constant that is characteristic of each crystal type Table NA is Avogadros constant and zA and zB are the electric charges of the cation and anion The electrostatic interaction between contiguous ions is the strongest and the Madelung constant generally becomes larger as the coordination number increases Because the electrical charges have opposite signs the potential becomes negative indicating the stabilization that accompanies the formation of a crystal lattice from well dispersed gaseous phase ions Although it is generally true that the lowest electrostatic potential leads to the most stable structure this is not strictly correct since there are also other interactions to consider Table Madelung constants Structural type A Rocksalt Cesium chloride Sphalerite Wurtzite Fluorite Rutile The second largest factor that contributes to the lattice enthalpy is the van der Waals force and dispersion forces or the London interaction is the main origin of this force It is an attractive interaction between electric dipoles which is inversely proportional to the th power of the distance d between ions The van der Waals force is very small The value of the constant C is a function of each compound Since it is at most of the Coulombic force it may be safely neglected in the calculation of lattice enthalpy d Structure of metal crystals If we imagine metal atoms as being hard balls when densely packed in two dimensions each ball will be in contact with six other balls A When another layer of this dimensional arrangement is placed on top of the first the packing will be densest and the structure most energetically stable when the metal atoms are placed on top of the hollows B of the first layer When a rd layer is placed on top of the nd layer there are two possibilities Namely the rd layer A overlaps with the st layer A or the rd layer C overlaps with neither A nor B The ABABtype packing is called hexagonally closepacked hcp Figure and the ABCABCtype is called cubic closepacked ccp Figure In both cases each ball is surrounded by balls that is it is coordinated The coordination polyhedron of hcp is anticubooctahedron Figure Hexagonally closepacked hcp of balls Figure Cubic closepacked ccp of balls and that of ccp is cubooctahedron When the lattice is sliced in different planes the unit lattice of ccp appears to be a facecentered cubic lattice fcc containing a ball at each cubical apex and on the center of each face Figure The unit lattice of hcp is a rhombohedral prism in which two balls are located in the positions shown in Figure There are several different modes of piling up layers other than the normal hcp and ccp and many examples are known Figure Different expressions of cubic closepacked Figure Different expressions of hexagonally closepacked The lattice with another ball at the center of a cubic lattice consisting of eight balls is the body centered cubic lattice bcc and some metals assume this mode of packing The ratio of space occupation in a bcc lattice is smaller than that of closepacked ones but the difference is not large Although the central ball is formally coordinated it is essentially coordinated since there are a further six balls only more distant than the first eight balls However because of the smaller ratio of space occupation bcc appears relatively rarely and pure metals tend to adopt hcp or ccp In both hcp and ccp the cavities among the balls are either the Oh holes enclosed octahedrally by six balls or the Td holes enclosed tetrahedrally by four balls Figure Oh and Td are the symmetry symbols used in group theory In ionic solids if the anions are in hcp or ccp arrangements cations enter into either of these cavities Figure Octahedral and tetrahedral holes Ionic Crystal In ionic crystals such as metal halides oxides and sulfides metal cations and anions are aligned alternately and the solid is bound together mainly by electrostatic bonding Many metal halides dissolve in polar solvents eg sodium chloride NaCl dissolves in water whereas metal oxides and sulfides in which there is a significant contribution of covalent bonding are usually insoluble even in the most polar of solvents The fundamental structure of ionic crystals is that larger ions usually anions are closepacked and smaller ions usually cations enter into the octahedral or tetrahedral cavities between them Ionic crystals are classified into several typical structures according to the kinds of cations and anions involved and their ionic radii Each structure type is called by the name of the typical compound just as the rock salt structure representing the structures of not only NaCl rock salt but also various other compounds Representative structure types of solid compounds and examples belonging to each type are shown in Table Table Crystal types of solidstate compounds Crystal type Coordination number Examples of compounds Rocksalt LiCl NaCl KBr RbI AgCl MgO NiO InP Cesium chloride CsCl CsBr CsI CuZn Sphalerite ZnS CdS HgS CuCl GaP Fluorite CaF SrF CdF ZrO UO Rutile TiO SnO RuO NiF Cadmium iodide CdI CoI MgOH Rhenium oxide ReO WO ScOH Perovskite CaTiO BaTiO SrTiO Rocksalt structure Sodium chloride NaCl is a typical compound in which Cl anions are arranged in ccp and Na cations occupy all the octahedral holes Oh holes Figure Each Na cation is surrounded by six Cl anions The same structure results even if the positions of anions and cations are exchanged In the case of the reversed structure each Cl anion is surrounded by six Na cations Namely each ion is coordinated and it is convenient to describe the structure as the structure The number of ions in a unit lattice is calculated by summing up the ions shown in Figure Since there is one ion inside the lattice the ions on the faces of the lattice are shared by on the edges by and on the corners by lattices a net of Cl ions belonging to the unit lattice of NaCl is obtained by multiplying the numbers of ions inside the lattice by on the faces by on the edges by and on the corners by The number of Na ions in the unit lattice is also and the ratio of Cl and Na ions agrees with the formula NaCl Figure Rocksalt structure Cesium chloride structure Cesium chloride CsCl is a typical example of the structure shown in Figure There is a Cs ion at the center and eight Cl are located at the eight corners of the cube Conversely even if a Cl comes to the center and eight Cs come to the corners the number of each ion in the unit lattice is the same Thus this is referred to as the structure Since there is one Cs and one Cl ion belonging to this unit lattice it coincides with the formula CsCl Figure Cesium chloride structure Zinc blende structure Zinc blende has the composition ZnS and its unit lattice is shown in Figure S anions are arranged in ccp and Zn cations occupy half of the tetrahedral holes Td holes In this arrangement each cation is coordinated by four anions and each anion by four cations Hence this is a structure There are both four Zn and S ions belonging to this unit lattice and the atomic ratio coincides with the formula of ZnS Figure Zinc blende structure Fluorite structure The composition of fluorite is CaF Since the number of F is twice that of Ca all the tetrahedral holes of Ca arranged in ccp are occupied by F as shown in Figure There are four Ca and eight F ions and the number of ions is times the formula The antifluorite structure exchanges the cations and anions and is exemplified by potassium oxide KO etc Figure Fluorite structure Exercise How many cations and anions are there in a unit lattice of zinc blende structure Answer All four cations are included in a unit lattice The anions occupy the corners and faces and the number is x x Radius ratio Generally the total Coulombic potential energy Ec of the univalent ionic compound MX is expressed by the following formula NA is the Avogadro constant A the Madelung constant and R the distance between ions According to this formula a structure with a larger A R ratio is more stable The Madelung constant of an MX compound increases with increasing coordination number On the other hand it is advantageous to lower the coordination number and to reduce R in the case of small M rendering contact between M and X more difficult In an ionic crystal the ratio of rM and rX with the anions contacting each other and also with the cations depends on the coordination number In a partial structure consisting only of anions the anions form a coordination polyhedron around a cation The anionic radius rX is one half of the distance of the edge of the polyhedron and the distance from the cation center to an apex of the polyhedron is the sum of the anion and cation radii rX rM The coordination polyhedron of the CsCl structure is a cube the NaCl structure an octahedron and the ZnS structure a tetrahedron The distance from the center of each polyhedron to an apex is fracsqrt r_X Therefore the ratios of the cationic and anionic radii rM rX are fracsqrt r_X r_Xr_X sqrt for CsCl fracsqrt r_X r_Xr_X sqrt for NaCl and fracfracsqrt r_X r_Xr_x fracsqrt for ZnS structures Figure It has been explained that the coordination number decreases when these radius ratios are smaller than the given values since cations and anions do not come into contact with each other causing instability On the other hand the coordination number increases for larger cations increasing the radius ratio However the relation between a coordination number and a radius ratio is not simple For example halides of alkali metals adopt the NaCl structures at normal temperatures except cesium chloride CsCl cesium bromide CsBr and cesium iodide CsI It is not possible to assume structure types from the radius ratios even in the case of simple ionic compounds like alkali metal halides However the qualitative trend that smaller cations have smaller coordination numbers is generally correct Figure The radius ratio rM rX of cations and anions Variation of the solid structure expression Many solidstate inorganic compounds have complicated threedimensional structures Different structural illustrations for the same compound help our understanding of its structure In the case of complicated inorganic compounds drawing bond lines between atoms as in most organic compounds causes confusion The anions in many metal oxides sulfides or halides form tetrahedra or octahedra around the central metal cations Although there is no bond between anions the structures are greatly simplified if they are illustrated by the anion polyhedra sharing apexes edges or faces In such illustrations cationic metal atoms are usually omitted As has been mentioned ionic solid structures can be thought of as a close packed arrays of anions Figures and illustrate these three representations for molecular phosphorus pentoxide PO PO and molybdenum pentachloride MoCl MoCl Polyhedral representations are much easier to understand for the structures of large molecules or solidstate compounds formed by an infinite number of atoms However the bond line representation is suitable for molecular compounds such as the above examples Figure Three expressions for the structure of PO Figure Three expressions for the structure of MoCl
