Radius ratio rules Atoms in crystals are held together by electrostatic forces van der Waals interactions and covalent bonding It follows that arrangements of atoms that can maximize the strength of these attractive interactions should be most favorable and lead to the most commonly observed crystal structures Radius ratio rules Early crystallographers had trouble solving the structures of inorganic solids using Xray diffraction because some of the mathematical tools for analyzing the data had not yet been developed Once a trial structure was proposed it was relatively easy to calculate the diffraction pattern but it was difficult to go the other way from the diffraction pattern to the structure if nothing was known a priori about the arrangement of atoms in the unit cell It was and still is important to develop some guidelines for guessing the coordination numbers and bonding geometries of atoms in crystals The first such rules were proposed by Linus Pauling who considered how one might pack together oppositely charged spheres of different radii Pauling proposed from geometric considerations that the quality of the fit depended on the radius ratio of the anion and the cation Atomic and Ionic Radii Note that cations are always smaller than the neutral atom pink of the same element whereas anions are larger Going from left to right across any row of the periodic table neutral atoms and cations contract in size because of increasing nuclear charge click for larger image The basic idea of radius ratio rules is illustrated at the right We consider that the anion is the packing atom in the crystal and the smaller cation fills interstitial sites holes Cations will find arrangements in which they can contact the largest number of anions If the cation can touch all of its nearest neighbor anions as shown at the right for a small cation in contact with larger anions then the fit is good If the cation is too small for a given site that coordination number will be unstable and it will prefer a lower coordination structure The table below gives the ranges of cationanion radius ratios that give the best fit for a given coordination geometry Critical Radius Ratio This diagram is for coordination number six anions in the plane are shown is above the plane and is below The stability limit is at rCrA Coordination number Geometry ρ rcationranion linear triangular tetrahedral square planar octahedral cubic cuboctahedral There are unfortunately several challenges with using this idea to predict crystal structures We dont know the radii of individual ions Atoms in crystals are not really ions there is a varying degree of covalency depending electronegativity differences Bond distances and therefore ionic radii depend on bond strength and coordination number remember Paulings rule Dn D log n Ionic radii depend on oxidation state higher charge smaller cation size larger anion size We can build up a table of ionic radii by assuming that the bond length is the sum of the radii r r if the ions are in contact in the crystal Consider for example the compounds MgX and MnX where X O S Se All of these compounds crystallize in the NaCl structure For the two larger anions S and Se the unit cell dimensions are the same for both cations This suggests that the anions are in contact in these structures From geometric considerations the anion radius in this case is given by and thus the radii of the S and Se ions are and Å respectively Once the sizes of these anions are fixed we can obtain a selfconsistent set of cation and anion radii from the lattice constants of many MX compounds How well does this model work Lets consider the structures of tetravalent metal oxides MO using Pauling radii and the predictions of the radius ratio model Oxide MO Radius ratio Predicted coord no Observed coord no structure CO linear molecule SiO various tetrahedral structures GeO silicalike structures rutile TiO rutile ZrO baddleyite fluorite ThO fluorite Note that cations have different radii depending on their coordination numbers and thus different radius ratios are calculated for Ge with coordination numbers and and for Zr with coordination numbers and For this series of oxides the model appears to work quite well The correct coordination number is predicted in all cases and borderline cases such as GeO and ZrO are found in structures with different coordination numbers The model also correctly predicts the structures of BeF SiO type MgF rutile and CaF fluorite What about the alkali halides NaCl KBr LiI CsF etc All of them have the NaCl structure except for CsCl CsBr and CsI which have the CsCl structure In this case the radius ratio model fails rather badly The Li salts LiBr and LiI are predicted to have tetrahedral structures and KF is predicted to have an structure like CsCl We can try adjusting the radii eg making the cations larger and anions smaller but the best we can do with the alkali halides is predict about half of their structures correctly Since the alkali halides are clearly ionic compounds this failure suggests that there is something very wrong with the radius ratio model and its success with MO compounds was coincidental In addition to the radius ratio rule Linus Pauling developed other useful rules that are helpful in rationalizing and also predicting the structures of inorganic compounds Paulings rules state that Stable structures are locally electroneutral For example in the structure of the double perovskite SrFeMoO MO M Fe Mo octahedra share all their vertices and Sr ions fill the cubooctahedral cavities that are flanked by eight MO octahedra Each O ion is coordinated to one Fe and one Mo ion in order to achieve local electroneutrality and thus the FeO and MoO octahedra alternate in the structure Cationcation repulsion should be minimized Anion polyhedra can share vertices as in the perovskite structure without any energetic penalty Shared polyhedral edges and especially shared faces cause cationcation repulsion and should be avoided For example in rutile the most stable polymorph of TiO the TiO octahedra share vertices and two opposite edges forming ribbons in the structure In anatase TiO each octahedron shares four edges so the anatase polymorph is less thermodynamically stable Highly charged cations in anion polyhedra tend not to share edges or even vertices especially when the coordination number is low For example in orthosilicates such as olivine MSiO there are isolated SiO tetrahedra Structure of olivine M Mg or Fe blue spheres Si pink tetrahedra O red spheres As we will soon see all of Paulings rules are justified on the basis of lattice energy considerations In ionic compounds the arrangement of atoms that maximizes anioncation interactions while minimizing cationcation and anionanion contacts is energetically the best
