No headers From the discussion above it is clear that the lattice energy EL of an ionic crystal can be calculated with reasonable accuracy if the structure is known But how can we calculate EL for a new or hypothetical compound of unknown structure Recall that the reduced Madelung constant is about the same for different crystal structures Russian chemist A F Kapustinskii recognized this fact and devised a formula that allows one to calculate EL for any compound if we know the univalent radii of the constituent ions The Madelung constant A is proportional to the number of ions n in formula unit so dividing by the n gives similar values as shown in the table below An invariant Structure An NaCl CsCl Rutile Fluorite Kapustinskii noticed that the difference in ionic radii between M and M the monovalent vs divalent radius largely compensates for the differences in An between monovalent NaCl CsCl and divalent rutile CaF structures He thus arrived at a lattice energy formula using an average Madelung constant corrected to monovalent radii In the Kapustinskii formula the lattice energy kJmol is given by Here the sum of the monovalent radii is used in place of ro the bond distance in the BornMayer equation The beauty of this formula is that it requires no knowledge of the structure of the compound Therefore it can be used in combination with BornHaber cycles to predict the stability of unknown compounds As we show below this is a broadly useful tool in guiding syntheses and predicting the reactivity of inorganic solids
