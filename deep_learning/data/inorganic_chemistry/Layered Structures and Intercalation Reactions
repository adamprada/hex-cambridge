No headers Layered structures are characterized by strong and typically covalent bonding between atoms in two dimensions and weaker bonding in the third A broad range of compounds including metal halides oxides sulfides selenides borides nitrides carbides and allotropes of some pure elements B C P As exist in layered forms Structurally the simplest of these structures for example binary metal halides and sulfides can be described as having some fraction of the octahedral andor tetrahedral sites are filled in the fcc and hcp lattices For example the CdCl structure is formed by filling all the octahedral sites in alternate layers of the fcc lattice and the CdI structure is the relative of this structure in the hcp lattice In the CdCl structure the stacking sequence of anion layers is ABCABC In the CdI structure the anion stacking sequence is ABAB and all the cations are eclipsed along the stacking axis Comparison of the CdCl left and CdI right crystal structures These are examples of structures because the cations are coordinated by an octahedron of six anions and the anions are coordinated by three cations to make a trigonal pyramid like NH Another way to describe these structures is to say that the MX octahedra each share six edges in the MX sheets Polyhedral drawing of one layer of the CdCl or CdI structure showing edgesharing MX octahedra Because these structures place the packing atoms the anions in direct van der Waals contact they are most stable for relatively covalent compounds Otherwise the electrostatic repulsion between contacting anions would destabilize the structure energetically More ionic MX compounds tend to adopt the fluorite CaF or rutile TiO structures which are not layered Despite the fact that these two structure types are the same at the level of nearest and nextnearest neighbor ions the CdI structure is much more common than the CdCl structure CdCl structure MCl M Mg Mn Fe Co Ni Zn Cd NiBr NiI ZnBr ZnI CdI structure MCl M

slippery because the layer planes slide past each other easily For example graphite MoS and talc a silicate are layered compounds that are used widely as lubricants and lubricant additives An important reaction of layered compounds is intercalation In intercalation reactions guest molecules and ions enter the galleries that separate the sheets usually with expansion of the lattice along the stacking axis This reaction is typically reversible if it does not perturb the bonding within the sheets Often the driving force for intercalation is a redox reaction ie electron transfer between the host and guest For example lithium metal reacts with TiS MoS and graphite to produce LiTiS LixMoS x and LiC In these compounds lithium is ionized to Li and the sheets are negatively charged Oxidizing agents such as Br FeCl and AsF also react with graphite In the resulting intercalation compounds the sheets are positively charged and the intercalated species are anionic Intercalation reactions are especially important for electrochemical energy storage in secondary batteries such as lithium ion batteries nickelmetal hydride batteries and nickelcadmium batteries The reversible nature of the intercalation reaction allows the electrodes to be charged and discharged up to several thousand times without losing their mechanical integrity In lithium ion batteries the negative electrode material is typically graphite which is intercalated by lithium to make LiC Several different oxides and phosphates containing redox active transition metal ions Mn Fe Co Ni are used as the positive electrode materials Oxidative or reductive intercalation involves the placement of anions or cations between sheets Lithium ion batteries based on CoO were first described in by John B Goodenoughs research group at Oxford In batteries based on CoO which has the CdI structure the positive electrode halfreaction is The negative electrode half reaction is The battery is fully charged when the positive electrode is in the CoO form and the negative electrode is in the LiC form Discharge involves the motion of Li ions through the electrolyte forming LixCoO and graphite at the two electrodes Blue plaque erected by the Royal Society of Chemistry commemorating the development of cathode materials for the lithiumion battery Crystal structure of LiCoO The lithium ion battery is a rocking chair battery so named because charging and discharging involve moving Li ions from one side to the other CoO is one example of a positive electrode material that has been used in lithium ion batteries It has a high energy density but batteries based on CoO have poor thermal stability Safer materials include lithium iron phosphate LiFePO and LiMO M a mixture of Co Mn and Ni These batteries are used widely in laptop computers portable electronics cellular telephones cordless tools and electric and hybrid vehicles A similar intercalation reaction occurs in nickelcadmium batteries and nickelmetal hydride batteries except in this case the reaction involves the movement of protons in and out of the NiOH lattice which has the CdI structure There are many layered compounds that cannot be intercalated by redox reactions typically because some other stable product is formed For example the reaction of layered CdI with Li produces LiI NaCl structure and Cd metal
