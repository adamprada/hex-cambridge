No headers Metals with closepacked structures HCP and FCC such as copper gold silver zinc magnesium etc are in general more malleable than those with the BCC structure tungsten vanadium chromium etc Why In the closepacked structure there is relatively little corrugation between sheets of metal atoms This means that these planes can slip past each other relatively easily In the BCC structure there are no closepacked planes and much greater corrugation between atoms at different levels This makes it much harder for one row to slide past another This effect explains the hardness of alloys like brass CuZn which has the BCC structure which are made by combining two soft metals Cu and Zn which are respectively FCC and HCP as pure metals are both soft and ductile Bronzes originally made as alloys of copper and arsenic but later as alloys of copper and tin are harder than either of the constituent metals for the same reason The history of bronzes and brass dates to prehistoric times with the earliest brasses made by smelting copperzinc ores In the Bronze Age possession of these hard alloys provided a tactical advantage in warfare see image at right that was later supplanted when the technology for smelting iron was developed Bronze age weapons from Romania
