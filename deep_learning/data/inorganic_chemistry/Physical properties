a Electric propertiesb Magnetismc Optical propertiesStructurefunction correlation It is barely imaginable that materials based on the physical properties of solid inorganic compounds have played such decisive roles in presentday technology and industry One may think that this field belongs more to material physics However apart from the theories of physical properties the contribution of chemistry and chemists to the preparation of materials and their structural analysis has been greater than that of other branches of science Material science is the application of the fundamental physical properties of materials such that basic theories and their applications converge Therefore by surveying the applications in such fields the outlines of research themes and their purposes can be understood Important inorganic materials are surveyed from the chemical point of view by focusing on the relationship between preparation and isolation and structure and physical properties a Electric properties A semiconductor is an electrical conductor with electrical resistance in the range of about to ohms A typical semiconductor is a superhigh grade silicon that is manufactured on a large scale and is widely used for information processing devices such as computers and energy conversion devices such as solar cells VLSI very largescale integrated circuits are printed on wafers made from almost defectless silicon single crystals with diameters of no less than cm prepared from polycrystalline silicon by the Czochralski method Memory chips with a very high degree of integration as well as highly efficient computer chips have recently been realized In a short periodic table silicon is a group IV element and has four valenceelectrons Although silicon semiconductors currently represent or more of all semiconductors isoelectronic compounds of IIVI or IIIV groups form compound semiconductors and are also used for optical or ultra highspeed electronic devices For example ZnS CdS GaAs InP etc are typical compound semiconductors and the development of technologies to grow single crystals of these materials is remarkable Light emitting diodes LED or semiconductor lasers are important applications of compound semiconductors As thin films of compound semiconductors are made by MBE molecular beam epitaxy or MOCVD metallorganic chemical vapor deposition special organometallic compounds such as trimethyl gallium GaCH and trimethylarsenic AsCH whichpreviously found little application are now used industrially Exercise What compounds other than the examples given are suitable as semiconductors Answer ZnO CdS PbS GaP and InSb Superconductivity is a phenomenon of zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature Tc and was discovered in by Kamerlingh Onnes Nobel Prize for physics who succeeded in liquefying helium during his experiments to measure the electrical resistance of mercury at ultra low temperatures About of the elements such as Nb Tc K In Sn and Pb behave as superconductors and more than alloys and intermetallic compounds are also superconductors but only NbTi alloy Tc K and NbSn Tc K find application NbSn NbGe VGa etc are cubic A type compounds in which transition metal atoms are aligned in chains and interatomic distances are shorter than those in the crystalline bulk metal raising the density of states of the conduction band and the critical temperature Tc of the compound Figure Structure of YBaCuOx Among inorganic compound superconductors chalcogenide compounds MxMoX X S Se Te and M Pb Sn etc of molybdenum called Chevrel phases and hightemperature superconductors of copper oxide derivatives which J G Bednortz and K A MÃ¼ller discovered in Nobel Prize for physics have attracted attention Chevrel phases have structures refer to Section in which hexanuclear cluster units of molybdenum are joined and the highest Tc is only K of PbMoS but the superconductive state is not broken even in strong magnetic fields In the copper oxide system more than similar compounds have been prepared since the first discovery and the highest Tc so far discovered is K A typical compound YBaCuOx has a structure Figure in which CuO square pyramids and CuO planes are connected by cornersharing Ba and Y are inserted between them and the oxygen content is nonstoichiometric Figure An electron donor and acceptor in a complex superconductor On the other hand molecular superconductors have also been studied Representative donoracceptor complexes are composed of TTF and BEDTTTF Figure as electron donors and ClO or Nidmit as electron acceptors The first example of this kind of superconductor was discovered in and of the about complexes known at present the highest Tc is K Recently fullerene C doped with alkali metals showed a Tc of about K Although thousands of superconductors are known only a few of them find ap pound superconductors are very brittle either it is difficult to ake plication Because com m them into wires or only small single crystals are obtained It will take considerable time before some of them find practical use Therefore mainly NbTi wires are used as the superconducting magnets of analytical NMR medical MRI magnetic resonance imaging instrument or maglev trains etc Efforts are concentrated on discovering materials that have suitable mechanical and other properties by cooperation between inorganic chemistry and solidstate physics Various metal oxides are used as thermistors temperature sensitive resistance device varistors nonlinear resistance device capacitors etc For example BaTiO with a perovskite structure and SrTiO etc can be used for any of the abovementioned purposes Ionic conduction materials are also called solid electrolytes and AgI AlO stabilized zirconia a part of Zr in ZrO is replaced by Ca or Y etc are used in solid state batteries or fuel cells b Magnetism Magnetic materials are divided into hard permanent magnets and soft magnetic materials Permanent magnets are indispensable to machines using motors and MRI which requires a high magnetic field Japan has a strong tradition in the development of magnets and has made many epochmaking magnetic materials for practical use Alnico magnets with Fe Ni and Al as their main constituents ferrite magnets composed of solid solutions of CoFeO and FeO cobaltrare earth magnets such as SmCo and NbFeB magnets were especially significant achievements Since soft magnetic materials are strongly magnetized in weak magnetic fields they are most suitable for use as core materials in transformers Hard magnetic properties are necessary for the stable maintenance of information whereas soft magnetic properties are required for recording and overwriting information in magnetic recording materials such as magnetic tapes floppy disks and hard disks Although FeO is a typical magnetic powder used for these purposes Co or crystalline CrO is added to it to improve its magnetic properties Recording materials as well as semiconductor devices are indispensable to our modern informationoriented society and the role played by inorganic chemistry in the improvement of the performance of these materials is significant Recently ferromagnetism of organic compounds or metal complexes has been discovered in which unpaired spins are aligned parallel in a molecule and coupled ferromagnetically The study of molecular magnets has the subject of intensive investigation Molecular design to couple paramagnetic metal complexes and to make spins parallel is an interesting subject in coordination chemistry c Optical properties Mainly inorganic substances are used as materials for optical applications The optical fiber in particular has been used for optical communications on a large scale and has had a major social influence in information communication A necessary property of good optical glass materials is the transmission of information to distant places with little optical loss Silica fibers are manufactured by lengthening silica glass rods produced from silica grains The silica is made from ultra pure SiCl which is oxidized in the vapor phase by an oxyhydrogen flame As the optical loss along fibers obtained by this method has already reached its theoretical limit fluoride glasses are being used in the search for materials with lower levels of loss Compound semiconductors such as GaP are widely used as laser light emitting diodes for optical communications CD players laser printers etc A high output YAG laser is made from neodymiumdoped yttrium aluminum garnet YAlO which is a ouble oxide of YO and AlO Single crystals such as lithium niobate LiNbO are used for changing wavelength of light by means of SHG second harmonic generation of nonlinear optics phenomena problems Write a catalytic reaction cycle of the hydroformylation reaction which uses RhHCOPPh as a catalyst Describe differences between ammonia synthesis by the HarberBosch process and biological nitrogen fixation reactions A type intermetallic compounds such as NbSn are cubic crystals with the AB composition Consider how to locate each atom in such a unit cell Structurefunction correlation Since all the naturally occurring elements have been discovered various bonding modes are established and the structures of compounds can be readily determined studies of the chemical properties of inorganic compounds will give way to studies of reactions and physical properties The synthesis of new compounds and the elucidation of structurefunction correlations will be the foundations of these studies although the is distant It is considerably difficult quantitatively to explain the thermal stability of a known inorganic compound using our present knowledge of theoretical chemistry and it is almost impossible fully to design compounds by a rational method Although the selectivity of a catalytic reaction can be explained to some extent the theoretical calculation of a reaction rate remains difficult The relation between superconductivity and structure is not understood well and critical temperatures cannot be predicted Many of the structures and functions of the metalloenzymes that are the basis of biological activities are unknown The research problems confronting the next generation of inorganic chemists are extensive and novel solutions can be anticipated
