No headers Pourbaix Diagrams plot electrochemical stability for different redox states of an element as a function of pH As noted above these diagrams are essentially phase diagrams that map the conditions of potential and pH most typically in aqueous solutions where different redox species are stable We saw a simple example of such a diagram in section for HO Typically the water redox reactions are plotted as dotted lines on these more complicated diagrams for other elements The lines in Pourbaix diagrams represent redox and acidbase reactions and are the parts of the diagram where two species can exist in equilibrium For example in the Pourbaix diagram for Fe below the horizontal line between the Fe and Fe regions represents the reaction which has a standard potential of V While we could use standard potentials for all these lines in practice Pourbaix diagrams are usually plotted for lower ion concentrations often mM that are more relevant to corrosion and electrochemical experiments Example Iron Pourbaix diagram Areas in the Pourbaix diagram mark regions where a single species Feaq FeOs etc is stable More stable species tend to occupy larger areas Lines mark places where two species exist in equilibrium Pure redox reactions are horizontal lines these reactions are not pHdependent Pure acidbase reactions are vertical lines these do not depend on potential Reactions that are both acidbase and redox have a slope of VpH x H e Figure Pourbaix diagram for iron at ionic concentrations of mM CC BYSA Unported Metallos via Wikipedia Examples of

lines have special significance on a Pourbaix diagram for an element such as iron Recall that liquid water is stable only in the region between the dotted lines Below the H line water is unstable relative to hydrogen gas and above the O line water is unstable with respect to oxygen For active metals such as Fe the region where the pure element is stable is typically below the H line This means that iron metal is unstable in contact with water undergoing reactions in acid in base Iron and most other metals are also thermodynamically unstable in airsaturated water where the potential of the solution is close to the O line in the Pourbaix diagram Here the spontaneous reactions are in acid ceFe_s O FeO_s in base Corrosion and passivation It certainly sounds bad for our friend Fe unstable in water no matter what the pH or potential Given enough time it will all turn into rust But iron and other active metals can corrode or can be stabilized against corrosion depending on the conditions Because our civilization is dependent on the use of active metals such as Fe Al Zn Ti Cr for practically everything it is important to understand this and we can do so by referring to the Pourbaix diagram The corrosion of iron and other active metals such as Al is indeed rapid in parts of the Pourbaix diagram where the element is oxidized to a soluble ionic product such as Feaq or Alaq However solids such as FeO and especially AlO form a protective coating on the metal that greatly impedes the corrosion reaction This phenomenon is called passivation Draw a vertical line through the iron Pourbaix diagram at the pH of tap water about and you will discover something interesting at slightly acidic pH iron is quite unstable with respect to corrosion by the reaction but only in water that contains relatively little oxygen ie in solutions where the potential is near the H line Saturating the water with air or oxygen moves the system closer to the O line where the most stable species is FeO and the corrosion reaction is This oxidation reaction is orders of magnitude slower because the oxide that is formed passivates the surface Therefore iron corrodes much more slowly in oxygenated solutions More generally iron and other active metals are passivated whenever they oxidize to produce a solid product and corrode whenever the product is ionic and soluble This behavior can be summed up on the colorcoded Pourbaix diagram below The red and green regions represent conditions under which oxidation of iron produces soluble and insoluble products respectively In the yellow part of the diagram an active metal such as iron can be protected by a second mechanism which is to bias it so that its potential is below the oxidation potential of the metal This cathodic protection strategy is most frequently carried out by connecting a more active metal such as Mg or Zn to the iron or steel object eg the hull of a ship or an underground gas pipeline that is being protected The active metal which must be higher than Fe in the activity series is also in contact with the solution and slowly corrodes so it must eventually be replaced In some cases a battery or DC power supply the anode of which oxidizes water to oxygen in the solution is used instead to apply a negative bias The white patches visible on the ships hull are zinc block sacrificial anodes Another common mode of corrosion of iron and carbon steel is differential aeration In this case part of the iron object eg the base of a bridge or the drill in an oil rig is under water or in an anoxic environment such as mud or soil The potential of the solution is close to the H line in the Pourbaix diagram where Fe can corrode to Fe aq Another part of the iron object is in the air or near the surface where water is well oxygenated At that surface oxygen can be reduced to water O H e HO The conductive iron object completes the circuit carrying electrons from the anode where Fe is oxidized to the cathode where O is reduced Corrosion by differential aeration can be rapid because soluble ions are produced and the reaction has a driving force of over V Iron or carbon steel that is subjected to frequent weathering such as the cast iron bridge and lamppost shown below is corroded on the surface by differential aeration Rusty cast iron bridge and lamppost North Ayrshire Scotland Differential aeration is involved in the formation of a rust ring around wet areas of cast iron eg an iron frying pan left partially submerged in water for a day or more You may have seen this mechanism of corrosion in action when you did not get to the dirty dishes right away Under the water Fe is oxidized to soluble Fe and at the water line O is reduced to HO As Fe ions diffuse towards the water surface they encounter oxygen molecules and are oxidized to Fe However Fe is insoluble at neutral pH and deposits as rust typically just below the water line forming the rust ring
