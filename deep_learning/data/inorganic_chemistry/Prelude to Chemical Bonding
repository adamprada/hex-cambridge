No headers Molecules and extended solids are built from atoms that form chemical bonds Theories of bonding seek to explain why molecules and solids form what their structures are why some are more stable than others and how they react As we will learn in Chapter quantum mechanics gives us the most realistic picture of chemical bonding via molecular orbital MO theory However the MO description of bonding is conceptually difficult and mathematically intensive This chapter will review less rigorous but still useful models such as Lewis dot structures and valence shell electronpair repulsion VSEPR theory When combined with a qualitative quantum mechanical description of bonding through the concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance these simple models can help us understand a great deal about the structures stabilities and reactions of inorganic molecules Ballandstick representation of chemical bonding in the molecules PO and PS The theory of chemical bonding has a long history dating back to ancient Greece and the atomists Democritus Leucippus and the Epicureans They postulated the existence of immutable atoms moving through the void and envisioned the physical properties of materials as arising from the kinds and shapes of atoms In his epic poem De rerum natura On the Nature of Things the Roman poet Lucretius c BC c BC drawing on his Epicurean beliefs describes some atoms and chemical bonding in the following way What seems to us the hardened and condensed Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked Be held compacted deep within as twere By branchlike atoms of which sort the chief Are diamond stones despisers of all blows And stalwart flint and strength of solid iron And brazen bars which budging hard in locks Do grate and scream But what are liquid formed Of fluid body they indeed must be Of elements more smooth and round because Their globules severally will not cohere Lucretius poem is enjoyable reading and contains some remarkable insights into the microscopic world given the tools available at the time Modern analytical methods show that he was off base with his ideas about hooks and spheres however We will revisit the nature of chemical bonding in the substances Lucretius mentions diamond silicates iron brass and water in the context of modern chemical theories to understand why they have the special properties they do
