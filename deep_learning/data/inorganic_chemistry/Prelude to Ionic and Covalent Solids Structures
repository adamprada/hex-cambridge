No headers As we noted in our discussion of metal and alloy structures in Chapter there is an intimate connection between the structures and the physical properties of materials As we graduate from simple metal structures based on sphere packings to more complex structures we find that this is still true In this chapter we will try to systematize the structures of inorganic solids metal oxides halides sulfides and related compounds and develop some rules for which structures to expect based on electronegativity differences hardsoft acidbase rules and other periodic trends We will see that many of these structures are related to the sphere packings that we learned about in Chapter The morphology of twinned crystals of iron pyrite FeS is related to the underlying cubic symmetry of the unit cell Like NaCl the pyrite crystal structure can be thought of as a facecentered cubic array of anions S with cations Fe occupying all the octahedral holes Inorganic solids often have simple crystal structures and some of these structures are adopted by large families of ionic or covalent compounds Examples of the most common structures include NaCl CsCl NiAs zincblende wurtzite fluorite perovskite rutile and spinel We will develop these structures systematically from the close packed and nonclose packed lattices shown below Some layered structures such as CdCl and CdI can be thought of as relatives of simple ionic lattices with some atoms missing
