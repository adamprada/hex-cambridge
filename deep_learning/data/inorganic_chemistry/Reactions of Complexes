reactionsInnersphere mechanismOutersphere mechanism The reactions of complexes are classified into the substitution reaction of ligands the conversion reaction of ligands and the redox reaction of the central metal The substitution and redox reactions in particular have been studied in detail a Ligand substitution reaction Ligand substitution reactions of complexes are very important for the preparation of various kinds of derivatives The detailed conditions which complexes and ligands fulfill have been studied in order to understand their stereochemistry and attain practical rates of substitution reactions As with other types of chemical reactions we require an understanding of both equilibrium and reaction rates Formation constant The equilibrium constant of a ligand substitution reaction is called a formation or stability constant The concept and the method of computing successive formation constants were proposed by N Bjerrum Equilibrium constants for the replacement of a hydrated ion M by other ligands L in an aqueous solution are M L rightarrow ML qquad qquad K_ fracMLML ML L rightarrow ML_ qquad qquad K_ fracML_MLL ML_ L rightarrow ML_ qquad qquad K_ fracML_ML_L ML_n L rightarrow ML_n qquad qquad K_n fracML_nML_nL and the overall formation constant is The thermodynamic stability of a substitution product becomes larger as the formation constant increases On the other hand an understanding of the effect of the leaving ligand X and the entering ligand Y on the substitution rate and on the intermediate species formed are essential to elucidate the reaction chemistry of metal complexes It is especially useful to summarize the electronic structure of the central metals the stereochemistry of complexes and the correlation between the parameters representing their steric properties and the reaction rate Generally reaction mechanisms can be classified into associative interchange and dissociative mechanisms according to the differences in the intermediate state Figure Figure The stability of the intermediate of ligand substitution Associative mechanism If the substitution rate of a ligand substitution of a complex is dependant upon the entering ligand Y coordinating to the central metal and is insensitive to the leaving ligand X it is presumed to take the associative mechanism which increases the coordination number Such a substitution reaction is often seen in planar tetracoordinate PtII complexes and the intermediate species are triangular bipyramidal pentacoordinate complexes The reaction is firstorder with respect to both the tetracoordinate complex and Y and is secondorder as a whole Since it is accompanied by a reduction of molecular species in the intermediate stage thermodynamic measurements of the reaction indicate the activation entropy S to be negative The intermediate species in the case of the associative mechanism in hexacoordinate complexes are heptacoordinate complexes Interchange mechanism When the life of an intermediate state is very short the reaction proceeds by the interchange mechanism as the coordination of Y and elimination of X are considered to occur simultaneously Dissociative mechanism A substitution reaction that is highly sensitive to the identity of the leaving ligand X and practically insensitive to the identity of the entering ligand Y assumes the dissociative mechanism in which the coordination number decreases in the intermediate state This is often observed in octahedral hexacoordinate complexes and the intermediate states are pentacoordinate complexes that form by the elimination of X As the elimination is accompanied by an increase of molecular species in the intermediate stage the entropy of activation S becomes positive Exercise The order of the rate of ligand substitution of PtII complexes is HO Cl I PR CN for entering ligands Which mechanism associative or dissociative do the substitutions take Answer Since they are dependent on the entering ligands the associative mechanism is more likely Trans effect In squareplanar tetracoordinate complexes typically of PtII the ligand trans to the leaving ligand X governs the substitution rate This is called the trans effect The substitution rate increases as the σ donor or π acceptor ability of the trans ligand becomes larger in the order of NH Cl Br I NCS PR CN CO An analogous effect may also be seen in octahedral hexacoordinate complexes although the effect is usually relatively small The HO exchange rate in aqua ions Inert intermediate and labile are classification of the exchange rate proposed by H Taube The exchange rate of aqua ions ions coordinated by water molecules of maingroup and transition metals differ greatly depending upon the identity of the metal species Since the rate of water ligand exchange is well correlated withthe exchange rates of other ligands it is useful for general comparison of the exchange rates in the complexes of different metal ions For alkali and alkaline earth metals the exchange rates are very high s and the complexes of these metals are classified as labile As the dissociative mechanism is generally found in these cases ions with smaller ionicity and of larger size attract water ligands less and their exchange rates becomes higher In Group metal ions Zn Cd Hg Group metal ions Al Ga In and Group metal ions Sc Y rapid water ligand exchange takes place by a dissociative mechanism On the other hand the exchange rates of M II ions in d block transition metal ions is medium s and that of M III ions are lower still The rates of d Cr and d Co are notably slow s and their complexes are termed inert There has been a great deal of study of ligandexchange reactions The exchange rates are smaller the larger the ligand field stabilization energy Therefore the ligandexchange rates of d and d transition metal complexes are generally slow Test tube experiments Easy chemical or biological reactions performed in test tubes are sometimes called test tube experiments Solutions in test tubes are mixed at room temperature in air and the mixture is shaken to observe a color change or formation of precipitates and the results of the reactions are speculated on University professors occasionally attempt these sorts of experiments Although easy these simple experiments show only the effects of visible light absorption and solubility However since even great discoveries can be born from such experiments they should not be dismissed H Taube wrote that he found a hint of the innersphere electron transfer mechanism from test tube experiments He mixed Craq and I in a test tube in order to clarify the oxidation of Craq and observed the change of color to the one characteristic of CrHO via green The green color is due to HOCrI which is unstable and changes to CrHO I He assumed that this was due to the formation of a CrI bond before CrII was oxidized by I Subsequently he performed another test tube experiment using NHCoCl as an oxidant and found that Craq was converted into CrHO via green HOCrCl This reaction established the innersphere electron transfer mechanism in which a CoClCr bridge forms between Co and Cr and led to the Nobel Prize in a later year b Redox reactions The oxidation number of the central metal in a transitionmetal compound can vary in a few steps from low to high Namely the oxidation state of a compound is changeable by redox reactions As a consequence of this the bond distance and the bond angle between the metal and coordinating elements or between metals change and at times the whole structure of a complex can be distorted remarkably or the compound may even decompose The reactions of a metal compound with various reducing or oxidizing agents are also very important from the viewpoint of synthetic chemistry Especially reduction reactions are used in the preparation of organometallic compounds such as metal carbonyls or cluster compounds Meanwhile the study of electron transfer between complexes especially the redox reactions of transition metal complexes has developed Taube won the Nobel Prize for the study of electron transfer reactions in transition metal complexes classifying such reactions into two mechanisms The mechanism of electron transfer in which a bridging ligand is shared between two metals is called the innersphere mechanism and the one involving a direct transfer of electrons between two metals without a bridging ligand is called the outersphere mechanism Innersphere mechanism When CoClNH is reduced by CrOH an intermediate complex NHCoClCrOH is formed in which the chlorine atom forms a bridge between cobalt and chromium As a result of an electron transfer from chromium to cobalt through chlorine CoNHCl in which cobalt is reduced from a trivalent to a divalent oxidation state and CrOH in which chromium is oxidized from a divalent to a trivalent oxidation state are formed This kind of reaction is a redox reaction via the innersphere mechanism The anions other than halogens suitable for such bridge formation are SCN N CN etc Outersphere mechanism When Fephen phen is orthophenanthroline is reduced by FeCN no ligand bridge forms between the metals and an electron moves from the HOMO of FeII to the LUMO of FeIII in a very short and direct contact between the two complexes As the result of the electron transfer Fephen and FeCN form This kind of reaction is a redox one via the outersphere mechanism and is characteristic of a complex system that has a very slow ligand substitution rate compared with the speed of electron transfer especially in systems that have the same ligands but different oxidationnumbers for example FeCN FeCN has a high rate of electron transfer R A Marcus won the Nobel Prize for his study of this outersphere electron transfer mechanism problems Which cavity either the octahedral or tetrahedral one in an array of oxygen atoms do Fe ions tend to occupy in iron oxide FeO containing both Fe and Fe ions Describe a method of preparing transPtClEtPEt Propose mononuclear and dinuclear metal complexes containing cyclopentadienyl and carbonyl ligands that satisfy the electron rule Devise a method of selective syntheses of cisPtClNH and transPtClNH using the trans effect How can it be proven that the reduction reaction of CoClNH by CrOH proceeds by the innersphere electron
