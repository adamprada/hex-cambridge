Liquid Ammonia SolutionsContributors Solvated electron as a reducing agent Birch reduction many examples of compounds in very unusual low oxidation states Reduction of salts of Group IV and V elements give polyhedral anions many examples Ge Sn Sn Pb Bi P As Liquid Ammonia Solutions A remarkable feature of the alkali metals is their ability to dissolve reversibly in liquid ammonia Just as in their reactions with water reacting alkali metals with liquid ammonia eventually produces hydrogen gas and the metal salt of the conjugate base of the solventin this case the amide ion NH rather than hydroxide where the am designation refers to an ammonia solution analogous to aq used to indicate aqueous solutions Without a catalyst the reaction in Equation ref tends to be rather slow In many cases the alkali metal amide salt MNH is not very soluble in liquid ammonia and precipitates but when dissolved very concentrated solutions of the alkali metal are produced One mole of Cs metal for example will dissolve in as little as mL g of liquid ammonia The pure metal is easily recovered when the ammonia evaporates Figure Solvated electrons The presence of solvated electrons e NH in solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia is indicated by the intense color of the solution and its electrical conductivity Solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia are intensely colored and good conductors of electricity due to the presence of solvated electrons e NH which are not attached to single atoms A solvated electron is loosely associated with a cavity in the ammonia solvent that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds Alkali metalliquid ammonia solutions of about M or less are deep blue Figure and conduct electricity about times better than an aqueous NaCl solution because of the high mobility of the solvated electrons As the concentration of the metal increases above M the color changes to metallic bronze or gold and the conductivity increases to a value comparable with that of the pure liquid metals Figure Alkali MetalLiquid Ammonia Solutions Most metals are insoluble in virtually all solvents but the alkali metals and the heavier alkaline earth metals dissolve readily in liquid ammonia to form solvated metal cations and solvated electrons which give the solution a deep blue color Image copyrighted by The most common sources of the hydride Nucleophile are lithium aluminum hydride LiAlH and sodium borohydride NaBH Note The hydride anion is not present during this reaction rather these reagents serve as a source of hydride due to the presence of a polar metalhydrogen bond Because aluminum is less electronegative than boron the AlH bond in LiAlH is more polar thereby making LiAlH a stronger reducing agent Contributors Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University
