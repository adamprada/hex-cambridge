NiAs structure There are a number of compounds that have structures similar to that of NaCl but have a lower symmetry usually imposed by the geometry of the anion than NaCl itself These compounds include FeS pyrite fools gold S disulfide and Fe CaC a saltlike carbide Ca and linear C anions CaCO calcite limestone marble Ca and triangular CO The rhombohedral unit cell of the calcite crystal structure The hexagonal caxis is shown The calcite CaCO crystal structure is shown above Triangular CO ions fill octahedral holes between the Ca ions black spheres in a distorted NaCl lattice As in NaCl each ion is coordinated by six of the other kind From this image we can see why the CaCO structure has a lower symmetry than that of NaCl The fourfold rotation symmetry of the NaCl unit cell is lost when the spherical Cl ions are replaced by triangular CO ions Because of this symmetry lowering transparent crystals calcite are birefringent as illustrated below Calcite crystals are birefringent meaning that their refractive indices are different along the two principal crystal directions This gives rise to the phenomenon of double refraction NiAs structure The NaCl structure can be described a facecentered cubic lattice with all of the octahedral holes filled What if we start with a hexagonalclose packed lattice rather than a facecentered cubic lattice Nickel arsenide crystal structure The NiAs trigonal prisms are shaded gray One octahedron of six As atoms surrounding a Ni atom is shown in the center of the figure This is the structure adopted by NiAs and many other transition metal sulfides phosphides and arsenides The cations are shown in gray while the anions are light blue in the figure at the right The cations are in octahedral coordination so each cation is coordinated to six anions The anions are also coordinated to six cations but they occupy trigonal prismatic sites In terms of layer stacking the NiAs structure is AcBcAcBc where the A and B sites the hcp lattice are occupied by the As atoms and the c sites which are eclipsed along the layer stacking axis are occupied by Ni Unlike the NaCl structure where the anion and cation sites are interchangeable NiAs has unique anion and cation sites The layer stacking sequence for NiAs is shown below A c B c A c B c The NiAs structure cannot be adopted by ionic compounds because of the eclipsing cations because the cationcation repulsions would be internally destabilizing for an ionic compound This structure is mainly adopted by covalent and polar covalent MX compounds typically with soft X anions S Se P As and lowvalent transition metal cations For example some compounds with the NiAs structure are MS MSe MTe MTi V Fe Co Ni Often these are nonstoichiometric or complex stoichiometries with ordered vacancies CrS FeS
