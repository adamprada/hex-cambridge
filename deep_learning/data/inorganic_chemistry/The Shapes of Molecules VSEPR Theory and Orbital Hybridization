Geometrical isomersOrbital hybridization Rules for orbital hybridization The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion VSEPR theory is a simple and useful way to predict and rationalize the shapes of molecules The theory is based on the idea of minimizing the electrostatic repulsion between electron pairs as first proposed by Sidgwick and Powell in then generalized by Gillespie and Nyholm in and then broadly applied over the intervening years Geometry of the water molecule To use the VSEPR model one begins with the Lewis dot picture to determine the number of lone pairs and bonding domains around a central atom Because VSEPR considers all bonding domains equally ie a single bond a double bond and a half bond all count as one electron domain one can use either an octet or hypervalent structure provided that the number of lone pairs which should be the same in both is calculated correctly For example in either the hypervalent or octet structure of the Iion above there are three lone pairs on the central I atom and two bonding domains We then follow these steps to obtain the electronic geometry Determine the number of lone pairs on the central atom in the molecule and add the number of bonded atoms aka bonding domains This number the steric number defines the electronic shape of the molecule by minimizing repulsion For example a steric number of three gives a trigonal planar electronic shape The angles between electron domains are determined primarily by the electronic geometry eg for a steric number of which implies that the electronic shape is a tetrahedron These angles are adjusted by the hierarchy of repulsions lone pair lone pair lone pair bond bond bond The molecular geometry is deduced from the electronic geometry by considering the lone pairs to be present but invisible The most commonly used methods to determine molecular structure Xray diffraction neutron diffraction and electron diffraction have a hard time seeing lone pairs but they can accurately determine the lengths of bonds between atoms and the bond angles The table below gives examples of electronic and molecular shapes for steric numbers between and We are most often concerned with molecules that have steric numbers between and Bonding electron pairs Lone pairs Electron domains Steric Shape Ideal bond angle examples bond angle Example Image linear CO trigonal planar BF bent SO tetrahedral CH trigonal pyramidal NH bent HO trigonal bipyramidal PCl seesaw SF Tshaped ClF linear XeF octahedral SF square pyramidal BrF square planar XeF pentagonal bipyramidal IF pentagonal pyramidal XeOF planar pentagonal XeF square antiprismatic XeF tricapped trigonal prismatic ReH From the Table we see that some of the molecules shown as examples have bond angles that depart from the ideal electronic geometry For example the HNH bond angle in ammonia is and the HOH angle in water is We can rationalize this in terms of the last rule above The lone pair in ammonia repels the electrons in the NH bonds more than they repel each other This lone pair repulsion exerts even more steric influence in the case of water where there are two lone pairs Similarly the axial FSF angle in the seesaw molecule SF is a few degrees less than because of repulsion by the lone pair in the molecule Geometrical isomers For some molecules in the Table we note that there is more than one possible shape that would satisfy the VSEPR rules For example the XeF molecule has a steric number of five and a trigonal bipyramidal geometry There are three possible stereoisomers one in which the F atoms occupy axial sites resulting in linear molecule one in which the F atoms occupy one equatorial and one axial site resulting in a bond angle and one in which the F atoms are both on equatorial sites with a FXeF bond angle of The observed geometry of XeF is linear which can be rationalized by considering the orbitals that are used to make bonds or lone pairs in the axial and equatorial positions There are four available orbitals s px py and pz If we choose the zaxis as the axial direction we can see that the px and py orbitals lie in the equatorial plane We assume that the spherical s orbital is shared equally by the five electron domains in the molecule the two axial bonds share the pz orbital and the three equatorial bonds share the px and py orbitals We can then calculate the bond orders to axial and equatorial F atoms as follows Because fluorine is more electronegative than a lone pair it prefers the axial site where it will have more negative formal charge In general by this reasoning lone pairs and electropositive ligands such as CH will always prefer the equatorial sites in the trigonal bipyramidal geometry Electronegative ligands such as F will always go to the axial sites In the case of the BrF anion which is isoelectronic with XeF in the Table the electronic geometry is octahedral and there are two possible isomers in which the two lone pairs are cis or trans to each other In this case lone pair lone pair repulsion dominates and we obtain the trans arrangement of lone pairs giving a square planar molecular geometry Orbital hybridization The observation of molecules in the various electronic shapes shown above is at first blush in conflict with our picture of atomic orbitals For an atom such as oxygen we know that the s orbital is spherical and that the px py and pz orbitals are dumbellshaped and point along the Cartesian axes The water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms bound to oxygen not at a angle but at an angle of Given the relative orientations of the atomic orbitals how do we arrive at angles between electron domains of and so on To understand this we will need to learn a little bit about the quantum mechanics of electrons in atoms and molecules The atomic orbitals ψ represent solutions to the Schrödinger wave equation Here E is the energy of an electron in the orbital and is the Hamiltonian operator By analogy with classical mechanics the Hamiltonian is commonly expressed as the sum of operators corresponding to the kinetic and potential energies of a system in the form where is the potential energy and is the kinetic energy operator in which m is the mass of the particle and the momentum operator is Here is hπ where h is Plancks constant and the Laplacian operator is Although this is not the technical definition of the Hamiltonian in classical mechanics it is the form it most commonly takes in quantum mechanics Combining these together yields the familiar form used in the Schrödinger equation For hydrogenlike oneelectron atoms the Schrödinger equation can be written as where Z is the nuclear charge e is the electron charge and r is the position of the electron The radial potential term on the right side of the equation is due to the Coulomb interaction ie the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron in which ε is the dielectric constant permittivity of free space and is the body reduced mass of the nucleus of mass mn and the electron of mass me To a good approximation µ me Erwin Schrödinger as a young scientist This is the equation that Erwin Schrödinger famously derived in to solve for the energies and shapes of the s p d and f atomic orbitals in hydrogenlike atoms It was a huge conceptual leap for both physics and chemistry because it not only explained the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom but also provided the theoretical basis for the octet rule and the arrangement of elements in the periodic table The Schrödinger equation can be used to describe chemical systems that are more complicated than the hydrogen atom eg multielectron atoms molecules infinite crystals and the dynamics of those systems if we substitute the appropriate potential energy function Vrt into the Hamiltonian The math becomes more complicated and the equation must be solved numerically in those cases so for our purposes we will stick with the simplest case of timeinvariant oneelectron hydrogenlike atoms Without going into too much detail about the Schrödinger equation we can point out some of its most important properties The equation derives from the fact that the total energy E is the sum of the kinetic energy KE and the potential energy PE These three quantities are represented mathematically as operators in the equation On the left side of the equation the total energy operator E is a scalar that is multiplied by the wavefunction ψ ψ is a function of the spatial coordinates xyz and is related to the probability that the electron is at that point in space The first term on the right side of the equation represents the kinetic energy KE The kinetic energy operator is proportional to the Laplacian operator which takes the second derivative with respect to three spatial coordinates of ψ Thus the Schrödinger equation is a differential equation The second term on the right side of the equation represents the Coulomb potential PE ie the attractive energy between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron The solutions to the Schrödinger equation are a set of energies E which are scalar quantities and wavefunctions aka atomic orbitals ψ which are functions of the spatial coordinates You will sometimes see the energies referred to as eigenvalues and the orbitals as eigenfunctions because mathematically the Schrödinger equation is an eigenfunctioneigenvalue equation Although ψ is a function of the coordinates E is not So an electron in a pz orbital has the same total energy E PE KE no matter where it is in space These E values and their associated wavefunctions ψ are catalogued according to their quantum numbers n l and ml That is there are many solutions to the differential equation and each solution ψxyz and E has a unique set of quantum numbers Some sets of orbitals are degenerate meaning that they have the same energy eg px py and pz The solutions ψxyz to the Schrödinger equation eg the s s px py and pz orbitals represent probability amplitudes for finding the electron at a particular point xyz in space A probability amplitude can have either or sign We typically represent the different signs by shading or by and signs on the two lobes of a p orbital The square of the probability amplitude ψ is always a positive number and represents the probability of finding the electron at a point xyz in space Because the total probability of finding the electron somewhere is the wavefunction must be normalized so that the integral of ψ over the spatial coordinates from to is The solutions to the Schrödinger equation are orthogonal meaning that the product of any two integrated over all space is zero For example the product of the s and px orbitals integrated over the spatial coordinates from to is zero The shapes of the first five atomic orbitals s s px py and pz The colors denote the sign of the wave function Orbital hybridization involves making linear combinations of the atomic orbitals that are solutions to the Schrödinger equation Mathematically this is justified by recognizing that the Schrödinger equation is a linear differential equation As such any sum of solutions to the Schrödinger equation is also a valid solution However we still impose the constraint that our hybrid orbitals must be orthogonal and normalized Rules for orbital hybridization Add and subtract atomic orbitals to get hybrid orbitals We get the same number of orbitals out as we put in The energy of a hybrid orbital is the weighted average of the atomic orbitals that make it up The coefficients are determined by the constraints that the hybrid orbitals must be orthogonal and normalized For sp hybridization as in the BeF or CO molecule we make two linear combinations of the s and pz orbitals assigning z as the axis of the BeF bond Here we have simply added and subtracted the s and pz orbitals we leave it as an exercise for the interested student to show that both orbitals are normalized ie and orthogonal ie What this means physically is explained in the figure below By combining the s and pz orbitals we have created two new orbitals with large lobes high electron probability pointing along the zaxis These two orbitals are degenerate and have an energy that is halfway between the energy of the s and pz orbitals Linear combinations of the s and pz atomic orbitals make two spz hybrids The pxand py orbitals are unchanged For an isolated Be atom which has two valence electrons the lowest energy state would have two electrons spinpaired in the s orbital However these electrons would not be available for bonding By promoting these electrons to the degenerate spz hybrid orbitals they become unpaired and are prepared for bonding to the F atoms in BeF This will occur if the bonding energy in the promoted state exceeds the promotion energy The overall bonding energy ie the energy released by combining a Be atom in its ground state with two F atoms is the difference between the bonding and promotion energies We can similarly construct sp hybrids eg for the BF molecule or the NO anion from one s and two p atomic orbitals Taking the plane of the molecule as the xy plane we obtain three hybrid orbitals at to each other The three hybrids are These orbitals are again degenerate and their energy is the weighted average of the energies of the s px and py atomic orbitals Finally to make a sp hybrid as in CH HO etc we combine all four atomic orbitals to make four degenerate hybrids The lobes of the sp hybrid orbitals point towards the vertices of a tetrahedron or alternate corners of a cube consistent with the tetrahedral bond angle in CH and the nearly tetrahedral angles in NH and HO Similarly we can show that we can construct the trigonal bipyramidal electronic shape by making sp and sp hybrids and the octahedral geometry from three sets of sp hybrids The picture that emerges from this is that the atomic orbitals can hybridize as required by the shape that best minimizes electron pair repulsions Interestingly however the bond angles in PH HS and HSe are close to suggesting that P S and Se primarily use their porbitals in bonding to H in these molecules This is consistent with the fact that the energy difference between s and p orbitals stays roughly constant going down the periodic table but the bond energy decreases as the valence electrons get farther away from the nucleus In compounds of elements in the rd th and th rows of the periodic table there thus is a decreasing tendency to use sp orbital hybrids in bonding For these heavier elements the bonding energy is not enough to offset the energy needed to promote the s electrons to sp hybrid orbitals
