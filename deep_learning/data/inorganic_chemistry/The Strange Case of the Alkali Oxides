Metalair batteries The alkali oxides made by reacting alkali metals Li Na K Rb Cs with oxygen show an unusual trend When lithium reacts with oxygen we obtain the binary oxide LiO as expected from combining an element in group I with one in group VI Curiously the oxide that forms most readily when sodium metal is oxidized is not NaO but is instead the peroxide NaO which we can formulate as NaO With potassium rubidium and cesium we obtain the superoxides MO which contain the superoxide radical anion O and should be formulated as MO While it is possible to make NaO KO RbO and CsO by reaction of the appropriate metal nitrate MNO with elemental alkali metal M it is curious that these normal valent compounds do not form by direct reaction of the metal with oxygen Sodium metal is oxided in air to sodium peroxide NaO Because the alkali metals are all very electropositive χ and oxygen is very electronegative χ we expect all the compounds we make by combining them to be reliably ionic Consistent with this picture we find that LiO along with NaO KO and RbO adopts the antifluorite structure coordination see problem which we expect to find with relatively ionic MX compounds Strangely however CsO crystallizes in the antiCdCl structure This is odd because CdCl has a layered structure that we normally associate with polar covalent MX compounds see section In CsO six Cs cations surround each O anion in an octahedron Each Cs is coordinated to three O ions and the Cs ions contact each other across a van der Waals gap The juxtaposition of Cs ions near each other is clearly electrostatically unfavorable so why does CsO prefer the antiCdCl structure to antifluorite The answer has to do with the crowding of alkali ions around oxygen as illustrated for KO at the right Because eight large K ions surround each O ion in the structure the cations are essentially in contact Indeed the metaloxygen bonds are stretched in NaO KO and RbO relative to MO bonds with the same bond order in other structures The situation is so extreme for CsO that it finds an electrostatically unfavorable structure in which the coordination is lowered to This packing problem is relieved somewhat in the peroxides where the coordination is still but the anion is larger and especially in the superoxides where the cationanion ratio is and the coordination is Thus the larger alkali ions K Rb Cs tend to form superoxides Spacefilling models of the crystal structures of KO top and CsO bottom Oxygen atoms are red potassium ions are blue and cesium ions are magenta Another way that we can rationalize this trend is through the energetics of forming the oxides peroxides and superoxides Lets calculate the enthalpy change per mole of metal for forming a metal oxide MO from the metal and oxygen We can use Hess law to write this as a sum of reactions Reaction ΔH Overall To get the enthalpy change for the overall reaction the heat of formation of mole of MO we will need the heats of formation of Mg and Og which are available from tabulated values and EL which we can calculate from Kapustinskiis equation Similarly we can write for the formation of the alkali peroxides Reaction Reaction ΔH Overall and for the superoxides Reaction ΔH Overall For the gaseous anions and cations we have the following heats of formation and ionic radii CN Ion ΔHf kJ ionic radius Å Li Na K Rb Cs O O O Now using Kapustinskiis equation we can calculate the lattice energies for each compound these have been converted to lattice enthalpies by subtracting RT or RT as appropriate Metal ΔHLMO ΔHLMO ΔHLMO Li kJ kJ kJ Na K Rb Cs As expected the lattice energies for MO and MO are comparable the latter being somewhat smaller in magnitude because of the larger size of the O anion The lattice energies of the superoxides MO are about those of the corresponding peroxides because both the anion and cation are singly charged and there are only two ions per formula unit Now putting it all together we can use the lattice energies and heats of formation of the individual ions to compare the heats of formation per mole of metal of each of the oxides Metal ΔHfMO ΔHfMO ΔHfMO Li kJ kJ kJ Na K Rb Cs We can see that for Li the formation of LiO is favored over LiO or LiO because of the very favorable lattice energy of LiO As the lattice energy becomes less negative with increasing cation size the peroxide becomes the most stable at Na For the heavier alkalis MO becomes quite unstable and the superoxides MO are the most stable This is consistent with our observations of the chemistry of the group I oxides Metalair batteries The alkali oxides are quite interesting in the context of metalair batteries because of their potential for extremely high energy storage on a mass basis Such batteries have alkali metal typically Li or Zn anodes and utilize oxygen from the air at the cathode Although lithium is the lightest and therefore the most energydense alkali metal there are materials problems associated with the formation of Li dendrites when the battery is recharged and also with the slow kinetics of the fourelectron interconversion between Og and O at the cathode For this reason superoxide batteries are currently being studied as alternatives The oneelectron cathode reaction O e O is kinetically fast and potassium and sodium represent potentially viable alternatives to lithium for the anode of these airbreathing batteries Recently it has been shown that LiO can be kinetically stabilized by template growth on iridium nanoparticles potentially opening the door to very high energy density lithiumair batteries Schematic of an airbreathing lithium battery
