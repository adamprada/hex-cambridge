EnthalpyEntropyGibbs energy Thermodynamic parameters on changes of state are necessary to describe chemical bonding structure and reaction This is true also in inorganic chemistry and the most important concepts in thermodynamics are described in this section Even simple thermodynamic knowledge is considerably useful for judging whether structures of compounds are stable and the likelihood of spontaneous reactions and for the calculations of reaction heat determination of reaction mechanism and understanding of electrochemistry Enthalpy Since enthalpy is the heat content of a system under constant pressure the changeH is negative in an exothermic reaction and positive in an endothermic reaction The standard reaction enthalpy H is the enthalpy change between mol of products and reactants in the standard state Pa and K The standard enthalpy of formation Hf of a compound is the standard reaction enthalpy for the formation of the compound from its constituent elements Since enthalpy is a state function the standard reaction enthalpy is calculated by defining the standard enthalpy of formation of simple substances to be zero Namely Entropy Entropy is a state function and is a criterion determining whether one state can be reached spontaneously from another state The nd law of thermodynamics states that the entropy S of an isolated system increases upon a spontaneous change Namely A thermodynamically irreversible process produces entropy Entropy is related to the disorder of a system in statistical themodynamics as follows k is the Boltzmann constant and W is the number of the arrangements of atoms or molecules of the system with the same energy and corresponds to the extent of disorder As entropy becomes larger the larger the disorder of a system Gibbs energy This quantity is defined as A spontaneous reaction occurs when Gibbs energy of a reaction is negative at constant temperature and pressure The standard Gibbs free energy G is related to the equilibrium constant K of the reaction K is larger than when G becomes negative and the reaction proceeds to the right
