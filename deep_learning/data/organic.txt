of Structure through ReactionsI Reactivity Saturation Unsaturation and Reaction MechanismsContributors and Attributions You may not be much interested in the way that organic chemistry developed but if you skip to the next section without reading further you will miss some of the flavor of a truly great achievement of how a few highly creative chemists were able with the aid of a few simple tools to determine the structures of molecules far too small and too elusive to be seen individually with the finest optical microscope manifesting themselves only by the collective behavior of at least millions of millions at once Try to visualize the problems confronting the organic chemist of years ago You will have no more than reasonably pure samples of organic compounds the common laboratory chemicals of today glassware balances thermometers means of measuring densities and a few optical instruments You also will have a relatively embryonic theory that there are molecules in those bottles and that one compound differs from another because its molecules have different members or kinds of atoms and different arrangements of bonds Your task will be to determine what kinds and what numbers of atoms they contain that is to determine their molecular formulas Obviously a compound with formula and one with are not the same compound But suppose two compounds from different sources both are To decide whether these are the same or different you could smell them far better to sniff than to inhale taste them emphatically not recommended see if they have the same appearance and viscosity if liquids or use more sophisticated criteria boiling point melting point density or refractive index Other possibilities would be to see if they both have the same solubility in water or other solvents and whether they give the same reaction products with various reagents Of course all this gets a bit tough when the compounds are not pure and no good ways are available to purify them but that is part of the job Think about how you might proceed In retrospect it is surprising that in less than fifty years an enormous even if incomplete edifice of structural organic chemistry was constructed on the basis of the results of chemical reactions without determination of a single bond distance and with no electronic theory as a guide Interestingly all of the subsequent developments of the quantum mechanical theory of chemical bonds has not altered this edifice in significant ways Indeed for a long time a goal of molecular quantum mechanics was simply to be able to corroborate that when an organic chemist draws a single line between two carbon atoms to show that they are bonded he in fact knows what he is doing And that when he draws two or three bonds between the carbons to indicate a double or triple bond quantum mechanics supports this also as a valid idea Furthermore when modern tools for determining organic structures that involve actually measuring the distances between the atoms became available these provided great convenience but no great surprises To be sure a few structures turned out to be incorrect because they were based on faulty or inadequate experimental evidence But on the whole the modern threedimensional representations of molecules that accord with actual measurements of bond distances and angles are in no important respect different from the widely used threedimensional ballandstick models of organic molecules and these in essentially their present form date from at least as far back as E Paterno in How was all of this achieved Not by any very simple process The essence of some of the important ideas follow but it should be clear that what actually took place was far from straightforward A diverse group of people was involved many firmly committed to if not having a vested interest in earlier working hypotheses or paradigms that had served as useful bases for earlier experimentation but were coming apart at the seams because they could not accommodate the new facts that kept emerging As is usual in human endeavors espousal of new and better ideas did not come equally quickly to all those used to thinking in particular ways To illustrate at least one famous chemist Berthelot still used as the formula for water twentyfive years after it seemed clear that was a better choice A Determination of Molecular Formulas Before structures of molecules could be established there had to be a means of establishing molecular formulas and for this purpose the key concept was Avogadros hypothesis which can be stated in the form equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules Avogadros hypothesis allowed assignment of relative molecular weights from measurements of gas densities Then with analytical techniques that permit determination of the weight percentages of the various elements in a compound it became possible to set up a selfconsistent set of relative atomic weights From these and the relative molecular weights one can assign molecular formulas For example if one finds that a compound contains carbon atomic weight hydrogen atomic weight and bromine atomic weight then the ratios of the numbers of atoms are Dividing each of the last set of numbers by the smallest gives which suggests a molecular formula of or a multiple thereof If we know that hydrogen gas is and has a molecular weight of we can compare the weight of a given volume of hydrogen with the weight of the same volume of our unknown in the gas phase at the same temperature and pressure If the experimental ratio of these weights turns out to be then the molecular weight of the unknown would be and the formula would be correct B Valence If we assume that the molecule is held together by chemical bonds without knowing more we could write numerous structures such as and so on However if we also know of the existence of stable but not of stable but not of and of stable and but not of and so on a pattern of what is called valence emerges It will be seen that the above formulas all are consistent if hydrogen atoms and bromine atoms form just one bond are univalent while carbon atoms form four bonds are tetravalent This may seem almost naively simple today but a considerable period of doubt and uncertainty preceded the acceptance of the idea of definite valences for the elements that emerged about C Structural Formulas If we accept hydrogen and bromine as being univalent and carbon as tetravalent we can write as a structural formula for However we also might have written There is a serious problem as to whether these formulas represent the same or different compounds All that was known in the early days was that every purified sample of no matter how prepared had a boiling point of and density of Furthermore all looked the same all smelled the same and all underwent the same chemical reactions There was no evidence that was a mixture or that more than one compound of this formula could be prepared One might conclude therefore that all of the structural formulas above represent a single substance even though they superficially at least look different Indeed because and are two different ways of writing a formula for the same substance we suspect that the same is true for There are though two of these structures that could be different from one another namely In the first of these is located opposite the and the s on the carbon with the also are opposite one another In the second formula and are located next to each other as are the s on the same carbon We therefore have a problem as to whether these two different formulas also represent different compounds D Tetrahedral Carbon A brilliant solution to the problem posed in the preceding section came in when J H vant Hoff proposed that all four valences of carbon are equivalent and directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron If we redraw the structures for as we see that there is only one possible arrangement and contrary to the impression we got from our earlier structural formulas the bromine is equivalently located with respect to each of the hydrogens on the same carbon A convenient way of representing organic molecules in three dimensions which shows the tetrahedral relationships of the atoms very clearly uses the socalled ballandstick models The sticks that represent the bonds or valences form the tetrahedral angles of E The Question of Rotational Isomers The tetrahedral carbon does not solve all problems without additional postulates For example there are two different compounds known with the same formula These substances which we call isomers can be reasonably written as However ballandstick models suggest further possibilities for the second structure for example and This is a problem apparently first clearly recognized by Paterno in We call these rotational or conformational isomers because one is converted to another by rotation of the halves of the molecule with respect to one another with the bond acting as an axle If this is not clear you should make a ballandstick model and see what rotation around the bond does to the relationships between the atoms on the carbons The difficulty presented by these possibilities finally was circumvented by a brilliant suggestion by vant Hoff of free rotation which holds that isomers corresponding to different rotational angles such as and do not have separate stable existence but are interconverted by rotation around the bond so rapidly that they are indistinguishable from one another Thus there is only one isomer corresponding to the different possible rotational angles and a total of only two isomers of formula As we shall see the idea of free rotation required extensive modification some years after it was first proposed but it was an extremely important paradigm which as often happens became so deeply rooted as to become essentially an article of faith for later organic chemists Free rotation will be discussed in more detail in Chapters and F The Substitution Method for Proof of Structure The problem of determining whether a particular isomer of is could be solved today in a few minutes by spectroscopic means as will be explained in Chapter However at the time structure theory was being developed the structure had to be deduced on the basis of chemical reactions which could include either how the compound was formed or what it could be converted to A virtually unassailable proof of structure where it is applicable is to determine how many different substitution products each of a given group of isomers can give For the pair of isomers substitution of a bromine for a hydrogen will be seen to give only one possibility with one compound and two with the other Therefore if we have two bottles one containing one isomer and one the other and run the substitution test the compound that gives only one product is and the one that gives a mixture of two products is Further it will be seen that the test besides telling which isomer is and which is establishes the structures of the two possible isomers and Thus only can be formed from both of the different isomers whereas is formed from only one of them G The Benzene Problem There were already many interconversion reactions of organic compounds known at the time that valence theory structural formulas and the concept of the tetrahedral carbon came into general use As a result it did not take long before much of organic chemistry could be fitted into a concordant whole One difficult problem was posed by the structures of a group of substitution products of benzene called aromatic compounds which for a long time defied explanation Benzene itself had been prepared first by Michael Faraday in An ingenious solution for the benzene structure was provided by A Kekule in wherein he suggested apparently as the result of a hallucinatory perception that the six carbons were connected in a hexagonal ring with alternating single and double carbontocarbon bonds and with each carbon connected to a single hydrogen This concept was controversial to say the least mainly on two counts Benzene did not behave as expected as judged by the behavior of other compounds with carbontocarbon double bonds and also because there should be two different dibromo substitution products of benzene with the bromine on adjacent carbons and but only one such compound could be isolated Kekule explained the second objection away by maintaining that and were in rapid equilibrium through concerted bond shifts in something like the same manner as the freerotation hypothesis mentioned previously However the first objection could not be dismissed so easily and quite a number of alternative structures were proposed over the ensuing years The controversy was not really resolved until it was established that benzene is a regular planar hexagon which means that all of its bonds have the same length in best accord with a structure written not with double not with single but with bonds between the carbons as in This in turn generated a massive further theoretical controversy over just how should be interpreted which for a time even became a part of ColdWar politics We shall examine experimental and theoretical aspects of the benzene structure in some detail later It is interesting that more than years after Kekules proposal the final story on the benzene structure is yet to be told H Proof of Structure through Reactions The combination of valence theory and the substitution method as described in Section F gives for many compounds quite unequivocal proofs of structure Use of chemical transformations for proofs of structure depends on the applicability of a simple guiding principle often called the principle of least structural change As we shall see later many exceptions are known and care is required to keep from making serious errors With this caution let us see how the principle may be applied The compound discussed in Section A reacts slowly with water to give a product of formula The normal valence of oxygen is two and we can write two and only two different structures and for The principle of least structural change favors as the product because the reaction to form it is a simple replacement of bromine bonded to carbon by whereas formation of would entail a much more drastic rearrangement of bonds The argument is really a subtle one involving an assessment of the reasonableness of various possible reactions On the whole however it works rather well and in the specific case of the isomers is strongly supported by the fact that treatment of with strong hydrobromic acid converts it back to In contrast the isomer of structure reacts with to form two molecules of In each case bonds are broken and bonds are formed We could conceive of many other possible reactions of with for example which as indicated by does not occur but hardly can be ruled out by the principle of least structural change itself Showing how the probability of such alternative reactions can be evaluated will be a very large part of our later discussions I Reactivity Saturation Unsaturation and Reaction Mechanisms The substitution method and the interconversion reactions discussed for proof of structure possibly may give you erroneous ideas about the reactions and reactivity of organic compounds We certainly do not wish to imply that it is a simple straightforward process to make all of the possible substitution products of a compound such as In fact as will be shown later direct substitution of bromine for hydrogen with compounds such as this does not occur readily and when it does occur the four possible substitution products indeed are formed but in far from equal amounts because there are differences in reactivity for substitution at the different positions Actually some of the substitution products are formed only in very small quantities Fortunately this does not destroy the validity of the substitution method but does make it more difficult to apply If direct substitution fails some or all of the possible substitution products may have to be produced by indirect means Nonetheless you must understand that the success of the substitution method depends on determination of the total number of possible isomers it does not depend on how the isomers are prepared Later you will hear a lot about compounds or reagents being reactive and unreactive You may be exasperated by the loose way that these terms are used by organic chemists to characterize how fast various chemical changes occur Many familiar inorganic reactions such as the neutralization of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide solution are extremely fast at ordinary temperatures But the same is not often true of reactions of organic compounds For example treated in two different ways is converted to gaseous compounds one having the formula and the other The compound ethene reacts very quickly with bromine to give but the compound ethane does not react with bromine except at high temperatures or when exposed to sunlight or similar intense light The reaction products then are and and later and and so on We clearly can characterize as reactive and as unreactive toward bromine The early organic chemists also used the terms unsaturated and saturated for this behavior and these terms are still in wide use today But we need to distinguish between unsaturated and reactive and between saturated and unreactive because these pairs of terms are not synonymous The equations for the reactions of ethene and ethane with bromine are different in that ethene adds bromine whereas ethane substitutes bromine You should reserve the term unsaturated for compounds that can at least potentially react by addition and saturated for compounds that can only be expected to react by substitution The difference between addition and substitution became much clearer with the development of the structure theory that called for carbon to be tetravalent and hydrogen univalent Ethene then was assigned a structure with a carbontocarbon double bond and ethane a structure with a carbontocarbon single bond Addition of bromine to ethene subsequently was formulated as breaking one of the carboncarbon bonds of the double bond and attaching bromine to these valences Substitution was written similarly but here bromine and a bond are involved We will see later that the way in which these reactions actually occur is much more complicated than these simple equations indicate In fact such equations are regarded best as chemical accounting operations The number of bonds is shown correctly for both the reactants and the products and there is an indication of which bonds break and which bonds are formed in the overall process However do not make the mistake of assuming that no other bonds are broken or made in intermediate stages of the reaction Much of what comes later in this book will be concerned with what we know or can find out about the mechanisms of such reactions a reaction mechanism being the actual sequence of events by which the reactants become converted to the products Such information is of extraordinary value in defining and understanding the range of applicability of given reactions for practical preparations of desired compounds The distinction we have made between unsaturated and reactive is best illustrated by a definite example Ethene is unsaturated and reactive toward bromine but tetrachloroethene will not add bromine at all under the same conditions and is clearly unreactive But is it also saturated The answer is definitely no because if we add a small amount of aluminum bromide to a mixture of tetrachloroethene and bromine addition does occur although sluggishly Obviously tetrachloroethene is unsaturated in the sense it can undergo addition even if it is unreactive to bromine in the absence of aluminum bromide The aluminum bromide functions in the addition of bromine to tetrachloroethene as a catalyst which is something that facilitates the conversion of reactants to products The study of the nature and uses of catalysts will concern us throughout this book Catalysis is our principal means of controlling organic reactions to help form the product we want in the shortest possible time We will finesse here the long and important struggle of getting a truly selfconsistent table of atomic weights If you are interested in the complex history of this problem and the clear solution to it proposed by S Cannizzaro in there are many accounts available in books on the history of chemistry One example is J R Partington A History of Chemistry Vol IV Macmillan London Relative atomic weights now are based on exactly Formulas such as this appear to have been used first by Crum Brown in after the originators of structural formulas A Kekule and A Couper came up with rather awkward impractical representations It seems incredible today that even the drawing of these formulas was severely criticized for many years The pot was kept boiling mainly by H Kolbe a productive German chemist with a gift for colorful invective and the advantage of a podium provided by being editor of an influential chemical journal The name of J A Le Bel also is associated with this particular idea but the record shows that Le Bel actually opposed the tetrahedral formulations although simultaneously with vant Hoff he made a related very important contribution as will be discussed in Chapter The resonance theory to be discussed in detail in Chapters and was characterized in as a physically and ideologically inadmissible theory formulated by decadent bourgeois scientists See L R Graham Science and Philosophy in the Soviet Union Vintage Books New York Chapter VIII for an interesting account of this controversy Modern organic chemistry should not be regarded at all as a settled science free of controversy To be sure personal attacks of the kind indulged in by Kolbe and others often are not published but profound and indeed acrimonious differences of scientific interpretation exist and can

Absolute ConfigurationRelative ConfigurationContributors and Attributions Learning Objective compare and contrast absolute configuration with relative configuration Absolute Configuration The absolute configuration at a chiral center in a molecule is a timeindependent and unambiguous symbolic description of the spatial arrangement of ligands groups bonded to the chiral center The chiral centers in and bear the same ligands abd and e However and are not superimposable on each other meaning that the arrangement of ligands around the chiral center in and in is different and are mirror images of each other meaning that the arrangement of ligands around the chiral center in is the exact opposite of that in Chiral centers in and are said to have opposite absolute configurations According to RS convention if the absolute configuration at the chiral center in is R that at the chiral center in is S or vice versa Relative Configuration The relative configuration is the experimentally determined relationship between two enantiomers even though we may not know the absolute configuration The sign of rotation of planepolarized light by an enantiomer is not easily related to its configuration This is true even for substances with very similar structures Thus given lactic acid with a specific rotation and methyl lactate with a specific rotation we cannot tell from the rotation alone whether the acid and ester have the same or a different arrangement of groups about the chiral center Their relative configurations have to be obtained by other means If we convert lactic acid into its methyl ester we can be reasonably certain that the ester will be related in configuration to the acid because esterification should not affect the configuration about the chiral carbon atom It happens that the methyl ester so obtained is levorotatory so we know that lactic acid and methyl lactate have the same relative configuration at the asymmetric carbon even if they possess opposite signs of optical rotation However we still do not know the absolute configuration that is we are unable to tell which of the two possible configurations of lactic acid or corresponds to the dextro or acid and which to the levo or acid Until the absolute configuration of no optically active compound was known Instead configurations were assigned relative to a standard glyceraldehyde which originally was chosen by E Fischer around for the purpose of correlating the configuration of carbohydrates Fischer arbitrarily assigned the configuration to dextrorotatory glyceraldehyde which was known as glyceraldehyde The levorotatory enantiomer is designated as glyceraldehyde If you are unsure of the terminology and or of the rules for writing Fischer projection formulas review Sections C and The configurations of many compounds besides sugars now have been related to glyceraldehyde including amino acids terpenes steroids and other biochemically important substances Compounds whose configurations are related to glyceraldehyde are said to belong to the series and those related to glyceraldehyde belong to the series At the time the choice of absolute configuration for glyceraldehyde was made there was no way of knowing whether the configuration of glyceraldehyde was in reality or However the choice had a chance of being correct and we now know that the configuration is in fact the correct configuration of glyceraldehyde This was established through use of a special xray crystallographic technique which permitted determination of the absolute disposition of the atoms in space of sodium rubidium tartrate The configuration of tartaric acid Section previously had been shown by chemical means to be opposite to that of glyceraldehyde Consequently the absolute configuration of any compound now is known once it has been correlated directly or indirectly with glyceraldehyde For example Figure below whereby the configuration of lactic acid is related to the amino acid alanine Because lactic acid has been related to glyceraldehyde it follows that the absolute configurations are lactic acid and alanine Chemical transformation showing how the configuration of natural alanine has been related to lactic acid and hence to glyceraldehyde The transformations shown involve two reactions each of which is stereospecific and inverts the configuration Section Reduction of the azide group leaves the configuration unchanged When there are several chiral carbons in a molecule the configuration at one center usually is related directly or indirectly to glyceraldehyde and the configurations at the other centers are determined relative to the first Thus in the aldehyde form of the important sugar glucose there are four chiral centers and so there are possible stereoisorners The projection formula of the isomer that corresponds to the aldehyde form of natural glucose is By convention for sugars the configuration of the highestnumbered chiral carbon is referred to glyceraldehyde to determine the overall configuration of the molecule For glucose this atom is next to the group and has the hydroxyl group on the right Therefore naturally occurring glucose which has a rotation belongs to the series and is properly called glucose However the configurations of amino acids possessing more than one chiral carbon are determined by the lowestnumbered chiral carbon which is the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group Thus even though the natural amino acid threonine has exactly the same kind of arrangement of substituents as the natural sugar threose threonine by the aminoacid convention belongs to the series whereas threose by the sugar convention belongs to the series A serious ambiguity arises for compounds such as the active tartaric acids If the aminoacid convention is used tartaric acid falls in the series by the sugar convention it has the configuration One way out of this dilemma is to use the subscripts and to denote the aminoacid or carbohydrate conventions respectively Then the absolute configuration of tartaric acid can be designated as either tartaric acid of tartaric acid Contributors and Attributions Gamini Gunawardena from the OChemPal site Utah

nomenclature USE YOUR MODELING KIT Models assist in visualizing the structure When using a model make sure the lowest priority is pointing away from you Then determine the direction from the highest priority substituent to the lowest clockwise R or counterclockwise S IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MODELING KIT remember that the dashes mean the bond is going into the screen and the wedges means that bond is coming out of the screen If the lowest priority bond is not pointing to the back mentally rotate it so that it is However it is very useful when learning organic chemistry to use models If you have a modeling kit use it as you read through this section and work the practice problems Introduction and the CahnIngoldPrelog rules of Priority To name the enantiomers of a compound unambiguously their names must include the handedness of the molecule The letters R and S are determined by applying the CahnIngoldPrelog CIP rules The optical activity can also be communicated in the name but must be empirically derived There are also biochemical conventions for carbohydrates sugars and amino acids the building blocks of proteins The method of unambiguously assigning the handedness of molecules was originated by three chemists RS Cahn C Ingold and V Prelog and as such is also often called the CahnIngoldPrelog rules In addition to the CIP system there are two ways of experimentally determining the absolute configuration of an enantiomer Xray diffraction analysis Note that there is no correlation between the sign of rotation and the structure of a particular enantiomer Chemical correlation with a molecule whose structure has already been determined via Xray diffraction However for nonlaboratory purposes it is beneficial to focus on the RS system The sign of optical rotation although different for the two enantiomers of a chiral moleculeat the same temperature cannot be used to establish the absolute configuration of an enantiomer this is because the sign of optical rotation for a particular enantiomer may change when the temperature changes The CahnIngoldPrelog rules of priority are based on the atomic numbers of the atoms of interest For chirality the atoms of interest are the atoms bonded to the chiral carbon The atom with higher atomic number has higher priority I Br Cl S P F O N C H When comparing isotopes the atom with the higher mass number has higher priority O O or N N or C C or T H D H H When there is a tie in above establish relative priority by proceeding to the next atoms along the chain until the first difference is observed Multiple bonds are treated as if each bond of the multiple bond is bonded to a unique atom For example the ethenyl group CHCH has higher priority than the ethyl group CHCH The ethenyl carbon priority is two bonds to carbon atoms and one bond to a hydrogen atom compared with the ethyl carbon that has only one bond to a carbon atom and two bonds to two hydrogen atoms Similarly the carboncarbon triple bond of acetylene would give it higher CIP priority than the ethenyl group as summarized below Stereocenters are labeled R or S The right hand and left hand nomenclature is used to name the enantiomers of a chiral compound The stereocenters are labeled as R or S Consider the diagram above on the left a curved arrow is drawn counterclockwise ccw from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent in the Sconfiguration Sinister Latin left The counterclockwise direction can be recognized by the movement left when leaving the o clock position Now consider the diagram above on the right where a curved arrow is drawn clockwise cw from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent in the R configuration Rectus Latin right The R or S is then added as a prefix in parenthesis to the name of the enantiomer of interest A locator number is required if there is more than one chiral center Otherwise the person reading the name is expected to recognize the chiral center Example The two chiral compounds below are drawn to emphasize the chiral carbon with the full chemical name below each structure Absolute Configurations of Perspective Formulas Chemists need a convenient way to distinguish one stereoisomer from another The CahnIngoldPrelog system is a set of rules that allows us to unambiguously define the stereochemical configuration of any stereocenter using the designations R from the Latin rectus meaning righthanded or S from the Latin sinister meaning lefthanded The rules for this system of stereochemical nomenclature are on the surface fairly simple Rules for assigning an RS designation to a chiral center Assign priorities to the four substituents with being the highest priority and the lowest Priorities are based on the atomic number Trace a circle from to to Determine the orientation of the priority group If it is oriented into the plane of the page away from you go to step a If it is oriented out of the plane of the page toward you go to step b a group pointing away from you a clockwise circle in part corresponds to the R configuration while a counterclockwise circle corresponds to the S configuration b group pointing toward you a clockwise circle in part corresponds to the S configuration while a counterclockwise circle corresponds to the R configuration Well use the carbon sugar glyceraldehyde as our first example The first thing that we must do is to assign a priority to each of the four substituents bound to the chiral center We first look at the atoms that are directly bonded to the chiral center these are H O in the hydroxyl C in the aldehyde and C in the CHOH group Assigning RS configuration to glyceraldehyde Two priorities are easy hydrogen with an atomic number of is the lowest priority and the hydroxyl oxygen with atomic number is priority Carbon has an atomic number of Which of the two C groups is priority the aldehyde or the CHOH To determine this we move one more bond away from the chiral center for the aldehyde we have a double bond to an oxygen while on the CHOH group we have a single bond to an oxygen If the atom is the same double bonds have a higher priority than single bonds Therefore the aldehyde group is assigned priority and the CHOH group the priority With our priorities assigned we look next at the priority group the hydrogen and see that it is pointed back away from us into the plane of the page thus step a from the procedure above applies Then we trace a circle defined by the and priority groups in increasing order The circle is clockwise which by step a tells us that this carbon has the R configuration and that this molecule is Rglyceraldehyde Its enantiomer by definition must be Sglyceraldehyde Next lets look at one of the enantiomers of lactic acid and determine the configuration of the chiral center Clearly H is the substituent and OH is Owing to its three bonds to oxygen the carbon on the acid group takes priority and the methyl group takes The group hydrogen happens to be drawn pointing toward us out of the plane of the page in this figure so we use step b The circle traced from to to is clockwise which means that the chiral center has the S configuration The drug thalidomide is an interesting but tragic case study in the importance of stereochemistry in drug design First manufactured by a German drug company and prescribed widely in Europe and Australia in the late s as a sedative and remedy for morning sickness in pregnant women thalidomide was soon implicated as the cause of devastating birth defects in babies born to women who had taken it Thalidomide contains a chiral center and thus exists in two enantiomeric forms It was marketed as a racemic mixture in other words a mixture of both enantiomers Lets try to determine the stereochemical configuration of the enantiomer on the left Of the four bonds to the chiral center the priority is hydrogen The nitrogen group is the carbonyl side of the ring is and the CH side of the ring is The hydrogen is shown pointing away from us and the prioritized substituents trace a clockwise circle this is the R enantiomer of thalidomide The other enantiomer of course must have the S configuration Although scientists are still unsure today how thalidomide works experimental evidence suggests that it was actually the R enantiomer that had the desired medical effects while the S enantiomer caused the birth defects Even with this knowledge however pure Rthalidomide is not safe because enzymes in the body rapidly convert between the two enantiomers we will see how that happens in chapter As a historical note thalidomide was never approved for use in the United States This was thanks in large part to the efforts of Dr Frances Kelsey a Food and Drug officer who at peril to her career blocked its approval due to her concerns about the lack of adequate safety studies particularly with regard to the drugs ability to enter the bloodstream of a developing fetus Unfortunately though at that time clinical trials for new drugs involved widespread and unregulated distribution to doctors and their patients across the country so families in the US were not spared from the damage caused Very recently a close derivative of thalidomide has become legal to prescribe again in the United States with strict safety measures enforced for the treatment of a form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma In Brazil thalidomide is used in the treatment of leprosy but despite safety measures children are still being born with thalidomiderelated defects Exercise Determine the

the configurations are reversed from the first example In the compound below the movement is clockwise R which is Horribly wrong so the actual configuration is S The complete IUPAC name for this compound is Sbutanol Manipulating Fischer Projections with NO Change to Configuration A Fischer projection restricts a threedimensional molecule into two dimensions Consequently there are limitations as to the operations that can be performed on a Fischer projection without changing the absolute configuration at chiral centers The operations that do not change the absolute configuration at a chiral center in a Fischer projections can be summarized as two rules Rule Rotation of the Fischer projection by º in either direction without lifting it off the plane of the paper does not change the absolute configuration at the chiral center Rule Rotation of three ligands on the chiral center in either direction keeping the remaining ligand in place does not change the absolute configuration at the chiral center Manipulating Fischer Projections with Change to Configuration The operations that do change the absolute configuration at a chiral center in a Fischer projection can be summarized as two rules Rule Rotation of the Fischer projection by º in either direction changes the absolute configuration at the chiral center Rule Interchanging any two ligands on the chiral center changes the absolute configuration at the chiral center The above rules assume that the Fischer projection under consideration contains only one chiral center However with care they can be applied to Fischer projections containing any number of chiral centers Exercise Classify the following compounds as R or S Solution S I Br F H The lowest priority substituent H is already going towards the back It turns

that some acids are stronger than others Sulfuric acid is strong enough to be used as a drain cleaner as it will rapidly dissolve clogs of hair and other organic material Not surprisingly concentrated sulfuric acid will also cause painful burns if it touches your skin and permanent damage if it gets in your eyes theres a good reason for those safety goggles you wear in chemistry lab Acetic acid vinegar will also burn your skin and eyes but is not nearly strong enough to make an effective drain cleaner Water which we know can act as a proton donor is obviously not a very strong acid Even hydroxide ion could theoretically act as an acid it has after all a proton to donate but this is not a reaction that we would normally consider to be relevant in anything but the most extreme conditions The relative acidity of different compounds or functional groups in other words their relative capacity to donate a proton to a common base under identical conditions is quantified by a number called the acid dissociation constant abbreviated Ka The common base chosen for comparison is water We will consider acetic acid as our first example When a small amount of acetic acid is added to water a protontransfer event acidbase reaction occurs to some extent Notice the phrase to some extent this reaction does not run to completion with all of the acetic acid converted to acetate its conjugate base Rather a dynamic equilibrium is reached with proton transfer going in both directions thus the twoway arrows and finite concentrations of all four species in play The nature of this equilibrium situation as you recall from General Chemistry is expressed by an equilibrium constant K The equilibrium constant is actually a ratio of activities represented by the symbol but activities are rarely used in courses other than analytical or physical chemistry To simplify the discussion for general chemistry and organic chemistry courses the activities of all of the solutes are replaced with molarities and the activity of the solvent usually water is defined as having the value of In our example we added a small amount of acetic acid to a large amount of water water is the solvent for this reaction Therefore in the course of the reaction the concentration of water changes very little and the water can be treated as a pure solvent which is always assigned an activity of The acetic acid acetate ion and hydronium ion are all solutes and so their activities are approximated with molarities The acid dissociation constant or Ka for acetic acid is therefore defined as Because dividing by does not change the value of the constant the is usually not written and Ka is written as In more general terms the dissociation constant for a given acid is expressed as or Equation applies to a neutral acid such as like HCl or acetic acid while Equation applies to a cationic acid like ammonium NH The value of Ka x for acetic acid is very small this means that very little dissociation actually takes place and there is much more acetic acid in solution at equilibrium than there is acetate ion Acetic acid is a relatively weak acid at least when compared to sulfuric acid Ka or hydrochloric acid Ka both of which undergo essentially complete dissociation in water A number like x is not very easy either to say or to remember Chemists often use pKa values as a more convenient term to express relative acidity pKa is related to Ka by the following equation Doing the math we find that the pKa of acetic acid is The use of pKa values allows us to express the acidity of common compounds and functional groups on a numerical scale of about very strong acid to not acidic at all Table at the end of the text lists exact or approximate pKa values for different types of protons that you are likely to encounter in your study of organic and biological chemistry Looking at Table you see that the pKa of carboxylic acids are in the range the pKa of sulfuric acid is and the pKa of water is Alkenes and alkanes which are not acidic at all have pKa values above The lower the pKa value the stronger the acid Table Representative acid constants It is important to realize that pKa is not the same thing as pH pKa is an inherent property of a compound or functional group while pH is the measure of the hydronium ion concentration in a particular aqueous solution Any particular acid will always have the same pKa assuming that we are talking about an aqueous solution at room temperature but different aqueous solutions of the acid could have different pH values depending on how much acid is added to how much water Our table of pKa values will also allow us to compare the strengths of different bases by comparing the pKa values of their conjugate acids The key idea to remember is this the stronger the conjugate acid the weaker the conjugate base Sulfuric acid is the strongest acid on our list with a pKa value of so HSO is the weakest conjugate base You can see that hydroxide ion is a stronger base than ammonia NH because ammonium NH pKa is a stronger acid than water pKa The stronger the conjugate acid the weaker the conjugate base While Table provides the pKa values of only a limited number of compounds it can be very useful as a starting point for estimating the acidity or basicity of just about any organic molecule Here is where your familiarity with organic functional groups will come in very handy What for example is the pKa of cyclohexanol It is not on the table but as it is an alcohol it is probably somewhere near that of ethanol pKa Likewise we can use Table to predict that parahydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde an intermediate compound in the biosynthesis of morphine has a pKa in the neighborhood of close to that of our reference compound phenol Notice in this example that we need to evaluate the potential acidity at four different locations on the molecule Aldehyde and aromatic protons are not at all acidic pKa values are above not on our table The two protons on the carbon next to the carbonyl are slightly acidic with pKa values around according to the table The most acidic proton is on the phenol group so if the compound were to be reacted with a single molar equivalent of strong base this is the proton that would be donated first As you continue your study of organic chemistry it will be a very good idea to commit to memory the approximate pKa ranges of some important functional groups including water alcohols phenols ammonium thiols phosphates carboxylic acids and carbons next to carbonyl groups socalled acarbons These are the groups that you are most likely to see acting as acids or bases in biological organic reactions A word of caution when using the pKa table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair If you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia NH compared to that of ethoxide ion CHCHO for example the relevant pKa values to consider are the pKa of ammonium ion and the pKa of ethanol From these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base Do not make the mistake of using the pKa value of this is the pKa of ammonia acting as an acid and tells you how basic the NH ion is very basic Example Acidic Groups Using the pKa table estimate pKa values for the most acidic group on the compounds below and draw the structure of the conjugate base that results when this group donates a proton Use the pKa table above andor from the Reference Tables Answer a The most acidic group is the protonated amine pKa b Alpha proton by the CO group pKa c Thiol pKa d Carboxylic acid pKa e Carboxylic acid pKa Example Acetic acid CHCOOH is known to have a pKa of Please determine the Ka for acetic acid Solution Solving for Ka algebraically you get the following pKa LogKa pKa LogKa pKa Ka Using a calculator first enter in the value for the pKa The make the number negative Next use the inverse log function All calculators are slightly different so this function may appear as ANTILOG INV LOG or X Often it is the second function of the LOG button Ka for acetic acid pKa x Exercises Write down an expression for the acidity

the products and specify the reagents to generate nucleophilic acetylide ions and heavy metal acetylides Acidity of Terminal Alkynes and Acetylilde Ion Formation Terminal alkynes are much more acidic than most other hydrocarbons Removal of the proton leads to the formation of an acetylide anion RCC The origin of the enhanced acidity can be attributed to the stability of the acetylide anion which has the unpaired electrons in an sp hybridized orbital The stability results from occupying an orbital with a high degree of sorbital character There is a strong correlation between scharacter in the orbital containing the nonbonding electrons in the anion and the acidity of hydrocarbons The enhanced acidity with greater scharacter occurs despite the fact that the homolytic CH BDE is larger Table

of removing a proton from each of the substances listed below Justify your answers briefly ethanol pKa acetic acid pKa acetylene pKa Answer Answers No The pKa of ethanol is similar to the pKa of water so proton exchange is comparable for both protonation and deprotonation between alcohols and water Alcohols can be considered alkylated water and share many similarities in both physical properties and chemical reactivity Yes very well There is a difference of pKa units between the pKa of water and the pKa of acetic acid The equilibrium lies well to the right with acetate as the predominate form of the original acetic acid No hardly at all The hydroxide ion is too weak a base to remove a proton from acetylene The equilibrium lies so far to the left that it is considered a No Reaction

base Study Notes You should already be familiar with the BrønstedLowry concept of acidity and the differences between strong and weak acids You may wish to review this topic before proceeding In chemists Johannes Brønsted and Martin Lowry independently developed definitions of acids and bases based on compounds abilities to either donate or accept protons H ions Here acids are defined as being able to donate protons in the form of hydrogen ions whereas bases are defined as being able to accept protons This took the Arrhenius definition one step further as water is no longer required to be present in the solution for acid and base reactions to occur BrønstedLowry Definition JN Brønsted and TM Lowry independently developed the theory of proton donors and proton acceptors in acidbase reactions coincidentally in the same region and during the same year The Arrhenius theory where acids and bases are defined by whether the molecule produces hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion when dissolved in water was too limiting because not all chemical reactions especially organic reactions occur in water The BrønstedLowry Theory defines an acid a proton donor while a base is a proton acceptor This is illustrated in the following reactions HAZAHZ Acid Base Donates hydrogen ions Accepts hydrogen ions HOH HO Cl HOH NH NH OH The determination of a substance as a BrønstedLowry acid or base can only be done by examining the reaction since many chemicals can be either an acid or a base For example HOH is a base in the first reaction and an acid in the second reaction To determine whether a substance is an acid or a base count the hydrogens on each substance before and after the reaction If the number of hydrogens has decreased then that substance is the acid donates hydrogen ions If the number of hydrogens has increased then that substance is the base accepts hydrogen ions These definitions are normally applied to the reactants on the left If the reaction is viewed in reverse a new acid and base can be identified The substances on the right side of the equation are called the conjugate acid and conjugate base compared to those on the left Also note that an acid turns into a conjugate base and the base turns into the conjugate acid after the reaction is over Conjugate AcidBase Pairs In aqueous solutions acids and bases can be defined in terms of the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base Thus for every acidic species in an aqueous solution there exists a species derived from the acid by the loss of a proton These two species that differ by only a proton constitute a conjugate acidbase pair For example in the reaction of HCl with water shown below HCl the parent acid donates a proton to a water molecule the parent base thereby forming Cl Thus HCl and Cl constitute a conjugate acidbase pair By convention we always write a conjugate acidbase pair as the acid followed by its conjugate base In the reverse reaction the Cl ion in solution acts as a base to accept a proton from HO forming HO and HCl Thus HO and HO constitute a second conjugate acidbase pair In general any acidbase reaction must contain two conjugate acidbase pairs which in this case are HClCl and HOHO All acidbase reactions contain two conjugate acidbase pairs Similarly in the reaction of acetic acid with water acetic acid donates a proton to water which acts as the base In the reverse reaction HO is the acid that donates a proton to the acetate ion which acts as the base Once again we have two conjugate acidbase pairs the parent acid and its conjugate base CHCOHCHCO and the parent base and its conjugate acid HOHO In the reaction of ammonia with water to give ammonium ions and hydroxide ions ammonia acts as a base by accepting a proton from a water molecule which in this case means that water is acting as an acid In the reverse reaction an ammonium ion acts as an acid by donating a proton to a hydroxide ion and the hydroxide ion acts as a base The conjugate acidbase pairs for this reaction are NHNH and HOOH Example Aniline CHNH is slightly soluble in water It has a nitrogen atom that can accept a hydrogen ion from a water molecule just like the nitrogen atom in ammonia does Write the chemical equation for this reaction and identify the BrønstedLowry acid and base Solution CHNH and HO are the reactants When CHNH accepts a proton from HO it gains an extra H and a positive charge and leaves an OH ion behind The reaction is as follows Because CHNH accepts a proton it is the BrønstedLowry base The HO molecule because it donates a proton is the BrønstedLowry acid Example Identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium Solution One pair is HO and OH where HO has one more H and is the conjugate acid while OH has one less H and is the conjugate base The other pair consists of CHN and CHNH where CHNH is the conjugate acid it has an additional proton and CHN is the conjugate base Some common conjugate acidbase pairs are shown in Figure The strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at the top right The conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong

ComplexesExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to state the Lewis definition of an acid and a base identify a given compound as being a Lewis acid or Lewis base given its Lewis structure or its Kekulé structure identify an organic molecule or ion in a reaction as either an electrophile or nucleophile Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below Lewis acid Lewis base Electrophile Nucleophile Study Notes The Lewis concept of acidity and basicity will be of great use to you when you study reaction mechanisms The realization that an ion such as is electron deficient and is therefore a Lewis acid should help you understand why this ion reacts with substances which are Lewis bases eg HO Introduction to Lewis AcidBase Theory The Brønsted acidbase theory has been used throughout the history of acid and base chemistry However this theory is very restrictive and focuses primarily on acids and bases acting as proton donors and acceptors Sometimes conditions arise where the theory doesnt necessarily fit such as in solids and gases In GN Lewis from UC Berkeley proposed an alternate theory to describe acids and bases His theory gave a generalized explanation of acids and bases based on structure and bonding Through the use of the Lewis definition of acids and bases chemists are now able to predict a wider variety of acidbase reactions Lewis theory used electrons instead of proton transfer and specifically stated that an acid is a species that accepts an electron pair while a base donates an electron pair Example of Lewis base oxygen atom from carbonyl reacting with Lewis Acid Mg ion The reaction of a Lewis acid and a Lewis base will produce a coordinate covalent bond A coordinate covalent bond is just a type of covalent bond in which one reactant donates both electrons to form the bond In this case the Lewis base donates its electrons to form a bond to the Lewis acid The resulting product is called an addition compound or more commonly a complex The electronpair flow from Lewis base to Lewis acid is shown using curved arrows much like those used for resonance structures in Section Curved arrows always mean that an electron pair moves from the atom at the tail of the arrow to the atom at the head of the arrow In this case the lone pair on the Lewis base attacks the Lewis acid forming a bond This new type of electron pair movement along with those described in Section will be used throughout this text to describe electron flow during reactions Lewis Acid a species that accepts an electron pair and will typically either have vacant orbitals or a polar bond involving hydrogen such that it can donate H which has an empty s orbital Lewis Base a species that donates an electron pair and will have lonepair electrons of pi bonding electrons Lewis Acids Neutral compounds of boron aluminum and the other Group elements BF AlCl which possess only six valence electrons have a very strong tendency to gain an additional electron pair Because these compounds are only surrounded by three electron groups they are sp hybridized contained a vacant p orbital and are potent Lewis acids Trimethylamines lone pair elections are contained in an sp hybrid orbital making it a Lewis base These two orbitals overlap creating a covalent bond in a boron trifluoridetrimethylamine complex The movement of electrons during this interaction is show by by an arrow Positive ions are often Lewis acids because they have an electrostatic attraction for electron donors Examples include alkali and alkaline earth metals in the group IA and IIA columns K Mg and Ca are sometimes seen as Lewis acidic sites in biology for example These ions are very stable forms of these elements because of their low electron ionization potentials However their positive charges do attract electron donorsThe interaction between a magnesium cation Mg and a carbonyl oxygen is a common example of a Lewis acidbase reaction The carbonyl oxygen the Lewis base donates a pair of electrons to the magnesium cation the Lewis acid As we will see in Chapter when we begin the study of reactions involving carbonyl groups this interaction has the very important effect of increasing the polarity of the carbonoxygen double bond The eightelectron rule does not hold throughout the periodic table In order to obtain noble gas configurations some atoms may need eighteen electrons in their valence shell Transition metals such as titanium iron and nickel may have up to eighteen electrons and can frequently accept electron pairs from Lewis bases Transition metals are often Lewis acids For example titanium has four valence electrons and can form four bonds in compounds such as titanium tetrakis isopropoxide below or titanium tetrachloride TiCl However the titanium atom in that compound has only eight valence electrons not eighteen It can easily accept electrons from donors Figure Although titanium has eight electrons in this molecule titanium tetrakisisopropoxide it can accommodate up to eighteen It is a Lewis acid The cerium atom in cerium trisdimethylamide comes from a similar part of the periodic table and is also a Lewis acid For example when THF and TiCl are combined a Lewis acidbase complex is formed TiClTHF TiClTHF is a yellow solid at room temperature Figure A Lewis acidbase complex between tetrahydrofuran THF and titanium tetrachloride The Proton as a Common Lewis Acid Perhaps the most common example of a Lewis acid is also the simplest It is the hydrogen cation H or proton It is called a proton because in most hydrogen atoms the only particle in the nucleus is a proton If an electron is removed to make a cation a proton is all that is left A proton is a Lewis acid for a number of reasons It has a positive charge and so it will attract electrons which are negative Also it lacks the electron configuration of its noble gas neighbor helium Helium has two electrons If a Lewis base or nucleophile donates a pair of electrons to a proton the proton will obtain a helium noble gas configuration Figure Proton reacting as a Lewis acid There is something about hydrogen cations that is not so simple however They are actually not so common Instead protons are generally always bound to a Lewis base Hydrogen is almost always covalently or coordinately bonded to another atom Many of the other elements commonly found in compounds with hydrogen are more electronegative than hydrogen As a result hydrogen often has a partial positive charge making is still act as a Lewis Acid A acidbase reaction involving protons might better be expressed as Figure Proton transfer from one site to another The Lewis acidbase interactions we have looked at so far are slightly different here Instead of two compounds coming together and forming a bond we have one Lewis base replacing another at a proton Two specific movements of electrons are shown in the reaction both of which are show by arrows Lone pair electrons on oxygen attack the hydrogen to form an OH bond in the product Also the electrons of the HCl bond move to become a lone pair on chlorine as the HCl bond breaks These two arrows together are said to represent the mechanism of this acidbase reaction Lewis Bases What makes a molecule or an atom or ion a Lewis base It must have a pair of electrons available to share with another atom to form a bond The most readily available electrons are those that are not already in bonds Bonding electrons are low in energy Nonbonding electrons are higher in energy and may be stabilized when they are delocalized in a new bond Lewis bases usually have nonbonding electrons or lone pairs this makes oxygen and nitrogen compounds common Lewis bases Lewis bases may be anionic or neutral The basic requirement is that they have a pair of electrons to donate Figure Some common organic examples of Lewis bases Most oxygen nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds can act as Lewis Bases Note Ammonia Ammonia NH has a lone pair and is a Lewis base It can donate to compounds that will accept electrons Ammonia donating to an electron acceptor or Lewis acid Not all compounds can act as a Lewis base For example methane CH has all of its valence electrons in bonding pairs These bonding pairs are too stable to donate under normal conditions therefore methane is not a Lewis base Neutral boron compounds also have all electrons in bonding pairs For example borane BH has no lone pairs all its valence electrons are in bonds Boron compounds are not typically Lewis bases Figure Carbon and boron compounds with all sigma bonds do not have lone pairs and do not act as Lewis bases Exercise Which of the following compounds would you expect to be Lewis bases a SiH b AlH c PH d SH e SH Answer a No silicon has valence electrons like carbon and all are involved in sigma bonds b No aluminum has valence electrons and all are involved in sigma bonds c Yes phosphorus has valence electrons so there is one lone pair available d Yes sulfur has valence electrons so there are two lone pairs available e Yes this ion has lone pairs available Lewis AcidBase Complexes What happens when a Lewis base donates a pair of electrons to a Lewis acid The electron pushing formalism arrows we have been using to illustrate the behavior of Lewis acids and Lewis bases is meant to show the direction of electron movement from the donor to the acceptor However given that a bond can be thought of as a pair of electrons that are shared between two atoms in this case between the donor and the acceptor these arrows also show where bonds are forming Figure Donation of electrons from a Lewis base to a Lewis acid The electrons donated from a Lewis base to a Lewis acid form a new bond A new larger compound is formed from the smaller Lewis acid and Lewis base This compound is called a Lewis acidbase complex A simple example of Lewis acidbase complexation involves ammonia and boron trifluoride The nitrogen atom has a lone pair and is an electron donor The boron has no octet and is an electron acceptor The two compounds can form a Lewis acidbase complex or a coordination complex together Figure Formation of a Lewis acidbase complex from ammonia and boron trifluoride When the nitrogen donates a pair of electrons to share with the boron the bond that forms is sometimes called a coordinate bond A coordinate bond is any covalent bond that arose because one atom brought a pair of its electrons and donated them to another In organic chemistry terminology the electron donor is called a nucleophile and the electron acceptor is called an electrophile Ammonia is a nucleophile and boron trifluoride is an electrophile Because Lewis bases are attracted to electrondeficient atoms and because positive charge is generally associated with the nucleus of an atom Lewis bases are sometimes refered to as nucleophiles Nucleophile means nucleusloving Because Lewis acids attract electron pairs Lewis acids are sometimes called electrophiles Electrophile means electronloving Exercise For the following reaction add curved arrows electron

and Attributions Objectives No objectives have been identified for this section Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below enzyme Study Notes This section is a brief but perhaps interesting overview of some of the key differences between reactions performed in the lab and those in living systems At this point do not concern yourself with memorizing large biological molecules and reactions The active site A critical element in the threedimensional structure of any enzyme is the presence of an active site which is a pocket usually located in the interior of the protein that serves as a docking point for the enzymes substrates substrate is the term that biochemists use for a reactant molecule in an enzymecatalyzed reaction It is inside the active site pocket that enzymatic catalysis occurs Shown below is an image of the glycolytic enzyme fructosebisphosphate aldolase with its substrate bound inside the active site pocket When the substrate binds to the active site a large number of noncovalent interactions form with the amino acid residues that line the active site The shape of the active site and the enzymesubstrate interactions that form as a result of substrate binding are specific to the substrateenzyme pair the active site has evolved to fit one particular substrate and to catalyze one particular reaction Other molecules do not fit in this active site nearly so well as fructose bisphosphate Here are two closeup views of the same active site pocket showing some of the specific hydrogenbonding interactions between the substrate and active site amino acids The first image below is a threedimensional rendering directly from the crystal structure data The substrate is shown in spacefilling style while the active site amino acids are shown in the ball and stick style Hydrogens are not shown The color scheme is grey for carbon red for oxygen blue for nitrogen and orange for phosphorus Below is a twodimensional picture of the substrate colored red surrounded by hydrogenbonding active site amino acids Notice that both main chain and side chain groups contribute to hydrogen bonding in this figure main chain Hbonding groups are colored blue and side chain Hbonding groups are colored green Looking at the last three images should give you some appreciation for the specific manner in which a substrate fits inside its active site Transition state stabilization One of the most important ways that an enzyme catalyzes any given reaction is through entropy reduction by bringing order to a disordered situation remember that entropy is a component of Gibbs Free Energy and thus a component of the activation energy Lets turn again to our previous example from section C of a biochemical nucleophilic substitution reaction the methylation of adenosine in DNA The reaction is shown below with nonreactive sections of the molecules depicted by variously shaped bubbles for the sake of simplicity In order for this reaction to occur the two substrates reactants must come into contact in precisely the right way If they are both floating around free in solution the likelihood of this occurring is very small the entropy of the system is simply too high In other words this reaction takes place very slowly without the help of a catalyst Heres where the enzymes active site pocket comes into play It is lined with various functional groups from the amino acid main and side chains and has a very specific threedimensional architecture that has evolved to bind to both of the substrates If the SAM molecule for example diffuses into the active site it can replace its favorable interactions with the surrounding water molecules with even more favorable new interactions with the functional groups lining the active site In a sense SAM is moving from one solvent water to another solvent the active site where many new energetically favorable interactions are possible Remember these new contacts between SAM and the active site groups are highly specific to SAM and SAM alone no other molecule can fit so well in this precise active site environment and thus no other molecule will be likely to give up its contacts to water and bind to the active site The second substrate also has a specific spot reserved in the active site Because in this case the second substrate is a small segment of a long DNA molecule the DNAbinding region of the active site is more of a groove than a pocket So now we have both substrates bound in the active site But they are not just bound in any random orientation they are specifically positioned relative to one another so that the nucleophilic nitrogen is held very close to the electrophilic carbon with a free path of attack What used to be a very disordered situation two reactants diffusing freely in solution is now a very highly ordered situation with everything set up for the reaction to proceed This is what is meant by entropy reduction the entropic component of the energy barrier has been lowered Looking a bit deeper though it is not really the noncovalent interaction between enzyme and substrate that are responsible for catalysis Remember all catalysts enzymes included accelerate reactions by lowering the energy of the transition state With this in mind it should make sense that the primary job of an enzyme is to maximize favorable interactions with the transition state not with the starting substrates This does not imply that enzymesubstrate interactions are not strong rather that enzymeTS interactions are far stronger often by several orders of magnitude Think about it this way if an enzyme were to bind to and stabilize its substrates more tightly than it bound to and stabilized the transition state it would actually slow down the reaction because it would be increasing the energy difference between starting state and transition state The enzyme has evolved to maximize favorable noncovalent interactions to the transition state in our example this is the state in which the nucleophilic nitrogen is already beginning to attack the electrophilic carbon and the carbonsulfur bond has already begun to break In many enzymatic reactions certain active site amino acid residues contribute to catalysis by increasing the reactivity of the substrates Often the catalytic role is that of acid andor base In our DNA methylation example the nucleophilic nitrogen is deprotonated by a nearby aspartate side chain as it begins its nucleophilic attack on the methyl group of SAM We will study nucleophilicity in greater detail in chapter but it should make intuitive sense that deprotonating the amine increases the electron density of the nitrogen making it more nucleophilic Notice also in the figure below that the main chain carbonyl of an active site proline forms a hydrogen bond with the amine which also has the effect of increasing the nitrogens electron density and thus its nucleophilicity Nucleic Acids Res How does our picture of enzyme catalysis apply to multistep reaction mechanisms Although the twostep nucleophilic substitution reaction between tertbutyl chloride and hydroxide section C is not a biologically relevant process lets pretend just for the sake of illustration that there is a hypothetical enzyme that catalyzes this reaction The same basic principles apply here the enzyme binds best to the transition state But therein lies the problem there are two transition states To which TS does the enzyme maximize its contacts Recall that the first step the loss of the chloride leaving group to form the carbocation intermediate is the slower ratelimiting step It is this step that our hypothetical enzyme needs to accelerate if it wants to accelerate the overall reaction and it is thus the energy of TS that needs to be lowered By Hammonds postulate we also know that the intermediate I is a close approximation of TS So the enzyme by stabilizing the intermediate will also stabilize TS as well as TS and thereby accelerate the reaction If you read scientific papers about enzyme mechanisms you will often see researchers discussing how an enzyme stabilizes a reaction intermediate By virtue of Hammonds postulate they are at the same time talking about how the enzyme lowers the energy of the transition state An additional note although we have in this section been referring to SAM as a substrate of the DNA methylation reaction it is also often referred to as a coenzyme or cofactor These terms are used to describe small relative to protein and DNA biological organic molecules that bind specifically in the active site of an enzyme and help the enzyme to do its job In the case of SAM the job is methyl group donation In addition to SAM we will see many other examples of coenzymes in the coming chapters a number of which like ATP adenosine triphosphate coenzyme A thiamine and flavin you have probably heard of before The full structures

Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below carbene RC carbenoid SimmonsSmith reaction stereospecific Study Notes A carbenoid is best considered to be a reagent which while not actually a carbene behaves as if it were an intermediate of this type Dichlorocarbenes can also form cyclopropane structures and are created in situ from reagents such as chloroform and KOH The detailed mechanism of the formation of dichlorocarbene is given below Note that the deprotonation of chloroform generates the trichloromethanide anion which spontaneously expels the chloride anion The highly strained nature of cyclopropane compounds makes them very reactive and interesting synthetic targets Additionally cyclopropanes are present in numerous biological compounds One common method of cyclopropane synthesis is the reaction of carbenes with the double bond in alkenes or cycloalkenes Methylene HC is simplest carbene and in general carbenes have the formula RC Other species that will also react with alkenes to form cyclopropanes but do not follow the formula of carbenes are referred to as carbenoids Introduction Carbenes were once only thought of as short lived intermediates The reactions of this section only deal with these short lived carbenes which are mostly prepared in situ in conjunction with the main reaction However there do exist so called persistent carbenes These persistent carbenes are stabilized by a variety of methods often including aromatic rings or transition metals In general a carbene is neutral and has valence electrons of which are non bonding These electrons can either occupy the same sp hybridized orbital to form a singlet carbene with paired electrons or two different sp orbitals to from a triplet carbene with unpaired electrons The chemistry of triplet and singlet carbenes is quite different but can be oversimplified to the statement singlet carbenes usually retain stereochemistry while triplet carbenes do not The carbenes discussed in this section are singlet and thus retain stereochemistry The reactivity of a singlet carbene is concerted and similar to that of electrophilic or nucleophilic addition although triplet carbenes react like biradicals explaining why sterochemistry is not retained The highly reactive nature of carbenes leads to very fast reactions in which the rate determining step is generally carbene formation Preparation of methylene The preparation of methylene starts with the yellow gas diazomethane CHN Diazomethane can be exposed to light heat or copper to facilitate the loss of nitrogen gas and the formation of the simplest carbene methylene The process is driven by the formation of the nitrogen gas which is a very stable molecule Carbene reaction with alkenes A carbene such as methlyene will react with an alkene which will break the double bond and result with a cyclopropane The reaction will usually leave stereochemistry of the double bond unchanged As stated before carbenes are generally formed along with the main reaction hence the starting material is diazomethane not methylene In the above case cisbutene is converted to cisdimethylcyclopropane Likewise below the trans configuration is maintained Additional Types of Carbenes and Carbenoids In addition to the general carbene with formula RC there exist a number of other compounds that behave in much the same way as carbenes in the synthesis of cyclopropane Halogenated carbenes are formed from halomethanes An example is dicholorcarbene ClC These halogenated carbenes will form cyclopropanes in the same manner as methylene but with the interesting presence of two halogen atoms in place of the hydrogen atoms Carbenoids are substances that form cyclopropanes like carbenes but are not technically carbenes One common example is the stereospecific SimmonSmith reaction which utilizes the carbenoid ICHZnI The carbenoid is formed in situ via the mixing of a ZnCu couple with CHISince this reacts

methylene could be used as the carbene or carbenoid The halogenated carbene will react the same as methylene yielding cisdichlorodimethylcyclopropane This is a SimmonsSmith reaction which uses the carbenoid formed by the CHI and ZuCu The reaction results in the same product as if methylene was used and retains stereospecificity Iodine metal and the ZnCu are not part of the product The product is transethylmethylcyclopropane References Vollhardt K Peter C and Schore Neil E Organic Chemistry Structure and Function New York Bleyer Brennan AbdelWahab AboelMagd A Ahmed Saleh A and Dürr Heinz

reagents for halogenation of alkenes Introduction As the halogen molecule for example Br approaches the double bond of an alkene electrons in the double bond repel electrons in the bromine molecule causing polarization of the halogen bond This interaction induces a dipole moment in the halogen molecule bond allowing one of the halogens to gain a partial positive charge and take the role of electrophile The nucleophilic pi electrons form a bond to the electrophilic halogen while the halogen molecular bond heterolytically breaks to release bromide as a leaving group The halogen addition is not regioselective but stereoselective Stereochemistry of this addition is analogous to the oxymercuration mechanism In this reaction a bromonium halogenium ion froms as the intermediate The bromonium ion formation stabilizes the positive charge and prevents carbocation rearrangement In the second step the bromide released from the first step takes the role of thenucleophile and reacts with the cyclic bromonium ion with back side orientation Therefore the stereochemistry of the product is a vicinial dihalides through antiaddition Halogens that are commonly used in this type of the reaction are Br and Cl In thermodynamical terms I is too slow for this reaction because of the size of its atom and F is too vigorous and explosive Solvents that are used for this type of electrophilic halogenation are inert eg CCl can be used in this reaction Because halogen with negative charge can attack any carbon from the opposite side of the cycle it creates a mixture of steric productsOptically inactive starting material produce optically inactive achiral products meso or a racemic mixture Electrophilic addition mechanism consists of two steps Before constructing the mechanism let us summarize conditions for this reaction We will use Br in our example for halogenation of ethylene Halogens can act as electrophiles due to polarizability of their covalent bond Addition of halogens is stereospecific and produces vicinial dihalides with antiaddition Cis starting materials will give a mixture of enantiomers and trans starting materials produce a meso compound Nucleophile pi electrons of alkene double bond Electrophile halogen Cl or Br Regiochemistry none Stereochemistry antiadditon Step The addition the BrBr bond polarizes heterolytic cleavage occurs and Br with the positive charge forms a intermediate cycle with the double bond Step The bromide anion reacts with either carbon of the bridged bromonium ion from the back side of the ring The ring opens up and the two halogens are in the antiposition relative to each other Exercise What is the mechanism of adding Cl to the cyclohexene A reaction of Br molecule in an inert solvent with alkene follows

productsspecify the reagents for EAR of hydrohalic acids HX with symmetrical alkenes This section looks at the reaction of symmetrical alkenes like ethene butene or cyclohexene with hydrogen halides such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide Since these alkenes have identical groups attached to each end of the carboncarbon double bond regioselectivity does not apply Addition to symmetrical alkenes All alkenes undergo addition reactions with the hydrogen halides A hydrogen atom joins to one of the carbon atoms originally in the double bond and a halogen atom to the other For example with ethene and hydrogen chloride you get chloroethane With butene you get chlorobutane What happens if you add the hydrogen to the carbon atom at the righthand end of the double bond and the chlorine to the lefthand end You would still have the same product The chlorine would be on a carbon atom next to the end of the chain you would simply have drawn the molecule flipped over in space That would be different of the alkene was unsymmetrical thats why we have to look at them separately Mechanism The addition of hydrogen halides is one of the easiest electrophilic addition reactions because it uses the simplest electrophile the proton Hydrogen halides provide both a electrophile proton and a nucleophile halide First the electrophile will attack the double bond and take up a set of π electrons attaching it to the molecule This is basically the reverse of the last step in the E reaction deprotonation step The resulting molecule will have a single carbon carbon bond with a positive charge on one of them carbocation The next step is when the nucleophile halide bonds to the carbocation producing a new molecule with both the original hydrogen and halide attached to the organic reactant The second step will only occur if a good nucleophile is used Mechanism of Electrophilic Addition of Hydrogen Chloride to Butene All of the halides HBr HCl HI HF can participate in this reaction and add on in the same manner Although different halides do have different rates of reaction due to the HX bond getting weaker as X gets larger poor overlap of orbitalss Reaction rates Variation of rates when you change the halogen Reaction rates increase in the order HF HCl HBr HI Hydrogen fluoride reacts much more slowly than the other three and is normally ignored in talking about these reactions When the hydrogen halides react with alkenes the hydrogenhalogen bond has to be broken The bond strength falls as you go from HF to HI and the hydrogenfluorine bond is particularly strong Because it is difficult to break the bond between the hydrogen and the fluorine the addition of HF is bound to be slow Variation of rates when you change the alkene This applies to unsymmetrical alkenes as well as to symmetrical ones For simplicity the examples given below are all symmetrical ones but they dont have to be Reaction rates increase as the alkene gets more complicated in the sense of the number of alkyl groups such as methyl groups attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond For example There are two ways of looking at the reasons for this both of which need you to know about the mechanism for the reactions Alkenes react because the electrons in the pi bond attract things with any degree of positive charge Anything which increases the electron density around the double bond will help this Alkyl groups have a tendency to push electrons away from themselves towards the double bond The more alkyl groups you have the more negative the area around the double bonds becomes The more negatively charged that region becomes the more it will attract molecules like hydrogen chloride The more important reason though lies in the stability of the intermediate ion formed during the reaction The three examples given above produce these carbocations carbonium ions at the halfway stage of the reaction The stability of the intermediate ions governs the activation energy for the reaction As you go towards the more complicated alkenes the activation energy for the reaction falls That means that the reactions become faster Exercise Draw the bondline structures for the

permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions In recent years great progress has been made in quantummechanical calculations of the properties of small organic molecules by socalled ab initio methods which means calculations from basic physical theory using only fundamental constants without calibration from known molecular constants Calculations that are calibrated by one or more known properties and then used to compute other properties are called semiempirical calculations It should be made clear that there is no single unique ab initio method Rather there is a multitude of approaches all directed toward obtaining useful approximations to mathematical problems for which no solution in closed form is known or foreseeable The calculations are formidable because account must be taken of several factors the attractive forces between the electrons and the nuclei the interelectronic repulsions between individual electrons the internuclear repulsions and the electron spins The success of any given ab initio method usually is judged by how well it reproduces known molecular properties with considerable premium for use of tolerable amounts of computer time Unfortunately many ab initio calculations do not start from a readily visualized physical model and hence give numbers that although agreeing well with experiment cannot be used to enhance ones qualitative understanding of chemical bonding To be sure this should not be regarded as a necessary condition for making calculations But it also must be recognized that the whole qualitative orbital and hybridization approach to chemical bonding presented in this chapter was evolved from mathematical models used as starting points for early ab initio and semiempirical calculations The success of any given ab initio method is judged by how well it reproduces known molecular properties The efforts of many chemical theorists now are being directed to making calculations that could lead to useful new qualitative concepts of bonding capable of increasing our ability to predict the properties of complex molecules One very successful ab initio procedure called the generalized valencebond GVB method avoids specific hybridization assignments for the orbitals and calculates an optimum set of orbitals to give the most stable possible electronic configuration for the specified positions of the atomic nuclei Each chemical bond in the GVB method involves two electrons with paired spins in two more or less localized atomic orbitals one on each atom Thus the bonds correspond rather closely to the qualitative formulations used previously in this chapter for example Figure The generalized valencebond GVB method avoids specific hybridization assignments for the orbitals and calculates an optimum set of orbitals to give the most stable possible electronic configuration for the specified positions of the atomic nuclei Electronamplitude contour diagrams of the GVB orbitals for ethene are shown in Figure Let us be clear about what these contour lines represent They are lines of equal electron amplitude analogous to topological maps for which contour lines are equalaltitude lines The electron amplitudes shown are those calculated in the planes containing the nuclei whose positions are shown with crosses In general the amplitudes decrease with distance from the nucleus The regions of equalelectron amplitude for like orbitals middleright of Figure surround the nuclei as a set of concentric shells corresponding to the surfaces of the layers of an onion Figure With the like orbitals the amplitude is zero at the nucleus of the atom to which the orbital belongs Figure Generalized valencebond orbitals calculated for ethene by the ab initio method The nuclei are located in the plane of the coordinate system at the positions indicated by crosses The long dashes correspond to locations of change of phase The dotted lines are contour lines of electron amplitude of opposite phase to the solid lines Top shows both bonding carbon orbitals almost middleleft is the carbon orbital and middleright the hydrogen orbital of one of the bonds and bottom represents a side view of the orbitals in perpendicular section to the plane Drawings furnished by Dr W A Goddard III The physical significance of electron amplitude is that its square corresponds to the electron density a matter that we will discuss further in Chapter The amplitude can be either positive or negative but its square the electron density is positive and this is the physical property that can be measured by appropriate experiments Looking down on ethene we see at the top of Figure two identical bonding orbitals one on each carbon directed toward each other The long dashed lines divide the space around the atom into regions of opposite orbital phase solid is positive and dotted is negative The contours for one of the bonding orbitals are in the middle of the figure and you will see that the orbital centered on the hydrogen is very much like an orbital while the one on the carbon is a hybrid orbital with considerable character There are three other similar sets of orbitals for the other ethene bonds When we look at the molecule edgewise perpendicular to the bond we see the contours of the individual essentially type orbitals for bonding Ethyne shows two sets of these orbitals as expected Figure Representation of an onion with a quarter cut away The edges of the layers on the cut horizontal surface correspond to the electronamplitude contours shown in Figure What is the difference between the GVB orbitals and the ordinary hybrid orbitals we have discussed previously in this chapter Consider the like orbitals upper part of Figure and the hybrids shown in Figure The important point is that the hybrid in Figure is an atomic orbital calculated for a single electron on a single atom alone in space The GVB orbital is much more physically realistic because it is an orbital derived for a molecule with all of the nuclei and other electrons present Nonetheless the general shape of the GVB like orbitals will be seen to correspond rather closely to the simple orbital in Figure This should give us confidence in the qualitative use of our simple atomicorbital models Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park

C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions The most definitive set of organic nomenclature rules currently in use were evolved through several international conferences and are known as the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Rules IUPAC rules We first shall describe this system for naming the hydrocarbons known as alkanes the socalled saturated paraffin hydrocarbons that have no double or triple bonds or rings and conform to the general formula The alkanes are classified as continuous chain that is unbranched if all the carbon atoms in the chain are linked to no more than two other carbons or branched chain if one or more carbon atoms are linked to more than two other carbons The first four continuouschain hydrocarbons have nonsystematic names The higher members beginning with pentane are named systematically with a numerical prefix pent hex hept etc to denote the number of carbon atoms and with the ending ane to classify the compound as a paraffin hydrocarbon as in Table To specify a continuouschain hydrocarbon the prefix n for normal sometimes is used However in the absence of any qualifying prefix the hydrocarbon is considered to be normal or unbranched and we shall not use this prefix henceforth You should memorize the names up to The possibility of having branchedchain hydrocarbons that are structural isomers of the continuouschain hydrocarbons begins with butane The IUPAC rules for the systematic naming of these hydrocarbons follow The longest continuous chain of carbon atoms is taken as the parent hydrocarbon and is the framework on which the various substituent groups are attached Thus the hydrocarbon is a substituted pentane rather than a substituted butane because the longest chain has five carbons The substituent groups attached to the main chain are named by replacing the ending ane of the alkane by yl We then have the alkyl groups or alkyl radicals the simplest examples being the methyl and ethyl groups The parent hydrocarbon then is numbered starting from the end of the chain and the substituent groups are assigned numbers corresponding to their positions on the chain The direction of numbering is chosen to give the lowest numbers to the sidechain substituents Thus hydrocarbon is dimethylpentane rather than dimethylpentane The prefix di signifies that there are two identical substituents The prefixes used to designate the number of substituents follow up to ten Mono is not used to designate a single substituent in systematic nomenclature but may be used in conversation for emphasis Where there are two identical substituents at one position as in numbers are supplied for each and the prefix di tri and so on is included to signify the number of groups of the same kind Branchedchain substituent groups are given appropriate names by a simple extension of the system used for branchedchain hydrocarbons The longest chain of the substituent is numbered starting with the carbon attached directly to the parent hydrocarbon chain Parentheses are used to separate the numbering of the substituent and of the main hydrocarbon chain Additional examples of alkyl substituents and their names are listed in Table These are further classified according to whether they are primary secondary or tertiary An alkyl group is described as primary if the carbon at the point of attachment is bonded to only one other carbon as secondary if bonded to two other carbons and tertiary if bonded to three other carbons Thus if is any hydrocarbon radical the different kinds of alkyl groups are Confusion can arise here because we often refer to specific carbons rather than whole alkyl groups as primary secondary and so on In this context a carbon is primary if it is bonded to one other carbon secondary if bonded to two tertiary if bonded to three and quaternary if bonded to four Thus either carbon of ethane is primary the carbon in propane is secondary and the carbon of dimethylpropane is quaternary The situation with regard to naming alkyl substituents has been muddied considerably by the fact that the IUPAC rules allow use of trivial names for a few alkyl groups Thus secbutyl sometimes is used in place of methylpropyl and tertbutyl in place of dimethylethyl These and other examples are included in parentheses in Table Further oddball but less official customs are the prefix iso which is reserved for substituents with two methyl groups at the end of an otherwise straight chain eg isopropyl and the prefix neo which is used to denote three methyl groups at the end of a chain eg neopentyl which is more properly called dimethylpropyl Also in common use are the names isobutane and neopentane for the hydrocarbons methylpropane and dimethylpropane respectively There is no ambiguity involved in the use of iso and neo prefixes here but the practice of using the name isooctane for trimethylpentane is erroneous Fortunately use of these special names is declining When there are two or more different substituents present the question arises as to what order they should be cited in naming the compound The system adopted by IUPAC and long practiced by Chemical Abstracts cites them in alphabetical order without regard for whether there is a multiplying prefix such as di or tri Examples are given below When a hydrocarbon is substituted with other than alkyl groups a new problem arises which can be illustrated by This substance can be called either chloroethane or ethyl chloride and both names are used in conversation and in print almost interchangeably In the IUPAC system halogens nitro groups and a few other monovalent groups are considered to be substituent groups on hydrocarbons and are named as haloalkanes nitroalkanes and so on The alphabetical order of precedence is preferred for substituents of different types when two or more are attached to a hydrocarbon chain because this makes indexing and using indexes more straightforward The rest of this chapter is devoted to names of compounds we will not discuss for several chapters ahead and you may wish to stop at this point and return later as necessary However you should test your knowledge of alkane nomenclature by doing Exercises and Confusion is possible when the numbering from each end is similar The rule is that when the series of substituent locants are compared term by term the lowest series has the lowest number at the first point of difference The compound is trimethylhexane not trimethylhexane Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This

straightchain alkane or normal alkane Study Notes A series of compounds in which successive members differ from one another by a CH unit is called a homologous series Thus the series CH CH CH CnHn is an example of a homologous series It is important that you commit to memory the names of the first straightchain alkanes ie from CH to CH You will use these names repeatedly when you begin to learn how to derive the systematic names of a large variety of organic compounds You need not remember the number of isomers possible for alkanes containing more than seven carbon atoms Such information is available in reference books when it is needed When drawing isomers be careful not to deceive yourself into thinking that you can draw more isomers than you are supposed to be able to Remember that it is possible to draw each isomer in several different ways and you may inadvertently count the same isomer more than once Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of singlebonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups Alkanes are often called saturated hydrocarbons because they have the maximum possible number of hydrogens per carbon In Section thealkane molecule ethane was shown to contain a CC sigma bond By adding more CC sigma bond larger and more complexed alkanes can be formed Methane CH ethane CH and propane CH are the beginning of a series of compounds in which any two members in a sequence differ by one carbon atom and two hydrogen atomsnamely a CH unit Any family of compounds in which adjacent members differ from each other by a definite factor here a CH group is called a homologous series The members of such a series called homologs have properties that vary in a regular and predictable manner Figure The Three Simplest Alkanes Methane CH ethane CH and propane CH are the beginning of a series of compounds in which any two members in a sequence differ by one carbon atom and two hydrogen atomsnamely a CH unit Consider the series in Figure The sequence starts with CH and a CH unit is added in each step moving up the series Any family of compounds in which adjacent members differ from each other by a definite factor here a CH group is called a homologous series The members of such a series called homologs have properties that vary in a regular and predictable manner Figure Members of a Homologous Series Each succeeding formula incorporates one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms more than the previous formula The homologous series allows us to write a general formula for alkanes CnHn Using this formula we can write a molecular formula for any alkane with a given number of carbon atoms For example an alkane with eight carbon atoms has the molecular formula CH CH Molecular Formulas Alkanes are the simplest family of hydrocarbons compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only Alkanes only contain carbonhydrogen bonds and carboncarbon single bonds The first six alkanes are as follows Table Molecular formulas for small alkanes methane CH ethane CH propane CH butane CH pentane CH hexane CH You can work out the formula of any of the alkanes using the general formula CnHn Isomerism All of the alkanes containing or more carbon atoms show structural isomerism meaning that there are two or more different structural formulas that you can draw for each molecular formula Isomers from the Greek isos meros meaning made of the same parts are molecules that have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of the atoms in space Alkanes with carbons methane CH ethane CH and propane CH do not exist in isomeric forms because there is only one way to arrange the atoms in each formula so that each carbon atom has four bonds However CH has more than possible structure The four carbons can be drawn in a row to form butane or the can branch to form isobutane The two compounds have different propertiesfor example butane boils at C while isobutane boils at C butane isobutane Likewise the molecular formula CH has three possible isomer The compound at the far left is pentane because it has all five carbon atoms in a continuous chain The compound in the middle is isopentane like isobutane it has a one CH branch off the second carbon atom of the continuous chain The compound at the far right discovered after the other two was named neopentane from the Greek neos meaning new Although all three have the same molecular formula they have different properties including boiling points pentane C isopentane C and neopentane C pentane isopentane neopentane Of the structures show above butane and pentane are called normal alkanes or straightchain alkanes indicating that all contain a single continuous chain of carbon atoms and can be represented by a projection formula whose carbon atoms are in a straight line The other structures isobutane isopentane and neopentane are called called branchedchain alkanes As the number of carbons in an akane increases the number of possible isomers also increases as shown in the table below Table Number of isomers for hydrocarbons Molecular Formula Number of Structural Isomers CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH CH Akanes can be represented in many different ways The figure below shows some of the different ways straightchain butane can be represented Most often chemists refer to butane by the condensed structure CHCHCHCH or nCH where n denotes a normal straight alkane Note that many of these structures only imply bonding connections and do not indicate any particular geometry The bottom two structures referred to as ball and stick and space filling do show D geometry for butane Because the fourcarbon chain in butane may be bent in various ways the groups can rotate freely about the CC bonds However this rotation does not change the identity of the compound It is important to realize that bending a chain does not change the identity of the compound all of the following represent the same compound butane The nomenclature of straight alkanes is based on the number of carbon atoms they contain The number of carbons are indicated by a prefix and the suffix ane is added to indicate the molecules is an alkane The prefix for three carbons is prop so adding ane the IUPAC name for CH is propane Likewise the prefix for six is hex so the name for the straight chain isomer of CH is called hexane The first ten prefixes should

Addition to unsymmetrical alkenes In terms of reaction conditions and the factors affecting the rates of the reaction there is no difference whatsoever between these alkenes and the symmetrical ones

be regioselective Say three reactions could occur between the hypothetical reactants A and B under the same conditions giving the constitutionally isomeric products C D and E There are two possibilities The three products form in equal amounts ie of the total product is C another D the remaining E These percentages are called relative yields of the products If this is what is observed the overall reaction between A and B is not regioselective One product forms in greater amounts than the others Say for example the relative yields of C D and E are and respectively If this is what is observed the overall reaction between A and B is regioselective eg Experimentally is the major product is the minor product Thus the overall reaction between and HBr is regioselective toward If more than one reaction could occur between a set of reactants under the same conditions giving products that are constitutional isomers and if only one product is observed the overall reaction is said to

Farmer Sonoma State University Jim Clark Chemguidecouk Gamini Gunawardena from the OChemPal site Utah Valley University Contributors and Attributions The openchain hydrocarbons with one double bond have the general formula and are called alkenes The carboncarbon double bond often is called an olefinic linkage and the alkenes designated as olefins oilformers These terms arose because the gaseous lowermolecularweight alkenes yield oily products on treatment with chlorine or bromine The term unsaturated hydrocarbon also is used again because these substances normally react with bromine and chlorine and are hence unsaturated with reference to reagents of this type also see Section I According to the IUPAC system for naming alkenes the longest continuous chain containing the double bond is given the name of the corresponding alkane with the ending ane changed to ene This chain then is numbered so that the position of the first carbon of the double bond is indicated by the lowest possible number A few very common alkenes also are called alkylenes by appending the suffix ene to the name of the hydrocarbon radical with the same carbon skeleton Examples are shown below with their alkylene names in parentheses We shall continue to use the IUPAC names whenever possible The hydrocarbon groups derived from alkenes have the suffix enyl as in alkenyl and numbering of the group starts with the carbon atom attached to the main chain A few alkenyl groups have trivial names that commonly are used in place of systematic names These are vinyl allyl and isopropenyl And again we shall avoid using these names except parenthetically Also hydrogen atoms that are bonded directly to the unsaturated carbon atoms of a double bond often are called vinyl hydrogens although the term alkenic hydrogens is more accurate and therefore preferable Cycloalkenes are named by the system used for the openchain alkenes except that numbering always is started at one of the carbons of the double bond and continued around the ring through the double bond so as to keep the index numbers as small as possible When a hydrocarbon group is doublebonded to a single carbon of a cycloalkane ring the suffix ylidene as in alkylidene is used Many compounds contain two or more double bonds and are known as alkadienes alkatrienes alkatetraenes and so on the suffix denoting the number of double bonds The location of each double bond is specified by appropriate numbers as illustrated below A further classification is used for the relationships of the double bonds to each other Thus alkadienes and similar substances are said to have cumulated double bonds Alkadienes and other compounds with alternating double and single bonds are said to have conjugated double bonds Compounds with double bonds that are neither cumulated nor conjugated are classified as having isolated doublebond systems Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic

alkenes using Molecular Orbital MO Theory and Orbital Hybridization Alkenes are a class of hydrocarbons ie containing only carbon and hydrogen They are unsaturated compounds with at least one carbontocarbon double bond The double bond makes alkenes more reactive than alkanes Olefin is another term used to describe alkenes The alkene group can also be called a vinyl group and the carbons sharing the double bond can be called vinyl carbons Alkenes Nomenclature of alkenes is covered in chapter Condensed structural formulas for the first eight alkenes are listed in Table along with some relevant physical propoerties Thus CHCH stands for The double bond is shared by the two carbon atoms and does not involve the hydrogen atoms although the condensed formula does not make this point obvious Note that the molecular formula for ethene is CH whereas that for ethane is CH Structure of Ethene the simplest alkene Ethene is not a very complicated molecule It is made up of four s hydrogen atoms and two s carbon atoms These carbon atoms already have four electrons but they each want to get four more so that they have a full eight in the valence shell Having eight valence electrons around carbon gives the atom itself the same electron configuration as neon a noble gas Carbon wants to have the same configuration as Neon because when it has eight valence electrons carbon is at its most stable lowest energy state it has all of the electrons that it wants so it is no longer reactive This forms a total of three bonds to each carbon atom giving them an hybridization Since the carbon atom is forming three sigma bonds instead of the four that it can it only needs to hybridize three of its outer orbitals instead of four It does this by using the electron and two of the electrons leaving the other unchanged This new orbital is called an hybrid because thats exactly what it is it is made from one s orbital and two p orbitals When atoms are an hybrid they have a trigonal planar structure These structures are very similar to a peace sign there is a central atom with three atoms around it all on one plane Trigonal planar molecules have an ideal bond angle of on each side The HCH bond angle is which is very close to the ideal of a carbon with hybridization The other two angles HCC are both Rigidity in Ethene There is rigidity in the ethene molecule due to the doublebonded carbons A double bond consists of one sigma bond formed by overlap of sp hybrid orbitals and one pi bond formed by overlap of parallel p orbitals In ethene there is no free rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond because these two carbons also share a bond A bond is only formed when there is adequate overlap between both top and bottom porbitals Free rotation the porbitals cause them to be from each other breaking the bond because there would be no overlap Since the bond is essential to the structure of ethene it must not break so there can be not free rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond The two carbon atoms of a double bond and the four atoms attached to them lie in a plane with bond angles of approximately as shownn in the figure below a The σbonded framework is formed by the overlap of two sets of singly occupied carbon sp hybrid orbitals and four singly occupied hydrogen s orbitals to form electronpair bonds This uses of the valence electrons to form a total of five σ bonds four CH bonds and one CC bond b One singly occupied unhybridized pz orbital remains on each carbon atom to form a carboncarbon π bond Note by convention in planar molecules the axis perpendicular to the molecular plane is the zaxis The first two alkenes in Table ethene and propene are most often called by their common namesethylene and propylene respectively Figure Ethylene is a major commercial chemical The US chemical industry produces about billion kilograms of ethylene annually more than any other synthetic organic chemical More than half of this ethylene goes into the manufacture of polyethylene one of the most familiar plastics Propylene is also an important industrial chemical It is converted to plastics isopropyl alcohol and a variety of other products

mechanisms for dehydration reactions predict the products and specify the reagents for alkene synthesis from alcohol dehydration reactions predict and explain the stereochemistry of E eliminations to form alkenes especially from cyclohexanes Dehydration of Alcohols to Yield Alkenes One way to synthesize alkenes is by dehydration of alcohols Alcohols undergo E or E mechanisms to lose water and form a double bond This mechanism is analogous to the alkyl halide mechanism The only difference is that hydroxide is a very poor leaving group so an extra step is required The hydroxyl group is protonated so that water is now the leaving group Therefore the dehydration reaction of alcohols to generate alkene proceeds by heating the alcohols in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid at high temperatures The required reaction temperature range decreases with increasing substitution of the hydroxycontaining carbon alcohols C alcohols C alcohols C If the reaction is not sufficiently heated the alcohols do not dehydrate to form alkenes but react with one another to form ethers eg the Williamson Ether Synthesis Mechanism for the Dehydration of Alcohols Different types of alcohols may dehydrate through a slightly different mechanism pathway However the general idea behind each dehydration reaction is that the OH group in the alcohol donates two electrons to H from the acid reagent to form an alkyloxonium ion This ion acts as a very good leaving group for either the E or E mechanism The deprotonated acid the conjugate base then reacts with one of the betahydrogens to form a double bond Primary Alcohols and the E Mechanism Primary alcohols undergo bimolecular elimination E mechanism while secondary and tertiary alcohols undergo unimolecular elimination E mechanism The relative reactivity of alcohols in dehydration reaction is ranked as the following Methanol primary secondary tertiary Primary alcohol dehydrates through the E mechanism Oxygen donates two electrons to a proton from sulfuric acid HSO forming an alkyloxonium ion The resulting conjugate base HSO approaches in an anticoplanar orientation relative to the leaving group and reacts with one adjacent hydrogen while the alkyloxonium ion simultaneously leaves in a concerted process making a double bond Secondary and Tertiary Alcohols and the E Mechanism Secondary and tertiary alcohols dehydrate through the E mechanism Similarly to the reaction above secondary and tertiary OH protonate to form alkyloxonium ions However the ion leaves first and forms a carbocation as the reaction intermediate The water molecule which is a stronger base than the HSO ion then abstracts a proton from an adjacent carbon forming a double bond For example in the mechanism below that the alkene formed depends on which proton is abstracted the red arrows show formation of the more substituted butene while the blue arrows show formation of the less substituted butene Recall the general rule that more substituted alkenes are more stable than less substituted alkenes and trans alkenes are more stable than cis alkenes Thereore the trans diastereomer of the butene product is most abundant The dehydration mechanism for a tertiary alcohol is analogous to that shown above for a secondary alcohol The E elimination of ºalcohols under relatively nonacidic conditions may be accomplished by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride POCl in pyridine This procedure is also effective with hindered ºalcohols but for unhindered and ºalcohols an SN chloride ion substitution of the chlorophosphate intermediate competes with elimination Examples of these and related reactions are given in the following figure The first equation shows the dehydration of a ºalcohol The predominance of the nonZaitsev product less substituted double bond is presumed due to steric hindrance of the methylene group hydrogen atoms which interferes with the approach of base at that site The second example shows two elimination procedures applied to the same ºalcohol The first uses the single step POCl method which works well in this case because SN substitution is retarded by steric hindrance The second method is another example in which an intermediate sulfonate ester confers halogenlike reactivity on an alcohol In every case the anionic leaving group is the conjugate base of a strong acid Carbocation Rearrangements and the E Mechanism Carbocation stability is always a driving force in E mechanisms It is important to evaluate the structure of all carbocation intermediates to look for the possibility of hydride or methyl shifts to form more stable carbocation intermediates Carbocation rearrangements are discussed more completely in chapter Exercise Draw the bondline structures

halide needed to synthesize a given alkyne determine whether or not the reaction of an acetylide ion with a given alkyl halide will result in substitution or elimination and draw the structure of the product formed in either case Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below alkylation Study Notes The alkylation of acetylide ions is important in organic synthesis because it is a reaction in which a new carboncarbon bond is formed hence it can be used when an organic chemist is trying to build a complicated molecule from much simpler starting materials The alkyl halide used in this reaction must be primary Thus if you were asked for a suitable synthesis of dimethylhexyne you would choose to attack iodoethane with the anion of dimethylbutyne rather than to attack iodomethylpropane with the anion of butyne The reasons will be made clear in Chapter Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of Acetylides Acetylide anions are strong bases and strong nucleophiles Therefore they are able to displace halides and other leaving groups in substitution reactions The product is a substituted alkyne Because the ion is a very strong base the substitution reaction is most efficient with methyl or primary halides without substitution near the reaction center Secondary tertiary or even bulky primary substrates will give elimination by the E mechanism Nucleophilic Addition of Acetylides to Carbonyls Acetylide anions will add to aldehydes and ketones to form alkoxides which upon protonation give propargyl alcohols With aldehydes and nonsymmetric

group isopropyl group secbutyl group isobutyl group tertbutyl group primary carbon secondary carbon tertiary carbon quaternary carbon Study Notes The differences among primary secondary tertiary and quaternary carbon atoms are explained in the following discussion A convenient way of memorizing this classification scheme is to remember that a primary carbon atom is attached directly to only one other carbon atom a secondary carbon atom is attached directly to two carbon atoms and so on The IUPAC system requires first that we have names for simple unbranched chains and second that we have names for simple alkyl groups that may be attached to the chains An alkyl group is formed by removing one hydrogen from the alkane chain The removal of this hydrogen results in a stem change from ane to yl to indicate an alkyl group The removal of a hydrogen from methane CH creates a methyl group CH Likewise the removal of a hydrogen from ethane CHCH creates an ethyl group CHCH The nomenclature pattern can continue to provide a series of straightchain alkyl groups from straight chain alkanes with a hydrogen removed from the end Note the letter R is used to designate a generic unspecified

the connection point of straightchain and branchedchain alkyl groups Although the modern nomenclature system discussed in the next section is preferred these older terms are still often used especially in solvents and reagents Thus an understanding of these prefixes is important to understanding organic chemistry Notice that the total number of carbons in the alkyl subsistent is still indicated with the prefix yl For methyl and ethyl alkyl groups there is only one possible connection point so connection prefixes are not necessary Starting with a three carbon alkyl group propyl the possibility of multiple connection points necessitates connection prefixes These prefixes are often abbreviated with a letter which is italicized Normal n The prefix n is used to indicate a connection at the end of a straightchain alkane This prefix is not commonly used to just indicate alkyl subsistent as discussed above However it is sometime used to indicate the connection of a functional group onto a straight alkane Iso i Starting with propyl alkyl groups there is the possibility of a connection other than the very end The prefix iso implies that the connection ends with a CHCH group Secondary Sec Starting with butyl straightchain alkyl groups there is the possibility of a connection on the second carbon from the end of the chain These alkyl groups are given the prfix Sec Tertiary tert or t Starting with four carbon alkyl groups there is an isomer which can have a connection endind with a CHC group These alkyl groups get the prefix t Example Using the naming system described above is often used to describe halogens which contain only a few carbons The halogen is shown as bonded to the connection point of the alkyl group Classification of carbon atoms Carbons have a special terminology to describe how many other carbons they are attached to This allows for an easy description of branching in alkanes Also we will find that the number of carbons attached to a given atom will have subtle effects on its chemistry Primary carbons o attached to one other C atom Secondary carbons o are attached to two other Cs Tertiary carbons o are attached to three other Cs Quaternary carbons o are attached to four Cs The figure below use the group R to represent an alkyl group of unspecified length R typically used to represent alkyl groups but an also represent a part of a molecule which is either unspecified or not germane to the discussion This terminology will be used repeatedly in organic chemistry to describe the number of carbons attached to a specific atom however the atom will not always a carbon Example Please indicate the the number of o o o and o carbons in the following molecule The molecule has six Primary carbons o The molecule has one Secondary

define and use in context the key terms below acetylide anion acidity order Study Notes An acetylide anion is an anion formed by removing the proton from the end carbon of a terminal alkyne An acidity orderis a list of compounds arranged in order of increasing or decreasing acidity The general ideas discussed in this section should already be familiar to you from your previous exposure to chemistry and from the review in Section A slightly different account of why terminal alkynes are stronger acids than are alkenes or alkanes is given below However the argument is still based on the differences between sp sp and sphybrid orbitals The carbons of a triple bond are sphybridized An sphybrid orbital has a s character and a p character whereas an sphybrid orbital is s and p and an sphybrid orbital is s and p The greater the s character of the orbital the closer the electrons are to the nucleus Thus in a CspceH bond the bonding electrons are closer to the carbon nucleus than they are in a CspceH bond In other words compared to a CspceH bond or a CspceH bond a CspceH bond is very slightly polar CδceHδ This slight polarity makes it easier for a base to remove a proton from a terminal alkyne than from a less polar or nonpolar alkene or alkane As you will appreciate the reaction between sodium amide and a terminal alkyne is an acidbase reaction The sodium acetylide product is of course a salt Terminal alkynes can also form salts with certain heavymetal cations notably silverI and copperI In the laboratory component of this course you will use the formation of an insoluble silver acetylide as a method for distinguishing terminal alkynes from alkenes and nonterminal alkynes Metal acetylides are explosive when dry They should be destroyed while still wet by warming with dilute nitric acid Acidity of Terminal Alkynes Formation of Acetylide Anions Terminal alkynes are much more acidic than most other hydrocarbons Removal of the proton leads to the formation of an acetylide anion RCC The origin of the enhanced acidity can be attributed to the stability of the acetylide anion which has the unpaired electrons in an sp hybridized orbital The stability results from occupying an orbital with a high degree of sorbital character There is a strong correlation between scharacter in the orbital containing the nonbonding electrons in the anion and the acidity of hydrocarbons The enhanced acidity with greater scharacter occurs despite the fact that the homolytic CH BDE is larger Table Akynes Compound Conjugate Base Hybridization s Character pKa CH BDE kJmol CHCH CHCH sp CHCH

able to give an example of a simple polar reaction eg a electrophilic addition identify the electrophile and nucleophile in a simple polar reaction Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below electrophilic addition carbocation Study Notes The curved arrows introduced in this section are used throughout the course to indicate the movement of electron pairs It takes practice for the beginning student to feel comfortable using these arrows Remember that the head of the arrow indicates where the electron pair moves to its tail shows where the electron pair comes from Chemists often refer to the use of curved arrows as electron pushing This page looks at the reaction of the carboncarbon double bond in alkenes such as ethene with hydrogen halides such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide Symmetrical alkenes like ethene or butene are dealt with first These are alkenes where identical groups are attached to each end of the carboncarbon double bond Addition to symmetrical alkenes All alkenes undergo addition reactions with the hydrogen halides A hydrogen atom joins to one of the carbon atoms originally in the double bond and a halogen atom to the other For example with ethene and hydrogen chloride you get chloroethane With butene you get chlorobutane What happens if you add the hydrogen to the carbon atom at the righthand end of the double bond and the chlorine to the lefthand end You would still have the same product The chlorine would be on a carbon atom next to the end of the chain you would simply have drawn the molecule flipped over in space That would be different of the alkene was unsymmetrical thats why we have to look at them separately Mechanism The addition of hydrogen halides is one of the easiest electrophilic addition reactions because it uses the simplest electrophile the proton Hydrogen halides provide both a electrophile proton and a nucleophile halide First the electrophile will attack the double bond and take up a set of pi electrons attaching it to the molecule This is basically the reverse of the last step in the E reaction deprotonation step The resulting molecule will have a single carboncarbon bond with a positive charge on one of them carbocation The next step is when the nucleophile halide bonds to the carbocation producing a new molecule with both the original hydrogen and halide attached to the organic reactant The second step will only occur if a good nucleophile is used Mechanism of Electrophilic Addition of Hydrogen Halide to Ethene Mechanism of Electrophilic Addition of Hydrogen Halide to Propene All of the halides HBr HCl HI HF can participate in this reaction and add on in the same manner Although different halides do have different rates of reaction due to the HX bond getting weaker as X gets larger poor overlap of orbitalss Reaction rates Variation of rates when you change the halogen Reaction rates increase in the order HF HCl HBr HI Hydrogen fluoride reacts much more slowly than the other three and is normally ignored in talking about these reactions When the hydrogen halides react with alkenes the hydrogenhalogen bond has to be broken The bond strength falls as you go from HF to HI and the hydrogenfluorine bond is particularly strong Because it is difficult to break the bond between the hydrogen and the fluorine the addition of HF is bound to be slow Variation of rates when you change the alkene This applies to unsymmetrical alkenes as well as to symmetrical ones For simplicity the examples given below are all symmetrical ones but they dont have to be Reaction rates increase as the alkene gets more complicated in the sense of the number of alkyl groups such as methyl groups attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond For example There are two ways of looking at the reasons for this both of which need you to know about the mechanism for the reactions Alkenes react because the electrons in the pi bond attract things with any degree of positive charge Anything which increases the electron density around the double bond will help this Alkyl groups have a tendency to push electrons away from themselves towards the double bond The more alkyl groups you have the more negative the area around the double bonds becomes The more negatively charged that region becomes the more it will attract molecules like hydrogen chloride The more important reason though lies in the stability of the intermediate ion formed during the reaction The three examples given above produce these carbocations carbonium ions at the halfway stage of the reaction The stability of the intermediate ions governs the activation energy for the reaction As you go towards the more complicated alkenes the activation energy for the reaction falls That means that the reactions become faster Addition to unsymmetrical alkenes In terms of reaction conditions and the factors affecting the rates of the reaction there is no difference whatsoever between these alkenes and the symmetrical ones described above The problem comes with the orientation of the addition in other words which way around the hydrogen and the halogen add across the double bond Orientation of addition If HCl adds to an unsymmetrical alkene like propene there are two possible ways it could add However in practice there is only one major product This is in line with Markovnikovs Rule which says When a compound HX is added to an unsymmetrical alkene the hydrogen becomes attached to the carbon with the most hydrogens attached to it already In this case the hydrogen becomes attached to the CH group because the CH group has more hydrogens than the CH group Notice that only the hydrogens directly attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond count The ones in the CH group are totally irrelevant Exercises Supply the missing curved arrows in the equations given below Answers Questions Q Predict the product of

Objective use retrosynthetic analysis to design a multistep synthesis with correct regiochemistry and stereochemistry using the reactions studied to date Introduction The study of organic chemistry introduces students to a wide range of interrelated reactions Alkenes for example may be converted to structurally similar alkanes alcohols alkyl halides epoxides glycols and boranes cleaved to smaller aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids and enlarged by carbocation and radical additions as well as cycloadditions Most of these reactions are shown in the Alkene Reaction Map below All of

chemical transformation have been intentionally omitted so that this map can be used as a study tool The answers are provided at the end of this section as part of the exercises Simple MultiStep Syntheses A one or two step sequence of simple reactions is not that difficult to deduce For example the synthesis of mesohexanediol from hexyne can occur by more than one multistep pathway One approach would be to reduce the alkyne to cis or transhexene before undertaking glycol formation Permanaganate or osmium tetroxide hydroxylation of cishexene would form the desired meso isomer From transhexene it would be necessary to first epoxidize the alkene with a peracid followed by ring opening with acidic or basic hydrolysis Longer multistep syntheses require careful analysis and thought since many options need to be considered Like an expert chess player evaluating the long range pros and cons of potential moves the chemist must appraise the potential success of various possible reaction paths focusing on the scope and limitations constraining each of the individual reactions being employed The skill is acquired by practice experience and often trial and error Thinking it Through with Examples The following three examples illustrate strategies for developing multistep syntheses from the reactions studied in the first ten chapters of this text It is helpful to systematically look for structural changes beginning with the carbon chain and brainstorm relevant functional group conversion reactions Retrosynthesis is the approach of working backwards from the product to the starting material In the first example we are asked to synthesize butanol from acetylene The carbon chain doubles in size indicating an acetylide SN reaction with an alkyl halide Primary alcohol formation from an antiMarkovnikov alkene hydration reaction hydroborationoxidation is more likely than a substitution reaction Applying retrosynthesis we work backwards from the alcohol to the alkene to the alkyne from an acetylide reaction that initially builds the carbon chain RetroSynthesis Working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each transformation identified from the retrosynthesis The ethylbromide must also be derived from acetylene so multiple reaction pathways are combined as shown below In the second example we are asked to synthesize dibromobutane from acetylene Once again there is an increase in the carbon chain length indicating an acetylide SN reaction with an alkyl halide similar to the first example The hydrohalogenation can be subtle to discern because the hydrogen atoms are not shown in bondline structures Comparing the chemical formulas of butyne with dibromobutane there is a difference of two H atoms and two Br atoms indicating hydrohalogenation and not halogenation The addition of both bromine atoms to the same carbon atom also supports the idea that hydrohalogenation occurs on an alkyne and not an alkene The formation of the geminal dihalide also indicates hydrohalogenation instead of halogenatioin because halogenation produces vicinal dihalides With this insight the retrosynthesis indicates the following series of chemical transformations RetroSynthesis Working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each transformation In the third example we are asked to produce oxoheptanal from methylcyclohexane Counting the carbons the starting material and product both contain seven carbon atoms and there is a cleavage reaction of an alkene under reductive conditions One important missing aspect of this reaction is a good leaving group LG Alkanes are chemically quite boring We can burn them as fuel or perform freeradical halogenation to create alkyl halides with excellent leaving groups With these observations the following retrosynthesis is reasonable RetroSynthesis Working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each reaction For the initial freeradical halogenation of the alkane we have the option of chlorine Cl or bromine Br Because methylcyclohexane has several different classifications of carbons the selectivity of Br is more important than the faster reactivity of Cl An strong base with heat can be used for the second step to follow an E mechanism and form methylcyclohexene The aldhyde group on the final product indicates gentle oxidative cleavage by any of several reaction pathways These reactions can be combined in to the following multistep synthesis Reaction Maps to Build Functional Group Conversion Mastery After working through the examples above we can see how important it is to memorize all of the functional group reactions studied in the first ten chapters We can apply the knowledge of these reactions to the wisdom of multistep syntheses Please note The reagents for each

design a multistep synthesis to prepare a given product from a given starting material using any of the reactions introduced in the textbook up to this point Study Notes You should have noticed that some of the assigned problems have required that you string together a number of organic reactions to convert one organic compound to another when there is no single reaction to achieve this goal Such a string of reactions is called an organic synthesis One of the major objectives of this course is to assist you in designing such syntheses To achieve this objective you will need to have all of the reactions described in the course available in your memory You will need to recall some reactions much more frequently than others and the only way to master this objective is to practise The examples given in this chapter will be relatively simple but you will soon see that you can devise some quite sophisticated syntheses using a limited number of basic reactions The study of organic chemistry exposes a student to a wide range of interrelated reactions Alkenes for example may be converted to structurally similar alkanes alcohols alkyl halides epoxides glycols and boranes cleaved to smaller aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids and enlarged by carbocation and radical additions as well as cycloadditions All of these products may be transformed subsequently to a host of new compounds incorporating a wide variety of functional groups and thereby open to even further elaboration Consequently the logical conception of a multistep synthesis for the construction of a designated compound from a specified starting material becomes one of the most challenging problems that may be posed A one or two step sequence of simple reactions is not that difficult to deduce If for example one is asked to prepare mesohexanediol from hexyne most students realize it will be necessary to reduce the alkyne to cis or transhexene before undertaking glycol formation Permanaganate or osmium tetroxide hydroxylation of cishexene would form the desired meso isomer From transhexene it would be necessary to first epoxidize the alkene with a peracid followed by ring opening with hydroxide ion This example illustrates a common feature in synthesis often there is more than one effective procedure that leads to the desired product Longer multistep syntheses require careful analysis and thought since many options need to be considered Like an expert chess player evaluating the long range pros and cons of potential moves the chemist must appraise the potential success of various possible reaction paths focussing on the scope and limitations constraining each of the individual reactions being employed This can be a daunting task the skill for which is acquired by experience and often trial and error The three examples shown below are illustrative The first is a simple functional group conversion problem that may initially seem difficult It is often helpful to work such problems backwards starting from the product In this case it should be apparent that cyclohexanol may be substituted for cyclohexanone since the latter could then be made by a simple oxidation Also since cyclohexane and alkanes in general is relatively unreactive bromination or chlorination would seem to be an obvious first step At this point one is tempted to convert bromocyclohexane to cyclohexanol by an SN reaction with hydroxide ion This reaction would undoubtedly be accompanied by E elimination so it would be cleaner although one step longer to first make cyclohexene and then hydrate it by any of several methods eg oxymercuration and hydroboration including the one shown by clicking on the diagram Answer Plausible solutions for the second and third problem will also appear above at this point In problem the desired product has seven carbon atoms and the starting material has four Clearly two intermediates derived from the starting compound must be joined together and one carbon must be lost either before or after this bonding takes place The ºalcohol function in the product suggests formation by a Grignard addition to a ketone and isobutene appears to be a good precursor to each of these reactants as shown The reactant and product compounds in the third problem are isomers but some kind of bondbreaking and bondmaking sequence is clearly necessary for this structural change to occur One possible procedure is shown above Acidcatalyzed rearrangement of cyclohexene oxide followed by reduction might also serve The useful approach of working out syntheses starting from the target molecule and working backward toward simpler starting materials has been formalized by Prof E J Corey Harvard and termed retrosynthetic analysis In this procedure the target molecule is transformed progressively into simpler structures by disconnecting selected carboncarbon bonds These disconnections rest on transforms which are the reverse of plausible synthetic constructions Each simpler structure so generated becomes the starting point for further disconnections leading to a branched set of interrelated intermediates A retrosynthetic transform is depicted by the symbol as shown below for previous examples Once a complete analysis has been conducted the desired synthesis may be carried out by application of the reactions underlying the transforms The above diagram does not provide a complete set of transforms for these target compounds When a starting material is specified as in the above problems the proposed pathways must reflect that constraint Thus the methylpentanone and methylbutyrate ester options in example while entirely reasonable do not fit well with a tertbutanol start Likewise a cyclopentyl intermediate might provide an excellent route to the product in example but does not meet the specified conditions of the problem Retrosynthetic analysis is especially useful when considering relatively complex molecules without starting material constraints If it is conducted without bias unusual and intriguing possibilities sometimes appear Unfortunately molecular complexity composed of size functionality heteroatom incorporation cyclic connectivity and stereoisomerism generally leads to very large and extensively branched transform trees Computer assisted analysis has proven helpful but in the end the instincts and experience of the chemist play a critical role in arriving at a successful synthetic plan Some relatively simple examples most having starting material restrictions are provided below Exercises Questions Q

State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Contributors and Attributions The socalled aromatic hydrocarbons or arenes are cyclic unsaturated compounds that have such strikingly different chemical properties from conjugated alkenes polyenes that it is convenient to consider them as a separate class of hydrocarbon The simplest member is benzene which frequently is represented as a cyclic conjugated molecule of three single and three double carboncarbon bonds Actually all the carboncarbon bonds are equivalent see Chapter but it is convenient to represent the structure in the manner shown A variety of substituted benzenes are known that have one or more of the hydrogen atoms of the ring replaced with other atoms or groups In almost all of these compounds the special properties associated with the benzene nucleus are retained A few examples of benzenoid hydrocarbons follow and it will be noticed that the hydrocarbon substituents include alkyl alkenyl and alkynyl groups Many have trivial names indicated in parentheses The hydrocarbon group from benzene itself is called a phenyl group and often is abbreviated as or less preferably by the symbol Generally aryl groups are abbreviated as in contrast to alkyl groups for which we use Thus is a methylsubstituted arene whereas is an alkylsubstituted benzene When there are two or more substituents on a benzene ring position isomerism arises Thus there are three possible isomeric disubstituted benzene derivatives according to whether the substituents have the or relationship The isomers commonly are designated as ortho meta and para or o m and p for the and isomers respectively The actual symmetry of the benzene ring is such that only one disubstitution product is found despite the fact that two would be predicted if benzene had the cyclohexatriene structure When the benzene ring carries different substituents we shall cite them in alphabetical order disregarding multiplying prefixes and assign their positions on the ring with the lowest possible numbers Examples are The IUPAC nomenclature system for other types of compounds is given in Chapter and is based on the fundamental rules described in this chapter

constitutional structural isomers and stereoisomers geometric isomers Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below constitutional structural isomers stereoisomers Different types of isomers Vladsinger Conformational Isomers The CC single bonds in ethane propane and other alkanes are formed by the overlap of an sp hybrid orbital on one carbon atom with an sp hybrid orbital on another carbon atom forming a σ bond Each sp hybrid orbital is cylindrically symmetrical all crosssections are circles resulting in a carboncarbon single bond that is also cylindrically symmetrical about the CC axis Because rotation about the carboncarbon single bond can occur without changing the overlap of the sp hybrid orbitals there is no significant electronic energy barrier to rotation Consequently many different arrangements of the atoms are possible each corresponding to different degrees of rotation Differences in threedimensional structure resulting from rotation about a σ bond are called differences in conformation and each different arrangement is called a conformational isomer or conformer Structural Isomers Unlike conformational isomers which do not differ in connectivity structural isomers differ in connectivity as illustrated here for propanol and propanol Although these two alcohols have the same molecular formula CHO the position of the OH group differs which leads to differences in their physical and chemical properties In the conversion of one structural isomer to another at least one bond must be broken and reformed at a different position in the molecule Consider for example the following five structures represented by the formula CH Of these structures a and d represent the same compound as do b and c No bonds have been broken and reformed the molecules are simply rotated about a vertical axis Only threenpentane a and d methylbutane b and c and dimethylpropane eare structural isomers Because no bonds are broken in going from a to d or from b to c these alternative representations are not structural isomers The three structural isomerseither a or d either b or c and ehave distinct physical and chemical properties Stereoisomers Molecules with the same connectivity but different arrangements of the atoms in space are called stereoisomers There are two types of stereoisomers geometric and optical Geometric isomers differ in the relative positions of substituents in a rigid molecule Simple rotation about a CC σ bond in an alkene for example cannot occur because of the presence of the π bond The substituents are therefore rigidly locked into a particular spatial arrangement Thus a carboncarbon multiple bond or in some cases a ring prevents one geometric isomer from being readily converted to the other The members of an isomeric pair are identified as either cis or trans and interconversion between the two forms requires breaking and reforming one or more bonds Because their structural difference causes them to have different physical and chemical properties cis and trans isomers are actually two distinct chemical compounds Stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different arrangements of atoms in space Optical isomers are molecules whose structures are mirror images but cannot be superimposed on one another in any orientation Optical isomers have identical physical properties although their chemical properties may differ in asymmetric environments Molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are said to be chiral pronounced kyral from the Greek cheir meaning hand Examples of some familiar chiral objects are your hands feet and ears As shown in part a in Figure your left and right hands are nonsuperimposable mirror images Try putting your right shoe on your left footit just doesnt work An achiral object is one that can be superimposed on its mirror image as shown by the superimposed flasks in part b in Figure Figure Chiral and Achiral Objects a Objects that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are chiral such as the left and the right hand b The unmarked flask is achiral because it can be superimposed on its mirror image Most chiral organic molecules have at least one carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups as occurs in the bromochlorofluoromethane molecule shown in part a in Figure This carbon often designated by an asterisk in structural drawings is called a chiral center or asymmetric carbon atom If the bromine atom is replaced by another chlorine part b in Figure the molecule and its mirror image can now be superimposed by simple rotation Thus the carbon is no longer a chiral center Asymmetric carbon atoms are found in many naturally occurring molecules such as lactic acid which is present in milk and muscles and nicotine a component of tobacco A molecule and its nonsuperimposable mirror image are called enantiomers from the Greek enantiou meaning opposite Figure Comparison of Chiral and Achiral Molecules a Bromochlorofluoromethane is a chiral molecule whose stereocenter is designated with an asterisk Rotation of its mirror image does not generate the original

Introduction LEARNING objective recognize acids or bases Introduction In the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius proposed two specific classifications of compounds termed acids and bases When dissolved in an aqueous solution certain ions were released into the solution As defined by Arrhenius acidbase reactions are characterized by acids which dissociate in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions H and bases which form hydroxide OH ions Arrhenius received the lowest passing score for his doctoral thesis with these innovative ideas about acids and bases Ten years later he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his insights Acids are defined as a compound or element that releases hydrogen H ions into the solution mainly water In this reaction nitric acid HNO disassociates into hydrogen H and nitrate NO ions when dissolved in water Bases are defined as a compound or element that releases hydroxide OH ions into the solution In this reaction lithium hydroxide dissociates into lithium and hydroxide ions when dissolved in water One way to define a class of compounds is by describing the various characteristics its members have in common In the case of the compounds known as acids the common characteristics include a sour taste the ability to change the color of the vegetable dye litmus to red and the ability to dissolve certain metals and simultaneously produce hydrogen gas For the compounds called bases the common characteristics are a slippery texture a bitter taste and the ability to change the color of litmus to blue Acids and bases also react with each other to form compounds generally known as salts Although we include their tastes among the common characteristics of acids and bases we never advocate tasting an unknown chemical Chemists prefer however to have definitions for acids and bases in chemical terms The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius developed the first chemical definitions of acids and bases in the late s Arrhenius defined an acid as a compound that increases the concentration of hydrogen ion H in aqueous solution Many acids are simple compounds that release a hydrogen cation into solution when they dissolve Similarly Arrhenius defined a base as a compound that increases the concentration of hydroxide ion OH in aqueous solution Many bases are ionic compounds that have the hydroxide ion as their anion which is released when the base dissolves in water Table Formulas and Names for Some Acids and Bases Acids Bases Formula Name Formula Name HClaq hydrochloric acid NaOHaq sodium hydroxide HBraq hydrobromic acid KOHaq potassium hydroxide HIaq hydriodic acid MgOHaq magnesium hydroxide HSaq hydrosulfuric acid CaOHaq calcium hydroxide HCHOaq acetic acid NHaq ammonia HNOaq nitric acid HNOaq nitrous acid HSOaq sulfuric acid HSOaq sulfurous acid HClOaq chloric acid HClOaq perchloric acid HClOaq chlorous acid HPOaq phosphoric acid HPOaq phosphorous acid Many bases and their aqueous solutions are named using the normal rules of ionic compounds that were presented previously that is they are named as hydroxide compounds For example the base sodium hydroxide NaOH is both an ionic compound and an aqueous solution However aqueous solutions of acids have their own naming rules The names of binary acids compounds with hydrogen and one other element in their formula are based on the root of the name of the other element preceded by the prefix hydro and followed by the suffix ic acid Thus an aqueous solution of HCl designated HClaq is called hydrochloric acid HSaq is called hydrosulfuric acid and so forth Acids composed of more than two elements typically hydrogen and oxygen and some other element have names based on the name of the other element followed by the suffix ic acid or ous acid depending on the number of oxygen atoms in the acids formula Other prefixes like per and hypo also appear in the names for some acids Unfortunately there is no strict rule for the number of oxygen atoms that are associated with the ic acid suffix the names of these acids are best memorized Table lists some acids and bases and their names Note that acids have hydrogen written first as if it were the cation while most bases have the negative hydroxide ion if it appears in the formula written last The name oxygen comes from the Latin meaning acid producer because its discoverer Antoine Lavoisier thought it was the essential element in acids Lavoisier was wrong but it is too late to change the name now Example Name each substance HFaq SrOHaq Solution This acid has only two elements in its formula so its name includes the hydro prefix The stem of the other elements name fluorine is fluor and we must also include the ic acid ending Its name is hydrofluoric acid This base is named as an ionic compound between the strontium ion and the hydroxide ion strontium hydroxide Exercise Name each substance HSeaq BaOHaq Notice that one base listed in Table ammoniadoes not have hydroxide as part of its formula How does this compound increase the amount of hydroxide ion in aqueous solution Instead of dissociating into hydroxide ions ammonia molecules react with water molecules by taking a hydrogen ion from the water molecule to produce an ammonium ion and a hydroxide ion Because this reaction of ammonia with water causes an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions in solution ammonia satisfies the Arrhenius definition of a base Many other nitrogencontaining compounds are bases because they too react with water to produce hydroxide ions in aqueous solution References The energies of the hydrogenlike orbitals of various atoms were mentioned in Chapter and in particular we showed a diagram of the most stable state of a carbon atom Figure Transfer of one of the electrons to the orbital requires excitation of the atom to a higher energy state and this can be achieved by absorption of electromagnetic radiation of the proper wavelength The usual way that such excitation occurs is by absorption of a single quantum of radiant energy and we can say that the absorption of this amount of energy corresponds to excitation of the atom from the ground state with energy to an excited state of configuration and energy The difference in energy is related directly to the frequency or wavelength of the absorbed quantum of radiation by the equation in which is Plancks constant and is the velocity of light The relationship often is called the Bohr frequency condition For chemical reactions we usually express energy changes in For absorption of one quantum of radiation by each atom or each molecule in one mole the energy change is related to by As defined corresponds to one einstein of radiation What we have developed here is the idea of a spectroscopic change being related to a change in energy associated with the absorption of a quantum of energy Spectra are the result of searches for such absorptions over a range of wavelengths or frequencies If one determines and plots the degree of absorption by a monoatomic gas such as sodium vapor as a function of wavelength a series of very sharp absorption bands or lines are observed hence the name line spectra The lines are sharp because they correspond to specific changes in electronic configuration without complication from other possible energy changes See Section for discussion of the units of frequency and wavelength References John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following

Attributions A Alkanes Saturated compounds such as the alkanes and their derivatives which have normal tetrahedral angles for the bonds to carbon can be formulated readily in terms of atomic orbitals with bonds to carbon An example is shown in Figure which also shows how an atomicorbital model can be drawn in abbreviated style The lines in this drawing correspond to bonds and are labeled as with the overlapping orbitals of the bond or as with the overlapping orbitals of the bonds B Atoms with Unshared Electron Pairs Many important molecules such as ammonia water and hydrogen fluoride have atoms with unshared pairs of electrons If we formulate each of these molecules in such a way to minimize repulsions between like charges a basically tetrahedral arrangement will be expected because this will place the nuclei and electron pairs as widely separated as possible The water molecule could be formulated this way as in with the Figure Abbreviated atomicorbital model of ethane showing only the orbitals of the outershell electrons oxygen at the center of the tetrahedron The simple picture predicts that the bond angle should be tetrahedral But actually it is There are two schools of thought as to why the angle is One idea is that the repulsion model is too simple and has to be modified to take into account that the repulsion is more severe between pairs of unshared electrons than between electrons in bonding orbitals on the same atom This is because when a bond is formed between two nuclei the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons shrinks the orbitals available to the bonding electrons thereby reducing their electrostatic repulsion with other pairs The degree of repulsion between electron pairs diminishes in the sequence unshared pairs vs unshared pairs unshared pairs vs bonding pairs bonding pairs vs bonding pairs From this we expect that in water the angle will be less than tetrahedral because the larger repulsion between the two unshared pairs will tend to push the bonding pairs closer together A similar but smaller effect is expected for ammonia because now the repulsion is only between the one unshared pair and bonding pairs The ammonia angle is which is only slightly smaller than the tetrahedral value of The alternative point of view of why the bond angle of water is starts with the premise that in the simplest approximation the angle should be To see how this comes about let us compare with You will recall that to form two bonds to we had to promote an electron and change the electronic configuration to the valence configuration The situation with is different in that the oxygen ground state and valence state are the same This means we could form two Figure Overlap of the hydrogen orbitals with and orbitals centered on oxygen The orbitals are represented here with distorted shapes to make the drawing clearer equivalent bonds to oxygen using the and orbitals at an angle of Figure Now to explain why the bond angles are instead of we can say that the repulsion between the hydrogen nuclei is expected to widen the bond angle An argument in favor of this formulation is provided by the bond angle in which is This is much closer to the expected for bond orbitals and the hydrogens in would not be expected to repel each other as much as in because sulfur is a larger atom than oxygen Both ways of formulating the orbitals used in the bonding of water molecules are in current use Arguments can be advanced in favor of both Highly sophisticated quantummechanical calculations which we will say more about later suggest that oxygen in water molecules uses orbitals that are and in its bonds and furthermore that the unshared pairs are in equivalent hybrid orbitals not one pair as and the other as Each of the unshared electronpair orbitals of oxygen in water is calculated to be about and The results are hardly clearcut but the bonding orbitals are considerably closer to and than they are to We recommend that the bonding orbitals of nitrogen and oxygen be considered to be and the unshared pairs designated simply as An abbreviated atomic orbital model of methanol made on this basis is shown in Figure Figure Abbreviated atomicorbital model of methanol showing the orbitals of the outershell electrons only C Compounds with Double Bonds Recall from Chapter that bond angles in compounds with carboncarbon double bonds such as ethene are closer to than to the normal tetrahedral value of There are several way sin which a carboncarbon double bond can be formulated in terms of atomicorbital models One very popular approach is to consider that ethene has two hybridized carbons that form one carboncarbon bond and four carbonhydrogen bonds by overlap of the six orbitals as shown in Figure The remaining carboncarbon bond is formulated as arising from sidewise overlap of the two orbitals one on each carbon that are not utilized in making the hybrids Sidewise overlap of orbitals is called overlap to distinguish it from the endwise overlap of the type we have discussed previously Figure The resulting bond differs from the bond in that electron density is concentrated in the regions above and below the bond axis rather than along the bond axis Figure The formulation of ethene Formulations of ethene in this way suggests that it should be a planar molecule with angles of Ethene is indeed planar but its angles are found to be rather than the predicted for bonds An explanation of this discrepancy using further electronrepulsion arguments will be discussed later in the chapter Figure Schematic representation of overlap and overlap of orbitals The simple elegance of the sigma model of ethene should not be taken as proving that there actually are two different kinds of bonds between the carbons The representation of double bonds is not really unique Given hybridization of the carbons so there are bonds to the hydrogens it is possible to take the and orbitals used for the and bonds rehybridize them and so derive a new set of overlapping orbitals for the double bond These orbitals are called tau bonding orbitals and can be represented by two bananashaped orbitals between the carbons Figure The result is two completely equivalent bonds The model has the advantage of offering a striking parallel to ballandstick models whereas the model is of particular value as a basis for quantitative calculations as will be discussed in Chapter Figure Formulation of ethene with bonds Each orbital is considered to contain an electron pair Using the model of double bonds we conclude that the twisted configuration shown in Figure should not be very stable Here the orbitals are not in position to overlap effectively in the manner The favored configuration is expected to have the axes of the orbitals parallel Because considerable energy would have to be expended to break the double bond and to permit rotation about the remaining bond restricted rotation and stable cistrans isomers are expected Similar conclusions can be reached on the basis of the model of the double bond Figure Orientation of orbitals in twisted configuration of ethene D Compounds with Triple Bonds Ethyne is an organic compound that usually is formulated with hybrid bonds The carbonhydrogen framework is built up through overlap of two hybrid orbitals one from each carbon atom to form a bond and overlap of the remaining orbitals with the orbital of two hydrogens to form bonds The remaining two carboncarbon bonds result through sidewise overlap of the pure orbitals as shown in Figure This model fits well with the properties of the ethyne molecule being linear bond angles of Also the bonds in ethyne are different from those in ethene or ethane as judged by their stretching and bending frequencies in the Figure The formulation of ethyne infrared Chapter their bond energies Table and their acidities Section These differences in properties are in keeping with the different states of hybridization of the carbon orbitals that we have postulated for ethane ethene and ethyne E More on Hybrid Bond Orbitals and Molecular Geometry A summary of the directional character of the hybrid atomic orbitals discussed so far is given in Table By referring to this table it usually is possible to deduce the nature of the bonding orbitals for most organic compounds from the molecular geometry if this is known Thus a tetrahedral molecule with four attached ligands uses hybrid orbitals localized on atom a planar triangular molecule with three attached ligands at angles of is hybridized at atom a linear molecule with two ligands is hybridized at Applying the converse of these rules one should be able to predict molecular geometry by making reasonable assumptions as to the state of hybridization for each atom in the molecule Obviously in doing this we have to take account of unshared electron pairs Prediction is easy if unshared pairs are absent Thus four attached ligands as in or imply hybridization at the central atom and therefore a tetrahedral arrangement of ligands Three ligands as bonded to carbon in or to boron in imply hybridization for the central atom and a planar triangular arrangement if ligands Two ligands as in imply hybridization and linear geometry In many of our later discussions of organic reactions we will be concerned with cationic radical and anionic carbon species that are substitution products of and Because of the importance of these entities you should know how to formulate them and related substances such as with atomic orbitals Perhaps the most straightforward way is to start from and see what changes in the bonds we would expect as the result of the hypothetical processes and Methane is tetrahedral with carbon bonding orbitals Removal of gives which corresponds in electronic structure to and for the same reasons should have a pyramidal shape with nearly tetrahedral angles Removal of from to give with six bonding electrons suggests a change to bonding orbitals for the carbon and planar geometry with angles of The radical presents a special problem We can think of it as being formed by the loss of from by adding an electron to planar or by removing an electron from pyramidal We can formulate with orbitals for the bonds and the extra electron in a orbital or with orbitals for the bonds and the extra electron in an orbital The actual structure of has the hydrogens and carbons in a plane left Therefore it appears that the repulsions between the bonding electron pairs is greater than the repulsions between the extra electron and the bonding pairs The actual structure corresponds to the one in which the bonding pairs are as far apart as possible F More on Interelectronic Repulsion and Bond Angles Molecules of the type which have four identical ligands on the central atom and no unshared electrons on eg and are expected to be and are tetrahedral By the same reasoning three electron pairs around one atom should seek a planar arrangement with angles to minimize electron repulsion accordingly species of the type which have no unshared pairs on eg and have this geometry With only two electron pairs the preferred arrangement is linear The bond angles of compounds with multiple bonds can be explained similarly For example in ethene the four electrons of the double bond occupy the region in space between the two carbon nuclei The situation at either carbon is rather like the case except that one of the ligands now has a double complement of bonding electrons Therefore the carbon orbitals are expected to be directed in one plane to give bond angles that deviate somewhat from because of the high density of electrons in the multiple bond Thus the angle shrinks to whereas the angles open up to because repulsion between electrons in the bonds is greater than between electrons in the bonds Electronattracting power or electronegativity of the ligands also is important in determining bond angles Thus for compounds of the type in which is a more electronattracting group than carbon the bond is polarized in the sense and the carbon then should have some of the character of Thus the angles are expected to be greater than as in fact they are In chloromethane for example the angle is Also we can explain on the basis of electron repulsions why the bond angle in phosphine is less than that in ammonia and the bond angle in is less than that in The important point is that phosphorus and sulfur are larger atoms than nitrogen and oxygen This means than the and bond angles can be about without bringing the hydrogens and the bonding pairs as close together as they are in and where the bond angles are near to the tetrahedral value Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and

this section you should be able to write the groundstate electron configuration for each of the elements up to and including atomic number Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below groundstate electronic configuration Hunds rule Pauli exclusion principle aufbau principle The electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells Commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Electron Configurations The electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells Commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the

orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Before assigning the electrons of an atom into orbitals one must become familiar with the basic concepts of electron configurations Every element on the periodic table consists of atoms which are composed of protons neutrons and electrons Electrons exhibit a negative charge and are found around the nucleus of the atom in electron orbitals defined as the volume of space in which the electron can be found within probability The four different types of orbitals spd and f have different shapes and one orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons The p d and f orbitals have different sublevels thus can hold more electrons As stated the electron configuration of each element is unique to its position on the periodic table The energy level is determined by the period and the number of electrons is given by the atomic number of the element Orbitals on different energy levels are similar to each other but they occupy different areas in space The s orbital and s orbital both have the characteristics of an s orbital radial nodes spherical volume probabilities can only hold two electrons etc but as they are found in different energy levels they occupy different spaces around the nucleus Each orbital can be represented by specific blocks on the periodic table The sblock is the region of the alkali metals including helium Groups the dblock are the transition metals Groups to the pblock are the main group elements from Groups to and the fblock are the lanthanides and actinides series Figure The Periodic Table Using the periodic table to determine the electron configurations of atoms is key but also keep in mind that there are certain rules to follow when assigning electrons to different orbitals The periodic table is an incredibly helpful tool in writing electron configurations For more information on how electron configurations and the periodic table are linked visit the Connecting Electrons to the Periodic Table module Rules for Assigning Electron Orbitals Pauli Exclusion Principle The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers The first three n l and ml may be the same but the fourth quantum number must be different A single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons which must have opposing spins otherwise they would have the same four quantum numbers which is forbidden One electron is spin up ms and the other would spin down ms This tells us that each subshell has double the electrons per orbital The s subshell has orbital that can hold up to electrons the p subshell has orbitals that can hold up to electrons the d subshell has orbitals that hold up to electrons and the f subshell has orbitals with electrons Example Hydrogen and Helium The first three quantum numbers of an electron are n l ml Only two electrons can correspond to these which would be either ms or ms As we already know from our studies of quantum numbers and electron orbitals we can conclude that these four quantum numbers refer to the s subshell If only one of the ms values are given then we would have s denoting hydrogen if both are given we would have s denoting helium Visually this is be represented as As shown the s subshell can hold only two electrons and when filled the electrons have opposite spins Hunds Rule When assigning electrons in orbitals each electron will first fill all the orbitals with similar energy also referred to as degenerate before pairing with another electron in a halffilled orbital Atoms at ground states tend to have as many unpaired electrons as possible When visualizing this processes think about how electrons are exhibiting the same behavior as the same poles on a magnet would if they came into contact as the negatively charged electrons fill orbitals they first try to get as far as possible from each other before having to pair up Example Oxygen and Nitrogen If we look at the correct electron configuration of the Nitrogen Z atom a very important element in the biology of plants s s p We can clearly see that p orbitals are halffilled as there are three electrons and three p orbitals This is because Hunds Rule states that the three electrons in the p subshell will fill all the empty orbitals first before filling orbitals with electrons in them If we look at the element after nitrogen in the same period oxygen Z its electron configuration is s s p for an atom Oxygen has one more electron than nitrogen and as the orbitals are all half filled the electron must pair up Occupation of Orbitals Electrons fill orbitals in a way to minimize the energy of the atom Therefore the electrons in an atom fill the principal energy levels in order of increasing energy the electrons are getting farther from the nucleus The relative energy of the orbitals is shown in Figure Figure The relative potential energy of atomic orbitals The order of levels filled is then s s p s p s d p s d p s f d p s f d and p The general order in which orbitals are filled is depicted in Figure Subshells corresponding to each value of n are written from left to right on successive horizontal lines where each row represents a row in the periodic table The order in which the orbitals are filled is indicated by the diagonal lines running from the upper right to the lower left Accordingly the s orbital is filled prior to the d orbital because of shielding and penetration effects Consequently the electron configuration of potassium which begins the fourth period is Ars and the configuration of calcium is Ars Five d orbitals are filled by the next elements the transition metals followed by three p orbitals Notice that the last member of this row is the noble gas krypton Z Arsdp Kr which has filled s d and p orbitals The fifth row of the periodic table is essentially the same as the fourth except that the s d and p orbitals are filled sequentially Figure Predicting the Order in Which Orbitals Are Filled in Multielectron Atoms If you write the subshells for each value of the principal quantum number on successive lines the observed order in which they are filled is indicated by a series of diagonal lines running from the upper right to the lower left The Aufbau Process Aufbau comes from the German word aufbauen meaning to build When writing electron configurations orbitals are built up from atom to atom When writing the electron configuration for an atom orbitals are filled in order of increasing atomic number However there are some exceptions to this rule Example rd row elements Following the pattern across a period from B Z to Ne Z the number of electrons increases and the subshells are filled This example focuses on the p subshell which fills from boron to neon B Z configuration s s p C Z configurations s p N Z configurations s p O Z configurations s p F Z configurations s p Ne Z configurations s p The Number of Valence Electrons The number of valence electrons of an element can be determined by the periodic table group vertical column in which the element is categorized With the exception of groups the transition metals the units digit of the group number identifies how many valence electrons are associated with a neutral atom of an element listed under that particular column For example in group the units digit is and elements in this group have valence electrons Table Valence electrons derived from periodic table group Periodic table group Valence electrons Group alkali metals Group alkaline earth metals Groups transition metals The s shell is complete and cannot hold any more electrons Group boron group Group carbon group Group pnictogens Group chalcogens Group halogens Group noble gases The general method for counting valence electrons is generally not useful for transition metals Instead the modified d electron count method is used Except for helium which has only two valence electrons The electron configuration of an element is the arrangement of its electrons in its atomic orbitals By knowing the electron configuration of an element we can predict and explain a great deal of its chemistry Example Draw an orbital diagram and use it to derive the electron configuration of phosphorus Z What is its valence electron configuration Given atomic number Asked for orbital diagram and valence electron configuration for phosphorus Strategy Locate the nearest noble gas preceding phosphorus in the periodic table Then subtract its number of electrons from those in phosphorus to obtain the number of valence electrons in phosphorus Referring to Figure draw an orbital diagram to represent those valence orbitals Following Hunds rule place the valence electrons in the available orbitals beginning with the orbital that is lowest in energy Write the electron configuration from your orbital diagram Ignore the inner orbitals those that correspond to the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas and write the valence electron configuration for phosphorus Solution A Because phosphorus is in the third row of the periodic table we know that it has a Ne closed shell with electrons We begin by subtracting electrons from the in phosphorus B The additional five electrons are placed in the next available orbitals which Figure tells us are the s and p orbitals Because the s orbital is lower in energy than the p orbitals we fill it first Hunds rule tells us that the remaining three electrons will occupy the degenerate p orbitals separately but with their spins aligned The electron configuration is Nesp C We obtain the valence electron configuration by ignoring the inner orbitals which for phosphorus means that we ignore the Ne closed shell This gives a valenceelectron configuration of sp Exercise Draw an orbital diagram and use it to derive the electron configuration of chlorine Z What is its valence electron configuration Answer Nesp sp The sixth row of the periodic table will be different from the preceding two because the f orbitals which can hold electrons are filled between the s and the d orbitals The elements that contain f orbitals in their valence shell are the lanthanides When the p orbitals are finally filled we have reached the next and last known noble gas radon Z Xesfdp Rn In the last row the f orbitals are filled between the s and the d orbitals which gives the actinide elements Because the large number of protons makes their nuclei unstable all the actinides are radioactive Example Write the electron configuration of mercury Z showing all the inner orbitals Given atomic number Asked for complete electron configuration Strategy Using the orbital diagram in Figure and the periodic table as a guide fill the orbitals until all electrons have been placed Solution By placing the electrons in orbitals following the order shown in Figure and using the periodic table as a guide we obtain s row electrons sp row electrons sp row electrons sdp row electrons sdp row electrons row electrons After filling the first five rows we still have more electrons to accommodate According to Figure we need to fill the s electrons f electrons and d electrons orbitals The result is mercurys electron configuration sspspsdpsdpsfd Hg Xesfd with a filled d subshell a sfd valence shell configuration and a total of electrons You should always check to be sure that the total number of electrons equals the atomic number Summary Based on the Pauli principle and a knowledge of orbital energies obtained using hydrogenlike orbitals it is possible to construct the periodic table by filling up the available orbitals beginning with the lowestenergy orbitals the aufbau principle which gives rise to a particular arrangement of electrons for each element its electron configuration Hunds rule says that the lowestenergy arrangement of electrons is the one that places them in degenerate orbitals with their spins parallel For chemical purposes the most important electrons are those in the outermost principal shell the valence electrons Exercises Write the electron configuration for carbon and draw the orbital diagram How many valence electrons do Nitrogen Carbon and Chlorine have

order of increasing energy sketch the shapes of s and p orbitals Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below nodal plane node orbital quantum mechanics wave function For a refresher on quantum numbers view this text Atomic Orbitals An orbital is the quantum mechanical refinement of Bohrs orbit In contrast to his concept of a simple circular orbit with a fixed radius orbitals are mathematically derived regions of space with different probabilities of having an electron One way of representing electron probability distributions was illustrated in Figure for the s orbital of hydrogen Because Ψ gives the probability of finding an electron in a given volume of space such as a cubic picometer a plot of Ψ versus distance from the nucleus r is a plot of the probability density The s orbital is spherically symmetrical so the probability of finding a s electron at any given point depends only on its distance from the nucleus The probability density is greatest at r at the nucleus and decreases steadily with increasing distance At very large values of r the electron probability density is very small but not zero In contrast we can calculate the radial probability the probability of finding a s electron at a distance r from the nucleus by adding together the probabilities of an electron being at all points on a series of x spherical shells of radius r r r rx rx In effect we are dividing the atom into very thin concentric shells much like the layers of an onion part a in Figure and calculating the probability of finding an electron on each spherical shell Recall that the electron probability density is greatest at r part b in Figure so the density of dots is greatest for the smallest spherical shells in part a in Figure In contrast the surface area of each spherical shell is equal to πr which increases very rapidly with increasing r part c in Figure Because the surface area of the spherical shells increases more rapidly with increasing r than the electron probability density decreases the plot of radial probability has a maximum at a particular distance part d in Figure Most important when r is very small the surface area of a spherical shell is so small that the total probability of finding an electron close to the nucleus is very low at the nucleus the electron probability vanishes part d in Figure Figure Most Probable Radius for the Electron in the Ground State of the Hydrogen Atom a Imagine dividing the atoms total volume into very thin concentric shells as shown in the onion drawing b A plot of electron probability density Ψ versus r shows that the electron probability density is greatest at r and falls off smoothly with increasing r The density of the dots is therefore greatest in the innermost shells of the onion c The surface area of each shell given by πr increases rapidly with increasing r d If we count the number of dots in each spherical shell we obtain the total probability of finding the electron at a given value of r Because the surface area of each shell increases more rapidly with increasing r than the electron probability density decreases a plot of electron probability versus r the radial probability shows a peak This peak corresponds to the most probable radius for the electron pm which is exactly the radius predicted by Bohrs model of the hydrogen atom For the hydrogen atom the peak in the radial probability plot occurs at r Å pm which is exactly the radius calculated by Bohr for the n orbit Thus the most probable radius obtained from quantum mechanics is identical to the radius calculated by classical mechanics In Bohrs model however the electron was assumed to be at this distance of the time whereas in the quantum mechanical Schrödinger model it is at this distance only some of the time The difference between the two models is attributable to the wavelike behavior of the electron and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle Figure compares the electron probability densities for the hydrogen s s and s orbitals Note that all three are spherically symmetrical For the s and s orbitals however and for all other s orbitals as well the electron probability density does not fall off smoothly with increasing r Instead a series of minima and maxima are observed in the radial probability plots part c in Figure The minima correspond to spherical nodes regions of zero electron probability which alternate with spherical regions of nonzero electron probability Figure Probability Densities for the s s and s Orbitals of the Hydrogen Atom a The electron probability density in any plane that contains the nucleus is shown Note the presence of circular regions or nodes where the probability density is zero b Contour surfaces enclose of the electron probability which illustrates the different sizes of the s s and s orbitals The cutaway drawings give partial views of the internal spherical nodes The orange color corresponds to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is positive and the blue color corresponds to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is negative c In these plots of electron probability as a function of distance from the nucleus r in all directions radial probability the most probable radius increases as n increases but the s and s orbitals have regions of significant electron probability at small values of r s Orbitals Three things happen to s orbitals as n increases Figure They become larger extending farther from the nucleus They contain more nodes This is similar to a standing wave that has regions of significant amplitude separated by nodes points with zero amplitude For a given atom the s orbitals also become higher in energy as n increases because of their increased distance from the nucleus Orbitals are generally drawn as threedimensional surfaces that enclose of the electron density as was shown for the hydrogen s s and s orbitals in part b in Figure Although such drawings show the relative sizes of the orbitals they do not normally show the spherical nodes in the s and s orbitals because the spherical nodes lie inside the surface Fortunately the positions of the spherical nodes are not important for chemical bonding p Orbitals Only s orbitals are spherically symmetrical As the value of l increases the number of orbitals in a given subshell increases and the shapes of the orbitals become more complex Because the p subshell has l with three values of ml and there are three p orbitals Figure the colors correspond to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is positive orange and negative blue The electron probability distribution for one of the hydrogen p orbitals is shown in Figure Because this orbital has two lobes of electron density arranged along the z axis with an electron density of zero in the xy plane ie the xy plane is a nodal plane it is a pz orbital As shown in Figure the other two p orbitals have identical shapes but they lie along the x axis px and y axis py respectively Note that each p orbital has just one nodal plane In each case the phase of the wave function for each of the p orbitals is positive for the lobe that points along the positive axis and negative for the lobe that points along the negative axis It is important to emphasize that these signs correspond to the phase of the wave that describes the electron motion not to positive or negative charges Figure The Three Equivalent p Orbitals of the Hydrogen Atom The surfaces shown enclose of the total electron probability for the px py and pz orbitals Each orbital is oriented along the axis indicated by the subscript and a nodal plane that is perpendicular to that axis bisects each p orbital The phase of the wave function is positive orange in the region of space where x y or z is positive and negative blue where x y or z is negative Just as with the s orbitals the size and complexity of the p orbitals for any atom increase as the principal quantum number n increases The shapes of the probability surfaces of the p p and higherenergy p orbitals are however essentially the same as those shown in Figure The electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells Commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Exercises What Kind of orbital is show below Of s s or s which is furthest from the nucleus Of s s or s which is the lowest in energy What is

section you should be able to describe the basic structure of the atom Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below atomic number atomic weight electron mass number neutron proton The Nuclear Atom The precise physical nature of atoms finally emerged from a series of elegant experiments carried out between and The most notable of these achievements was Ernest Rutherfords famous alpharay scattering experiment which established that Almost all of the mass of an atom is contained within a tiny and therefore extremely dense nucleus which carries a positive electric charge whose value identifies each element and is known as the atomic number of the element Almost all of the volume of an atom consists of empty space in which electrons the fundamental carriers of negative electric charge reside The extremely small mass of the electron th the mass of the hydrogen nucleus causes it to behave as a quantum particle which means that its location at any moment cannot be specified the best we can do is describe its behavior in terms of the probability of its manifesting itself at any point in space It is common but somewhat misleading to describe the volume of space in which the electrons of an atom have a significant probability of being found as the electron cloud The latter has no definite outer boundary so neither does the atom The radius of an atom must be defined arbitrarily such as the boundary in which the electron can be found with probability Atomic radii are typically pm The nucleus is itself composed of two kinds of particles Protons are the carriers of positive electric charge in the nucleus the proton charge is exactly the same as the electron charge but of opposite sign This means that in any electrically neutral atom the number of protons in the nucleus often referred to as the nuclear charge is balanced by the same number of electrons outside the nucleus The other nuclear particle is the neutron As its name implies this particle carries no electrical charge Its mass is almost the same as that of the proton Most nuclei contain roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons so we can say that these two particles together account for almost all the mass of the atom Because the electrons of an atom are in contact with the outside world it is possible for one or more electrons to be lost or some new ones to be added The resulting electricallycharged atom is called an ion Atomic Number Z What single parameter uniquely characterizes the atom of a given element It is not the atoms relative mass as we will see in the section on isotopes below It is rather the number of protons in the nucleus which we call the atomic number and denote by the symbol Z Each proton carries an electric charge of so the atomic number also specifies the electric charge of the nucleus In the neutral atom the Z protons within the nucleus are balanced by Z electrons outside it Atomic numbers were first worked out in by Henry Moseley a young member of Rutherfords research group in Manchester Moseley searched for a measurable property of each element that increases linearly with atomic number He found this in a class of Xrays emitted by an element when it is bombarded with electrons The frequencies of these Xrays are unique to each element and they increase uniformly in successive elements Moseley found that the square roots of these frequencies give a straight line when plotted against Z this enabled him to sort the elements in order of increasing atomic number You can think of the atomic number as a kind of serial number of an element commencing at for hydrogen and increasing by one for each successive element The chemical name of the element and its symbol are uniquely tied to the atomic number thus the symbol Sr stands for strontium whose atoms all have Z Mass Number A The mass number equals the sum of the numbers of protons and the number of neutrons in the nucleus It is sometimes represented by the symbol so AZN in which is the atomic number and is the neutron number Elements To date about different elements have been discovered by definition each is chemically unique To understand why they are unique you need to understand the structure of the atom the fundamental individual particle of an element and the characteristics of its components Atoms consist of electrons protons and neutrons Although this is an oversimplification that ignores the other subatomic particles that have been discovered it is sufficient for discussion of chemical principles Some properties of these subatomic particles are summarized in Table which illustrates three important points Electrons and protons have electrical charges that are identical in magnitude but opposite in sign Relative charges of and are assigned to the electron and proton respectively Neutrons have approximately the same mass as protons but no charge They are electrically neutral The mass of a proton or a neutron is about times greater than the mass of an electron Protons and neutrons constitute the bulk of the mass of atoms The discovery of the electron and the proton was crucial to the development of the modern model of the atom and provides an excellent case study in the application of the scientific method In fact the elucidation of the atoms structure is one of the greatest detective stories in the history of science Table Properties of Subatomic Particles Particle Mass g Atomic Mass amu Electrical Charge coulombs Relative Charge electron proton neutron In most cases the symbols for the elements are derived directly from each elements name such as C for carbon U for uranium Ca for calcium and Po for polonium Elements have also been named for their properties such as radium Ra for its radioactivity for the native country of the scientists who discovered them polonium Po for Poland for eminent scientists curium Cm for the Curies for gods and goddesses selenium Se for the Greek goddess of the moon Selene and for other poetic or historical reasons Some of the symbols used for elements that have been known since antiquity are derived from historical names that are no longer in use only the symbols remain to indicate their origin Examples are Fe for iron from the Latin ferrum Na for sodium from the Latin natrium and W for tungsten from the German wolfram Examples are in

kalium from the Arabic alqili alkali silver Ag argentum Latin for silver sodium Na natrium Latin for sodium tin Sn stannum Latin for tin tungsten W wolfram German for wolf stone because it interfered with the smelting of tin and was thought to devour the tin Recall that the nuclei of most atoms contain neutrons as well as protons Unlike protons the number of neutrons is not absolutely fixed for most elements Atoms that have the same number of protons and hence the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes All isotopes of an element have the same number of protons and electrons which means they exhibit the same chemistry The isotopes of an element differ only in their atomic mass which is given by the mass number A the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons Carbon Isotopes The element carbon C has an atomic number of which means that all neutral carbon atoms contain protons and electrons In a typical sample of carboncontaining material of the carbon atoms also contain neutrons so each has a mass number of An isotope of any element can be uniquely represented as where X is the atomic symbol of the element The isotope of carbon that has neutrons is therefore The subscript indicating the atomic number is actually redundant because the atomic symbol already uniquely specifies Z Consequently is more often written as C which is read as carbon Nevertheless the value of Z is commonly included in the notation for nuclear reactions because these reactions involve changes in Z Figure Formalism used for identifying specific nuclide any particular kind of nucleus In addition to a typical sample of carbon contains C with neutrons and protons and a trace of C with neutrons and protons The nucleus of C is not stable however but undergoes a slow radioactive decay that is the basis of the carbon dating technique used in archaeology Many elements other than carbon have more than one stable isotope tin for example has isotopes

that govern its chemical and physical behavior Each atom of an element contains the same number of protons which is the atomic number Z Neutral atoms have the same number of electrons and protons Atoms of an element that contain different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes Each isotope of a given element has the same atomic number but a different mass number A which is the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons The relative masses of atoms are reported using the atomic mass unit amu which is defined as onetwelfth of the mass of one atom of carbon with protons neutrons and

Axial and Equatorial BondsAxial vs Equatorial Substituents ExercisesSolutionsQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to Draw the chair conformation of cyclohexane with axial and equatorial hydrogen atoms clearly shown and identified identify the axial and equatorial hydrogens in a given sketch of the cyclohexane molecule explain how chair conformations of cyclohexane and its derivatives can interconvert through the process of ring flip Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below axial position equatorial position ring flip Axial and Equatorial Positions in Cyclohexane Careful examination of the chair conformation of cyclohexane shows that the twelve hydrogens are not structurally equivalent Six of them are located about the periphery of the carbon ring and are termed equatorial The other six are oriented above and below the approximate plane of the ring three in each location and are termed axial because they are aligned parallel to the symmetry axis of the ring In the figure above the equatorial hydrogens are colored blue and the axial hydrogens are black Since there are two equivalent chair conformations of cyclohexane in rapid equilibrium all twelve hydrogens have equatorial and axial character How To Draw Axial and Equatorial Bonds How not to draw the chair Aside from drawing the basic chair the key points are Axial bonds alternate up and down and are shown vertical Equatorial groups are approximately horizontal but actually somewhat distorted from that slightly up or slightly down so that the angle from the axial group is a bit more than a right angle reflecting the common o bond angle Each carbon has an axial and an equatorial bond Each face of the cyclohexane ring has three axial and three equatorial bonds Each face alternates between axial and equatorial bonds Then looking at the up bond on each carbon in the cyclohexane ring they will alternate axialequatorialaxial ect When looking down at a cyclohexane ring the equatorial bonds will form an equator around the ring The axial bonds will either face towards you or away These will alternate with each axial bond The first axial bond will be coming towards with the next going away There will be three of each type Note The terms cis and trans in regards to the stereochemistry of a ring are not directly linked to the terms axial and equatorial It is very common to confuse the two It typically best not to try and directly inter convert the two naming systems Axial vs Equatorial Substituents When a substituent is added to cyclohexane the ring flip allows for two distinctly different conformations One will have the substituent in the axial position while the other will have the substituent in the equatorial position In the next section will discuss the energy differences between these two possible conformations Below are the two possible chair conformations of methylcyclohexane created by a ringflip Although the conformation which places the methyl group in the equatorial position is more stable by kJmol the energy provided by ambient temperature allows the two conformations to rapidly interconvert The figure below illustrates how to convert a molecular model of cyclohexane between two different chair conformations this is something that you should practice with models Notice that a ring flip causes equatorial groups to become axial and viceversa Example For the following please indicate if the substituents are in the axial or equatorial positions Solution Due to the large number of bonds in cyclohexane it is common to only draw in the relevant ones leaving off the hydrogens unless they are involved in a reaction or are important for analysis It is still possible to determine axial and equatorial positioning with some thought With problems such as this it is important to remember that each carbon in a cyclohexane ring has one axial and one equatorial bond Also remember that axial bonds are perpendicular with the ring and appear to be going either straight up or straight down Equatorial bonds will be roughly in the plane of the cyclohexane ring only slightly up or down Sometimes it is valuable to draw in the additional bonds on the carbons of interest With this it can be concluded that the bromine and chlorine substituents are attached in equatorial positions and the CH substituent is attached in an axial position Exercises Draw two conformations of cyclohexyl amine CHNH Indicate axial and equatorial

Organic Biomolecules There are a number of important biomolecules that could occur as enantiomers including amino acids and sugars In most cases only one enantiomer occurs although some fungi for example are able to produce mirrorimage forms of these compounds We will look later at some of these biomolecules but first we will look at a compound that occurs naturally in both enantiomeric forms Carvone is a secondary metabolite That means it is a naturallyoccurring compound that is not directly connected to the very basic functions of a cell such as selfreplication or the production of energy The role of secondary metabolites in nature is often difficult to determine However these compounds often play roles in selfdefense acting as deterrents against competitor species in a sort of smallscale chemical warfare scenario They are also frequently used in communications this role has been studied most extensively among insects which use lots of compounds to send information to each other The two naturallyoccurring enantiomers of carvone Carvone is produced in two enantiomeric forms One of these forms called carvone is found in mint leaves and it is a principal contributor to the distinctive odor of mint The other form carvone is found in caraway seeds This form has a very different smell and is typically used to flavor rye bread and other Eastern European foods Note that carvone is the same thing as Scarvone The designation is based on its positive optical rotation value which is experimentally measured The S designation is determined by the CahnIngoldPrelog rules for designating stereochemistry which deal with looking at the groups attached to a chiral center and assigning priority based on atomic number However carvones chiral center actually has three carbons attached to it they all have the same atomic number We need a new rule to break the tie If two substituent groups have the same atomic number go one bond further to the next atom If there is a difference among the second tier of atoms stop The group in which you have encountered a higher atomic number gets the highest priority If there is not a clear difference proceed one additional bond to the next set of atoms and so on until you find a difference In carvone this decision tree works as follows The chiral center is connected to a H a C a C and a C The H is lowest priority One C eventually leads to a CO However at the second bond from the chiral center this C is connected to a C and two Hs A second C is also part of the sixmembered ring but the CO is farther away in this direction At the second bond from the chiral center this C is connected to a C and two Hs just like the first one The third C is part of a little threecarbon group attached to the sixmembered ring At the second bond from the chiral center it is connected to only one H and has two bonds to another C this is counted as two bonds to C and one to H Those first two carbon groups are identical so far However the third group is different it has an extra bond to C whereas the others have an extra bond to H C has a higher atomic number than H so this group has higher priority The secondhighest priority is the branch that reaches the oxygen at the third bond from the chiral center Comparing atoms stepbystep to assign configuration How different exactly are these two compounds and carvone Are they completely different isomers with different physical properties In most ways the answer is no These two compounds have the same appearance colorless oil the same boiling point C the same refractive index and specific gravity However they have optical rotations that are almost exactly opposite values Two enantiomers have the same physical properties Enantiomers have opposite optical rotations Clearly they have different biological properties since they have slightly different odors they must fit into slightly different nasal receptors signaling to the brain whether the person next to you is chewing a stick of gum or a piece of rye bread This different shape complimentarity is not surprising just as it isnt surprising that a left hand only fits into a left handed baseball glove and not into a right handed one Thalidomide There are other reasons that we might concern ourselves with an understanding of enantiomers apart from dietary and olfactory preferences Perhaps the most dramatic example of the importance of enantiomers can be found in the case of thalidomide Thalidomide was a drug commonly prescribed during the s and s in order to alleviate nausea and other symptoms of morning sickness In fact only one enantiomer of thalidomide had any therapeutic effect in this regard The other enantiomer apart from being therapeutically useless in this application was subsequently found to be a teratogen meaning it produces pronounced birth defects This was obviously not a good thing to prescribe to pregnant women Workers in the pharmaceutical industry are now much more aware of these kinds of consequences although of course not all problems with drugs go undetected even through the extensive clinical trials required in the United States Since the era of thalidomide however a tremendous amount of research in the field of synthetic organic chemistry has been devoted to methods of producing only one enantiomer of a useful compound and not the other This effort probably represents the single biggest aim of synthetic organic chemistry through the last quarter century Enantiomers may have very different biological properties Obtaining enantiomerically pure compounds is very important in medicine and the pharmaceutical industry Exercises Draw the two enantiomeric forms of butanol CHCHOHCHCH Label their configurations Sometimes compounds have many chiral centers in them For the following compounds identify four chiral centers in each mark them with asterisks and identify each center as R or S configuration The following is the structure of dysinosin A a potent thrombin inhibitor that consequently prevents blood clotting Ginkgolide B below is a secondary metabolite of the ginkgo tree extracts of which are used in Chinese medicine Sanglifehrin A shown below is produced by a bacteria that may be found in the soil of coffee plantations in Malawi It is also a promising candidate for the treatment of organ transplant patients owing

University Radical mechanisms for flavindependent reactionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to discuss briefly some of the addition reactions that take place in nature and the role of enzymes in such processes Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below enzyme coenzyme Study Notes You need not memorize the reaction described in this section of the textbook However you should note how the names of enzymes are derived from the reactions they catalyze for example ascorbic acid oxidase is the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ascorbic acid vitamin C Radical mechanisms for flavindependent reactions Flavin coenzymes like their nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD counterparts can act as hydride acceptors and donors In these redox reactions two electrons are transferred together in the form of a hydride ion Flavin however is also capable of mediating chemical steps in which a single unpaired electron is transferred in other words radical chemistry This is due to the ability of the flavin system to form a stabilized radical intermediate called a semiquinone formed when FADH or FMNH donates a single electron or when FAD or FMN accepts a single electron This singleelectron transfer capability of flavins is critical to their metabolic role as the entry point of electrons into the electron transport phase of respiration Electrons harvested from the oxidation of fuel molecules are channeled one by one by FMNH into the electron transport chain where they eventually reduce molecular oxygen NADH is incapable of single electron transfer all it can do is transfer two electrons in the form of a hydride to FMN the regenerated FMNH is then able to continue sending single electrons into the transport chain You will learn more details about this process in a biochemistry class Because flavins are capable of singleelectron as well as twoelectron chemistry the relevant mechanisms of flavoenzymecatalyzed reactions are often more difficult to determine Recall the dehydrogenation reaction catalyzed by acylCoA dehydrogenase section C it involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons ie a hydrogen molecule to FAD Both electrons could be transferred together with the FAD coenzyme simply acting as a hydride acceptor this is the mechanism we considered previously However because the oxidizing coenzyme being used is FAD rather than NAD it is also possible that the reaction could proceed by a singleelectron radical intermediate process In the alternate radical mechanism proposed below for example the enolate intermediate first donates a single electron to FAD forming a radical semiquinone intermediate step The second electron is transferred when the semiquinone intermediate abstracts a hydrogen from Cb in a homolytic fashion step Scientists are still not sure which mechanism the hydride transfer mechanism that we saw in section B or the single electron transfer detailed above more accurately depicts what is going on in this reaction The conjugated elimination catalyzed by chorismate synthase section B is another example of a reaction where the participation of flavin throws doubt on the question of what is the relevant mechanism This could simply be a conjugated E reaction with formation of an allylic carbocation intermediate The question plaguing researchers studying this enzyme however is why FADH is required This is not a redox reaction and correspondingly FADH is not used up in the course of the transformation it just needs to be bound in the active site in order for the reaction to proceed Given that flavins generally participate in singleelectron chemistry this is an indication that radical intermediates may be involved Recently an alternative mechanism involving a flavin semiquinone intermediate has been proposed J Biol Chem Notice that a single electron is transferred from substrate to coenzyme in step then transferred back in step Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Enzymatic E and E reactions Learning Objective discuss enzymatic elimination reactions of histidine Enzymatic E and E reactions While most biochemical belimination reactions are of the Ecb type some enzymatic E and E reactions are known Like the enzymatic SN and SN substitution mechanisms discussed in chapters and the E and E models represent two possible mechanistic extremes and actual enzymatic elimination reactions may fall somewhere in between In an EE hybrid elimination for example CβX bond cleavage may be quite advanced but not complete before proton abstraction takes place this would lead to the buildup of transient partial positive charge on Cβ but a discreet carbocation intermediate would not form The extent to which partial positive charge builds up determines whether we refer to the mechanism as Elike or Elike A reaction in the histidine biosynthetic pathway provides a good example of a biological Elike elimination step were looking specifically here at the first enolforming step in the reaction below the second step is simply a tautomerization from the enol to the ketone product Notice in this mechanism that an Ecb elimination is not possible there is no electronwithdrawing group like a carbonyl to stabilize the carbanion intermediate that would form if the proton were abstracted first There is however an electrondonating group the lone pair on a nitrogen that can stabilize a positivelycharged intermediate that forms when the water leaves Another good example of a biological Elike reaction is the elimination of phosphate in the formation of enolpyruvylshikimatephosphate EPSP an intermediate in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids Experimental evidence indicates that significant positive charge probably builds up on Cβ of the starting compound implying that CO bond cleavage is advanced before proton abstraction occurs notice the parallels to the Cope elimination in the previous section The very next step in the aromatic acid biosynthesis pathway is also an elimination this time a conjugated elimination rather than a simple betaelimination An Elike mechanism as illustrated above has been proposed for this step but other evidence suggests that a freeradical mechanism may be involved While most E and E reactions involve proton abstraction eliminations can also incorporate a decarboxylation step Isopentenyl diphosphate the building block for all isoprenoid compounds is formed from a decarboxylationelimination

of Minnesota Morris Leaving Groups in Biochemical ReactionsSAM Methyltransferases Objective discuss the importance of leaving groups in biological substitution reactions Leaving Groups in Biochemical Reactions In biological reactions we do not often see halides serving as leaving groups in fact outside of some marine organisms halogens are fairly unusual in biological molecules More common leaving groups in biochemical reactions are phosphates water alcohols and thiols In many cases the leaving group is protonated by an acidic group on the enzyme as bondbreaking occurs For example hydroxide ion itself seldom acts as a leaving group it is simply too high in energy too basic Rather the hydroxide oxygen is generally protonated by an enzymatic acid before or during the bondbreaking event resulting in a very stable water leaving group More often however the hydroxyl group of an alcohol is first converted enzymatically to a phosphate ester in order to create a better leaving group This phosphate ester can take the form of a simple monophosphate arrow in the figure below a diphosphate arrow or a nucleotide monophosphate arrow Due to resonance delocalization of the developing negative charge phosphates are excellent leaving groups Heres a specific example from DNA nucleotide biosynthesis Here the OH group on ribofuranose is converted to a diphosphate a much better leaving group Ammonia is the nucleophile in the second step of this SNlike reaction What is important for now is that in each case an alcohol has been converted into a much better leaving group and is now primed for a nucleophilic substitution reaction SAM Methyltransferases Some of the most important examples of SN reactions in biochemistry are those catalyzed by Sadenosyl methionine SAM dependent methyltransferase enzymes We have already seen in chapter and again in chapter how a methyl group is transferred in an SN reaction from SAM to the amine group on the nucleotide base adenosine Nucleic Acids Res Another SAMdependent methylation reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called catecholOmethyltransferase The substrate here is epinephrine also known as adrenaline Notice that in this example the attacking nucleophile is an alcohol rather than an amine thats why the enzyme is called an Omethyltransferase In both cases though a basic amino acid side chain is positioned in the active site in just the right place to deprotonate the nucleophilic group as it attacks increasing its nucleophilicity The electrophile in both reactions is a methyl carbon so there is little steric hindrance to slow down the nucleophilic attack The methyl carbon is electrophilic because it is bonded to a positivelycharged sulfur which is a powerful electron withdrawing group The positive charge on the sulfur also makes it an excellent leaving group as the resulting product will be a neutral and very stable sulfide All in all in both reactions we have a reasonably good nucleophile an electronpoor unhindered electrophile and an excellent leaving group Because the electrophilic carbon in these reactions is a methyl carbon a stepwise SNlike mechanism is extremely unlikely a methyl carbocation is very high in energy and thus is not a reasonable intermediate to propose We can confidently predict that this reaction is SN Does this SN reaction occur as expected with inversion of stereochemistry Of course the electrophilic methyl carbon in these reactions is achiral so inversion is not apparent To demonstrate inversion the following experiment has been carried out with catecholOmethyltransferase Here the methyl group of SAM was made to be chiral by incorporating hydrogen isotopes tritium H T and deuterium H D The researchers determined that the reaction occurred with inversion of configuration as expected for an SN displacement J Biol Chem Example Contributors Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma

Contributors and Attributions In writing the conventional Lewis structures for molecules we assume that a covalent chemical bond between two atoms involves sharing a pair of elections one from each atom Figure shows how atomic orbitals can be considered to be used in bond formation Here we postulate that a single bond is formed by the pulling together of two atomic nuclei by attractive forces exerted by the nuclei for the two paired electrons in overlapping atomic orbitals Because two atomic orbitals can hold a maximum of four electrons it is reasonable to ask why it is that two rather than one three or four electrons normally are involved in a bond The answer is that two overlapping atomic Figure Representation of the formation of an bond by sharing of electrons in overlapping orbitals orbitals can be considered to combine to give one lowenergy bonding molecular orbital and one highenergy antibonding molecular orbital see the top part of Figure a Orbitals that overlap as shown in Figure a are said to overlap in the sigma manner and the bonding orbital is called a sigma orbital the antibonding orbital is called a orbital read sigma star Two paired electrons suffice to fill the orbital Any additional electrons must go into the highenergy orbital and contribute not to bonding but to repulsion between the atoms The hydrogen moleculeion can be regarded as having one electron in a orbital It has been studied in the vapor state by spectroscopic means and found to have a dissociation energy to and of compared to the bond energy for Several possible combinations of two hydrogen orbitals and from one to four electrons are shown in Figure b Figure a Schematic representation of formation of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals by overlap of two atomic orbitals b Some of the various electronic configurations that are possible with these orbitals More about the difference between bonding and antibonding orbitals is given in Section For now we will say that the property of orbitals that leads to bonding or antibonding is a property analogous to phase An inphase combination of two orbitals is bonding and an outofphase combination is antibonding

rotate and those that cannot Sigma Bonds can Rotate We learned in section that single bonds in organic molecules are free to rotate due to the endtoend sigma nature of their orbital overlap Consider the carbonoxygen bond in ethanol for example with a o rotation about this bond the shape of the molecule would look quite different For ethane rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond results in many different possible threedimensional arrangements of the atoms Pi Bonds are rigid Pi bonds are created from overlapping p orbitals The lobes of the p orbitals prevent the atoms sharing pi bonds from rotating as shown in the diagram below Double and Triple Bonds cannot Rotate The pi bonds in double and triple bonds prevent these bonds from rotating This rigidity has an effect on the physical structure of compounds and can influence chemical reactivity For now we want to build the habit of looking at static drawings and diagrams of organic compounds and visualizing their dynamic nature For ethene there is no rotation about the carboncarbon double bond because of the pi bond Exercise Label the selected bonds in the compound below as Rotates or Rigid Answer Arrows for a and c are pointing to single bonds that can rotate Arrow b is pointing to a double bond that is rigid because of the pi bond The BrønstedLowry Theory of Acids and BasesConjugate AcidBase PairContributors and Attributions learning objective recognize acids and bases The BrønstedLowry Theory of Acids and Bases In Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted and English chemist Thomas Lowry independently proposed new definitions for acids and bases ones that focus on proton transfer A BrønstedLowry acid is any species that can donate a proton H to another molecule A BrønstedLowry base is any species that can accept a proton from another molecule In short a BrønstedLowry acid is a proton donor PD while a BrønstedLowry base is a proton acceptor PA A BrønstedLowry acid is a proton donor while a BrønstedLowry base is a proton acceptor Let us use the reaction of ammonia in water to demonstrate the BrønstedLowry definitions of an acid and a base Ammonia and water molecules are reactants while the ammonium ion and the hydroxide ion are products What has happened in this reaction is that the original water molecule has donated a hydrogen ion to the original ammonia molecule which in turn has accepted the hydrogen ion We can illustrate this as follows Because the water molecule donates a hydrogen ion to the ammonia it is the BrønstedLowry acid while the ammonia moleculewhich accepts the hydrogen ionis the BrønstedLowry base Thus ammonia acts as a base in both the Arrhenius sense and the BrønstedLowry sense Is an Arrhenius acid like hydrochloric acid still an acid in the BrønstedLowry sense Yes but it requires us to understand what really happens when HCl is dissolved in water Recall that the hydrogen atom is a single proton surrounded by a single electron To make the hydrogen ion we remove the electron leaving a bare proton Do we really have bare protons floating around in aqueous solution No we do not What really happens is that the H ion attaches itself to HO to make HO which is called the hydronium ion For most purposes H and HO represent the same species but writing HO instead of H shows that we understand that there are no bare protons floating around in solution Rather these protons are actually attached to solvent molecules The Hydronium IOn A proton in aqueous solution may be surrounded by more than one water molecule leading to formulas like or rather than It is simpler however to use to represent the hydronium ion With this in mind how do we define HCl as an acid in the BrønstedLowry sense Consider what happens when HCl is dissolved in HO We can depict this process using Lewis electron dot diagrams Now we see that a hydrogen ion is transferred from the HCl molecule to the HO molecule to make chloride ions and hydronium ions As the hydrogen ion donor HCl acts as a BrønstedLowry acid as a hydrogen ion acceptor HO is a BrønstedLowry base So HCl is an acid not just in the Arrhenius sense but also in the BrønstedLowry sense Moreover by the BrønstedLowry definitions HO is a base in the formation of aqueous HCl So the BrønstedLowry definitions of an acid and a base classify the dissolving of HCl in water as a reaction between an acid and a basealthough the Arrhenius definition would not have labeled HO a base in this circumstance A BrønstedLowry acid is a proton hydrogen ion donor A BrønstedLowry base is a proton hydrogen ion acceptor All Arrhenius acids and bases are BrønstedLowry acids and bases as well However not all BrønstedLowry acids and bases are Arrhenius acids and bases Example Aniline CHNH is slightly soluble in water It has a nitrogen atom that can accept a hydrogen ion from a water molecule just like the nitrogen atom in ammonia does Write the chemical equation for this reaction and identify the BrønstedLowry acid and base Solution CHNH and HO are the reactants When CHNH accepts a proton from HO it gains an extra H and a positive charge and leaves an OH ion behind The reaction is as follows Because CHNH accepts a proton it is the BrønstedLowry base The HO molecule because it donates a proton is the BrønstedLowry acid Exercise Identify the BrønstedLowry acid and the BrønstedLowry base in this chemical equation Answer BrønstedLowry acid HPO BrønstedLowry base HO Exercise Which of the following compounds is a BronstedLowry base HCl HPO HPO NH CHNH Answer A BrønstedLowry Base is a proton acceptor which means it will take in an H This eliminates and because they are BronstedLowry acids They all give away protons In the case of consider the following equation Here it is clear that HPO is the acid since it donates a proton to water to make HO and PO Now consider the following equation In this case HPO is the base since it accepts a proton from water to form HPO and OH Thus HPO is an acid and base together making it amphoteric Since HPO is the only compound from the options that can act as a base the answer is b HPO Conjugate AcidBase Pair In reality all acidbase reactions involve the transfer of protons between acids and bases For example consider the acidbase reaction that takes place when ammonia is dissolved in water A water molecule functioning as an acid transfers a proton to an ammonia molecule functioning as a base yielding the conjugate base of water and the conjugate acid of ammonia In the reaction of ammonia with water to give ammonium ions and hydroxide ions ammonia acts as a base by accepting a proton from a water molecule which in this case means that water is acting as an acid In the reverse reaction an ammonium ion acts as an acid by donating a proton to a hydroxide ion and the hydroxide ion acts as a base The conjugate acidbase pairs for this reaction are and Figure The strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at the top right The conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong base is a very weak acid Figure The Relative Strengths of Some Common Conjugate AcidBase Pairs The strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at the top right The conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong base is a very weak acid Example Identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium Solution Similarly in the reaction of acetic acid with water acetic acid donates a proton to water which acts as the base In the reverse reaction is the acid that donates a proton to the acetate ion which acts as the base Once again we have two conjugate acidbase pairs the parent acid and its conjugate base and the parent base and its conjugate acid Example Identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium Solution One pair is HO and OH where HO has one more H and is the conjugate acid while OH has one less H and is the conjugate base The other pair consists of CHN and CHNH where CHNH is the conjugate acid it has an additional proton and CHN is the conjugate base Exercise Identify the conjugate acidbase

unsaturation saturated unsaturated There are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule Although nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and infrared radiation IR are the primary ways of determining molecular structures calculating the degrees of unsaturation is useful information since knowing the degrees of unsaturation make it easier for one to figure out the molecular structure it helps one doublecheck the number of bonds andor cyclic rings Saturated and Unsaturated Molecules In the lab saturation may be thought of as the point when a solution cannot dissolve anymore of a substance added to it In terms of degrees of unsaturation a molecule only containing single bonds with no rings is considered saturated CHCHCH methyoxypentane Unlike saturated molecules unsaturated molecules contain double bonds triple bonds andor rings CHCHCHCH chlorooctyne Calculating The Degree of Unsaturation DoU If the molecular formula is given plug in the numbers into this formula is the number of carbons is the number of nitrogens is the number of halogens F Cl Br I is the number of hydrogens As stated before a saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings Another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane Thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by C which is the general molecular representation of an alkane As an example for the molecular formula CH the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is Cx The compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens Degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated Hence the DoB formula divides by The formula subtracts the number of Xs because a halogen X replaces a hydrogen in a compound For instance in chloroethane CHCl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane CH For a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present Therefore we add the number of nitrogens N This can be seen with CHN compared to CH Oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements As seen in alcohols the same number of hydrogens in ethanol CHOH matches the number of hydrogens in ethane CH The following chart illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for a given degree of unsaturation Each row

Sonoma State University Kim Quach UCD Stability of carbocation intermediatesExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe the geometry of a given carbocation arrange a given series of carbocations in order of increasing or decreasing stability explain the relative stability of methyl primary secondary and tertiary carbocations in terms of hyperconjugation and inductive effects Study Notes Although hyperconjugation can be used to explain the relative stabilities of carbocations this explanation is certainly not the only one and is by no means universally accepted A more common explanation involving the concept of an inductive effect is given below It is a general principle in chemistry that the more a charge is dispersed the more stable is the species carrying the charge Put simply a species in which a positive charge is shared between two atoms would be more stable than a similar species in which the charge is borne wholly by a single atom In a tertiary carbocation the positively charged carbon atom attracts the bonding electrons in the three carboncarbon sigma σ bonds and thus creates slight positive charges on the carbon atoms of the three surrounding alkyl groups and indeed on the hydrogen atoms attached to them Chemists sometimes use an arrow to represent this inductive release Note These diagrams do not reflect the geometry of the carbocation The overall charge on the carbocation remains unchanged but some of the charge is now carried by the alkyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that is the charge has been dispersed In the tertiary carbocation shown above the three alkyl groups help to stabilize the positive charge In a secondary carbocation only two alkyl groups would be available for this purpose while a primary carbocation has only one alkyl group available Thus the observed order of stability for carbocations is as follows tertiary secondary primary methyl Stability of carbocation intermediates We know that the ratelimiting step of an SN reaction is the first step formation of the this carbocation intermediate The rate of this step and therefore the rate of the overall substitution reaction depends on the activation energy for the process in which the bond between the carbon and the leaving group breaks and a carbocation forms According to Hammonds postulate section B the more stable the carbocation intermediate is the faster this first bondbreaking step will occur In other words the likelihood of a nucleophilic substitution reaction proceeding by a dissociative SN mechanism depends to a large degree on the stability of the carbocation intermediate that forms The critical question now becomes what stabilizes a carbocation So if it takes an electron withdrawing group to stabilize a negative charge what will stabilize a positive charge An electron donating group A positively charged species such as a carbocation is very electronpoor and thus anything which donates electron density to the center of electron poverty will help to stabilize it Conversely a carbocation will be destabilized by an electron withdrawing group Alkyl groups methyl ethyl and the like are weak electron donating groups and thus stabilize nearby carbocations What this means is that in general more substituted carbocations are more stable a tertbutyl carbocation for example is more stable than an isopropyl carbocation Primary carbocations are highly unstable and not often observed as reaction intermediates methyl carbocations are even less stable Alkyl groups are electron donating and carbocationstabilizing because the electrons around the neighboring carbons are drawn towards the nearby positive charge thus slightly reducing the electron poverty of the positivelycharged carbon It is not accurate to say however that carbocations with higher substitution are always more stable than those with less substitution Just as electrondonating groups can stabilize a carbocation electronwithdrawing groups act to destabilize carbocations Carbonyl groups are electronwithdrawing by inductive effects due to the polarity of the CO double bond It is possible to demonstrate in the laboratory see section D that carbocation A below is more stable than carbocation B even though A is a primary carbocation and B is secondary The difference in stability can be explained by considering the electronwithdrawing inductive effect of the ester carbonyl Recall that inductive effects whether electronwithdrawing or donating are relayed through covalent bonds and that the strength of the effect decreases rapidly as the number of intermediary bonds increases In other words the effect decreases with distance In species B the positive charge is closer to the carbonyl group thus the destabilizing electronwithdrawing effect is stronger than it is in species A In the next chapter we will see how the carbocationdestabilizing effect of electronwithdrawing fluorine substituents can be used in experiments designed to address the question of whether a biochemical nucleophilic substitution reaction is SN or SN Stabilization of a carbocation can also occur through resonance effects and as we have already discussed in the acidbase chapter resonance effects as a rule are more powerful than inductive effects Consider the simple case of a benzylic carbocation This carbocation is comparatively stable In this case electron donation is a resonance effect Three additional resonance structures can be drawn for this carbocation in which the positive charge is located on one of three aromatic carbons The positive charge is not isolated on the benzylic carbon rather it is delocalized around the aromatic structure this delocalization of charge results in significant stabilization As a result benzylic and allylic carbocations where the positively charged carbon is conjugated to one or more nonaromatic double bonds are significantly more stable than even tertiary alkyl carbocations Because heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen are more electronegative than carbon you might expect that they would by definition be electron withdrawing groups that destabilize carbocations In fact the opposite is often true if the oxygen or nitrogen atom is in the correct position the overall effect is carbocation stabilization This is due to the fact that although these heteroatoms are electron withdrawing groups by induction they are electron donating groups by resonance and it is this resonance effect which is more powerful We previously encountered this same idea when considering the relative acidity and basicity of phenols and aromatic amines in section Consider the two pairs of carbocation species below In the more stable carbocations the heteroatom acts as an electron donating group by resonance in effect the lone pair on the heteroatom is available to delocalize the positive charge In the less stable carbocations the positivelycharged carbon is more than one bond away from the heteroatom and thus no resonance effects are possible In fact in these carbocation species the heteroatoms actually destabilize the positive charge because they are electron withdrawing by induction Finally vinylic carbocations in which the positive charge resides on a doublebonded carbon are very unstable and thus unlikely to form as intermediates in any reaction Example In which of the structures below is the carbocation expected to be more stable Explain Answer In the carbocation on the left the positive charge is located in a position relative to the nitrogen such that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen can be donated to fill the empty orbital This is not possible for the carbocation species on the right For the most part carbocations are very highenergy transient intermediate species in organic reactions However there are some unusual examples of very stable carbocations that take the form of organic salts Crystal violet is the common name for the chloride salt of the carbocation whose structure is shown below Notice the structural possibilities for extensive resonance delocalization of the positive charge and the presence of three electrondonating amine groups Example Draw a resonance structure of the crystal violet cation in which the positive charge is delocalized to one of the nitrogen atoms Answer When considering the possibility that a nucleophilic substitution reaction proceeds via an SN pathway it is critical to evaluate the stability of the hypothetical carbocation intermediate If this intermediate is not sufficiently stable an SN mechanism must be considered unlikely and the reaction probably proceeds by an SN mechanism In the next chapter we will see several examples of biologically important SN reactions in which the positively charged intermediate is stabilized by inductive and resonance effects inherent in its own molecular structure Example State which carbocation in each pair below is more stable or if they are expected to be approximately equal Explain your reasoning Answer a tertiary vs secondary carbocation b equal

a reaction in which loss of the leaving group followed by removal of he betahydrogen results in the formation of a double bond It is similar to a unimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction SN in various ways One being the formation of a carbocation intermediate as the rate determining slow step hence the name unimolecular Alkyl halides that can ionize to form stable carbocations are more reactive via the E mechanism Because carbocation stability is the primary energetic consideration stabilization of the carbocation via solvation is also an important consideration Because carbocations are highly reactive the strength of the base is not important and weak bases can be used Since SN and E reactions behave similarly they often compete against each other Many times both these reactions will occur simultaneously to form different products from a single reaction However one can be favored over another through thermodynamic control Heating the reaction favors elimination over substitution In order of decreasing importance the factors impacting E reaction pathways are structure of the alkyl halide stability of the carbocation type of solvent strength of the base Mechanism for Alkyl Halides As can be seen in the E mechanism below the preliminary step is the leaving group LG leaving on its own Because it takes the electrons in the bond along with it the carbon that was attached to it loses its electron making it a carbocation Once it becomes a carbocation a Lewis Base B deprotonates the intermediate carbocation at the beta position which then donates its electrons to the neighboring CC bond to form a double bond Unlike E reactions which require the proton to be anti to the leaving group E reactions only require a neighboring hydrogen This is due to the fact that the leaving group has already left the molecule The final product is an alkene along with the HB byproduct and leaving group salt Once again we see the two steps of the E mechanism A base deprotonates a beta carbon to form a pi bond In this case we see a mixture of products rather than one discrete one This is the case because the carbocation has two nearby carbons that are capable of being deprotonated but that only one forms a major product more stable Reactivity Due to the fact that E reactions create a carbocation intermediate rules present in reactions still apply As expected tertiary carbocations are favored over secondary primary and methyls This is due to the phenomena of hyperconjugation which essentially allows a nearby CC or CH bond to interact with the p orbital of the carbon to bring the electrons down to a lower energy state Thus this has a stabilizing effect on the molecule as a whole In general primary and methyl carbocations do not proceed through the E pathway for this reason unless there is a means of carbocation rearrangement to move the positive charge to a nearby carbon Secondary and Tertiary carbons form more stable carbocations thus this formation occurs quite rapidly Secondary carbocations can be subject to the E reaction pathway but this generally occurs in the presence of a good strong base Adding a weak base to the reaction disfavors E essentially pushing towards the E pathway In many instances solvolysis occurs rather than using a base to deprotonate This means heat is added to the solution and the solvent itself deprotonates a hydrogen The medium can effect the pathway of the reaction as well Polar protic solvents may be used to hinder nucleophiles thus disfavoring E Sn from occurring Regiochemistry Stereochemistry of the E Reaction The E reaction is regiospecific because it follows Zaitsevs rule that states the more substituted alkene is the major product This infers that the hydrogen on the most substituted carbon is the most probable to be deprotonated thus allowing for the most substituted alkene to be formed Unlike E reactions the E reaction is not stereospecific Thus a hydrogen is not required to be anticoplanar to the leaving group because the leaving group is gone In the mechanism below we can see two possible pathways for the reaction Either one leads to a plausible resultant product however only one forms a major product As stated by Zaitsevs rule deprotonation of the most substituted carbon results in the most substituted alkene This then becomes the most stable product due to hyperconjugation and is also more common than the minor product Exercises Which of these steps is the rate determining step A or B What is the major product formed C or D In order to produce the most stable alkene product from which carbon should the base deprotonate A B or C If the carbocation were to rearrange on which carbon would the positive charge go onto without sacrificing stability A B or C Predict the major product of the following reaction True or False There is no way of controlling the product ratio of E Sn reactions Explain why the presence of a weak base nucleophile favors E reactions over E Answer A C B B False They can be thermodynamically controlled to favor a certain product over another By definition an E reaction is a Unimolecular Elimination reaction This means the only rate determining step is that of the dissociation of the leaving group to form a carbocation Since E is bimolecular and the nucleophilic attack is part of the rate determining step a weak basenucleophile disfavors it and ultimately allows E to dominate Dont forget about SN which still pertains to this reaction simaltaneously Outside Links E reaction

predict the mechanism based on its rate equation or reaction data for SN reactions predict the products and specify the reagents for SN reactions with stereochemistry propose mechanisms for SN reactions draw and interpret Reaction Energy Diagrams for SN reactions In order of decreasing importance the factors impacting SN reaction pathways are structure of the alkyl halide stability of the leaving group type of solvent The unimolecular transition state of the SN pathway means that structure of the alkyl halide and stability of the leaving group are the primary considerations Alkyl halides that can ionize to form stable carbocations are more reactive via the SN mechanism Because carbocation stability is the primary energetic consideration stabilization of the carbocation via solvation is also an important consideration Alkyl Halide Structure and Carbocation Stability The first order kinetics of SN reactions suggest a twostep mechanism in which the ratedetermining step consists of carbocation formation from the ionization of the alkyl halide as shown in the diagram below In this mechanism the carbocation is a highenergy intermediate the bonds immediately to nearby nucleophiles The only reactant that is undergoing change in the first ratedetermining step is the alkyl halide so we expect such reactions would be unimolecular and follow a firstorder rate equation Hence the name SN is applied to this mechanism The Hammond postulate suggests that the activation energy of the ratedetermining first step will be inversely proportional to the stability of the carbocation intermediate the more stable the carbocation the lower the activation energy the faster the reactivity Therefore carbocation stability is a primary consideration in SN reactions Carbocations can be stabilized by delocalizing the charge via resonance and through inductive electron donation of alkyl groups Carbocations can also stabilize by rearrangement via hydride or methyl shifts Carbocation rearrangements are explained in a subsequent section of this chapter Benzyl Carbocation The relative stability of carbocations is summarized below Carbocation Stability CH CHCH CHCH CHCHCH CHCH CHC Consequently we expect that ºalkyl halides will be more reactive than their º and ºcounterparts in reactions that follow an SN mechanism This is opposite to the reactivity order observed for the SN mechanism Allylic and benzylic halides are exceptionally reactive by either mechanism This trend is summarized in the diagram below Effects of Leaving Group An SN reaction speeds up with a good leaving group This is because the leaving group is involved in the ratedetermining step A good leaving group wants to leave so it breaks the CLeaving Group bond faster Once the bond breaks the carbocation is formed and the faster the carbocation is formed the faster the nucleophile can come in and the faster the reaction will be completed A good leaving group is a weak base because weak bases can hold the charge Theyre happy to leave with both electrons and in order for the leaving group to leave it needs to be able to accept electrons Strong bases on the other hand donate electrons which is why they cant be good leaving groups As you go from left to right on the periodic table electron donating ability decreases and thus ability to be a good leaving group increases Halides are an example of a good leaving group whos leavinggroup ability increases as you go down the column The two reactions below is the same reaction done with two different leaving groups One is significantly faster than the other This is because the better leaving group leaves faster and thus the reaction can proceed faster Figure below Methyl Sulfate Ion Mesylate Ion Triflate Ion Tosylate Ion CHSO CHSO CFSO CHCHSO Solvent Effects on the SN Reaction To facilitate the charge separation of the ionization reaction in the first step a good ionizing solvent is needed Two solvent characteristics will be particularly important the polarity and the solvating power The dielectric constant ε measures polarity of solvent molecules and their ability to orient themselves between ions to attenuate reduce the electrostatic force one ion exerts on the other The higher the dielectric constant the more polar the substance and in the case of SN reactions the faster the rate A dielectric constant below is usually considered nonpolar Solvents having high dielectric constants such as water ε formic acid ε dimethyl sulfoxide ε acetonitrile ε are generally considered better ionizing solvents than are some common organic solvents such as ethanol ε acetone ε methylene chloride ε ether ε Below is the same reaction conducted in two different solvents The relative reaction rate in water ε is times faster than in methanol ε Solvation refers to the solvents ability to stabilize ions by encasing them in a sheath of weakly bonded solvent molecules Anions are solvated by partial positive charges of hydrogenbonding solvents Cations are often best solvated by the nucleophilic sites on a solvent molecule eg oxygen nitrogen atoms The interaction of the carbocations with these nucleophilic solvents may be strong enough to form covalent bonds to carbon thus converting the intermediate to a substitution product and creating the reaction name solvolysis When solvolysis occurs with water the actions are called hydrolysis reactions as shown in the reaction below Polar Protic and Polar Aprotic Solvents Protic solvents contain polarized hydrogen Whereas aprotic solvents do NOT contain polarized hydrogen For SN reactions solvation of the nucleophile by polar protic solvents slows the reaction rate However in SN reaction the nucleophile is not a part of the ratedetermining step so this concern is not relevant In fact polar protic solvents actually speed up the rate of SN reactions because the polar solvent helps stabilize the transition state and carbocation intermediate Since the carbocation is unstable anything that can stabilize this even a little will speed up the reaction Polar aprotic solvents have a dipole moment but their hydrogen is not highly polarized Polar aprotic solvents are not used in SN reactions because some of them can react with the carbocation intermediate and give an unwanted sideproduct Rather polar protic solvents are preferred for unimolecular substitution reactions Effects of Nucleophile The strength of the nucleophile does not affect the reaction rate of SN because the nucleophile is not involved in the ratedetermining step Since nucleophiles only participate in the fast second step their relative molar concentrations rather than their nucleophilicities should be the primary productdetermining factor If a nucleophilic solvent such as water is used its high concentration will assure that alcohols are the major product However if you have more than one nucleophile competing to bond to the carbocation the strengths and concentrations of those nucleophiles affects the distribution of products For example if tbutylchloride reacts with a mixture of water and formic acid where the water and formic acid are competing nucleophiles two different products are formed CHCOH and CHCOCOH The relative yields of these products depends on the concentrations and relative reactivities of the nucleophiles With a higher electron density water is considered the stronger nucleophile and the tertiary alcohol will be the major product if there are equal concentrations of competing nucleophiles

position Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Contributors and Attributions As a class alkanes generally are unreactive The names saturated hydrocarbon or paraffin which literally means not enough affinity L parum not enough affins affinity arise because their chemical affinity for most common reagents may be regarded as saturated or satisfied Thus none of the or bonds in a typical saturated hydrocarbon for example ethane are attacked at ordinary temperatures by a strong acid such as sulfuric acid or by an oxidizing agent such as bromine in the dark oxygen or potassium permanganate Under ordinary conditions ethane is similarly stable to reducing agents such as hydrogen even in the presence of catalysts such as platinum palladium or nickel However all saturated hydrocarbons are attacked by oxygen at elevated temperatures and if oxygen is in excess complete combustion to carbon dioxide and water occurs Vast quantities of hydrocarbons from petroleum are utilized as fuels for the production of heat and power by combustion although it is becoming quite clear that few of the nations of the world are going to continue to satisfy their needs or desires for energy through the use of petroleum the way it has been possible in the past Petroleums differ considerably in composition depending on their source However a representative petroleum on distillation yields the following fractions Gas fraction boiling up to contains normal and branched alkanes from to Natural gas is mainly methane and ethane Bottled gas liquefied petroleum gas is mainly propane and butane Gasoline boiling point from to contains mostly hydrocarbons from to Over compounds have been identified in gasoline and these include continuouschain and branched alkanes cycloalkanes and alkylbenzenes arenes The branched alkanes make better gasoline than their continuouschain isomers because they give less knock in highcompression

jelly Vaseline The distillation residues known as asphalts The way in which petroleum is refined and the uses for it depend very much on supply and demand which always are changing However the situation for the United States in is summarized in Figure which shows roughly how much of one barrel of oil liters is used for specific purposes Figure Sources and uses of petroleum in the United States in In the past three decades petroleum technology has outpaced coal technology and we now are reliant on petroleum as the major source of fuels and chemicals Faced with dwindling oil reserves however it is inevitable that coal again will become a major source of raw materials When coal is heated at high temperatures in the absence of air it carbonizes to coke and gives off a gaseous mixture of compounds Some of these gases condense to a black viscous oil coal tar others produce an aqueous condensate called ammoniacal liquors and some remain gaseous coal gas The residue is coke which is used both as a fuel and as a source of carbon for the production of steel The major component in coal gas is methane Coal tar is an incredible mixture of compounds mostly hydrocarbons a substantial number of which are arenes Coal and coal tar can be utilized to produce alkanes but the technology involved is more complex and costly than petroleum refining It seems inevitable that the cost of hydrocarbon fuel will continue to rise as supply problems become more difficult And there is yet no answer to what will happen when the worlds limited quantities of petroleum and coal are

chiral or achiral and identify planes of symmetry Stereoisomers are isomers that differ in spatial arrangement of atoms rather than order of atomic connectivity One of their most interesting type of isomer is the mirrorimage stereoisomers a nonsuperimposable set of two molecules that are mirror image of one another The existence of these molecules are determined by concept known as chirality Introduction Organic compounds molecules created around a chain of carbon atom more commonly known as carbon backbone play an essential role in the chemistry of life These molecules derive their importance from the energy they carry mainly in a form of potential energy between atomic molecules Since such potential force can be widely affected due to changes in atomic placement it is important to understand the concept of an isomer a molecule sharing same atomic make up as another but differing in structural arrangements This article will be devoted to a specific isomers called stereoisomers and its property of chirality Figure Figure Two enantiomers of a tetrahedral complex The concepts of steroisomerism and chirality command great deal of importance in modern organic chemistry as these ideas helps to understand the physical and theoretical reasons behind the formation and structures of numerous organic molecules the main reason behind the energy embedded in these essential chemicals In contrast to more wellknown constitutional isomerism which develops isotopic compounds simply by different atomic connectivity stereoisomerism generally maintains equal atomic connections and orders of building blocks as well as having same numbers of atoms and types of elements What then makes stereoisomers so unique To answer this question the learner must be able to think and imagine in not just twodimensional images but also threedimensional space This is due to the fact that stereoisomers are isomers because their atoms are different from others in terms of spatial arrangement Spatial Arrangement First and foremost one must understand the concept of spatial arrangement in order to understand stereoisomerism and chirality Spatial arrangement of atoms concern how different atomic particles and molecules are situated about in the space around the organic compound namely its carbon chain In this sense spatial arrangement of an organic molecule are different another if an atom is shifted in any threedimensional direction by even one degree This opens up a very broad possibility of different molecules each with their unique placement of atoms in threedimensional space Stereoisomers Stereoisomers are as mentioned above contain different types of isomers within itself each with distinct characteristics that further separate each other as different chemical entities having different properties Type called entaniomer are the previouslymentioned mirrorimage stereoisomers and will be explained in detail in this article Another type diastereomer has different properties and will be introduced afterwards The Many Synonyms of the Chiral Carbon Be aware all of the following terms can be used to describe a chiral carbon chiral carbon asymmetric carbon optically active carbon stereo carbon Enantiomers This type of stereoisomer is the essential mirrorimage nonsuperimposable type of stereoisomer introduced in the beginning of the article Figure provides a perfect example note that the gray plane in the middle demotes the mirror plane Figure Comparison of Chiral and Achiral Molecules a Bromochlorofluoromethane is a chiral molecule whose stereocenter is designated with an asterisk Rotation of its mirror image does not generate the original structure To superimpose the mirror images bonds must be broken and reformed b In contrast dichlorofluoromethane and its mirror image can be rotated so they are superimposable Note that even if one were to flip over the left molecule over to the right the atomic spatial arrangement will not be equal This is equivalent to the left hand right hand relationship and is aptly referred to as handedness in molecules This can be somewhat counterintuitive so this article recommends the reader try the hand example Place both palm facing up and hands next to each other Now flip either side over to the other One hand should be showing the back of the hand while the other one is showing the palm They are not same and nonsuperimposable This is where the concept of chirality comes in as one of the most essential and defining idea of stereoisomerism Chirality Chirality essentially means mirrorimage nonsuperimposable molecules and to say that a molecule is chiral is to say that its mirror image it must have one is not the same as it self Whether a molecule is chiral or achiral depends upon a certain set of overlapping conditions Figure shows an example of two molecules chiral and achiral respectively Notice the distinct characteristic of the achiral molecule it possesses two atoms of same element In theory and reality if one were to create a plane that runs through the other two atoms they will be able to create what is known as bisecting plane The images on either side of the plan is the same as the other Figure Figure In this case the molecule is considered achiral In other words to distinguish chiral molecule from an achiral molecule one must search for the existence of the bisecting plane in a molecule All chiral molecules are deprive of bisecting plane whether simple or complex As a universal rule no molecule with different surrounding atoms are achiral Chirality is a simple but essential idea to support the concept of stereoisomerism being used to explain one type of its kind The chemical properties of the chiral molecule differs from its mirror image and in this lies the significance of chilarity in relation to modern organic chemistry Exercise Identify the following as either a constitutional isomer or stereoisomer If stereoisomer determine if it is an enantiomer or diastereomer Explain the reason behind the answer Also mark chirality for each molecule a b c Solutions a achiral b chiral c chiral Exercise Identify the chiral centers in each of the

Chong Jonathan Mooney McGill University Stereogenic NitrogenContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to recognize that atoms other than carbon can be chiral centres explain why enantiomers of compounds such as ethylmethylamine cannot normally be isolated Study Notes The first example of a resolvable compound containing a chiral nitrogen atom was resolved by William Pope and Stanley Peachey in It had the structure shown below Chiral sulfoxides find application in certain drugs such as esomeprazole and armodafinil and are a good example of a stereogenic sulfur center Stereogenic Nitrogen Singlebonded nitrogen is pyramidal in shape with the nonbonding electron pair pointing to the unoccupied corner of a tetrahedral region Since the nitrogen in these compounds is bonded to three different groups its configuration is chiral The nonidentical mirrorimage configurations are illustrated in the following diagram the remainder of the molecule is represented by R and the electron pair is colored yellow If these configurations were stable there would be four additional stereoisomers of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine However pyramidal nitrogen is normally not configurationally stable It rapidly inverts its configuration equilibrium arrows by passing through a planar sphybridized transition state leading to a mixture of interconverting R and S configurations If the nitrogen atom were the only chiral center in the molecule a racemic mixture of R and S configurations would exist at equilibrium If other chiral centers are present as in the ephedrin isomers a mixture of diastereomers will result The takehome message is that nitrogen does not contribute to isolable stereoisomers Asymmetric quaternary ammonium groups are also chiral Amines however are not chiral because they rapidly invert or turn inside out at room temperature The phosphorus center of phosphate ion and organic phosphate esters for example is tetrahedral and thus is potentially a stereocenter We will see in chapter how researchers in order to investigate the stereochemistry of reactions at the phosphate center incorporated sulfur andor O and O isotopes of oxygen the normal isotope is O to create chiral phosphate groups Phosphate triesters are chiral if the three substituent groups are different Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar

Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Some Chiral Organic MoleculesExercisesContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to explain how chiral molecules in nature can have such dramatically different biological properties Some Chiral Organic Molecules There are a number of important biomolecules that could occur as enantiomers including amino acids and sugars In most cases only one enantiomer occurs although some fungi for example are able to produce mirrorimage forms of these compounds We will look later at some of these biomolecules but first we will look at a compound that occurs naturally in both enantiomeric forms Carvone is a secondary metabolite That means it is a naturallyoccurring compound that is not directly connected to the very basic functions of a cell such as selfreplication or the production of energy The role of secondary metabolites in nature is often difficult to determine However these compounds often play roles in selfdefense acting as deterrents against competitor species in a sort of smallscale chemical warfare scenario They are also frequently used in communications this role has been studied most extensively among insects which use lots of compounds to send information to each other Figure The two naturallyoccurring enantiomers of carvone Carvone is produced in two enantiomeric forms One of these forms called carvone is found in mint leaves and it is a principal contributor to the distinctive odor of mint The other form carvone is found in caraway seeds This form has a very different smell and is typically used to flavor rye bread and other Eastern European foods Note that carvone is the same thing as Scarvone The designation is based on its positive optical rotation value which is experimentally measured The S designation is determined by the CahnIngoldPrelog rules for designating stereochemistry which deal with looking at the groups attached to a chiral center and assigning priority based on atomic number However carvones chiral center actually has three carbons attached to it they all have the same atomic number We need a new rule to break the tie If two substituent groups have the same atomic number go one bond further to the next atom If there is a difference among the second tier of atoms stop The group in which you have encountered a higher atomic number gets the highest priority If there is not a clear difference proceed one additional bond to the next set of atoms and so on until you find a difference In carvone this decision tree works as follows The chiral center is connected to a H a C a C and a C The H is lowest priority One C eventually leads to a CO However at the second bond from the chiral center this C is connected to a C and two Hs A second C is also part of the sixmembered ring but the CO is farther away in this direction At the second bond from the chiral center this C is connected to a C and two Hs just like the first one The third C is part of a little threecarbon group attached to the sixmembered ring At the second bond from the chiral center it is connected to only one H and has two bonds to another C this is counted as two bonds to C and one to H Those first two carbon groups are identical so far However the third group is different it has an extra bond to C whereas the others have an extra bond to H C has a higher atomic number than H so this group has higher priority The secondhighest priority is the branch that reaches the oxygen at the third bond from the chiral center Figure Comparing atoms stepbystep to assign configuration How different exactly are these two compounds and carvone Are they completely different isomers with different physical properties In most ways the answer is no These two compounds have the same appearance colorless oil the same boiling point C the same refractive index and specific gravity However they have optical rotations that are almost exactly opposite values Two enantiomers have the same physical properties Enantiomers have opposite optical rotations Clearly they have different biological properties since they have slightly different odors they must fit into slightly different nasal receptors signaling to the brain whether the person next to you is chewing a stick of gum or a piece of rye bread This different shape complimentarity is not surprising just as it isnt surprising that a left hand only fits into a left handed baseball glove and not into a right handed one Figure Thalidomide There are other reasons that we might concern ourselves with an understanding of enantiomers apart from dietary and olfactory preferences Perhaps the most dramatic example of the importance of enantiomers can be found in the case of thalidomide Thalidomide was a drug commonly prescribed during the s and s in order to alleviate nausea and other symptoms of morning sickness In fact only one enantiomer of thalidomide had any therapeutic effect in this regard The other enantiomer apart from being therapeutically useless in this application was subsequently found to be a teratogen meaning it produces pronounced birth defects This was obviously not a good thing to prescribe to pregnant women Workers in the pharmaceutical industry are now much more aware of these kinds of consequences although of course not all problems with drugs go undetected even through the extensive clinical trials required in the United States Since the era of thalidomide however a tremendous amount of research in the field of synthetic organic chemistry has been devoted to methods of producing only one enantiomer of a useful compound and not the other This effort probably represents the single biggest aim of synthetic organic chemistry through the last quarter century Enantiomers may have very different biological properties Obtaining enantiomerically pure compounds is very important in medicine and the pharmaceutical industry Exercises Q Draw the two enantiomeric forms of butanol CHCHOHCHCH Label their configurations Q Sometimes compounds have many chiral centers in them For the following compounds identify four chiral centers in each mark them with asterisks and identify each center as R or S configuration The following is the structure of dysinosin A a potent thrombin inhibitor that consequently prevents blood clotting Ginkgolide B below is a secondary metabolite of the ginkgo tree extracts of which are used in Chinese medicine Sanglifehrin A shown below is produced by a bacteria that may be found in the soil of coffee plantations in Malawi It is also a promising candidate for the treatment of organ transplant patients owing to its potent immunosuppressant activity Answer S S

ChromatographyReferences A GasLiquid Chromatography Many separation methods are based on chromatography that is separation of the components of a mixture by differences in the way they become distributed or partitioned between two different phases To illustrate with an extreme example suppose we have a mixture of gaseous methane and ammonia and contact this mixture with water Ammonia being very soluble in water per water at pressure will mostly go into the water phase whereas the methane being almost insoluble per of water will essentially remain entirely in the gas phase Such a separation of methane and ammonia would be a onestage partitioning between gas and liquid phases and clearly could be made much more efficient by contacting the gas layer repeatedly with fresh water Carried through many separate operations this partitioning procedure is at best a tedious process especially if the compounds to be separated are similar in their distributions between the phases However partitioning can be achieved nearly automatically by using chromatographic columns which permit a stationary phase to be contacted by a moving phase To illustrate suppose a sample of a gaseous mixture of ammonia and methane is injected into a long tube column filled with glass beads moistened with water the stationary phase and a slow stream of an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen or helium is passed in to push the other gases through A multistage partitioning would occur as the ammonia dissolves in the water and the resulting gas stream encounters fresh water as it moves along the column Carrier gas enriched with methane would emerge first and effluent gas containing ammonia would come out later This is a crude description of the method of gasliquid chromatography abbreviated often as glc GC or called vaporphase chromatography vpc This technique has become so efficient as to revolutionize the analysis and separation of almost any organic substance that has even a slight degree of volatility at some reasonably attainable temperature The most modern glc equipment runs wholly under computer control with preprogrammed temperatures and digital integration of the detector output A wide variety of schemes is available for measuring the concentration of materials in the effluent carrier gas and some of these are of such extraordinary sensitivity that only very small samples are necessary or less Figure Schematic diagram of a gasliquid chromatography apparatus The detector is arranged to measure the difference in some property of the carrier gas alone versus the carrier gas plus effluent sample at the exit Differences In thermal conductivity are particularly easy to measure and give reasonably high detection sensitivities In the usual glc procedure a few microliters of an organic liquid to be analyzed are injected into a vaporizer and carried with a stream of gas usually helium into a long heated column that is packed with a porous solid such as crushed firebrick impregnated with a nonvolatile liquid Gasliquid partitioning occurs and small differences between partitioning of the components can be magnified by the large number of repetitive partitions possible in a long column Detection often is achieved simply by measuring changes in thermal conductivity of the effluent gases A schematic diagram of the apparatus and a typical separation pattern are shown in Figures and The method is extraordinarily useful for detection of minute amounts of impurities provided these are separated from the main peak Glc also can be used effectively to purify materials as well as to detect impurities To do this the sample size and the size of the apparatus may be increased or an automatic system may be used wherein the products from many smallscale runs are combined Figure A gasliquid chromatogram of a mixture of the isomeric butanols at constant column temperature A tiny peak on the far left is a trace of air injected with the sample The retention times of the various isomers are in the same order as the boiling points which are from left to right and The areas under each peak correspond to the relative amounts of material present Raising the column temperature at a preprogrammed rate while developing the chromatogram speeds up the removal of the slowermoving components and sharpens their peaks Also by diversion of the gas stream to appropriate cold traps it is possible to collect pure fractions of each componentI B LiquidSolid Chromatography Liquidsolid chromatography originally was developed for the separation of colored substances hence the name chromatography which stems from the Greek word chroma meaning color In a typical examination a colored substance suspected of containing colored impurities is dissolved in a suitable solvent and the solution allowed to percolate down through a column packed with a solid adsorbent such as alumina or silica as shown in Figure The chromatogram then is developed by passing through a suitable solvent that washes the adsorbate down through the column What one hopes for but may not always find is that the components of the mixture will be adsorbed unequally by the solid phase so distinct bands or zones of color appear The bands at the top of the column contain the most strongly adsorbed components and the bands at the bottom the least strongly held components The zones may be separated mechanically or sufficient solvent can be added to wash or elute the zones of adsorbed materials sequentially from the column for further analysis Liquidsolid chromatography in the form just described was developed first by the Russian biochemist M S Tswett about In recent years many variations have been developed that provide greater convenience better separating power and wider applicability In thinlayer chromatography which is especially useful for rapid analyses a solid adsorbent containing a suitable binder is spread evenly on a glass plate a drop of solution to be analyzed is placed near one edge and the plate is placed in a container with the edge of the plate below the spot dipping into an eluting solvent The solvent ascends the plate and the materials in the spot move upward at different rates as on a Tswett column Various detecting means are used simple visual observation for colored compounds differential fluorescence under ultraviolet light and spraying of the plate with substances that will give colored materials with the compounds present In favorable cases this form of liquidsolid chromatography can be carried out with submicrogram quantities of materials Figure A simple chromatographic column for liquidsolid chromatography An extremely important improvement on the Tswett procedure is highpressure solidliquid chromatography HPLC Increasing the input pressure on the system to improves the speed of separations by permitting the use of much smaller solid particles with more surface area than would be practical for gravityflow Tswett columns Automatic monitoring of the column effluent by ultraviolet spectroscopy Section or by changes in the refractive index usually provides an effective means of determining how the separation is proceeding With such techniques chromatograms similar to Figure are obtained Highpressure liquid chromatography hplc has great advantages for analysis and separation of highmolecularweight heatsensitive compounds that are unsuitable for glc An ingenious variation of solidliquid chromatography is to use a solid support to which material is attached that has a specific affinity for a particular substance to be separated The technique is especially useful for separating enzymes and the immobile phase can be constructed from compounds known to react with or be complexed by the enzyme Some other forms of chromatography are discussed in Sections B and E Observation of a single peak in a given chromatographic procedure is evidence albeit not definitive evidence for purity Contaminants with nearly the same properties may be very difficult to separate and if knowing the degree of purity is highly important one can run chromatograms with a variety of different adsorbents to see if each gives the same result If they do the presumption of purity improves although it is desirable to determine whether the spectroscopic

Study Notes Your previous studies in chemistry may have prepared you to discuss the nature of a carboncarbon double bond If not you should review Section of this course before beginning the present section It is particularly important that you make molecular models of some simple alkenes to gain insight into the geometry of these compounds Geometric isomerism also known as cistrans isomerism or EZ isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism Isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of the atoms in space That excludes any different arrangements which are simply due to the molecule rotating as a whole or rotating about particular bonds Where the atoms making up the various isomers are joined up in a different order this is known as structural isomerism Structural isomerism is not a form of stereoisomerism and is dealt with in a separate Module Geometric cis trans isomerism These isomers occur where you have restricted rotation somewhere in a molecule At an introductory level in organic chemistry examples usually just involve the carboncarbon double bond and thats what this page will concentrate on Think about what happens in molecules where there is unrestricted rotation about carbon bonds in other words where the carboncarbon bonds are all single The next diagram shows two possible configurations of dichloroethane These two models represent exactly the same molecule You can get from one to the other just by twisting around the carboncarbon single bond These molecules are not isomers If you draw a structural formula instead of using models you have to bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bonds You must accept that these two structures represent the same molecule But what happens if you have a carboncarbon double bond as in dichloroethene These two molecules are not the same The carboncarbon double bond wont rotate and so you would have to take the models to pieces in order to convert one structure into the other one That is a simple test for isomers If you have to take a model to pieces to convert it into another one then youve got isomers If you merely have to twist it a bit then you havent Drawing structural formulae for the last pair of models gives two possible isomers In one the two chlorine atoms are locked on opposite sides of the double bond This is known as the trans isomer trans from latin meaning across as in transatlantic In the other the two chlorine atoms are locked on the same side of the double bond This is know as the cis isomer cis from latin meaning on this side The most likely example of geometric isomerism you will meet at an introductory level is butene In one case the CH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond and in the other case they are on the same side The importance of drawing geometric isomers properly Its very easy to miss geometric isomers in exams if you take shortcuts in drawing the structural formulae For example it is very tempting to draw butene as CHCHCHCH If you write it like this you will almost certainly miss the fact that there are geometric isomers If there is even the slightest hint in a question that isomers might be involved always draw compounds containing carboncarbon double bonds showing the correct bond angles around the carbon atoms at the ends of the bond In other words use the format shown in the last diagrams above How to recognize the possibility of geometric isomerism You obviously need to have restricted rotation somewhere in the molecule Compounds containing a carboncarbon double bond have this restricted rotation Other sorts of compounds may have restricted rotation as well but we are concentrating on the case you are most likely to meet when you first come across geometric isomers If you have a carboncarbon double bond you need to think carefully about the possibility of geometric isomers What needs to be attached to the carboncarbon double bond Think about this case Although weve swapped the righthand groups around these are still the same molecule To get from one to the other all you would have to do is to turn the whole model over You wont have geometric isomers if there are two groups the same on one end of the bond in this case the two pink groups on the lefthand end So there must be two different groups on the lefthand carbon and two different groups on the righthand one The cases weve been exploring earlier are like this But you could make things even more different and still have geometric isomers Here the blue and green groups are either on the same side of the bond or the opposite side Or you could go the whole hog and make everything different You still get geometric isomers but by now the words cis and trans are meaningless This is where the more sophisticated EZ notation comes in Summary To get geometric isomers you must have restricted rotation often involving a carboncarbon double bond for introductory purposes two different groups on the lefthand end of the bond and two different groups on the righthand end It doesnt matter whether the lefthand groups are the same as the righthand ones or not Exercises The reading shows

identify draw the geometric cistrans isomers of cycloalkanes Geometric Isomerism of Cycloalkanes The carbon ring of cycloalkanes forms a pseudoplane that can be used to assign the relative orientation of atoms or substituents bonded to the ring stereochemistry One side of the ring is called up while the other side is called down By agreement chemists use heavy wedgeshaped bonds to indicate a substituent located above the average plane of the ring up and a hatched line for bonds to atoms or groups located below the ring down Disubstituted cycloalkane stereoisomers may be designated by nomenclature prefixes such as cis and trans Cis and trans isomers are also called geometric isomers For the cis isomer both substituents are aobe or below the carbon ring For the trans isomer one substituent is above the ring while the other substituent is below the ring The cis and trans isomers for dibromocyclopentane are shown as an example below While the carboncarbon single bonds of the rings can rotate partially there is NO way to interconvert between the cis and trans isomers Cis and trans isomers are unique compounds with their own unique melting points boiling points densities etc Further explanation In general if any two sp carbons in a ring have two different substituent groups not counting other ring atoms stereoisomerism is possible This is similar to the substitution pattern that gives rise to stereoisomers in alkenes indeed one might view a double bond as a twomembered ring Four other examples of this kind of stereoisomerism in cyclic compounds are shown below If more than two ring carbons have different substituents not counting other ring atoms the stereochemical notation distinguishing the various isomers becomes more complex However we can always state the relationship of any two substituents using cis or trans For example in the trisubstitutued cyclohexane below we can say that the methyl group is cis to the ethyl group and trans to the chlorine We can also say that the ethyl group is trans to the chlorine We cannot however designate the entire molecule as a cis or trans isomer Exercise Draw the following molecules transdimethylcyclohexane

disubstituted cycloalkanes using ballandstick molecular models Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below constitutional isomer stereoisomer cistrans isomers Previously constitutional isomers have been defined as molecules that have the same molecular formula but different atom connectivity In this section a new class of isomers stereoisomers will be introduced Stereoisomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula the same atom connectivity but they differ in the relative spatial orientation of the atoms Cycloalkanes are similar to openchain alkanes in many respects They both tend to be nonpolar and relatively inert One important difference is that cycloalkanes have much less freedom of movement than openchain alkanes As discussed in Sections and openchain alkanes are capable of rotation around their carboncarbon sigma bonds The ringed structures of cycloalkanes prevent such free rotation causing them to be more rigid and somewhat planar Disubstituted cycloalkanes are one class of molecules that exhibit stereoisomerism dibromocyclopentane can exist as two different stereoisomers cisdibromocyclopentane and transdibromocyclopentane The cisdibromocyclopentane and transdibromocyclopentane stereoisomers of dibromocyclopentane are shown below Both molecules have the same molecular formula and the same atom connectivity They differ only in the relative spatial orientation of the two bromines on the ring In cisdibromocyclopentane both bromine atoms are on the same face of the cyclopentane ring while in transdibromocyclopentane the two bromines are on opposite faces of the ring Stereoisomers require an additional nomenclature prefix be added to the IUPAC name in order to indicate their spatial orientation Disubstituted cycloalkane stereoisomers are designated by the nomenclature prefixes cis Latin meaning on this side and trans Latin meaning across Interactive Element The D Structure of cisdibromocyclopentane Interactive Element The D Structure of transdibromocyclopentane Representing D Structures By convention chemists use heavy wedgeshaped bonds to indicate a substituent located above the plane of the ring coming out of the page a dashed line for bonds to atoms or groups located below the ring going back into the page and solid lines for bonds in the plane of the page In general if any two sp carbons in a ring have two different substituent groups not counting other ring atoms cistrans stereoisomerism is possible However the cistrans designations are not used if both groups are on the same carbon For example the chlorine and the methyl group are on the same carbon in chloromethylcyclohexane and the trans prefix should not be used If more than two ring carbons have substituents the stereochemical notation distinguishing the various isomers becomes more complex and the prefixes cis and trans cannot be used to formally name the molecule However the relationship of any two substituents can be informally described using cis or trans For example in the trisubstituted cyclohexane below the methyl group is cis to the ethyl group and also trans to the chlorine However the entire molecule cannot be designated as either a cis or trans isomer Later sections will describe how to name these more complex molecules Sequence Rules for Specifying Configuration Example Name the following cycloalkanes Solution These two example represent the two main ways of showing spatial orientation in cycloalkanes a In example a the cycloalkane is shown as being flat and in the plane of the page The positioning of the substituents is shown by using dashwedge bonds Cistrans positioning can be determined by looking at the type of bonds attached to the substituents If the substituents are both on the same side of the ring Cis they would both have either dash bonds or wedge bonds If the the substituents are on opposite side of the ring Trans one substituent would have a dash bond and the other a wedge bond Because both bromo substituents have a wedge bond they are one the same side of the ring and are cis The name of this molecule is cisDibromocyclohexane b Example b shows the cycloalkane ring roughly perpendicular to the plane of the page When this is done the upper and lower face of the ring is defined and each carbon in the ring will have a bond one the upper face and a bond on the lower face Cis substituents will either both be on the upper face or the lower face Trans substituents will have one on the upper face and one one the lower face In example b one of the methyl substituents is on the upper face of the ring and one is on the lower face which makes them trans to each other The name of this molecule is transDimethylcyclopropane

about the relative positions of the indicated hydrogens Name the following compounds Solutions Both the OH and the methyl group have wedge bonds This implies that they are both on the same side of the testosterone ring making them cis Two of the hydrogens have wedge bonds while one has a wedge This means two of the hydrogens are on one side of the testosterone ring while one is on the other side

a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris A How Are FunctionalGroup Classifications UsefulB Classifications by Reaction TypesContributors and Attributions There are a number of recurring types of structural features in organic compounds that commonly are known as functional groups In fact a traditional approach to the subject of organic chemistry involves the classification of compounds according to their functional groups Thus the structural features and are the functional groups of alkenes alkynes carbonyl compounds alcohols amines and nitriles respectively It will be helpful to look at the structural features of some of the major types of organic compounds even though the details of their chemistry will not be discussed until later chapters Examples of the structures arranged in accord with their functional groups are given in Table The examples chosen are representative of compounds containing carbon and hydrogen hydrocarbons as well as compounds containing halogens oxygen nitrogen and sulfur We do not expect you to memorize this table In time you will become familiar with all of the types of structures in it In Table we generally have used systematic names as firstchoice names because these names emphasize the relationships between the compounds and ease the burden fo the beginning student in having to remember many special names We have little hope that systematic names such as methanal propanone and ethanoic acid soon will replace the commonly used nonsystematic names formaldehyde acetone and acetic acid But there is no question that every organic chemist knows what compounds the names methanal propanone and ethanoic acid represent so the beginner can communicate with these names and later become familiar with and use the special names We will have more to say on this subject in Chapter A How Are FunctionalGroup Classifications Useful One of the main reasons for classifying compounds by their functional groups is that it also classifies their chemical behavior By this we mean that the reactions of compounds and to some extent their physical properties are influenced profoundly by the nature of the functional groups present Indeed many organic reactions involve transformations of the functional group that do not affect the rest of the molecule For instance alcohols can be transformed into a number of other compounds such as organic halides or ethers and amines without changing the structure of the hydrocarbon group Furthermore any compound possessing a particular functional group may be expected to exhibit reactions characteristic of that group and to some extent at least of inorganic compounds with similar functional groups A good example of the use of the functionalgroup concept is for acidbase properties Alcohols are structurally related to water in that both possess a hydroxyl function We may then expect the chemistry of alcohols to be similar to that of water In fact both are weak acids because the group has a reactive proton that it can donate to a sufficiently strongly basic substance written as here Water and alcohols both are weak bases because the oxygens of their groups have unshared electron pairs to use in bonding with a proton donated by an acid We can carry the analogy further to include carboxylic acids which also have a hydroxyl function They also should possess acidic and basic properties They do have these properties and they are in fact stronger acids than either water or alcohols and form salts with bases Amines are structurally related to ammonia and we therefore may predict that they will have similar properties A property of ammonia that you probably will have encountered earlier is that it acts as a base and forms salts with acids Amines behave likewise It is with logic of this kind inferring chemical behavior from structural analogies that much of organic chemistry can be understood There are other logical classification schemes however and one of these depends more on types of reactions than on functional groups B Classifications by Reaction Types The rationale of classification by reaction types is that different functional groups may show the same kinds of reactions Thus as we have just seen alcohols carboxylic acids and amines all can accept a proton from a suitably strong acid Fortunately there are very few different types of organic reactions at least as far as the overall result that they produce The most important are acidbase substitution addition elimination and rearrangement reactions Some examples of these are given below and you should understand that these are descriptive of the overall chemical change and nothing is implied as to how or why the reaction occurs also see Section I Substitution of one atom or group of atoms for another Addition usually to a double or triple bond Elimination which is the reverse of addition Rearrangement where one structure is converted to an isomeric structure Certain reactions commonly are described as either oxidation or reduction reactions and most simply can be thought of as reactions that result in changes in the oxygen or hydrogen content of a molecule by direct or indirect reactions with oxygen or hydrogen respectively They frequently fall into one of the categories already mentioned Reduction of ethene to ethane is clearly addition as is oxidation of ethene to oxacyclopropane Reactions that lead to substantial degradation of molecules into smaller fragments are more difficult to classify An example is the combustion of ethane to carbon dioxide and water All of the chemical bonds in the reactants are broken in this reaction It seems pointless to try to classify this as anything but a complete combustion or oxidation reaction

following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions To understand ionic reactions we need to be able to recognize whether a particular reagent will act to acquire an electron pair or to donate an electron pair Reagents that acquire an electron pair in chemical reactions are said to be electrophilic electronloving We can picture this in a general way as a heterolytic bond breaking of compound by an electrophile such that becomes bonded to by the electron pair of the bond Thus Reagents that donate an electron pair in chemical reactions are said to be nucleophilic nucleus loving Thus the bond also can be considered to be broken by the nucleophile which donates its electron pair to while leaves as with the electrons of the bond Thus by definition electrophiles are electronpair acceptors and nucleophiles are electronpair donors These definitions correspond closely to definitions used in the generalized theory of acids and bases proposed by G N Lewis According to Lewis an acid is any substance that can accept an electron pair and a base is any substance that can donated an electron pair to form a covalent bond Therefore acids must be electrophiles and bases must be nucleophiles For example the methyl cation may be regarded as a Lewis acid or an electrophile because it accepts electrons from reagents such as chloride ion or methanol In turn because chloride ion and methanol donate electrons to the methyl cation they are classified as Lewis bases or nucleophiles The generalized Lewis concept of acids and bases also includes common protontransfer reactions Thus water acts as a base because one of the electron pairs on oxygen can abstract a proton from a reagent such as hydrogen fluoride Alternatively the hydronium ion is an acid because it can accept electrons from another reagent eg fluoride ion by donating a proton A proton donor can be classified as an electrophile and a proton acceptor as a nucleophile For example hydrogen chloride can transfer a proton to ethene to form the ethyl cation Therefore hydrogen chloride functions as the electrophile or acid and ethene functions as the nucleophile or base What then is the difference between an acid and an electrophile or between a base and nucleophile No great difference until we try to use the terms in a quantitative sense For example if we refer to acid strength or acidity this means the position of equilibrium in an acidbase reaction The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid or the is a quantitative measure of acid strength The larger the value of or the smaller the the stronger the acid A summary of the relationships between and follow where the quantities in brackets are concentrations or By definition and hence or However in referring to the strength of reagents as electrophiles or nucleophiles we usually are not referring to chemical equilibria but to reaction rates A good nucleophile is a reagent that reacts rapidly with a particular electrophile In contrast a poor nucleophile reacts only slowly with the same electrophile Consequently it should not then be taken for granted that there is a parallel between the acidity or basicity of a reagent and its reactivity as an electrophile or nucleophile For instance it is incorrect to assume that the strengths of a series of bases in aqueous solution will necessarily parallel their nucleophilicities toward a carbon electrophile such as methyl chloride The important difference is that the strength of the base is determined in an equilibrium reaction whereas its nucleophilicity is determined by its reactivity in slow substitution reactions To put it another way the base strength corresponds to the overall energy change of a reaction while the nucleophilicity corresponds to the activation energy of a reaction see Figure Even so it turns out that most strong bases are good nucleophiles and that most strong proton acids are good electrophiles We will see that the converse may not be true Good nucleophiles are not always strong bases examples are and and good electrophiles are not always strong acids by either the BronstedLowry or Lewis definitions examples are In what follows we will be concerned with the rates of ionic reactions under nonequilibrium conditions We shall use the term nucleophilic repeatedly and we want you to understand that a nucleophile is any neutral or charged reagent that supplies a pair of electrons either bonding or nonbonding to form a new covalent bond In substitution reactions the nucleophile usually is an anion or a neutral molecule or The operation of each of these is illustrated in the following equations for reactions of the general compound and some specific examples An electrophile is any neutral or charged reagent that accepts an electron pair from a nucleophile to form a new bond In the preceding substitution reactions the electrophile is The electrophile in other reactions may be a carbon cation or a proton donor as in the following examples The concept of an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor is due to Bronsted and Lowry Previous to this time acids and bases generally were defined as substances that functioned by forming or in water solutions The BronstedLowry concept was important because it liberated acidbase phenomena from the confines of watercontaining solvents by focusing attention on proton transfers rather than the formation of or The Lewis concept of generalized acids and bases further broadened the picture by showing the relationship between proton transfers and reactions where an electronpair acceptor is transferred from one electronpair donor to another Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content

format Contributors and Attributions All hydrocarbons are attacked by oxygen at elevated temperatures and if oxygen is in excess complete combustion occurs to carbon dioxide and water The heat evolved in this process the heat of the combustion reaction is a measure of the amount of energy stored in the and bonds of the hydrocarbon compared to the energy stored in the products carbon dioxide and water It can be measured experimentally with considerable accuracy and generally is reported as the amount of heat in kilocalories liberated on complete combustion of one mole of hydrocarbon when the reactants and the products are in standard states and at the same temperature usually Not all chemical reactions that occur spontaneously liberate heat some actually absorb heat By convention is given a negative sign when heat is evolved exothermic reaction and a positive sign when heat is absorbed endothermic reaction The heat evolved or absorbed also is called the enthalpy change For the combustion of of methane at we find by experiment corrected from constant volume to constant pressure if necessary that the reaction is exothermic by This statement can be expressed as follows with The symbol denotes that the reactants and products are in the gaseous state except for the water which is liquid If we wish to have with gaseous water as the product we have to make a correction for the heat of vaporization of water at The task of measuring the heats of all chemical reactions is a formidable one and about as practical as counting grains of sand on the beach However it is of practical interest to be able to estimate heats of reaction and this can be done quite simply with the aid of bond energies The necessary bond energies are given in Table and it is important to notice that they apply only to complete dissociation of gaseous substances to gaseous atoms at Also they do not apply without suitable corrections to many compounds such as benzene that have more than one double bond This limitation will be discussed in Chapters and To calculate for the combustion of one mole of methane first we break bonds as follows using for the energy of each of the bonds and then for the energy of the double bond in oxygen Then we make bonds using for each bond in carbon dioxide and for each of the bonds in water The net sum of these values is which is reasonably close to the value of for the heat of combustion of one mole of methane determined experimentally The same type of procedure can be used to estimate values for many other kinds of reactions of organic compounds in the vapor phase at Moreover if appropriate heats of vaporization are available it is straightforward to compute for vaporphase reactions of substances which are normally liquids or solids at The special problems that arise when solutions and ionic substances are involved are considered in Chapters and It is important to recognize that the bond energies listed in Table for all molecules other than diatomic molecules are average values That the bond energy is stated to be does not mean that if the hydrogens of methane were detached one by one would have to be put in at each step Actually the experimental evidence is in accord with quite different energies for the separate dissociation steps The moral is that we should try to avoid using the bond energies in Table as a measure of for the dissociation of just one bond in a polyatomic molecule For this we need what are called bonddissociation energies some of which are given in Table The values given have been selected to emphasize how structure influences bond energy Thus bond energies in alkanes decrease in the order primary secondary tertiary likewise bonds decrease in strength along the series How accurate are values calculated from bond energies Generally quite good provided nonbonded interactions between the atoms are small and the bond angles and distances are close to the normal values Section B A few examples of calculated and experimental heats of combustion of some hydrocarbons are given in Table Negative discrepancies represent heats of combustion smaller than expected from the average bond energies and positive values correspond to larger than expected heats of combustion Comparing isomers in Table we see that methylpropane and tetramethylbutane give off less heat when burned than do butane and octane and this is a rather general characteristic result of chain branching Cyclopropane has a of combustion of greater than expected from bond energies and this clearly is associated with the abnormal bond angles in the ring These matters will be discussed in detail in Chapter For cyclohexane which has normal bond angles the heat of combustion is close to the calculated value In this book we use kilocalories in place of the presently recommended SI joules for units of energy As of the date of writing it is not clear just how general the use of the joule will become among chemists To convert calories to joules or to multiply by You may wonder how a reaction such as combustion of methane can occur at The fact is that the reaction can be carried out at any desired temperature The important thing is that the value we are talking about here is the heat liberated or absorbed when you start with the reactants at and finish with the products at As long as is defined this way it does not matter at what temperature the reaction actually occurs Standard states for gases are partial pressure Standard states for liquids or solids usually are the pure liquid or solid at external pressure Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under

Learning Objective Draw interpret and convert between Lewis Kekule Condensed and Bondline Structures Note The review of general chemistry in sections is integrated into the above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and Common bonding patterns in organic structures The Lewis structure below of one of the four nucleoside building blocks that make up DNA can appear complex and confusing at first glance Fortunately common bonding patterns occur that can allow for simplifications when drawing structures The rules for the simplifies structures rely on the neutral bonding patterns for carbon orygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur primarily Since organic compounds have a hydrocarbon backbone the atoms that are NOT carbon and hydrogen are called heteroatoms deoxycytidine contains seven heteroatoms four oxygen atoms land three nitrogen atoms Heteroatoms are a primary source of chemical reactivity for organic chemistry Heteroatoms atoms in an organic compound that are NOT carbon or hydrogen typically oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur The ability to quickly and efficiently draw large structures and determine formal charges is not terribly hard to come by all it takes is a few shortcuts and some practice at recognizing common bonding patterns Lets start with carbon the most important element for organic chemists Carbon is said to be tetravalent meaning that it tends to form four bonds If you look at the simple structures of methane methanol ethane ethene and ethyne in the figures from the previous section you should quickly recognize that in each molecule the carbon atom has four bonds and a formal charge of zero This is a pattern that holds throughout most of the organic molecules we will see but there are also exceptions style typetextcssstyle In carbon dioxide the carbon atom has double bonds to oxygen on both sides OCO Later on in this chapter and throughout this book we will see examples of organic ions called carbocations and carbanions in which a carbon atom bears a positive or negative formal charge respectively If a carbon has only three bonds and an unfilled valence shell in other words if it does not fulfill the octet rule it will have a positive formal charge If on the other hand it has three bonds plus a lone pair of electrons it will have a formal charge of Another possibility is a carbon with three bonds and a single unpaired free radical electron in this case the carbon has a formal charge of zero One last possibility is a highly reactive species called a carbene in which a carbon has two bonds and one lone pair of electrons giving it a formal charge of zero You may encounter carbenes in more advanced chemistry courses but they will not be discussed any further in this book You should certainly use the methods you have learned to check that these formal charges are correct for the examples given above More importantly you will need before you progress much further in your study of organic chemistry to simply recognize these patterns and the patterns described below for other atoms and be able to identify carbons that bear positive and negative formal charges by a quick inspection The pattern for hydrogens is easy hydrogen atoms have only one bond and no formal charge The exceptions to this rule are the proton H and the hydride ion H which is a proton plus two electrons Because we are concentrating in this book on organic chemistry as applied to living things however we will not be seeing naked protons and hydrides as such because they are too reactive to be present in that form in aqueous solution Nonetheless the idea of a proton will be very important when we discuss acidbase chemistry and the idea of a hydride ion will become very important much later in the book when we discuss organic oxidation and reduction reactions As a rule though all hydrogen atoms in organic molecules have one bond and no formal charge Let us next turn to oxygen atoms Typically you will see an oxygen bonding in three ways all of which fulfill the octet rule If it has two bonds and two lone pairs as in water it will have a formal charge of zero If it has one bond and three lone pairs as in hydroxide ion it will have a formal charge of If it has three bonds and one lone pair as in hydronium ion it will have a formal charge of When we get to our discussion of free radical chemistry in chapter we will see other possibilities such as where an oxygen atom has one bond one lone pair and one unpaired free radical electron giving it a formal charge of zero For now however concentrate on the three main nonradical examples as these will account for virtually everything we see until chapter Nitrogen has two major bonding patterns both of which fulfill the octet rule If a nitrogen has three bonds and a lone pair it has a formal charge of zero If it has four bonds and no lone pair it has a formal charge of In a fairly uncommon bonding pattern negatively charged nitrogen has two bonds and two lone pairs Two third row elements are commonly found in biological organic molecules sulfur and phosphorus Although both of these elements have other bonding patterns that are relevant in laboratory chemistry in a biological context sulfur almost always follows the same bondingformal charge pattern as oxygen while phosphorus is present in the form of phosphate ion PO where it has five bonds almost always to oxygen no lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Remember that atoms of elements in the third row and below in the periodic table have expanded valence shells with d orbitals available for bonding and the the octet rule does not apply Finally the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are very important in laboratory and medicinal organic chemistry but less common in naturally occurring organic molecules Halogens in organic compounds usually are seen with one bond three lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Sometimes especially in the case of bromine we will encounter reactive species in which the halogen has two bonds usually in a threemembered ring two lone pairs and a formal charge of These rules if learned and internalized so that you dont even need to think about them will allow you to draw large organic structures complete with formal charges quite quickly Once you have gotten the hang of drawing Lewis structures it is not always necessary to draw lone pairs on heteroatoms as you can assume that the proper number of electrons are present around each atom to match the indicated formal charge or lack thereof Occasionally though lone pairs are drawn if doing so helps to make an explanation more clear Exercise Draw one structure that corresponds to each of the following molecular formulas using the common bonding patters covered above Be sure to include all lone pairs and formal charges where applicable and assume that all atoms have a full valence shell of electrons More than one correct answer

halides Halogen containing organic compounds are relatively rare in terrestrial plants and animals The thyroid hormones T and T are exceptions as is fluoroacetate the toxic agent in the South African shrub Dichapetalum cymosum known as gifblaar However the halogen rich environment of the ocean has produced many interesting natural products incorporating large amounts of halogen Some examples are shown below The ocean is the largest known source for atmospheric methyl bromide and methyl iodide Furthermore the ocean is also estimated to supply of atmospheric methyl chloride with other significant contributions coming from biomass burning salt marshes and woodrotting fungi Many subsequent chemical and biological processes produce polyhalogenated methanes Synthetic organic halogen compounds are readily available by direct halogenation of hydrocarbons and by addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes Many of these have proven useful as intermediates in traditional synthetic processes Some halogen compounds shown in the box have been used as pesticides but their persistence in the environment once applied has led to restrictions including banning of their use in developed countries Because DDT is a cheap and effective mosquito control agent underdeveloped countries in Africa and Latin America have experienced a dramatic increase in malaria deaths following its removal and arguments are made for returning it to limited use T and D are common herbicides that are sold by most garden stores Other organic halogen compounds that have been implicated in environmental damage include the polychloro and polybromobiphenyls PCBs and PBBs used as heat transfer fluids and fire retardants and freons eg CClF and other chlorofluorocarbons used as refrigeration gases and fire extinguishing agents Alkyl halides provide nice examples for learning about two very important organic reaction mechanism types nucleophilic substitution and betaelimination In learning about these mechanisms in the context of alkyl halide reactivity we will also learn some very fundamental ideas about three main players in many organic reactions nucleophiles electrophiles and leaving groups Well start with an overview of the substitution and elimination reactions which alkyl halides undergo Contributors Learning Objective predict the products and specify the reagents for SN SN E and E reactions with stereochemistry propose mechanisms for SN SN E and E reactions draw interpret and apply Reaction Energy Diagrams for SN SN E and E reactions Summary of Reaction Patterns Having discussed the many factors that influence nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions of alkyl halides we must now consider the practical problem of predicting the most likely outcome when a given alkyl halide is reacted with a given nucleophile As we noted earlier several variables must be considered the most important being the structure of the alkyl group and the nature of the nucleophilic reactantIn general in order for an SN or E reaction to occur the relevant carbocation intermediate must be relatively stable Strong nucleophile favor substitution and strong bases especially strong hindered bases such as tertbutoxide favor elimination The nature of the halogen substituent on the alkyl halide is usually not very significant if it is Cl Br or I In cases where both SN and E reactions compete chlorides generally give more elimination than do iodides since the greater electronegativity of chlorine increases the acidity of betahydrogens Indeed although alkyl fluorides are relatively unreactive when reactions with basic nucleophiles are forced elimination occurs note the high electronegativity of fluorine The following table summarizes the expected outcome of alkyl halide reactions with nucleophiles It is assumed that the alkyl halides have one or more betahydrogens making elimination possible and that low dielectric solvents eg acetone ethanol tetrahydrofuran ethyl acetate are used When a high dielectric solvent would significantly influence the reaction this is noted in red Note that halogens bonded to sp or sp hybridized carbon atoms do not normally undergo substitution or elimination reactions with nucleophilic reagents Nucleophile Anionic Nucleophiles Weak Bases I Br SCN N CHCO RS CN etc pKas from to left to right Anionic Nucleophiles Strong Bases HO RO pKas Neutral Nucleophiles HO ROH RSH RN pKas ranging from to Alkyl Group Primary RCH Rapid SN substitution The rate may be reduced by substitution of βcarbons as in the case of neopentyl Rapid SN substitution E elimination may also occur eg ClCHCHCl KOH CHCHCl SN substitution N S O Secondary RCH SN substitution and or E elimination depending on the basicity of the nucleophile Bases weaker than acetate pKa give less elimination The rate of substitution may be reduced by branching at the βcarbons and this will increase elimination E elimination will dominate SN substitution N S O In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be formed slowly Tertiary RC E elimination will dominate with most nucleophiles even if they are weak bases No SN substitution due to steric hindrance In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be expected E elimination will dominate No SN substitution will occur In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed E elimination with nitrogen nucleophiles they are bases No SN substitution In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Allyl HCCHCH Rapid SN substitution for º and ºhalides For ºhalides a very slow SN substitution or if the nucleophile is moderately basic E elimination In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be observed Rapid SN substitution for º halides E elimination will compete with substitution in ºhalides and dominate in the case of ºhalides In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles will give SN substitution in the case of º and ºhalides ºhalides will probably give E elimination with nitrogen nucleophiles they are bases In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Water hydrolysis will be favorable for º ºhalides Benzyl CHCH Rapid SN substitution for º and ºhalides For ºhalides a very slow SN substitution or if the nucleophile is moderately basic E elimination In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be observed Rapid SN substitution for º halides note there are no β hydrogens E elimination will compete with substitution in ºhalides and dominate in the case of ºhalides In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles will give SN substitution in the case of º and ºhalides ºhalides will probably give E elimination with nitrogen nucleophiles they are bases In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Water hydrolysis will be favorable for º ºhalides Experimental Observations Experimental observations are reported for the following reactions These reactions include a range of alkyl halide structures in a variety of reaction conditions to illustrate the reaction patterns summarized above In describing these it is useful to designate the halogenbearing carbon as alpha and the carbon atoms adjacent to it as beta as noted in the first four equations shown below Replacement or substitution of the halogen on the αcarbon colored maroon by a nucleophilic reagent is a commonly observed reaction as shown in equations below Also since the electrophilic character introduced by the halogen extends to the βcarbons and since nucleophiles are also bases the possibility of base induced HX elimination must also be considered as illustrated by equation Finally there are some combinations of alkyl halides and nucleophiles that fail to show any reaction over a hour period such as the example in equation For consistency alkyl bromides have been used in these examples Similar reactions occur when alkyl chlorides or iodides are used but the speed of the reactions and the exact distribution of products will change In order to understand why some combinations of alkyl halides and nucleophiles give a substitution reaction whereas other combinations give elimination and still others give no observable reaction we must investigate systematically the way in which changes in reaction variables perturb the course of the reaction The following general equation summarizes the factors that will be important in such an investigation Friendly Reminder One conclusion relating the structure of the Rgroup to possible products should be immediately obvious If R has no betahydrogens an elimination reaction is not possible unless a structural rearrangement occurs first The first four halides shown on the left below do not give elimination reactions on treatment with base because they have no βhydrogens The two halides on the right do not normally undergo such reactions because the potential elimination products have highly strained double or triple bonds It is also worth noting that sp hybridized CX compounds such as the three on the right do not normally undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions unless other functional groups perturb the double bonds

nd order substitution reactions Predicting SN vs SN mechanisms When considering whether a nucleophilic substitution is likely to occur via an SN or SN mechanism we really need to consider three factors The electrophile when the leaving group is attached to a methyl group or a primary carbon an SN mechanism is favored here the electrophile is unhindered by surrounded groups and any carbocation intermediate would be highenergy and thus unlikely When the leaving group is attached to a tertiary allylic or benzylic carbon a carbocation intermediate will be relatively stable and thus an SN mechanism is favored These patterns of reactivity of summarized below Alkyl Halide Structure Possible Substitution Reactions methyl and primary SN only secondary SN and SN tertiary SN only primary and secondary benzylic and allylic SN and SN tertiary benzylic and allylic SN only vinyl and aryl NO reaction The nucleophile powerful nucleophiles especially those with negative charges favor the SN mechanism Weaker nucleophiles such as water or alcohols favor the SN mechanism The solvent Polar aprotic solvents favor the SN mechanism by enhancing the reactivity of the nucleophile Polar protic solvents favor the SN mechanism by stabilizing the transition state and carbocation intermediate SN reactions are called solvolysis reactions when the solvent is the nucleophile These patterns of reactivity are summarized in the table below Comparison between SN and SN Reactions Reaction Parameter SN SN alkyl halide structure methyl primary secondary tertiary tertiary secodary primary

nucleophile and a polar protic solvent well assume that methanol is the solvent Thus wed confidently predict an SN reaction mechanism Because substitution occurs at a chiral carbon we can also predict that the reaction will proceed with racemization In the reaction below on the other hand the electrophile is a secondary alkyl bromide with these both SN and SN mechanisms are possible depending on the nucleophile and the solvent In this example the nucleophile a thiolate anion is strong and a polar protic solvent is used so the SN mechanism is heavily favored The reaction is expected to proceed with inversion of configuration Exercise Determine whether each substitution reaction shown below is likely to proceed by an SN or SN mechanism and explain your reasoning Answer a SN bc primary alkyl

mechanism when reacted with a strong nucleophile and weak base in a polar aprotic solvent A Geometric IsomerismB ChiralityC Optical ActivityD Properties of EnantiomersContributors and Attributions A Geometric Isomerism We have defined isomers in a very general way as nonidentical molecules that possess the same number and kind of atoms However there are several ways in which isomers can be nonidentical Among the alkenes and butene are position isomers because in these compounds the double bond has a different position in the carbon chain Most but not all alkenes have stereoisomers that are not identical because of different spatial arrangements of the component atoms Thus there are two stereoisomers of butene that differ in the geometric arrangement of the groups attached to the double bond In one isomer both methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond cisbutene and in the other the methyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond transbutene The two isomers clearly have the same structural framework but they differ in the arrangement of this framework in space hence the designation stereoisomers They owe their separate existence to the fact that the double bond is rigid and the parts of the molecule are not free to rotate with respect to each other about this bond Therefore the isomers do not interconvert without breaking the double bond and they exist as different compounds each with its own chemical and physical properties Ballandstick models of cis and transbutene are shown in Figure and the rigidity of the double bond is simulated in the model by a pair of stiff springs or bent sticks connecting the two carbons of the double bond It should be clear to you that there will be no cistrans isomers of alkenes in which one end of the double bond carries identical groups Thus we don not expect there to be cistrans isomers of butene or methylpropene and Figure Ballandstick models of cis and transbutene indeed none are known You may wish to verify this by making ballandstick models of these substances Ring formation also confers rigidity on molecular structure such that rotation about the ring bonds is prevented As a result stereoisomerism of the cistrans type is possible For example dimethylcyclopropane exists in two forms that differ in the arrangement of the two methyl groups with Figure Ballandstick models of cis and trans isomers of dimethylcyclopropane respect to the ring In the cis isomer the methyl groups both are situated above or below the plane of the ring and in the trans isomer they are situated one above and one below as shown in Figure Interconversion of these isomers does not occur without breaking one or more chemical bonds Stereoisomers that do not interconvert rapidly under normal conditions and therefore are stable enough to be separated specifically are called configurational isomers Thus cis and transbutene are configurational isomers as are cis and transdimethylcyclopropane The terms cistrans isomerism or geometric isomerism commonly are used to describe configurational isomerism in compounds with double bonds and rings When referring to the configuration of a particular isomer we mean to specify its geometry For instance the isomer of dichloroethene shown below has the trans configuration the isomer of dichlorocyclobutane has the cis configuration Cistrans isomerism is encountered very frequently By one convention the configuration of a complex alkene is taken to correspond to the configuration of the longest continuous chain as it passes through the double bond Thus the following compound is transethylmethylheptene despite the fact that two identical groups are cis with respect to each other because the longest continuous chain is trans as it passes through the double bond Notice that cistrans isomerism is not possible at a carboncarbon triple bond as for butyne because the bonding arrangement at the triply bonded carbons is linear Many compounds have more than one double bond and each may have the potential for the cis or trans arrangement For example hexadiene has three different configurations which are designated as transtrans ciscis and transcis Because the two ends of this molecule are identically substituted the transcis becomes identical with cistrans B Chirality The most important type of stereoisomerism is that which arises when molecules possess two structures that are not identical and also are mirror images of one another This is not a difficult or unfamiliar concept Many things around us such as our hands and pairs of shoes are not identical and also are mirror images of one another In the same way nonidentical molecules exist in which the only distinction between them is that one is the mirror image of the other A common statement is that such isomers are mirror images of one another but these images are not superimposable A simple example of this type of stereoisomerism is chlorobutane which can exist in two spatial configurations and that correspond to reflections of each other These isomers are specifically called enantiomers To be convinced that there really are two nonidentical forms of this molecule you should construct molecular models of both configurations and try to superimpose them as in Figure If you put and together and and together you find that and are on opposite sides and and are on opposite sides No matter how you turn the models around they cannot be superimposed unless you break bonds at the number carbon and interchange the positions of any two atoms or groups Compounds that lack reflection symmetry meaning that they are not identical with their mirror images are said to be chiral pronounced kirall rhymes with spiral This term is derived from the Greek word hand and handedness or chirality is a property of dissymmetric molecules such that two configurational isomers are possible that are nonidentical mirror images Compounds that possess reflection symmetry meaning that they are identical with their mirror images are said to be achiral Enantiomers are not possible for achiral compounds An enantiomeric pair is a pair of substances whose molecules are nonidentical mirror images The pressing question at this point is how can we tell whether a substances will be chiral or achiral The most common origin of chirality in molecules and the one originally recognized by vant Hoff and Le Bel is the presence of one or more atoms usually carbon atoms each of which forms coplanar bonds to four different atoms or groups This is the case for chlorobutane because the second tetrahedral carbon along the chain is bonded to four different groups hydrogen chlorine methyl and ethyl Therefore there is a pair of enantiomers and Another example is bromochlorotrifluoroethane which is a widely used inhalation anaesthetic The four different groups in this case are hydrogen chlorine bromine and trifluoromethyl the pair of enantiomers is shown in Structures and The atom that carries the four different substituents in and or and is called a chiral atoms or chiral center The latter is the more general term because as we shall see later Section A dissymmetry in molecules need not be centered at an atom Figure Use of ballandstick models to show nonidentity of the enantiomers of chlorobutane and In evaluating a chemical structure for chirality you should look for carbons carrying four different attached groups There may be more than one chiral carbon and you should be alert to the fact that structural differences in the attached groups do not necessarily show up at the first or even the second position along a chain As an example consider the chirality of trimethylcyclohexane Carbons and are clearly achiral because each is connected to two identical groups which for these atoms are hydrogens The same is true for because it is connected to two groups You might conclude that also is an achiral position because it is connected to two groups But this would be wrong If you look farther you will see that the groups attached to actually are different and are and Therefore trimethylcyclohexane has a chiral center at In contrast the isomer has no chiral centers because the groups attached to the ring at are identical Several other terms that we shall use frequently in addition to chirality are racemic mixture resolution and racemization A mixture of equal amounts of both enantiomers is a racemic mixture separation of a racemic mixture into its component enantiomers is a resolution and the conversion of either enantiomer into equal parts of both is called racemization C Optical Activity Until recently the phenomenon of chirality has been better known as optical isomerism and configurational isomers that are enantiomers were referred to as optical antipodes The reasons for this are mainly historical It was discovered early in the nineteenth century that many compounds whether solid liquid or gas have the property of rotating the plane of polarization of polarized light and can be said to be optically active A satisfactory explanation of the origin of optical activity came much later and developed in its modern form from the classic researches of Louis Pasteur and from the concept of the threedimensional carbon atoms expressed independently by J H vant Hoff and J A Le Bel Pasteurs contribution to stereochemistry came as a result of his studies of the shapes of crystals of tartaric acid and its salts Tartaric acid a byproduct of wine production was known to be optically active and Pasteur showed that it and nineteen different salts of it all formed crystals that were not identical with their mirror images A different substance known as racemic acid for which we can write the same condensed formula was known to be optically inactive and Pasteur expected that when he crystallized this acid or its salts he would obtain crystals that would be identical with their mirror images However crystallization of the sodium ammonium salt of racemic acid from water at temperatures below gave crystals of two different shapes and these shapes were mirror images of one another Pasteur carefully picked apart the two kinds of crystals and showed that one of them was identical with the corresponding salt of tartaric acid except that it rotated the plane of polarization of polarized light in the opposite direction This separation of racemic acid into two optically active forms now is called a resolution of racemic acid On the basis of his discoveries Pasteur postulated that optical isomerism had to be related to the molecular dissymmetry of substances such that nonidentical mirrorimage forms could exist However it remained for vant Hoff and Le Bel to provide almost simultaneously a satisfactory explanation at the molecular level In his first published work on tetrahedral carbon vant Hoff said it appears more and more that the present constitutional formulae are incapable of explaining certain cases of isomerism the reason for this is perhaps the fact that we need a more definite statement about the actual positions of the atoms He goes on to discuss the consequences of the tetrahedral arrangements of atoms about carbon explicitly in connection with optical isomerism and geometric or cistrans isomerism It is not easy for the chemist of today to appreciate fully the contributions of these early chemists because we have long accepted the tetrahedral carbon as an experimentally established fact At the time the concept was enunciated however even the existence of atoms and molecules was questioned openly by many scientists and to ascribe shapes to what in the first place seemed like metaphysical conceptions was too much for many to accept D Properties of Enantiomers Optical activity is an experimentally useful property and usually is measured as the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization of polarized light passing through solutions of the substances under investigation Figure Where measurable optical activity is present it is found that one enantiomer rotates the plane of polarization in one direction whereas the other causes the plane to rotate equally but in the opposite direction With reference to the plane of incident light the enantiomer that rotates the plane to the right is called dextrorotatory and is symbolized by either d or the enantiomer that rotates the plane to the left is levorotatory symbolized by l or A racemic mixture then can be designated as dl or and will have no net optical rotation It is very important to know that d l or do not designate configurations Thus although butanol actually has configuration and butanol has configuration there is no simple way to predict that a particular sign of rotation will be associated with a particular configuration Methods used in assigning the true configurations to enantiomers will be discussed later Figure Schematic representation of the rotation of the plane of polarization of polarized light by an optically active compound Planepolarized light is different from ordinary light in that its electrical component vibrates in a plane rather than in all directions The angle is the angle between the plane of polarization of light entering the sample and the plane of polarization of the emerging light A very important point to keep in mind about any pair of enantiomers is that they will have identical chemical and physical properties except for the signs of their optical rotations with one important proviso All of the properties to be compared must be determined using achiral reagents in a solvent made up of achiral molecules or in short in an achiral environment Thus the melting and boiling points but not the optical rotations of and will be identical in an achiral environment How a chiral environment or chiral reagents influence the properties of substances such as and will be considered in Chapter In the older literature chiral centers often are called asymmetric centers and you may be confused by the difference between asymmetric and dissymmetric Both asymmetric and dissymmetric molecules or objects are chiral An asymmetric object has no symmetry at all and looks different from all angles of view Formulas and represent asymmetric molecules A dissymmetric molecule is chiral but looks the same from more than one angle of view A helical spring is dissymmetric it looks the same from each end We will encounter dissymmetric molecules later The tetrahedral carbon was first proposed by E Paterno in see SectionE but he apparently did not recognize its implications for chirality These implications were recognized first by vant Hoff and Le Bel with vant Hoff proceeding on the basis of bonds to carbon being directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron Le Bel was opposed to such a rigid formulation of the bonds to carbon An interesting account and references to vant Hoffs early work can be found in The Reception of J H vant Hoffs Theory of the Asymmetric Carbon by H A M Snelders J Chem Educ A century has passed since vant Hoff first published his theory which he did before he

When using ballandstick models if one allows the sticks to rotate in the holes it will be found that for ethane an infinite number of different atomic orientations are possible depending on the angular relationship the socalled torsional angle between the hydrogens on each carbon Two extreme orientations or conformations are shown in Figure In endon views of the models the eclipsed conformation is seen to have the hydrogens on the forward carbon directly in front of those on the back carbon The staggered conformation has each of the hydrogens on the forward carbon set between each of the hydrogens on the back carbon It has not been possible to obtain separate samples of ethane that correspond to these or intermediate orientations because actual ethane molecules appear to have essentially free rotation about the single bond joining the carbons Free or at least rapid rotation is possible around all single bonds except when the carbons are part of a ring as in cyclopropane or cyclohexane Figure Two rotational conformations of ethane For ethane and its derivatives the staggered conformations are more stable than the eclipsed conformations The reason for this in ethane is not wholly clear but doubtless depends on the fact that in the staggered conformation the bonding electrons are as far away from one another as possible and give the least interelectronic repulsion With groups larger than hydrogen atoms substituted on ethane carbons spacefilling models usually show less interference steric hindrance for staggered conformations than for eclipsed conformations Figure Potentialenergy curve for rotation about the bond in ethane The energy difference between eclipsed and staggered ethane is approximately This is shown in Figure as the height of the peaks eclipsed forms separating the valleys staggered forms on a curve showing the potential energy of ethane as the methyl groups rotate with respect to each other through Rotation then is not strictly free because there is a energy barrier to overcome on eclipsing the hydrogens Even so the barrier is low enough that rotation is very rapid at room temperature occurring on the order of times per second Figure Six rotational conformations about the bond of butane The forward groups are shown here as rotating counterclockwise with respect to the rear groups In butane a rotation about the central bond allows the molecule to pass through three different eclipsed arrangements and three different staggered arrangements as shown in Figure Experiment shows that butane favors the staggered form in which the methyl groups are farthest apart This form is called the anti or trans conformation sometimes conformer and of the molecules of butane exist in this form at room temperature The other two staggered forms and are called gauche syn or skew conformations and have a torsional angle of between the two methyl groups Forms and actually are nonidentical mirror images but bond rotation is so rapid that the separate enantiomeric conformations cannot be isolated The populations of the two gauche forms are equal at room temperature of each so any optical rotation caused by one form is exactly canceled by an opposite rotation caused by the other Figure Conformational energies and rotational barriers in butane the difference in energy between the anti and gauche forms is The energies are relative to conformation as zero The populations of the eclipsed forms of butane like the eclipsed forms of ethane are small and represent energy maxima for the molecule as rotation occurs about the central bond The energy differences between the butane conformations are represented diagrammatically in Figure The valleys correspond to staggered forms and the energy difference between the anti and gauche forms is Pioneering work in the field of conformational analysis was contributed by O Hassel Norway and D R H Barton Britain for which they shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry in Hassels work involved the physical determination of preferred conformations of small molecules whereas Barton was the first to show the general importance of conformation to chemical reactivity Study of conformations and conformational equilibria has direct application to explaining the extraordinary specificity exhibited by compounds of biological importance The compounds of living systems are tailormade to perform highly specific or even unique functions by virtue of their particular configurations and conformations This is by no means a trivial amount of energy the

projections and sawhorse structures correlate energies of conformations with rotational energy diagrams and predict the most stable conformations for butane Butane Conformations Now lets consider butane with its fourcarbon chain There are now three rotating carboncarbon bonds to consider but we will focus on the middle bond between C and C Below are two representations of butane in a conformation which puts the two CH groups C and C in the eclipsed position with the two CC bonds at a o dihedral angle If we rotate the front blue carbon by clockwise the butane molecule is now in a staggered conformation This is more specifically referred to as the gauche conformation of butane Notice that although they are staggered the two methyl groups are not as far apart as they could possibly be A further rotation of gives us a second eclipsed conformation B in which both methyl groups are lined up with hydrogen atoms One more rotation produces another staggered conformation called the anti conformation where the two methyl groups are positioned opposite each other a dihedral angle of o As with ethane the staggered conformations of butane are energy valleys and the eclipsed conformations are energy peaks However in the case of butane there are two different valleys and two different peaks The gauche conformation is a higher energy valley than the anti conformation due to steric strain which is the repulsive interaction caused by the two bulky methyl groups being forced too close together Clearly steric strain is lower in the anti conformation In the same way steric strain causes the eclipsed A conformation where the two methyl groups are as close together as they can possibly be to be higher in energy than the two eclipsed B conformations The diagram below summarizes the relative energies for the various eclipsed staggered and gauche conformations The following diagram illustrates the change in potential energy that occurs with rotation about the CC bond at smaller rotational increments Potential curve vs dihedral angle of the CC bond of butane Because the anti conformation staggered is lowest in energy and also simply for ease of

this compound analyze the stability of cyclobutane cyclopentane and their substituted derivatives in terms of angular strain torsional strain and steric interactions Study Notes Notice that in both cyclobutane and cyclopentane torsional strain is reduced at the cost of increasing angular angle strain Although the customary line drawings of simple cycloalkanes are geometrical polygons the actual shape of these compounds in most cases is very different Cyclopropane is necessarily planar flat with the carbon atoms at the corners of an equilateral triangle The º bond angles are much smaller than the optimum º angles of a normal tetrahedral carbon atom and the resulting angle strain dramatically influences the chemical behavior of this cycloalkane Cyclopropane also suffers substantial eclipsing strain since all the carboncarbon bonds are fully eclipsed Cyclobutane reduces some bondeclipsing strain by folding the outofplane dihedral angle is about º but the total eclipsing and angle strain remains high Cyclopentane has very little angle strain the angles of a pentagon are º but its eclipsing strain would be large about kJmol if it remained planar Consequently the fivemembered ring adopts nonplanar puckered conformations whenever possible Rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar However this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring Cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations Cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring Cyclic systems are a little different from openchain systems In an open chain any bond can be rotated º going through many different conformations That complete rotation isnt possible in a cyclic system because the parts that would be trying to twist away from each other would still be connected together Thus cyclic systems have fewer degrees of freedom than aliphatic systems they have restricted rotation Because of the restricted rotation of cyclic systems most of them have much more welldefined shapes than their aliphatic counterparts Lets take a look at the basic shapes of some common rings Many biologically important compounds are built around structures containing rings so its important that we become familiar with them In nature three to sixmembered rings are frequently encountered so well focus on those Cyclopropane A three membered ring has no rotational freedom whatsoever A plane is defined by three points so the three carbon atoms in cyclopropane are all constrained to lie in the same plane This lack of flexibility does not allow cyclopropane to form more stable conformers which are nonplanar The main source of ring strain in cyclopropane is angle strain All of the carbon atoms in cyclopropane are tetrahedral and would prefer to have a bond angle of o The angles in an equilateral triangle are actually o about half as large as the optimum angle The large deviation from the optimal bond angle means that the CC sigma bonds forming the cyclopropane ring are bent Maximum bonding occurs when the overlapping orbitals are pointing directly toward each other The severely strained bond angles in cyclopropane means that the orbitals forming the CC bonds overlap at a slight angle making them weaker This strain is partially overcome by using socalled banana bonds where the overlap between orbitals is no longer directly in a line between the two nuclei as shown here in three representations of the bonding in cyclopropane The constrained nature of cyclopropane causes neighboring CH bonds to all be held in eclipsed conformations Cyclopropane is always at maximum torsional strain This strain can be illustrated in a Newman projections of cyclopropane as shown from the side Newman Projection of cyclopropane Cyclopropane isnt large enough to introduce any steric strain Steric strain does not become a factor until we reach six membered rings Before that point rings are not flexible enough to allow for two ring substituents to interact with each other Interactive Element The D Structure of Cyclopropane The combination of torsional and angle strain creates a large amount of ring strain in cyclopropane which weakens the CC ring bonds kJmol when compared to CC bonds in openchain propane kJmol Cyclobutane Cyclobutane is a four membered ring The larger number of ring hydrogens would cause a substantial amount of torsional strain if cyclobutane were planar In three dimensions cyclobutane is flexible enough to buckle into a puckered shape which causes the CH ring hydrogens to slightly deviate away from being completely eclipsed This conformation relives some of the torsional strain but increases the angle strain because the ring bond angles decreases to o In a line drawing this butterfly shape is usually shown from the side with the near edges drawn using darker lines The deviation of cyclobutanes ring CH bonds away from being fully eclipsed can clearly be seen when viewing a Newman projections signed down one of the CC bond Newman projection of cyclobutane With bond angles of o rather than o degrees cyclobutane has significant amounts of angle strain but less than in cyclopropane Although torsional strain is still present the neighboring CH bonds are not exactly eclipsed in the cyclobutanes puckered conformation Steric strain is very low Cyclobutane is still not large enough that substituents can reach around to cause crowding Overall the ring strain in cyclobutane kJmol is slightly less than cyclopropane kJmol Interactive Element The D Structure of Cyclobutane Cyclopentane Cyclopentanes are even more stable than cyclobutanes and they are the secondmost common cycloalkane ring in nature after cyclohexanes Planar cyclopentane has virtually no angle strain but an immense amount of torsional strain To reduce torsional strain cyclopentane addops a nonplanar conformation even though it slightly increases angle strain The lowest energy conformation of cyclopentane is known as the envelope with four of the ring atoms in the same plane and one out of plane notice that this shape resembles an envelope with the flap open The outofplane carbon is said to be in the endo position endo means inside The envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope However the neighboring carbons are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap D structure of cyclopentane notice that the far top right carbon is the endo position At room temperature cyclopentane undergoes a rapid bond rotation process in which each of the five carbons takes turns being in the endo position Cyclopentane distorts only very slightly into an envelope shape in which one corner of the pentagon is lifted up above the plane of the other four The envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope by allowing the bonds to be in an almost completely staggared position However the neighboring bonds are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap Viewing a Newman projections of cyclopentane signed down one of the CC bond show the staggered CH bonds Newman projection of cyclopentane The angle strain in the envelope conformation of cyclopentane is low The ideal angle in a regular pentagon is about o very close to the preferred o tetrahedral bond angle There is some torsional strain in cyclopentane The envelope conformation reduces torsional strain by placing some bonds in nearly staggered positions However other bonds are still almost fully eclipsed Cyclopentane is not large enough to allow for steric strain to be created Overall cyclopentane has very little ring strain kJmol when compared to cyclopropane and cyclobutane Interactive Element The D Structure of Cyclopentane CC Cycloalkanes in Nature If one of the carboncarbon bonds is broken in cyclopropane or cyclobutane the ring will spring open releasing energy as the bonds reassume their preferred tetrahedral geometry The effectiveness of two antibiotic drugs fosfomycin and penicillin is due in large part to the high reactivity of the three and fourmembered rings in their structures One of the most important fivemembered rings in nature is a sugar called ribose DNA and RNA are both constructed upon backbones derived from ribose Pictured below is one thymidine T deoxynucleotide from a stretch of DNA Since the ribose has lost one of the OH groups at carbon of the ribose ring this is part of a deoxyribonucleic acid DNA If the OH at carbon of the ribose ring was present this would be part of a ribonucleic acid RNA The lowestenergy conformations for ribose are envelope forms in which either C or C are endo on the same side as the C substituent Exercises If cyclobutane were to be planar how many HH eclipsing interactions would there be Assuming kJmol per HH eclipsing interaction what would the strain be on this planar molecule In the two conformations of

the first structure which is lower energy while they are gauche in the second structure increasing strain within the molecule The ring carbon attached to the methyl group would most likely be the endo carbon The large methyl group would create the most torsional strain if eclipsed Being in the endo position would place the bonds is a more staggered position which would reduce strain Questions Q If

section you should be able to explain why cyclohexane rings are free of angular strain draw the structure of a cyclohexane ring in the chair conformation Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below chair conformation twistboat conformation We will find that cyclohexanes tend to have the least angle strain and consequently are the most common cycloalkanes found in nature A wide variety of compounds including hormones pharmaceuticals and flavoring agents have substituted cyclohexane rings Example hormone testosterone which contains three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring Rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar However this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring Cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations Cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring Cyclohexane has the possibility of forming multiple conformations each of which have structural differences which lead to different amounts of ring strain Conformations of Cyclohexane A planar structure for cyclohexane is clearly improbable The bond angles would necessarily be º º larger than the ideal tetrahedral angle Also every carbonhydrogen bond in such a structure would be eclipsed The resulting angle and eclipsing strains would severely destabilize this structure The ring strain of planar cyclohexane is in excess of kJmol so it rarely discussed other than in theory Cyclohexane in the strained planar configuration showing how the hydrogens become eclipsed Chair Conformation of Cyclohexane The flexibility of cyclohexane allows for a conformation which is almost free of ring strain If two carbon atoms on opposite sides of the sixmembered ring are bent out of the plane of the ring a shape is formed that resembles a reclining beach chair This chair conformation is the lowest energy conformation for cyclohexane with an overall ring strain of kJmol In this conformation the carboncarbon ring bonds are able to assume bonding angles of o which is very near the optimal tetrahedral o so angle strain has been eliminated Also the CH ring bonds are staggered so torsional strain has also been eliminated This is clearly seen when looking at a Newman projection of chair cyclohexane sighted down the two central CC bonds Newman projection of cyclohexane Interactive Element The D Structure of Chair Cyclohexane How to Draw the Chair Conformation Boat Conformation of Cyclohexane The Boat Conformation of cyclohexane is created when two carbon atoms on opposite sides of the sixmembered ring are both lifted up out of the plane of the ring creating a shape which slightly resembles a boat The boat conformation is less stable than the chair form for two major reasons The boat conformation has unfavorable steric interactions between a pair of hydrogens the socalled flagpole hydrogens that are forced to be very close together Å This steric hindrance creates a repulsion energy of about kJmol An additional cause of the higher energy of the boat conformation is that adjacent hydrogen atoms on the bottom of the boat are forced into eclipsed positions For these reasons the boat conformation about kJmol less stable than the chair conformation A boat structure of cyclohexane the interfering flagpole hydrogens are shown in red TwistBoat Conformation of Cyclohexane The boat form is quite flexible and by twisting it at the bottom created the twistboat conformer This conformation reduces the strain which characterized the boat conformer The flagpole hydrogens move farther apart the carbons they are attached to are shifted in opposite directions one forward and one back and the eight hydrogens along the sides become largely but not completely staggered Though more stable than the boat conformation the twistboat sometimes skewboat conformation is roughly kJmol less stable than the chair conformation A twistboat structure of cyclohexane Half Chair Conformation of Cyclohexane Cyclohexane can obtain a partially plane conformation called half chair but with only with excessive amounts of ring strain The half chair conformation is formed by taking planar cyclohexane and lifting one carbon out of the plane of the ring The half chair conformation has much of the same strain effects predicted by the fully planar cyclohexane In the planar portion of half chair cyclohexane the CC bond angles are forced to o which creates significant amounts of angle strain Also the corresponding CH bonds are fully eclipsed which create torsional strain The outofplane carbon allows for some of the rings bond angles to reach o and for some of CH bonds to not be fully eclipsed Overall the half chair conformation is roughly kJmol less stable than the chair conformation Conformation Changes in Cyclohexane Ring Flips Cyclohexane is rapidly rotating between the two most stable conformations known as the chair conformations in what is called the ring flip shown below The importance of the ring flip will be discussed in the next section Ring flip describes the rapid equilibrium of cyclohexane rings between the two chair conformations It is important to note that one chair does not immediately become the other chair rather the ring must travel through the higher energy conformations as transitions At room temperature the energy barrier created by the half chair conformation is easily overcome allowing for equilibration between the two chair conformation on the order of times per second Although cyclohexane is continually converting between these different conformations the stability of the chair conformation causes it to comprises more than of the equilibrium mixture at room temperature Image of energy

stereoisomers of dimethylcyclohexaneSummary of Disubstitued Cyclohexane Chair ConformationsConformational Analysis of Complex Six Membered Ring StructuresExercisesSolutionsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to use conformational analysis to determine the most stable conformation of a given disubstituted cyclohexane Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below conformational analysis Study Notes When faced with the problem of trying to decide which of two conformers of a given disubstituted cyclohexane is the more stable you may find the following generalizations helpful A conformation in which both substituents are equatorial will always be more stable than a conformation with both groups axial When one substituent is axial and the other is equatorial the most stable conformation will be the one with the bulkiest substituent in the equatorial position Steric bulk decreases in the order tertbutyl isopropyl ethyl methyl hydroxyl halogens Monosubstituted Cyclohexanes In the previous section it was stated that the chair conformation in which the methyl group is equatorial is more stable because it minimizes steric repulsion and thus the equilibrium favors the more stable conformer This is true for all monosubstituted cyclohexanes The chair conformation which places the substituent in the equatorial position will be the most stable and be favored in the ring flip equilibrium Disubstituted Cyclohexanes Determining the more stable chair conformation becomes more complex when there are two or more substituents attached to the cyclohexane ring To determine the stable chair conformation the steric effects of each substituent along with any additional steric interactions must be taken into account for both chair conformations In this section the effect of conformations on the relative stability of disubstituted cyclohexanes is examined using the two principles Substituents prefer equatorial rather than axial positions in order to minimize the steric strain created of diaxial interactions The more stable conformation will place the larger substituent in the equatorial position Disubstituted Cyclohexanes The more stable chair conformation can often be determined empirically or by using the energy values of steric interactions previously discussed in this chapter Note in some cases there is no discernable energy difference between the two chair conformations which means they are equally stable dimethylcyclohexane does not have cis or trans isomers because both methyl groups are on the same ring carbon Both chair conformers have one methyl group in an axial position and one methyl group in an equatorial position giving both the same relative stability The steric strain created by the diaxial interactions of a methyl group in an axial position versus equatorial is kJmol from Table so both conformers will have equal amounts of steric strain Thus the equilibrium between the two conformers does not favor one or the other Note that both methyl groups cannot be equatorial at the same time without breaking bonds and creating a different molecule However if the two groups are different as in tertbutylmethylcyclohexane then the equilibrium favors the conformer in which the larger group tertbutyl in this case is in the more stable equatorial position The energy cost of having one tertbutyl group axial versus equatorial can be calculated from the values in table and is approximately kJmol The conformer with the tertbutyl group axial is approximately kJmol kJmol kJmol less stable then the conformer with the tertbutyl group equatorial Solving for the equilibrium constant K shows that the equatorial is preferred about over axial This means that tertbutylmethylcyclohexane will spend the majority of its time in the more stable conformation with the tertbutyl group in the equatorial position Cis and trans stereoisomers of dimethylcyclohexane In cisdimethylcyclohexane both chair conformations have one methyl group equatorial and one methyl group axial As previously discussed the axial methyl group creates kJmol of steric strain due to diaxial interactions It is important to note that both chair conformations also have an additional kJmol of steric strain created by a gauche interaction between the two methyl groups Overall both chair conformations have kJmol of steric strain and are of equal stability In transdimethylcyclohexane one chair conformer has both methyl groups axial and the other conformer has both methyl groups equatorial The conformer with both methyl groups equatorial has no diaxial interactions however there is till kJmol of strain created by a gauche interaction The conformer with both methyl groups axial has four Diaxial interactions which creates x kJmol kJmol of steric strain This conformer is kJmol kJmol kJmol less stable than the other conformer The equilibrium will therefore favor the conformer with both methyl groups in the equatorial position Cis and trans stereoisomers of dimethylcyclohexane A similar conformational analysis can be made for the cis and trans stereoisomers of dimethylcyclohexane For cisdimethylcyclohexane one chair conformation has both methyl groups in axial positions creating diaxial interactions The other conformer has both methyl groups in equatorial positions thus creating no diaxial interaction Because the methyl groups are not on adjacent carbons in the cyclohexane rings gauche interactions are not possible Even without energy calculations it is simple to determine that the conformer with both methyl groups in the equatorial position will be the more stable conformer For transdimethylcyclohexane both conformations have one methyl axial and one methyl group equatorial Each conformer has one methyl group creating a diaxial interaction so both are of equal stability Summary of Disubstitued Cyclohexane Chair Conformations When considering the conformational analyses discussed above a pattern begins to form There are only two possible relationships which can occur between ringflip chair conformations AAEE One chair conformation places both substituents in axial positions creating diaxial interactions The other conformer places both substituents in equatorial positions creating no diaxial interactions This diequatorial conformer is the more stable regardless of the substituents AEEA Each chair conformation places one substituent in the axial position and one substituent in the equatorial position If the substituents are the same there will be equal diaxial interactions in both conformers making them equal in stability However if the substituents are different then different diaxial interactions will occur The chair conformation which places the larger substituent in the equatorial position will be favored Substitution type Chair Conformation Relationship csdisubstituted cyclohexanes AEEA transdisubstituted cyclohexanes AAEE cisdisubstituted cyclohexanes AAEE transdisubstituted cyclohexanes AEEA cisdisubstituted cyclohexanes AEEA transdisubstituted cyclohexanes AAEE Example For cischloromethylcyclohexane draw the most stable chair conformation and determine the energy difference between the two chair conformers Solution Based on the table above cisdisubstitued cyclohexanes should have two chair conformations each with one substituent axial and one equatorial Based on this we can surmise that the energy difference of the two chair conformations will be based on the difference in the diaxial interactions created by the methyl and chloro substituents As predicted each chair conformer places one of the substituents in the axial position Because the methyl group is larger and has a greater diaxial interaction than the chloro the most stable conformer will place it the equatorial position as shown in the structure on the right Using the diaxial energy values given in the previous sections we can calculate that the conformer on the right is kJmol kJmol kJmol more stable than the other Example For transchloromethylcyclohexane draw the most stable chair conformation and determine the energy difference between the two chair conformers Solution Based on the table above transdisubstitued cyclohexanes should have one chair conformation with both substituents axial and one conformation with both substituents equatorial Based on this we can predict that the conformer which places both substituents equatorial will be the more stable conformer The energy difference of the two chair conformations will be based on the diaxial interactions created by both the methyl and chloro substituents As predicted one chair conformer places both substituents in the axial position and other places both substituents equatorial The more stable conformer will place both substituents in the equatorial position as shown in the structure on the right Using the diaxial energy values given in the previous sections we can calculate that the conformer on the right is kJmol kJmol kJmol more stable than the other Conformational Analysis of Complex Six Membered Ring Structures Cyclohexane can have more than two substituents Also there are multiple six membered rings which contain atoms other than carbon All of these systems usually form chair conformations and follow the same steric constraints discussed in this section Because the most commonly found rings in nature are six membered conformational analysis can often help in understanding the usual shapes of some biologically important molecules In complex six membered ring structures a direct calculation of diaxial energy values may be difficult In these cases a determination of the more stable chair conformer can be made by empirically applying the principles of steric interactions A later chapter will discuss how many sugars can exist in cyclic forms which are often six remembered rings When in an aqueous solution the six carbon sugar glucose is usually a six membered ring adopting a chair conformation When looking at the two possible ringclip chair conformations one has all of the substituents axial and the other has all the substutents equatorial Even without a calculation it is clear that the conformation with all equatorial substituents is the most stable and glucose will most commonly be found in this conformation Example The six carbon sugar fructose in aqueous solution is also a sixmembered ring in a chair conformation Which of the two possible chair conformations would be expected to be the most stable Solution The lower energy chair conformation is the one with three of the five substituents including the bulky CHOH group in the equatorial position pictured on the right The left structure has axial substituents while the structure on the right only has two axial substituents Exercises Draw the two chair conformations for cisethylmethylcyclohexane using bondline structures and indicate the more energetically favored conformation Draw the most stable

nonhydrogen substituent as axial or equatorial Predict which conformation is likely to be more stable and explain why Solutions The bulkier isopropyl groups is in the equatorial position No In order to change the relationship of two substituents on a ring from cis to trans you would need to break and reform two covalent bonds Ring flips involve only rotation of single bonds Exercises Questions Q For the following molecules draw the most stable chair conformation and explain why you chose this as an answer transdimethylcyclohexane cisdimethylcyclohexane Solutions S The most stable conformation would be to have the methyl groups equatorial reducing steric interaction The most stable conformation would be to have the groups equatorial this would reduce the strain if they were axial

eclipsing strain Study Notes You should be prepared to sketch various conformers using both sawhorse representations and Newman projections Each method has its own advantages depending upon the circumstances Notice that when drawing the Newman projection of the eclipsed conformation of ethane you cannot clearly draw the rear hydrogens exactly behind the front ones This is an inherent limitation associated with representing a D structure in two dimensions Conformational isomerism involves rotation about sigma bonds and does not involve any differences in the connectivity of the atoms or geometry of bonding Two or more structures that are categorized as conformational isomers or conformers are really just two of the exact same molecule that differ only in rotation of one or more sigma bonds Ethane Conformations Although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical Rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations In order to better visualize these different conformations it is convenient to use a drawing convention called the Newman projection In a Newman projection we look lengthwise down a specific bond of interest in this case the carboncarbon bond in ethane We depict the front atom as a dot and the back atom as a larger circle The six carbonhydrogen bonds are shown as solid lines protruding from the two carbons at angles which is what the actual tetrahedral geometry looks like when viewed from this perspective and flattened into two dimensions Interactive Element Figure A D Model of Staggered Ethane The lowest energy conformation of ethane shown in the figure above is called the staggered conformation In the staggered conformation all of the CH bonds on the front carbon are positioned at an angle of relative to the CH bonds on the back carbon This angle between a sigma bond on the front carbon compared to a sigma bond on the back carbon is called the dihedral angle In this conformation the distance between the bonds and the electrons in them is maximized Maximizing the distance between the electrons decreases the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons and results in a more stable structure If we now rotate the front CH group clockwise the molecule is in the highest energy eclipsed conformation and the hydrogens on the front carbon are as close as possible to the hydrogens on the back carbon This is the highest energy conformation because of unfavorable electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the front and back CH bonds The energy of the eclipsed conformation is approximately kcalmol kJmol higher than that of the staggered conformation Torsional strain or eclipsing strain is the name give to the energy difference caused by the increased electrostatic repulsion of eclipsing bonds Another rotation returns the molecule to a second eclipsed conformation This process can be continued all around the circle with three possible eclipsed conformations and three staggered conformations in addition to an infinite number of variations in between We will focus on the staggered and eclipsed conformers since they are respectively the lowest and highest energy conformers Unhindered Free Rotations Do Not Exist in Ethane The carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate the kcalmol torsional strain in ethane creates a barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another This rotational barrier is not large enough to prevent rotation except at extremely cold temperatures So at normal temperatures the carboncarbon bond is constantly rotating However at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other conformer The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds as shown in Figure Figure The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds Valleys in the graph represent the low energy staggered conformers while peaks represent the higher energy eclipsed conformers Although the conformers of ethane are in rapid equilibrium with each other the kcalmol energy difference leads to a substantial preponderance of staggered conformers at any given time The animation

conformations with rotational energy diagrams and predict the most stable conformations for higher alkanes Pentane and Higher Alkanes Pentane and higher alkanes have conformational preferences similar to ethane and butane Each dihedral angle tries to adopt a staggered conformation and each internal CC bond attempts to take on an anti conformation to minimize the potential energy of the molecule The most stable conformation of any unbranched alkane follows these rules to take on zigzag shapes Figure The zigzag shapes of unbranched alkanes in their most stable conformations Lets analyze the staggered conformations of pentane in more detail considering conformations about the C_ C_ and C_ C_ bonds shows a few possible permutations The most stable conformation is anti at both bonds whereas less stable conformations contain gauche interactions One gauchegauche conformer is particularly unfavorable because methyl groups are aligned with parallel bonds in close proximity This conformation

diaxial interaction compare the gauche interactions in butane with the diaxial interactions in the axial conformer of methylcyclohexane arrange a given list of substituents in increasing or decreasing order of diaxial interactions Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below diaxial interaction Study Notes Diaxial interactions are steric interactions between an axial substituent located on carbon atom of a cyclohexane ring and the hydrogen atoms or other substituents located on carbon atoms and Be prepared to draw Newmantype projections for cyclohexane derivatives as the one shown for methylcyclohexane Note that this is similar to the Newman projections from chapter such as nbutane Newman projections of methylcyclohexane and nbutane When a substituent is added to a cyclohexane ring the two possible chair conformations created during a ring flip are not equally stable In the example of methylcyclohexane the conformation where the methyl group is in the equatorial position is more stable than the axial conformation by kJmol at o C The percentages of the two different conformations at equilibrium can be determined by solving the following equation for K the equilibrium constant ΔE RTlnK In this equation ΔE is the energy difference between the two conformations R is the gas constant JmolK T is the temperature in Kelvin and K is the equilibrium constant for the ring flip conversion Using this equation we can calculate a K value of which means about methylcyclohexane molecules have the methyl group in the equatorial position at o C The energy difference between the two conformations comes from strain called diaxial interactions created when the axial methyl group experiences steric crowding with the two axial hydrogens located on the same side of the cyclohexane ring Because axial bonds are parallel to each other substituents larger than hydrogen experience greater steric crowding when they are oriented axial rather than equatorial Consequently substituted cyclohexanes will preferentially adopt conformations in which the larger substituents are in the equatorial orientation When the methyl group is in the equatorial position this strain is not present which makes the equatorial conformer more stable and favored in the ring flip equilibrium Actually diaxial steric strain is directly related to the steric strain created in the gauche conformer of butane discussed in Section When butane is in the gauche conformation kJmol of strain was created due the steric crowding of two methyl group with a o dihedral angle When looking at the a Newman projection of axial methylcyclohexane the methyl group is at a o dihedral angle with the ring carbon in the rear This creates roughly the same amount of steric strain as the gauche conformer of butante Given that there is actually two such interactions in axial methylcyclohexane it makes sense that there is kJmol kJmol of steric strain in this conformation The Newman projection of equatorial methylcyclohexane shows no such interactions and is therefore more stable Newman projections of methyl cyclohexane and butane showing similarity of diaxial and gauche interactions Strain values for other cyclohexane substituents can also be considered The relative steric hindrance experienced by different substituent groups oriented in an axial versus equatorial location on cyclohexane determined the amount of strain generated The strain generated can be used to evaluate the relative tendency of substituents to exist in an equatorial or axial location Looking at the energy values in this table it is clear that as the size of the substituent increases the diaxial energy tends to increase also Note that it is the size and not the molecular weight of the group that is important Table summarizes some of these strain values values Table A Selection of ΔG Values for the Change from Axial to Equatorial Orientation of Substituents

diaxial strain when going from a methyl substituent kJmol to an ethyl substituent kJmol why It may help to use molecular model to answer this question Solutions The ethyne group is linear and therefore does not affect the hydrogens in the positions to say to the extent as a bulkier or a bent group eg ethene group would This leads to less of a strain on the molecule The equatorial conformation of bromocyclohexane will have two diaxial interactions The table above states that each interaction accounts for kJmol of strain The total strain in equatorial bromocyclohexane will be

solved algebraically X X X X X X This means that bromocyclohexane is in the equatorial position of the time and in the axial position of the time The fact that CC sigma bonds can freely rotate allows the ethyl subsistent to obtain a conformation which places the bulky CH group away from the cyclohexane ring This forces the ethyl substituent to have only have diaxial interactions between hydrogens which only provides a slight difference to a methyl group Exercises Questions Q In the molecule cyclohexyl ethyne there is little steric strain why Solutions S The ethyne group is linear and therefore does not affect the hydrogens in the positions to say to the extent as a bulkier or a bent group eg ethene group would This leads to less of a strain on the molecule Contributors and Attributions Dr

bonds to consider but we will focus on the middle bond between C and C Below are two representations of butane in a conformation which puts the two CH groups C and C in the eclipsed position Eclipsed interaction Energy kcalmol Energy kJmol HH HCH CHCH The CHCH groups create the significantly larger eclipsed interaction of kJmol There are also two HH eclipsed interactions at kJmol each to create a total of kJmol kJmol kJmol of strain This is the highest energy conformation for butane due to torsional strain caused by the electrostatic repulsion of electrons in the eclipsed bonds but also because of another type of strain called steric repulsion between the two rather bulky methyl groups Steric strain comes about when two large groups such as two methyl groups try to occupy the same space What results is a repulsive noncovalent interaction caused by their respective electron densities If we rotate the front blue carbon by clockwise the butane molecule is now in a staggered conformation This is more specifically referred to as the gauche conformation of butane Notice that although they are staggered the two methyl groups are not as far apart as they could possibly be There is still significant steric repulsion between the two bulky groups A further rotation of gives us a second eclipsed conformation B in which both methyl groups are lined up with hydrogen atoms Due to steric repulsion between methyl and hydrogen substituents this eclipsed conformation B is higher in energy than the gauche conformation However because there is no methyltomethyl eclipsing it is lower in energy than eclipsed conformation A One more rotation produces the anti conformation where the two methyl groups are positioned opposite each other and steric repulsion is minimized The anti conformation is the lowest energy conformation for butane The diagram below summarizes the relative energies for the various eclipsed staggered and gauche conformations Interactive Element Figure

Public Domain Keministi At room temperature butane is most likely to be in the lowestenergy anti conformation at any given moment in time although the energy barrier between the anti and eclipsed conformations is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at very low temperatures For this reason and also simply for ease of drawing it is conventional to draw straightchain alkanes in a zigzag form which implies the anti conformation at all carboncarbon bonds For example octane is commonly drawn as Drawing Newman Projections Newman projections are a valuable method for viewing the relative positions of groups within molecule Being able to draw the Newman projection for a given molecule is a valuable skill and will be used repeatedly throughout organic chemistry Because organic molecules often contain multiple carboncarbon bonds it is important to precisely know which bond and which direction is being sighted for the Newman projection The details of the Newman projection change given the molecule but for typical alkanes a full conformational analysis involves a full o rotation in o increments This will produce three staggered conformers and three eclipsed conformers Typically the staggered conformers are more stable and the eclipsed conformers are less stable The least stable conformer will have the largest groups eclipsed while the most stable conformer will have the largest groups anti o to each other Example Draw the Newman projection of dimethylbutane along the CC bond Then determine the least stable conformation First draw the molecule and locate the indicated bond Because the question asks for the least stable conformation focus on the three possible eclipsed Newman projections Draw out three eclipsed Newman projections as a template Because it is difficult to draw a true staggered Newman projection it is common to show the bonds slightly askew Place the substituents attached to the second carbon C on the back bonds of all three Newman projections In this example they are CHs and an H Place the substituents in the same position on all three Newman projections Then place the substituents attached to the first carbon C on the front bonds of the Newman projection In this example the substituents are also CHs and an H Move the substituents through two o rotations to create the remaining two eclipsed Newman projections Leave the substituents on the back carbon in place Attempting to rotate the front and back carbons simultaneously is a common mistake and often leads to incorrect Newman projections Compare the Newman projections by looking the eclipsed interactions Remember that the order of torsional strain interactions are CHCH CHH HH The third structure has two CHCH torsional interactions which will make it the least stable conformer of dimethyl butane Example Draw Newman projections of the eclipsed and staggered conformations of propane as if viewed down the CC bond Answer Example Draw a Newman projection

Compounds Naming Spiro CompoundsExamplesConformations in Bicyclic Ring SystemsPolycyclic Systems in Nature ExercisesSolutionsQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to draw the structures and construct molecular models of simple polycyclic molecules Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bridgehead carbon atom polycyclic molecule Study Notes A bridgehead carbon atom is a carbon atom which is shared by at least two rings The hydrogen atom which is attached to a bridgehead carbon may be referred to as a bridgehead hydrogen Note that bicycloheptane is the systematic name of norborane You need not be concerned over the IUPAC name of norbornane The nomenclature of compounds of this type is beyond the scope of this course Nomenclature of Bicyclic Ring Systems There are many hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives with two rings having common carbon atoms There are three main ways that the two rings can be connected The first is called a fused bicyclic ring structure where the two rings share a covalent bond and a have two bridgehead carbons marked in red on the structures below A bridgehead is defined as a carbon that is part of two or more rings Hydrogens attached to bridge head carbons are often referred to as bridge head hydrogens The two rings can also be connected by a bridge containing one or more carbons to form a bridged bicyclic molecule Lastly the two rings can be joined with a singe bridge head carbon to form spiro bicyclic molecules Naming Fused and Bridged Compounds Fused and bridged bicyclic compounds are follow similar naming conventions Count the total number of carbons in both rings This is the parent name eg ten carbons in the system would be decane Count the number of carbons between the bridgeheads then place the numbers in square brackets in descending order separated by periods Fused and bridged bycyclic compounds should have three numbers such as For fused compounds one of the numbers should be zero Place the word bicyclo at the beginning of the name bicyclodecane bicyclodecane Examples with carbons and hydrogens explicitly shown Naming Spiro Compounds Spiro bicyclics are named using the same basic rules Because there is only one bridgehead carbon only two numbers will be required in the brackets Also the word spiro is placed at the beginning Examples Conformations in Bicyclic Ring Systems As expected the connection of two rings has defined effects on the possible conformations However the ideas previously discussed in this chapter can be used for conformational analysis Fused rings have the possibility of two isomers where the bridgehead hydrogens are either cis or trans along the shared bond These two isomers have significant differences in flexibility and stability as seen in bicyclodecane more commonly known as decalin If the positioning of the bridgehead hydrogens are shown in a fused ring the prefix cis or trans should be included in the name The transisomer is the easiest to describe because the fusion of the two rings creates a rigid roughly planar structure made up of two chair conformations Unlike cyclohexane the two rings cannot flip from one chair form to another Accordingly the orientation of the any substituents is fixed in either an axial or equatorial position in transdecalin This means that the CC bonds coming away from the fused edge are held in equatorial positions relative to each ring thus preventing the possibility of any diaxial interactions occurring between ring atoms Interactive Element The D Structure of TransDecalin kcal mol The two rings in cisdecalin are also both held in a chair conformations In comparison the chairchair forms of cisdecalin are relatively flexible and inversion of both rings at once occurs fairly easily Interactive Element The D Structure of CisDecalin The flexibility of cisdecalin allows for a substituent to interconvert between axial and equatorial conformations In much the same fashion as cyclohexane equatorial substituents tend to create less steric strain and create a more stable conformer A major difference in cisdecalin is the fact that one of CC bonds coming away from the fused edge is held an an axial position This is true in both ringflip conformations This axial CC bond causes diaxial interactions to occur in cisdecalin making it roughly kJmol less stable than transdecalin This amount of diaxial steric strain is roughly equivalent to that of an ethyl substituent attached to a cyclohexane ring kJmol Bicyclic compounds with a bridge typically have very little flexibility and are often held in a ridged conformation The molecule norbornane represent a cyclohexane ring connected by a single carbon bridge norbornane bicycloheptane Interactive Element The D Structure of Norbornane Norbornane is estimated to have kJmol of ring strain which can be understood when viewing the contained rings The carbon bridge in norbornane holds the cyclohexane ring at the bottom in a boat conformation creating torsional strain from eclipsing bonds along the edge Also the carbon bridge forms a cyclopentane ring shown in red below making up the right side of the structure with increased angle strain throughout the whole molecule Polycyclic Systems in Nature Fused ring systems like decalin are very common in natural products In fact similar ring systems are found in steroids which are an important class of lipids Steroids generally have structures that include three sixmembered rings and a fivemembered ring connected by three fused bonds Most natural steroids have a trans configuration at all three fusion points This tends to give steroids a rigid and semiflat structure Sex hormones are an example of steroids The primary male hormone testosterone is responsible for the development of secondary sex characteristics Two female sex hormones progesterone and estrogen or estradiol control the ovulation cycle Notice that the male and female hormones have only slight differences in structures but yet have very different physiological effects Testosterone promotes the normal development of male genital organs and is synthesized from cholesterol in the testes It also promotes secondary male sexual characteristics such as deep voice facial and body hair testosterone Interactive Element The D Structure of Estradiol The best known and most abundant steroid in the body is cholesterol Cholesterol is formed in brain tissue nerve tissue and the blood stream It is the major compound found in gallstones and bile salts Cholesterol also contributes to the formation of deposits on the inner walls of blood vessels These deposits harden and obstruct the flow of blood This condition known as atherosclerosis results in various heart diseases strokes and high blood pressure Exercises i j The following molecule is cholic acid Determine if the three fused bonds have a cis or trans

explain the partial rotation of carboncarbon single bonds in rings explain ring strain and its relationship to cycloalkane stability Cycloalkanes aka Rings Cycloalkanes have one or more rings of carbon atoms The simplest examples of this class consist of a single unsubstituted carbon ring and these form a homologous series similar to the unbranched alkanes The IUPAC names of the first five members of this series are given in the following table The last column gives the general formula for a cycloalkane of any size If a simple unbranched alkane is converted to a cycloalkane two hydrogen atoms one from each end of the chain must be lost Hence the general formula for a cycloalkane composed of n carbons is CnHn Although a cycloalkane has two fewer hydrogens than the equivalent alkane each carbon is bonded to four other atoms so such compounds are still considered to be saturated with hydrogen Table Examples of Simple Cycloalkanes Name Cyclopropane Cyclobutane Cyclopentane Cyclohexane Cycloheptane Cycloalkane Molecular Formula CH CH CH CH CH CnHn Structural Formula CHn Line Formula Although the customary line drawings of simple cycloalkanes are geometrical polygons the actual shape of these compounds in most cases is very different Cyclic systems are a little different from openchain systems In an open chain any bond can be rotated degrees going through many different conformations Complete rotation isnt possible in a cyclic system because the parts that you would be trying to twist away from each other would still be connected together Cyclic systems have fewer degrees of freedom than aliphatic systems they have restricted rotation Because of the restricted rotation of cyclic systems most of them have much more welldefined shapes than their aliphatic counterparts Lets take a look at the basic shapes of some common rings Many biologically important compounds are built around structures containing rings so its important that we become familiar with them In nature three to sixmembered rings are frequently encountered so well focus on those The Baeyer Theory and the Experimental Evidence of Ring Strain Many of the properties of cyclopropane and its derivatives are similar to the properties of alkenes In the famous German organic chemist A Baeyer suggested that cyclopropane and cyclobutane derivatives are different from cyclopentane and cyclohexane because their CCC angles cannot have the tetrahedral value of At the same time Baeyer hypothesized that the difficulties encountered in synthesizing cycloalkane rings from C upward was the result of the angle strain that would be expected if the large rings were regular planar polygons see Table Baeyer also believed that cyclohexane had a planar structure like that shown in Figure which would mean that the bond angles would have to deviate from the tetrahedral value However in the then unknown chemist H Sachse suggested that cyclohexane exists in the strainfree chair and boat forms discussed in Section This suggestion was not accepted at the time because it led to the prediction of several possible isomers for compounds such as chlorocyclohexane cf Exercise The idea that such isomers might act as a single substance as the result of rapid equilibration seemed like a needless complication and it was not until that E Mohr proposed a definitive way to distinguish between the Baeyer and Sachse cyclohexanes As will be discussed in Section the result now known as the SachseMohr theory was complete confirmation of the idea of nonplanar large rings

ethene cyclopropane cyclobutane cyclopentane cyclohexane cycloheptane cyclooctane cyclononane cyclodecane cyclopentadecane open chain alkane Ring Strain in Cycloalkanes Ring Strain occurs because the carbons in cycloalkanes are sp hybridized which means that they do not have the expected ideal bond angle of o this causes an increase in the potential energy because of the desire for the carbons to be at an ideal o An example of ring strain can be seen in the diagram of cyclopropane below in which the bond angle is o between the carbons The reason for ring strain can be seen through the tetrahedral carbon model The CCC bond angles in cyclopropane diagram above o and cyclobutane o are much different than the ideal bond angle of o This bond angle causes cyclopropane and cyclobutane to have a high ring strain However molecules such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane would have a much lower ring strain because the bond angle between the carbons is much closer to o Below are some examples of cycloalkanes Ring strain can be seen more prevalently in the cyclopropane and cyclobutane models Below is a chart of cycloalkanes and their respective heats of combustion ΔHcomb The ΔHcomb value increases as the number of carbons in the cycloalkane increases higher membered ring and the ΔHcombCH ratio decreases The increase in ΔHcomb can be attributed to the greater amount of London Dispersion forces However the decrease in ΔHcombCHcan be attributed to a decrease in the ring strain Certain cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane deal with ring strain by forming conformers A conformer is a stereoisomer in which molecules of the same connectivity and formula exist as different isomers in this case to reduce ring strain The ring strain is reduced in conformers due to the rotations around the sigma bonds Other Types of Strain There are many different types of strain that occur with cycloalkanes In addition to ring strain there is also transannular strain eclipsing or torsional strain and bond angle strainTransannular strain exists when there is steric repulsion between atoms Eclipsing torsional strain exists when a cycloalkane is unable to adopt a staggered conformation around a CC bond and bond angle strain is the energy needed to distort the tetrahedral carbons enough to close the ring The presence of angle strain in a molecule indicates that there are bond angles in that particular molecule that deviate from the ideal bond angles required ie that molecule has conformers Cyclopropane A three membered ring has no rotational freedom whatsoever so the three carbon atoms in cyclopropane are all constrained to lie in the same plane at the corners of an equilateral triangle The º bond angles are much smaller than the optimum º angles of a normal tetrahedral carbon atom and the resulting angle strain dramatically influences the chemical behavior of this cycloalkane Cyclopropane also suffers substantial eclipsing strain since all the carboncarbon bonds are fully eclipsed Furthermore if you look at a model you will find that the neighboring CH bonds CC bonds too are all held in eclipsed conformations Cyclopropane is always at maximum torsional strain This strain can be illustrated in a line drawing of cyclopropane as shown from the side In this oblique view the dark lines mean that those sides of the ring are closer to you However the ring isnt big enough to introduce any steric strain which does not become a factor until we reach six membered rings Until that point rings are not flexible enough for two atoms to reach around and bump into each other The really big problem with cyclopropane is that the CCC bond angles are all too small All the carbon atoms in cyclopropane appear to be tetrahedral These bond angles ought to be degrees The angles in an equilateral triangle are actually degrees about half as large as the optimum angle This factor introduces a huge amount of strain in the molecule called ring strain Cyclobutane Cyclobutane is a four membered ring In two dimensions it is a square with degree angles at each corner Cyclobutane reduces some bondeclipsing strain by folding the outofplane dihedral angle is about º but the total eclipsing and angle strain remains high Cyclopentane has very little angle strain the angles of a pentagon are º but its eclipsing strain would be large about kcalmol if it remained planar Consequently the fivemembered ring adopts nonplanar puckered conformations whenever possible However in three dimensions cyclobutane is flexible enough to buckle into a butterfly shape relieving torsional strain a little bit When it does that the bond angles get a little worse going from degrees to degrees In a line drawing this butterfly shape is usually shown from the side with the near edges drawn using darker lines With bond angles of rather than degrees cyclobutane has a lot of ring strain but less than in cyclopropane Torsional strain is still present but the neighbouring bonds are not exactly eclipsed in the butterfly Cyclobutane is still not large enough that the molecule can reach around to cause crowding Steric strain is very low Cyclobutanes are a little more stable than cyclopropanes and are also a little more common in nature Cyclopentane Cyclopentanes are even more stable than cyclobutanes and they are the secondmost common paraffinic ring in nature after cyclohexanes In two dimensions a cyclopentane appears to be a regular pentagon In three dimensions there is enough freedom of rotation to allow a slight twist out of this planar shape In a line drawing this threedimensional shape is drawn from an oblique view just like cyclobutane The ideal angle in a regular pentagon is about degrees very close to a tetrahedral bond angle Cyclopentane distorts only very slightly into an envelope shape in which one corner of the pentagon is lifted up above the plane of the other four and as a result ring strain is entirely removed The envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope However the neighbouring carbons are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap There is still some torsional strain in cyclopentane Again there is no steric strain in this system Rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar However this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring Cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations Cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring Exercise If cyclobutane were to be planar how many HH eclipsing interactions would there be and assuming kJmol per HH eclipsing interaction what is the strain on this planar molecule In the two conformations of ciscyclopentane one is more stable than the other Explain why this is Answer There are eclipsing interactions two per CC bond The extra strain on this molecule would be kJmol kJmol x The first conformation is more stable Even though the methyl groups are cis in the model on the left they are eclipsing due the conformation therefore increasing the strain within the molecule

shown below Several other notable cyclohexane conformations occur during the transition from one chair conformer to the other the boat the twist and the halfchair The relative energies of the conformations is a direct reflection of their relative stabilities These structural and energetic relationships are summarized in the conformational energy diagram for cyclohexane below The Chair Conformation a closer look Since the chair conformation has the lowest potential energy it is the most relevant to the conformation of cyclohexane On careful examination of a chair conformation of cyclohexane we find that the twelve hydrogens are not structurally equivalent Six of them are located about the periphery of the carbon ring and are termed equatorial The other six are oriented above and below the approximate plane of the ring three in each location and are termed axial because they are aligned parallel to the symmetry axis of the ring In the figure above the equatorial hydrogens are colored blue and the axial hydrogens are in bold Since there are two equivalent chair conformations of cyclohexane in rapid equilibrium all twelve hydrogens have equatorial and axial character The figure below illustrates how to convert a molecular model of cyclohexane between two different chair conformations this is something that you should practice with models Notice that a ring flip causes equatorial hydrogens to become axial and viceversa How to draw stereo bonds up and down bonds There are various ways to show these orientations The solid dark up wedge I used is certainly common Some people use an analogous down wedge which is light to indicate a down bond unfortunately there is no agreement as to which way the wedge should point and you are left relying on the lightness of the wedge to know it is down The down bond avoids this wedge ambiguity and just uses some kind of light line The down bond I used eg in Figure B is a dashed line IUPAC encourages a series of parallel lines something like What I did is a variation of what is recommended by IUPAC In ISISDraw the up wedge and down bond that I used along with other variations are available from a tool button that may be labeled with any of them depending on most recent use It is located directly below the tool button for ordinary CC bonds In Symyx Draw the up wedge and down bond along with other variations are

are going on in organic chemistry you should Be careful The precise zigs and zags and the angles of substituents are all important Your textbook may offer you some hints for how to draw chairs A short item in the Journal of Chemical Education offers a nice trick showing how the chair can be thought of as consisting of an M and a W The article is V Dragojlovic A method for drawing the cyclohexane ring and its substituents J Chem Educ I thank M Farooq Wahab Chemistry Univ Karachi for suggesting that this article be noted here Aside from drawing the basic chair the key points in adding substituents are Axial groups alternate up and down and are shown vertical Equatorial groups are approximately horizontal but actually somewhat distorted from that so that the angle from the axial group is a bit more than a right angle reflecting the common degree bond angle As cautioned before it is usually easier to draw and see what is happening at the four corners of the chair than at the two middle positions Try to use the corners as much as possible Because axial bonds are parallel to each other substituents larger than hydrogen generally suffer greater steric crowding when they are oriented axial rather than equatorial Consequently substituted cyclohexanes will preferentially adopt conformations in which the larger substituents assume equatorial orientation When the methyl group in the structure above occupies an axial position it suffers steric crowding by the two axial hydrogens located on the same side of the ring The conformation in which the methyl group is equatorial is more stable and thus the equilibrium lies in this direction Exercise Questions Consider the conformations of cyclohexane chair boat twist boat Order them in increasing strain in the molecule Draw two

Objectives calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation DU and apply it to alkene structure Saturated and Unsaturated Molecules In the lab saturation may be thought of as the point when a solution cannot dissolve anymore of a substance added to it In terms of degrees of unsaturation a molecule only containing single bonds with no rings is considered saturated CHCHCH methyoxypentane Unlike saturated molecules unsaturated molecules contain double bonds triple bonds andor rings CHCHCHCH chlorooctyne There are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule Although nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and infrared radiation IR are the primary ways of determining molecular structures these techniques require expensive instrumentation and are not always readily available Fortunately calculating the degrees of unsaturation provides useful information about the structure The degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings within a molecule which makes it easier for one to figure out the molecular structure DU Degrees of Unsaturation number of pi bonds number of rings Alkenes RCCR and alkynes RCCR are called unsaturated hydrocarbons because they have fewer hydrogen atoms than does an alkane with the same number of carbon atoms as is indicated in the following general formulas Calculating The Degree of Unsaturation DU If the molecular formula is given plug in the numbers into this formula is the number of carbons is the number of nitrogens is the number of halogens F Cl Br I is the number of hydrogens The molecular formula of a hydrocarbon provides information about the possible structural types it may represent A saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings Another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane Thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by C which is the general molecular representation of an alkane As an example for the molecular formula CH the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is Cx The compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens Degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated Hence the DoB formula divides by The formula subtracts the number of Xs because a halogen X replaces a hydrogen in a compound For instance in chloroethane CHCl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane CH For example consider compounds having the formula CH The formula of the fivecarbon alkane pentane is CH so the difference in hydrogen content is This difference suggests such compounds may have a triple bond two double bonds a ring plus a double bond or two rings Some examples are shown here and there are at least fourteen others For a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present Therefore we add the number of nitrogens N This can be seen with CHN compared to CH Oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements As seen in alcohols the same number of hydrogens in ethanol CHOH matches the number of hydrogens in ethane CH The following chart illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for a given degree of unsaturation Each row corresponds to a different combination One degree of unsaturation is equivalent to ring or double bond bond Two degrees of unsaturation is equivalent to double bonds ring and double bond rings or triple bond bonds When the DU is or greater the presence of benzene rings is very likely DU Possible combinations of rings bonds of rings of double bonds of triple bonds Remember the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor rings For instance a degree of unsaturation of can contain

Objectives After completing this section you should be able to predict the value of ΔH for a gasphase reaction given the necessary bond dissociation energy data predict the dissociation energy of a particular bond given ΔH for a reaction involving the bond and any other necessary bond dissociation energy data outline the limitations of using bond dissociation energies to predict whether or not a given reaction will occur Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bond dissociation energy solvation Study Notes The idea of calculating the standard enthalpy of a reaction from the appropriate bond dissociation energy data should be familiar to you from your firstyear chemistry course Solvation is the interaction between solvent molecules and the ions or molecules dissolved in that solvent The homolytic bond dissociation energy is the amount of energy needed to break apart one mole of covalently bonded gases into a pair of radicals The SI units used to describe bond energy are kiloJoules per mole of bonds kJMol It indicates how strongly the atoms are bonded to each other Introduction Breaking a covalent bond between two partners AB can occur either heterolytically where the shared pair of electron goes with one partner or another or or homolytically where one electron stays with each partner The products of homolytic cleavage are radicals and the energy that is required to break the bond homolytically is called the Bond Dissociation Energy BDE and is a measure of the strength of the bond Calculation of the BDE The BDE for a molecule AB is calculated as the difference in the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants for homolysis Officially the IUPAC definition of bond dissociation energy refers to the energy change that occurs at K and the symbol is However it is commonly referred to as BDE the bond dissociation energy and it is generally used albeit imprecisely interchangeably with the bond dissociation enthalpy which generally refers to the enthalpy change at room temperature K Although there are technically differences between BDEs at K and K those difference are not large and generally do not affect interpretations of chemical processes Bond BreakageFormation Bond dissociation energy or enthalpy is a state function and consequently does not depend on the path by which it occurs Therefore the specific mechanism in how a bond breaks or is formed does not affect the BDE Bond dissociation energies are useful in assessing the energetics of chemical processes For chemical reactions combining bond dissociation energies for bonds formed and bonds broken in a chemical reaction using Hesss Law can be used to estimate reaction enthalpies Example Chlorination of Methane Consider the chlorination of methane the overall reaction thermochemistry can be calculated exactly by combining the BDEs for the bonds broken and bonds formed CH CH H BDECHH Cl Cl BDECl H Cl HCl BDEHCl CH Cl CHCl BDECHCl Because reaction enthalpy is a state function it does not matter what reactions are combined to make up the overall process using Hesss Law However BDEs are convenient to use because they are readily available Alternatively BDEs can be used to assess individual steps of a mechanism For example an important step in free radical chlorination of alkanes is the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane to form a free radical RH Cl R HCl The energy change for this step is equal to the difference in the BDEs in RH and HCl This relationship shows that the hydrogen abstraction step is more favorable when BDERH is smaller The difference in energies accounts for the selectivity in the halogenation of hydrocarbons with different types of CH bonds Table Representative CH BDEs in Organic Molecules RH Do kJmol D kJmol RH Do kJmol D kJmol CHH HCCHH CHCHH CHH CHCHH HCCH CHCH HCCHCHH HCOH CHCHH CHCOH Trends in CH BDEs It is important to remember that CH BDEs refer to the energy it takes to break the bond and is the difference in energy between the reactants and the products Therefore it is not appropriate to interpret BDEs solely in terms of the stability of the radical products as is often done Analysis of the BDEs shown in the table above shows that there are some systematic trends BDEs vary with hybridization Bonds with sp hybridized carbons are weakest and bonds with sp hybridized carbons are much stronger The vinyl and phenyl CH bonds are similar reflecting their sp hybridization The correlation with hybridization can be viewed as a reflection of the CH bond lengths Longer bonds formed with sp orbitals are consequently weaker Shorter bonds formed with orbitals that have more scharacter are similarly stronger CH BDEs vary with substitution Among sp hybridized systems methane has the strongest CH bond CH bonds on primary carbons are stronger than those on secondary carbons which are stronger than those on tertiary carbons Interpretation of CH BDEs for sp Hybridized Carbons The interpretation of the BDEs in saturated molecules has been subject of recent controversy As indicated above the variation in BDEs with substitution has traditionally been interpreted as reflecting the stabilities of the alkyl radicals with the assessment that more highly substituted radicals are more stable as with carbocations Although this is a popular explanation it fails to account fo the fact the bonds to groups other than H do not show the same types of variation R BDERCH BDERCl BDERBr BDEROH CH CHCH CHCH CHC Therefore although CCH bonds get weaker with more substitution the effect is not nearly as large as that observed with CH bonds The strengths of CCl and CBr bonds are not affected by substitution despite the fact that the same radicals are formed as when breaking CH bonds and the COH bonds in alcohols actually increase with more substitution Gronert has proposed that the variation in BDEs is alternately explained as resulting from destabilization of the reactants due to steric repulsion of the substituents which is released in the nearly planar radicals Considering that BDEs reflect the relative energies of reactants and products either explanation can account for the trend in BDEs Another factor that needs to be considered is the electronegativity The Pauling definition of electronegativity says that the bond dissociation energy between unequal partners is going to be dependent on the difference in electrongativities according to the expression where and are the electronegativities and the bond energies are in eV Therefore the variation in BDEs can be interpreted as reflecting variation in the electronegativities of the different types of alkyl fragments There is likely some merit in all three interpretations Since Gronerts original publication of his alternate explanation there have been many desperate attempts to defend the radical stability explanation References Gronert S J Org Chem Further Reading

indication of whether the reaction is fast or slow exothermic or endothermic interpret the reaction energy diagram for a singlestep process eg use the diagram to decide whether the reaction is

energy ΔG Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below activation energy ΔG reaction energy diagram transition state Study Notes You may have been taught to use the term activated complex rather than transition state as the two are often used interchangeably Similarly the activation energy of a reaction is often represented by the symbol Eact or Ea You may recall from general chemistry that it is often convenient to describe chemical reactions with energy diagrams In an energy diagram the vertical axis represents the overall energy of the reactants while the horizontal axis is the reaction coordinate tracing from left to right the progress of the reaction from starting compounds to final products The energy diagram for a typical onestep reaction might look like this Despite its apparent simplicity this energy diagram conveys some very important ideas about the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction Recall that when we talk about the thermodynamics of a reaction we are concerned with the difference in energy between reactants and products and whether a reaction is downhill exergonic energy releasing or uphill endergonic energy absorbing When we talk about kinetics on the other hand we are concerned with the rate of the reaction regardless of whether it is uphill or downhill thermodynamically First lets review what this energy diagram tells us about the thermodynamics of the reaction illustrated by the energy diagram above The energy level of the products is lower than that of the reactants This tells us that the change in standard Gibbs Free Energy for the reaction ΔGrnx is negative In other words the reaction is exergonic or downhill Recall that the ΔGrnx term encapsulates both ΔHrnx the change in enthalpy heat and ΔSrnx the change in entropy disorder where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin For chemical processes where the entropy change is small the enthalpy change is essentially the same as the change in Gibbs Free Energy Energy diagrams for these processes will often plot the enthalpy H instead of Free Energy for simplicity The standard Gibbs Free Energy change for a reaction can be related to the reactions equilibrium constant K_eq_ by a simple equation where Keq product reactant at equilibrium R JKmol or cal Kmol T temperature in Kelvin K If you do the math you see that a negative value for ΔGrnx an exergonic reaction corresponds as it should by intuition to Keq being greater than an equilibrium constant which favors product formation In a hypothetical endergonic energyabsorbing reaction the products would have a higher energy than reactants and thus ΔGrnx would be positive and Keq would be less than favoring reactants Now lets move to kinetics Look again at the energy diagram for exergonic reaction although it is downhill overall it isnt a straight downhill run First an energy barrier must be overcome to get to the product side The height of this energy barrier you may recall is called the activation energy ΔG The activation energy is what determines the kinetics of a reaction the higher the energy hill the slower the reaction At the very top of the energy barrier the reaction is at its transition state TS which is the point at which the bonds are in the process of breaking and forming The transition state is an activated complex a transient and dynamic state that unlike more stable species does not have any definable lifetime It may help to imagine a transition state as being analogous to the exact moment that a baseball is struck by a bat Transition states are drawn with dotted lines representing bonds that are in the process of breaking or forming and the drawing is often enclosed by brackets Here is a picture of a likely transition state for a substitution reaction between hydroxide and chloromethane This reaction involves a collision between two molecules for this reason we say that it has second order kinetics The rate expression for this type of reaction is rate kreactant reactant which tells us that the rate of the reaction depends on the rate constant k as well as on the concentration of both reactants The rate constant can be determined experimentally by measuring the rate of the reaction with different starting reactant concentrations The rate constant depends on the activation energy of course but also on temperature a higher temperature means a higher k and a faster reaction all else being equal This should make intuitive sense when there is more heat energy in the system more of the reactant molecules are able to get over the energy barrier Here is one more interesting and useful expression Consider a simple reaction where the reactants are A and B and the product is AB this is referred to as a condensation reaction because two molecules are coming together or condensing If we know the rate constant k for the forward reaction and the rate constant kreverse for the reverse reaction where AB splits apart into A and B we can simply take the quotient to find our equilibrium constant This too should make some intuitive sense if the forward rate constant is higher than the reverse

Applications to Organic Reactions The equation below can also be useful without performing any calculations Conceptually this equation helps us compare the energetics of reaction mechanisms to predict

underlying energetics of equilibrium the stability of charged reactants and products can be used to predict reaction equilibrium Reaction conditions can also be adjusted or controlled to shift the

between a transition state and an intermediate draw a reaction energy diagram for a given multistep process interpret the reaction energy diagram of a multistep process eg determine which of the steps is ratedetermining Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below reaction intermediate Study Notes Each step in a multistep reaction has its own activation energy The overall activation energy is the difference in energy between the reactants and the transition state of the slowest ratedetermining step The ratedetermining step that is the one that controls the overall rate of reaction is the step with the highest activation energy A second model for a nucleophilic substitution reaction is called the dissociative or SN mechanism in this picture the CX bond breaks first before the nucleophile approaches This results in the formation of a carbocation because the central carbon has only three bonds it bears a formal charge of Recall that a carbocation should be pictured as sp hybridized with trigonal planar geometry Perpendicular to the plane formed by the three sp hybrid orbitals is an empty unhybridized p orbital In the second step of this twostep reaction the nucleophile attacks the empty electron hungry p orbital of the carbocation to form a new bond and return the carbon to tetrahedral geometry We saw that SN reactions result specifically in inversion of stereochemistry at the electrophilic carbon center What about the stereochemical outcome of SN reactions In the model SN reaction shown above the leaving group dissociates completely from the vicinity of the reaction before the nucleophile begins its attack Because the leaving group is no longer in the picture the nucleophile is free to attack from either side of the planar sphybridized carbocation electrophile This means that about half the time the product has the same stereochemical configuration as the starting material retention of configuration and about half the time the stereochemistry has been inverted In other words racemization has occurred at the carbon center As an example the tertiary alkyl bromide below would be expected to form a racemic mix of R and S alcohols after an SN reaction with water as the incoming nucleophile Exercise Draw the structure of the intermediate in the twostep nucleophilic substitution reaction above Answer The SN reaction we see an example of a reaction intermediate a very important concept in the study of organic reaction mechanisms that was introduced earlier in the module on organic reactivity Recall that many important organic reactions do not occur in a single step rather they are the sum of two or more discreet bondforming bondbreaking steps and involve transient intermediate species that go on to react very quickly In the SN reaction the carbocation species is a reaction intermediate A potential energy diagram for an SN reaction shows that the carbocation intermediate can be visualized as a kind of valley in the path of the reaction higher in energy than both the reactant and product but lower in energy than the two transition states Exercise Draw structures representing TS and TS in the reaction above Use the soliddash wedge convention to show three dimensions Answer Recall that the first step of the reaction above in which two charged species are formed from a neutral molecule is much the slower of the two steps and is therefore ratedetermining This is illustrated by the energy diagram where the activation energy for the first step is higher than that for the second step Also recall that an SN reaction has first order kinetics because the rate determining step involves one molecule splitting apart not two molecules colliding We come now to the subject of catalysis Our hypothetical bowl of sugar from section is still stubbornly refusing to turn into carbon dioxide and water even though by doing so it would reach a much more stable energy state There are in fact two ways that we could speed up the process so as to avoid waiting several millennia for the reaction to reach completion We could supply enough energy in the form of heat from a flame to push some of the sugar molecules over the high energy hill Heat would be released from the resulting exothermic reaction and this energy would push more molecules over their energy hills and so on the sugar would literally burn up A second way to make the reaction go faster is to employ a catalyst You probably already know that a catalyst is an agent that causes a chemical reaction to go faster by lowering its activation energy How might you catalyze the conversion of sugar to carbon dioxide and water Its not too hard just eat the sugar and let your digestive enzymes go to work catalyzing the many biochemical reactions involved in breaking it down Enzymes are proteins and are very effective catalysts Very effective in this context means very specific and very fast Most enzymes are very selective with respect to reactant molecules they have evolved over millions of years to catalyze their specific reactions An enzyme that attaches a phosphate group to glucose for example will not do anything at all to fructose the details of these reactions are discussed in section B Glucose kinase is able to find and recognize glucose out of all of the other molecules floating around in the chemical soup of a cell A different enzyme fructokinase specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose We have already learned section that enzymes are very specific in terms of the stereochemistry of the reactions that they catalyze Enzymes are also highly regiospecific acting at only one specific part of a molecule Notice that in the glucose kinase reaction above only one of the alcohol groups is phosphorylated Finally enzymes are capable of truly amazing rate acceleration Typical enzymes will speed up a reaction by anywhere from a million to a billion times and the most efficient enzyme currently known to scientists is believed to accelerate its reaction by a factor of about see Chemical and Engineering News March p for an interesting discussion about this enzyme orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase We will now begin an exploration of some of the basic ideas about how enzymes accomplish these amazing feats of catalysis and these ideas will be revisited often throughout the rest of the text as we consider various examples of enzymecatalyzed organic reactions But in order to begin to understand how enzymes work we will first need to learn or review as the case may be a little bit about protein structure Exercises Questions Q Draw an energy diagram with a exergonic first step and an endergonic second step Label the diagram Solutions S Contributors and

section you should be able to describe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of molecular orbitals account for differences in bond length and strength in terms of the efficiency with which atomic orbitals overlap draw simple molecular orbital diagrams eg for the H molecule showing the formation of bonding and antibonding orbitals Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below antibonding molecular orbital bonding molecular orbital molecular orbital MO theory As we have seen valence bond theory does a remarkably good job of explaining the bonding geometry and properties of many organic compounds There are some areas however where the valence bond theory falls short It fails to adequately account for example for some interesting properties of compounds that contain alternating double and single bonds In order to understand these properties we need to think about chemical bonding in a new way using the ideas of molecular orbital MO theory Another look at the H molecule bonding and antibonding sigma molecular orbitals Lets consider again the simplest possible covalent bond the one in molecular hydrogen H When we described the hydrogen molecule using valence bond theory we said that the two s orbitals from each atom overlap allowing the two electrons to be shared and thus forming a covalent bond In molecular orbital theory we make a further statement we say that the two atomic s orbitals dont just overlap they actually combine to form two completely new orbitals These two new orbitals instead of describing the likely location of an electron around a single nucleus describe the location of an electron pair around two or more nuclei The bonding in H then is due to the formation of a new molecular orbital MO in which a pair of electrons is delocalized around two hydrogen nuclei An important principle of quantum mechanical theory is that when orbitals combine the number of orbitals before the combination takes place must equal the number of new orbitals that result orbitals dont just disappear We saw this previously when we discussed hybrid orbitals one s and three p orbitals make four sp hybrids When two atomic s orbitals combine in the formation of H the result is two molecular orbitals called sigma σ orbitals According to MO theory the first sigma orbital is lower in energy than either of the two isolated atomic s orbitals thus this sigma orbital is referred to as a bonding molecular orbital The second sigmastar σ orbital is higher in energy than the two atomic s orbitals and is referred to as an antibonding molecular orbital In MO theory a star sign always indicates an antibonding orbital Following the aufbau building up principle we place the two electrons in the H molecule in the lowest energy molecular orbital which is the bonding sigma orbital The bonding sigma orbital which holds both electrons in the ground state of the molecule is eggshaped encompassing the two nuclei and with the highest likelihood of electrons being in the area between the two nuclei The highenergy antibonding sigmastar orbital can be visualized as a pair of droplets with areas of higher electron density near each nucleus and a node area of zero electron density midway between the two nuclei Remember that we are thinking here about electron behavior as wave behavior When two separate waves combine they can do so with what is called constructive interference where the two amplitudes reinforce one another or destructive interference where the two amplitudes cancel one another out Bonding MOs are the consequence of constructive interference between two atomic orbitals which results in an attractive interaction and an increase in electron density between the nuclei Antibonding MOs are the consequence of destructive interference which results in a repulsive interaction and a canceling out of electron density between the nuclei in other words a node MO theory and pi bonds In p orbitals the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases analogous to how a twodimensional wave has both parts above and below the average We indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors When orbital lobes of the same phase overlap constructive wave interference increases the electron density When regions of opposite phase overlap the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes When p orbitals overlap end to end they create σ and σ orbitals If two atoms are located along the xaxis in a Cartesian coordinate system the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx bonding and σpx antibonding read as sigmapx and sigmapx star respectively Just as with sorbital overlap the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei which is a higherenergy antibonding orbital The advantage of MO theory becomes more apparent when we think about pi bonds especially in those situations where two or more pi bonds are able to interact with one another Lets first consider the pi bond in ethene from an MO theory standpoint in this example we will be disregarding the various sigma bonds and thinking only about the pi bond According to MO theory the two atomic pz orbitals combine to form two pi π molecular orbitals one a lowenergy π bonding orbital and one a highenergy πstar π antibonding molecular orbital These are sometimes denoted in MO diagrams like the one below with the Greek letter psi Ψ instead of π In the bonding Ψ orbital the two shaded lobes of the pz orbitals interact constructively with each other as do the two unshaded lobes remember the shading choice represents mathematical and signs for the wavefunction Therefore there is increased electron density between the nuclei in the molecular orbital this is why it is a bonding orbital In the higherenergy antibonding Ψ orbital the shaded lobe of one pz orbital interacts destructively with the unshaded lobe of the second pz orbital leading to a node between the two nuclei and overall repulsion By the aufbau principle the two electrons from the two atomic orbitals will be paired in the lowerenergy Ψorbital when the molecule is in the ground

are formed valence bond theory and molecularly orbital theory Valence bond theory is most often used to describe bonding in organic molecules In this model covalent bonds are considered to form from the overlap of two atomic orbitals on different atoms each orbital containing a single electron The electrons become paired in the orbital overlap bonding the atoms together The simplest example valence bond theory can be demonstrated by the H molecule We can see from the periodic table that each hydrogen atom has a single valence electron If hydrogen atoms come together to form a bond then each hydrogen atom effectively has a share in both electrons and thus each resembles the noble gas helium and is more stable The electrons shared in the orbital overlap are represented by a single dash between the atoms Valence bond theory describes a chemical bond as the overlap of atomic orbitals In the case of the hydrogen molecule the s orbital of one hydrogen atom overlaps with the s orbital of the second hydrogen atom to form a molecular orbital called a sigma bond which contains two electrons of opposite spin The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap ne more characteristic of the covalent bond in H is important to consider at this point The two overlapping s orbitals can be visualized as two spherical balloons being pressed together This means that the bond has cylindrical symmetry if we were to take a crosssectional plane of the bond at any point it would form a circle This type of bond is referred to as a σsigma bond The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap The energy diagram below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms the colored curve changes as they approach each other When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero As the atoms move together their orbitals begin to overlap Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom In addition the electrons begin to repel each other as do the nuclei While the atoms are still widely separated the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions and the energy of the system decreases A bond begins to form As the atoms move closer together the overlap increases so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei At some specific distance between the atoms which varies depending on the atoms involved the energy reaches its lowest most stable value This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is called the the bond lengths between the two atoms The bond is stable because at this point the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration Figure A Plot of Potential Energy versus Internuclear Distance for the Interaction between Two Gaseous Hydrogen Atoms This optimal internuclear distance is the bond length For the H molecule the distance is pm picometers meters Likewise the difference in potential energy between the lowest energy state at the optimal internuclear distance and the state where the two atoms are completely separated is called the bond dissociation energy or more simply bond strength For the hydrogen molecule the HH bond strength is equal to about kJmol This means it would take kJ to break one mole of HH bonds Every covalent bond in a given molecule has a characteristic length and strength In general the length of a typical carboncarbon single bond in an organic molecule is about pm while carboncarbon double bonds are about pm carbonoxygen double bonds are about pm and carbonhydrogen bonds are in the range of to pm The strength of covalent bonds in organic molecules ranges from about kJmol for a carboniodine bond in thyroid hormone for example about kJmole for a typical carbonhydrogen bond and up to over kJmole for a carboncarbon triple bond Representative Bond Energies and Lengths Exercises For the following energy diagram for energy vs

involved Memorize the number of valence electrons possessed by each of the elements commonly encountered in organic chemistry C H O N S P and the halogens When drawing any organic structure you must remember that a neutral carbon atom will almost always have four bonds Similarly hydrogen always has one bond neutral oxygen atoms have two bonds and neutral nitrogen atoms have three bonds By committing these simple rules to memory you can avoid making unnecessary mistakes later in the course The wedgeandbrokenline type of representation which helps to convey the threedimensional nature of organic compounds will be used throughout the course Bonding Overview Why are some substances chemically bonded molecules and others are an association of ions The answer to this question depends upon the electronic structures of the atoms and nature of the chemical forces within the compounds Although there are no sharply defined boundaries chemical bonds are typically classified into three main types ionic bonds covalent bonds and metallic bonds In this chapter each type of bond and the general properties found in typical substances in which the bond type occurs will be discussed Ionic bonds results from electrostatic forces that exist between ions of opposite charge These bonds typically involve a metal with a nonmetal Covalent bonds result from the sharing of electrons between two atoms The bonds typically involve one nonmetallic element with another Metallic bonds are found in solid metals copper iron aluminum with each metal atom bonded to several neighboring metal atoms and the bonding electrons are free to move throughout the dimensional structure Each bond classification is discussed in detail in subsequent sections of the chapter Lets look at the preferred arrangements of electrons in atoms when they form chemical compounds Figure G N Lewis and the Octet Rule a Lewis is working in the laboratory b In Lewiss original sketch for the octet rule he initially placed the electrons at the corners of a cube rather than placing them as we do now Lewis Symbols At the beginning of the th century the American chemist G N Lewis devised a system of symbolsnow called Lewis electron dot symbols often shortened to Lewis dot symbolsthat can be used for predicting the number of bonds formed by most elements in their compounds Each Lewis dot symbol consists of the chemical symbol for an element surrounded by dots that represent its valence electrons Lewis Dot symbols provide a convenient representation of valence electrons allows you to keep track of valence electrons during bond formation consists of the chemical symbol for the element plus a dot for each valence electron To write an elements Lewis dot symbol we place dots representing its valence electrons one at a time around the elements chemical symbol Up to four dots are placed above below to the left and to the right of the symbol in any order as long as elements with four or fewer valence electrons have no more than one dot in each position The next dots for elements with more than four valence electrons are again distributed one at a time each paired with one of the first four Fluorine for example with the electron configuration Hesp has seven valence electrons so its Lewis dot symbol is constructed as follows Figure Lewis Dot Symbols for the Elements in Period Lewis used the unpaired dots to predict the number of bonds that an element will form in a compound Consider the symbol for nitrogen in Figure The Lewis dot symbol explains why nitrogen with three unpaired valence electrons tends to form compounds in which it shares the unpaired electrons to form three bonds Boron which also has three unpaired valence electrons in its Lewis dot symbol also tends to form compounds with three bonds whereas carbon with four unpaired valence electrons in its Lewis dot symbol tends to share all of its unpaired valence electrons by forming compounds in which it has four bonds Lewis symbols are a tool to help draw structures We will see why bonding in molecular compounds follow Lewis theory in the next seciont Elements in the same period have the same number of valence electrons and similar Lewis symbols For example the electron configuration for atomic sulfur is Nesp thus there are six valence electrons Its Lewis symbol would therefore be similar oxygen and look like The Octet Rule Lewiss major contribution to bonding theory was to recognize that atoms tend to lose gain or share electrons to reach a total of eight valence electrons called an octet This socalled octet rule explains the stoichiometry of most compounds in the s and p blocks of the periodic table We now know from quantum mechanics that the number eight corresponds to one ns and three np valence orbitals which together can accommodate a total of eight electrons Remarkably though Lewiss insight was made nearly a decade before Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of the atom Common exceptions to the octet rule are helium whose s electron configuration gives it a full n shell and hydrogen which tends to gain or share its one electron to achieve the electron configuration of helium Lewiss idea of an octet explains why noble gases rarely form compounds They have the stable sp configuration full octet no charge so they have no reason to react and change their configuration All other elements attempt to gain lose or share electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration This explains why atom combine together to form compounds By forming bond the makes the atoms more stable and lower in energy Making bonds releases energy and represents a driving force for the formation of compounds Atoms often gain lose or share electrons to achieve the same number of electrons as the noble gas closest to them in the periodic table Lewis Structures Lewis structures represent how Lewis symbols gain lose or share electrons to obtain an octet by forming compounds Lewis Structures of Ionic Compounds Whenever there is a metal present in the structure of an organic compound there is a high likelihood that at least one ionic bond is present Ionic bonds are represented differently in Lewis structures than covalent bonds Great care should be taken whenever drawing the Lewis structure of an organic compounds which contains and ionic bond Ionic bonds typically are formed when a metal and a nonmetal are part of a compound Some atoms achieve an octet by fully gaining or losing electrons to form ions Ionic bonds form through the eletrostatic attraction of the created ions The formula for table salt is NaCl It is the result of Na ions and Cl ions bonding together If sodium metal and chlorine gas mix under the right conditions they will form salt The sodium loses an electron and the chlorine gains that electron In the process a great amount of light and heat is released The resulting salt is mostly unreactive it is stable It will not undergo any explosive reactions unlike the sodium and chlorine that it is made of Why Referring to the octet rule atoms attempt to get a noble gas electron configuration which is eight valence electrons Sodium ssps has one valence electron so giving it up would result in the same electron configuration as neon ssp Chlorine sspsphas seven valence electrons so if it takes one it will have eight an octet Chlorine has the electron configuration of argon sspsp when it gains an electron The Lewis structure of an ionic compound show the movement of electrons For NaCl sodium is in group and has one valence electron and chlorine is in group and has seven valence electrons Sodium loses its sole valence electron thereby becomes positively charged Chlorine gains this electron gaining a full octet and a negative charge After the gainloss of an electron the new Lewis structures of Na and Cl are written next to each other representing the ionic bond in NaCl Examples of Lewis Structures of Ionic Compounds Covalent Bonds and the Lewis Structures of Molecular Compounds While alkali metals such as sodium and potassium alkaline earth metals such as magnesium and calcium and halogens such as fluorine and chlorine often form ions in order to achieve a full octet the principle elements of organic chemistry carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen instead tend to fill their octet by sharing electrons with other atoms forming covalent bonds Consider the simplest case of hydrogen gas An isolated hydrogen atom has only one electron located in the s orbital If two hydrogen atoms come close enough so that their respective s orbitals overlap the two electrons can be shared between the two nuclei and a covalently bonded H molecule is formed In the Lewis structure of H each pair of electrons that is shared between two atoms is drawn as a single line designating a single covalent bond Hydrogen represents a special case because a hydrogen atom cannot fulfill the octet rule it needs only two electrons to have a full shell This is often called the doublet rule for hydrogen One of the simplest organic molecules is methane with the molecular formula CH Methane is the natural gas burned in home furnaces and hot water heaters as well as in electrical power generating plants To illustrate the covalent bonding in methane using a Lewis structure we first must recognize that although a carbon atom has a total of six electrons its Lewis symbol has four unpaired electrons Following Lewis theory the carbon atom wants to form four covalent bonds to fill its octet In a methane molecule the central carbon atom shares its four valence electrons with four hydrogen atoms thus forming four bonds and fulfilling the octet rule for the carbon and the doublet rule for each of the hydrogens The next relatively simple organic molecule to consider is ethane which has the molecular formula CH If we draw each atoms Lewis symbol separately we can see that the octetdoublet rule can be fulfilled for all of them by forming one carboncarbon bond and six carbonhydrogen bonds The same approach can be used for molecules in which there is no carbon atom In a water molecule the Lewis symbol of the oxygen atom has two unpaired electrons These are paired with the single electron in the Lewis symbols of the hydrogens two OH covalent bonds The remaining four nonbonding electrons on oxygen called lone pairs Since the lone pair electrons are often NOT shown in chemical structures it is important to see mentally add the lone pairs In the beginning it can be helpful to physically add the lone pair electrons Exercise For the following structure please fill in all of the missing lone pair electrons Answer When two or more electrons are shared between atoms a multiple covalent bond is formed The molecular formula for ethene also known as ethylene a compound found in fruits such as apples that signals them to ripen is CH Arranging Lewis symbols of the atoms you can see that the octetdoublet rule can be fulfilled for all atoms only if the two carbons share two pairs of electrons between them Ethene contains a carboncarbon double bond Following this pattern the triple bond in ethyne molecular formula CH also known as acetylene the fuel used in welding torches is formed when the two carbon atoms share three pairs of electrons between them Exercise Draw the Lewis structure for ammonia NH Answer Molecular Shape A stick and wedge drawing of methane shows the tetrahedral anglesThe wedge is coming out of the paper and the dashed line is going behind the paper The solid lines are in the plane of the paper The following examples make use of this notation and also illustrate the importance of including nonbonding valence shell electron pairs when viewing such configurations Methane Ammonia Water Bonding configurations are readily predicted by valenceshell electronpair repulsion theory commonly referred to as VSEPR in most introductory chemistry texts This simple model is based on the fact that electrons repel each other and that it is reasonable to expect that the bonds and nonbonding valence electron pairs associated with a given atom will prefer to be as far apart as possible The bonding configurations of carbon are easy to remember since there are only three categories Configuration Bonding Partners Bond Angles Example Tetrahedral º Trigonal Planar º Linear º Figure In the three examples shown above the central atom carbon does not have any nonbonding valence electrons consequently the configuration may be estimated from the number of bonding partners alone However for molecules of water and ammonia the nonbonding electrons must be included in the calculation In each case there are four regions of electron density associated with the valence shell so that a tetrahedral bond angle is expected The measured bond angles of these compounds HO º NH º show that they are closer to being tetrahedral than trigonal planar or linear Of course it is the configuration of atoms not electrons that defines the the shape of a molecule and in this sense ammonia is said to be pyramidal not tetrahedral The compound boron trifluoride BF does not have nonbonding valence electrons and the configuration of its atoms is trigonal Nice treatments of VSEPR theory have been provided by Oxford and Purdue The best way to study the threedimensional shapes of molecules is by using molecular models Many kinds of model kits are available to students and professional chemists Two Electron Groups Our first example is a molecule with two bonded atoms and no lone pairs of electrons BeH AX BeH The central atom beryllium contributes two valence electrons and each hydrogen atom contributes one The Lewis electron structure is Figure Lewis Structure for BeH There are two electron groups around the central atom We see from Figure that the arrangement that minimizes repulsions places the groups apart Both groups around the central atom are bonding pairs BP Thus BeH is designated as AX From Figure we see that with two bonding pairs the molecular geometry that minimizes repulsions in BeH is linear AX CO The central atom carbon contributes four valence electrons and each oxygen atom contributes six The Lewis electron structure is The carbon atom forms two double bonds Each double bond is a group so there are two electron groups around the central atom Like BeH the arrangement that minimizes repulsions places the groups apart Once again both groups around the central atom are bonding pairs BP so CO is designated as AX VSEPR only recognizes groups around the central atom Thus the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms do not influence the molecular geometry With two bonding pairs on the central atom and no lone pairs the molecular geometry of CO is linear Figure Three Electron Groups AX BCl The central atom boron contributes three valence electrons and each chlorine atom contributes seven valence electrons The Lewis electron structure is There are three electron groups around the central atom To minimize repulsions the groups are placed apart Figure All electron groups are bonding pairs BP so the structure is designated as AX From Figure we see that with three bonding pairs around the central atom the molecular geometry of BCl is trigonal planar AX CO The central atom carbon has four valence electrons and each oxygen atom has six valence electrons As you learned previously the Lewis electron structure of one of three resonance forms is represented as The structure of CO is a resonance hybrid It has three identical bonds each with a bond order of We minimize repulsions by placing the three groups apart Figure All electron groups are bonding pairs BP With three bonding groups around the central atom the structure is designated as AX We see from Figure that the molecular geometry of CO is trigonal planar In our next example we encounter the effects of lone pairs and multiple bonds on molecular geometry for the first time AXE SO The central atom sulfur has valence electrons as does each oxygen atom With valence electrons the Lewis electron structure is shown below There are three electron groups around the central atom two double bonds and one lone pair We initially place the groups in a trigonal planar arrangement to minimize repulsions Figure There are two bonding pairs and one lone pair so the structure is designated as AXE This designation has a total of three electron pairs two X and one E Because a lone pair is not shared by two nuclei it occupies more space near the central atom than a bonding pair Figure Thus bonding pairs and lone pairs repel each other electrostatically in the order BPBP LPBP LPLP In SO we have one BPBP interaction and two LPBP interactions The molecular geometry is described only by the positions of the nuclei not by the positions of the lone pairs Thus with two nuclei and one lone pair the shape is bent or V shaped which can be viewed as a trigonal planar arrangement with a missing vertex Figures and Figure The Difference in the Space Occupied by a Lone Pair of Electrons and by a Bonding Pair As with SO this composite model of electron distribution and negative electrostatic potential in ammonia shows that a lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space around the nitrogen atom than does a bonding pair of electrons that is shared with a hydrogen atom Like lone pairs of electrons multiple bonds occupy more space around the central atom than a single bond which can cause other bond angles to be somewhat smaller than expected This is because a multiple bond has a higher electron density than a single bond so its electrons occupy more space than those of a single bond For example in a molecule such as CHO AX whose structure is shown below the double bond repels the single bonds more strongly than the single bonds repel each other This causes a deviation from ideal geometry an HCH bond angle of rather than Four Electron Groups One of the limitations of Lewis structures is that they depict molecules and ions in only two dimensions With four electron groups we must learn to show molecules and ions in three dimensions AX CH The central atom carbon contributes four valence electrons and each hydrogen atom has one valence electron so the full Lewis electron structure is There are four electron groups around the central atom As shown in Figure repulsions are minimized by placing the groups in the corners of a tetrahedron with bond angles of All electron groups are bonding pairs so the structure is designated as AX With four bonding pairs the molecular geometry of methane is tetrahedral Figure AXE NH In ammonia the central atom nitrogen has five valence electrons and each hydrogen donates one valence electron producing the Lewis electron structure There are four electron groups around nitrogen three bonding pairs and one lone pair Repulsions are minimized by directing each hydrogen atom and the lone pair to the corners of a tetrahedron With three bonding pairs and one lone pair the structure is designated as AXE This designation has a total of four electron pairs three X and one E We expect the LPBP interactions to cause the bonding pair angles to deviate significantly from the angles of a perfect tetrahedron There are three nuclei and one lone pair so the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal In essence this is a tetrahedron with a vertex missing Figure However the HNH bond angles are less than the ideal angle of because of LPBP repulsions AXE HO Oxygen has six valence electrons and each hydrogen has one valence electron producing the Lewis electron structure There are four groups around the central oxygen atom two bonding pairs and two lone pairs Repulsions are minimized by directing the bonding pairs and the lone pairs to the corners of a tetrahedron Figure With two bonding pairs and two lone pairs the structure is designated as AXE with a total of four electron pairs Due to LPLP LPBP and BPBP interactions we expect a significant deviation from idealized tetrahedral angles With two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electrons the structure has significant lone pair interactions There are two nuclei about the central atom so the molecular shape is bent or V shaped with an HOH angle that is even less than the HNH angles in NH as we would expect because of the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the central atom rather than one This molecular shape is essentially a tetrahedron with two missing vertices Exercises Questions Q List the bond angles for each of the following compounds BH CF HO Q Why is sulfur dioxide a bent molecule bond angle less than Solutions S HBH FCF OHO S This deviation is due to the lone pairs on the sulfur These force the molecule to exhibit a bent geometry and therefore a deviation from the IntroductionDiastereomers vs EnantiomersExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be

enantiomers or represent a pair of diastereomers draw the wedgeandbrokenline structure of a specific stereoisomer of a compound containing two chiral carbon atoms given its IUPAC name and RS configuration Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below diastereomer Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not related as object and mirror image and are not enantiomers Unlike enatiomers which are mirror images of each other and nonsumperimposable diastereomers are not mirror images of each other and nonsuperimposable Diastereomers can have different physical properties and reactivity They have different melting points and boiling points and different densities They have two or more stereocenters Introduction It is easy to mistake between diasteromers and enantiomers For example we have four steroisomers of bromobutanol The four possible combination are SS RR SR and RS Figure One of the molecule is the enantiomer of its mirror image molecule and diasteromer of each of the other two molecule SS is enantiomer of RR and diasteromer of RS and SR SSs mirror image is RR and they are not superimposable so they are enantiomers RS and SR are not mirror image of SS and are not superimposable to each other so they are diasteromers Figure Diastereomers vs Enantiomers Tartaric acid CHO is an organic compound that can be found in grape bananas and in wine The structures of tartaric acid itself is really interesting Naturally it is in the form of RR stereocenters Artificially it can be in the meso form RS which is achiral RR tartaric acid is enantiomer to is mirror image which is SS tartaric acid and diasteromers to mesotartaric acid Figure RR and SS tartaric acid have similar physical properties and reactivity However mesotartaric acid have different physical properties and reactivity For example melting point of RR SS tartaric is about degree Celsius and melting point of mesotartaric acid is about degree Celsius Figure We turn our attention next to molecules which have more than one stereocenter We will start with a common fourcarbon sugar called Derythrose A note on sugar nomenclature biochemists use a special system to refer to the stereochemistry of sugar molecules employing names of historical origin in addition to the designators D and L You will learn about this system if you take a biochemistry class We will use the DL designations here to refer to different sugars but we wont worry about learning the system As you can see Derythrose is a chiral molecule C and C are stereocenters both of which have the R configuration In addition you should make a model to convince yourself that it is impossible to find a plane of symmetry through the molecule regardless of the conformation Does Derythrose have an enantiomer Of course it does if it is a chiral molecule it must The enantiomer of erythrose is its mirror image and is named Lerythrose once again you should use models to convince yourself that these mirror images of erythrose are not superimposable Notice that both chiral centers in Lerythrose both have the S configuration Note In a pair of enantiomers all of the chiral centers are of the opposite configuration What happens if we draw a stereoisomer of erythrose in which the configuration is S at C and R at C This stereoisomer which is a sugar called Dthreose is not a mirror image of erythrose Dthreose is a diastereomer of both Derythrose and Lerythrose The definition of diastereomers is simple if two molecules are stereoisomers same molecular formula same connectivity different arrangement of atoms in space but are not enantiomers then they are diastereomers by default In practical terms this means that at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite in a pair of diastereomers By definition two molecules that are diastereomers are not mirror images of each other Lthreose the enantiomer of Dthreose has the R configuration at C and the S configuration at C Lthreose is a diastereomer of both erythrose enantiomers In general a structure with n stereocenters will have n different stereoisomers We are not considering for the time being the stereochemistry of double bonds that will come later For example lets consider the glucose molecule in its openchain form recall that many sugar molecules can exist in either an openchain or a cyclic form There are two enantiomers of glucose called Dglucose and Lglucose The Denantiomer is the common sugar that our bodies use for energy It has n stereocenters so therefore there are n possible stereoisomers including Dglucose itself In Lglucose all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose That leaves diastereomers of Dglucose these are molecules in which at least one but not all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose One of these diastereomers a sugar called Dgalactose is shown above in Dgalactose one of four stereocenters is inverted relative to Dglucose Diastereomers which differ in only one stereocenter out of two or more are called epimers Dglucose and Dgalactose can therefore be refered to as epimers as well as diastereomers Example Draw the structure of Lgalactose the enantiomer of Dgalactose Draw the structure of two more diastereomers of Dglucose One should be an epimer Answer Erythronolide B a precursor to the macrocyclic antibiotic erythromycin has stereocenters Its enantiomer is that molecule in which all stereocenters are inverted In total there are stereoisomers in the erythronolide B family of these are diastereomers of the structure above one is the enantiomer of the structure above and the last is the structure above We know that enantiomers have identical physical properties and equal but opposite degrees of specific rotation Diastereomers in theory at least have different physical properties we stipulate in theory because sometimes the physical properties of two or more diastereomers are so similar that it is very difficult to separate them In addition the specific rotations of diastereomers are unrelated they could be the same sign or opposite signs and similar in magnitude or very dissimilar Exercises Questions Q Determine the stereochemistry of the following molecule Solutions S Contributors and Attributions Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim

Diastereomers have different physical properties melting points boiling points and densities Depending on the reaction mechanism diastereomers can produce different stereochemical products Introduction So far we have been analyzing compounds with a single chiral center Next we turn our attention to those which have multiple chiral centers Well start with some stereoisomeric fourcarbon sugars with two chiral centers To avoid confusion we will simply refer to the different stereoisomers by capital letters Look first at compound A below Both chiral centers in have the R configuration you should confirm this for yourself The mirror image of Compound A is compound B which has the S configuration at both chiral centers If we were to pick up compound A flip it over and put it next to compound B we would see that they are not superimposable again confirm this for yourself with your models A and B are nonsuperimposable mirror images in other words enantiomers Now look at compound C in which the configuration is S at chiral center and R at chiral center Compounds A and C are stereoisomers they have the same molecular formula and the same bond connectivity but a different arrangement of atoms in space recall that this is the definition of the term stereoisomer However they are not mirror images of each other confirm this with your models and so they are not enantiomers By definition they are diastereomers of each other Notice that compounds C and B also have a diastereomeric relationship by the same definition So compounds A and B are a pair of enantiomers and compound C is a diastereomer of both of them Does compound C have its own enantiomer Compound D is the mirror image of compound C and the two are not superimposable Therefore C and D are a pair of enantiomers Compound D is also a diastereomer of compounds A and B This can also seem very confusing at first but there some simple shortcuts to analyzing stereoisomers Stereoisomer shortcuts If all of the chiral centers are of opposite RS configuration between two stereoisomers they are enantiomers If at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite between two stereoisomers they are diastereomers Note these shortcuts to not take into account the possibility of additional stereoisomers due to alkene groups we will come to that later Heres another way of looking at the four stereoisomers where one chiral center is associated with red and the other blue Pairs of enantiomers are stacked together We know using the shortcut above that the enantiomer of RR must be SS both chiral centers are different We also know that RS and SR are diastereomers of RR because in each case one but not both chiral centers are different Diastereomers vs Enantiomers in Wine Chemistry Tartaric acid CHO is an organic compound that can be found in grape bananas and in wine The structures of tartaric acid itself is really interesting Naturally it is in the form of RR stereocenters Artificially it can be in the meso form RS which is achiral RR tartaric acid is enantiomer to is mirror image which is SS tartaric acid and diasteromers to mesotartaric acid Figure RR and SS tartaric acid have similar physical properties and reactivity However mesotartaric acid have different physical properties and reactivity For example melting point of RR SS tartaric is about degree Celsius and melting point of mesotartaric acid is about degree Celsius Diastereomers vs Enantiomers in Sugar Chemistry Derythrose is a common fourcarbon sugar A note on sugar nomenclature biochemists use a special system to refer to the stereochemistry of sugar molecules employing names of historical origin in addition to the designators D and L You will learn about this system if you take a

stereocenters both of which have the R configuration In addition you should make a model to convince yourself that it is impossible to find a plane of symmetry through the molecule regardless of the conformation Does Derythrose have an enantiomer Of course it does if it is a chiral molecule it must The enantiomer of erythrose is its mirror image and is named Lerythrose once again you should use models to convince yourself that these mirror images of erythrose are not superimposable Notice that both chiral centers in Lerythrose both have the S configuration Note In a pair of enantiomers all of the chiral centers are of the opposite configuration What happens if we draw a stereoisomer of erythrose in which the configuration is S at C and R at C This stereoisomer which is a sugar called Dthreose is not a mirror image of erythrose Dthreose is a diastereomer of both Derythrose and Lerythrose The definition of diastereomers is simple if two molecules are stereoisomers same molecular formula same connectivity different arrangement of atoms in space but are not enantiomers then they are diastereomers by default In practical terms this means that at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite in a pair of diastereomers By definition two molecules that are diastereomers are not mirror images of each other Lthreose the enantiomer of Dthreose has the R configuration at C and the S configuration at C Lthreose is a diastereomer of both erythrose enantiomers Erythronolide B a precursor to the macrocyclic antibiotic erythromycin has stereocenters Its

potassium permanganate or osmium tetroxide produce the syndihydroxylated products The osmium tertroxide reaction can also take place by a twostep process OsO in pyridine followed by HS or NaHSO It is important to note that different professors will emphasize different reagent systems to accomplish the same chemical reaction In these situations it can be helpful to recognize the role of each reagent to discern patterns Anti Dihydroxylation Epoxides may be cleaved by aqueous acid to give glycols that are often diastereomeric with those prepared by the synhydroxylation reaction described above Proton transfer from the acid catalyst generates the conjugate acid of the epoxide which is attacked by nucleophiles such as water in the same way that the cyclic bromonium ion described above undergoes reaction The result is antihydroxylation of the double bond in contrast to the synstereoselectivity of the earlier method In the following equation this procedure is illustrated for a cisdisubstituted epoxide which of course could be prepared from the corresponding cisalkene This hydration of an epoxide does not change the oxidation state of any atoms or groups The mechanism for the ring opening of epoxides depends on the reaction conditions and is discussed in more detail in the next section of this chapter Syn Dihydroxylation Osmium tetroxide oxidizes alkenes to give glycols through syn addition A glycol also known as a vicinal diol is a compound with two OH groups on adjacent carbons Dihydroxylated products glycols are obtained by reaction with aqueous potassium permanganate pH or osmium tetroxide in pyridine solution Both reactions appear to proceed by the same mechanism shown below the metallocyclic intermediate may be isolated in the osmium reaction In basic solution the purple permanganate anion is reduced to the green manganate ion providing a nice color test for the double bond functional group From the mechanism shown here we would expect synstereoselectivity in the bonding to oxygen and regioselectivity is not an issue When viewed in context with the previously discussed addition reactions the hydroxylation reaction might seem implausible Permanganate and osmium tetroxide have similar configurations in which the metal atom occupies the center of a tetrahedral grouping of negatively charged oxygen atoms How then would such a species interact with the nucleophilic pielectrons of a double bond A possible explanation is that an empty dorbital of the electrophilic metal atom extends well beyond the surrounding oxygen atoms and initiates electron transfer from the double bond to the metal in much the same fashion noted above for platinum Backbonding of the nucleophilic oxygens to the antibonding πorbital completes this interaction The result is formation of a metallocyclic intermediate as shown above The reaction with is a concerted process that has a cyclic intermediate and no rearrangements Vicinal syn dihydroxylation complements the epoxidehydrolysis sequence which constitutes an anti dihydroxylation of an alkene When an alkene reacts with osmium tetroxide stereocenters can form in the glycol product Cis alkenes give meso products and trans alkenes give racemic mixtures is formed slowly when osmium powder reacts with gasoues at ambient temperature Reaction of bulk solid requires heating to C Since Osmium tetroxide is expensive and highly toxic the reaction with alkenes has been modified Catalytic amounts of OsO and stoichiometric amounts of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide are now used to eliminate some hazards Also an older reagent that was used instead of OsO was potassium permanganate Although syn diols will result from the reaction of KMnO and an alkene potassium permanganate is less useful since it gives poor yields of the product because of overoxidation Chemical Highlight Antitumor drugs have been formed by using dihydroxylation This method has been applied to the enantioselective synthesis of ovalicin which is a class of fungalderived products called antiangiogenesis agents These antitumor products can cut off the blood supply to solid tumors A derivative of ovalicin TNP is chemically stable nontoxic and noninflammatory TNP has been used in research to determine its effectiveness in treating cancer of the breast brain cervix liver and prostate Exercise Give the major product What is the product in the dihydroxylation of Zhexene What is the product in the dihydroxylation of Ehexene Draw the intermediate of this reaction Fill in the

Objective Determine relative strengths of acids and bases from their pKa values Determine the form of an acid or base at a specified pH given the pKa The HendersonHasselbach Equation a Quantitative View We will use the general reaction for a weak acid to write the Ka expression pKa log Ka where each bracketed term represents the concentration of that substance in solution The stronger an acid the greater the ionization the lower the pKa and the lower the pH the compound will produce in solution It is important to realize that pKa is not at all the same thing as pH the former is an inherent property of a compound or functional group while the latter is the measure of the hydronium ion concentration in a particular aqueous solution pH log HO Additional reagents can be added to a reaction solution to change the pH of the reaction conditions beyond the effects of an individual compound Relative Acidity and pKa Values An application of the HendersonHasselbach Equation is the ability to determine the relative acidity of compounds by comparing their pKa values The stronger an acid the greater the ionization the lower the pKa and the lower the pH the compound will produce in solution Some selected pKa values for compounds in the study of organic chemistry are shown bellow Since organic reactions can be performed in nonaqueous environments the pH can exceed and organic compounds can have pKa values above It is a variation on that line from the Wizard of Oz We dont live in water anymore It is a very good idea to commit to memory the approximate pKa ranges of the compounds above A word of caution when using the pKa table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair If you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia NH compared to that of ethoxide ion CHCHO for example the relevant pKa values to consider are the pKa of ammonium ion and the pKa of ethanol From these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base Do not make the mistake of using the pKa value of this is the pKa of ammonia acting as an acid and tells you how basic the NH ion is very basic A note on the pKa of water The pKa of water is Biochemistry and organic chemistry texts often list the value as These texts have incorrectly factored the molar value for the concentration of water into the equilibrium constant The correct derivation of the equilibrium constant involves the activity of water which has a value of Example While this course begins with single functional groups we will eventually work with interesting compounds containing multiple functional groups Recognizing which hydrogens can be ionized as acidic protons and which hydrogens can NOT is a useful skill Notice in this example that we need to evaluate the potential acidity at four different locations on the molecule Aldehyde and aromatic protons are not at all acidic pKavalues are above not on our table The two protons on the carbon next to the carbonyl are slightly acidic with pKa values around according to the table The most acidic proton is on the phenol group so if the compound were to be subjected to a single molar equivalent of strong base this is the proton that would be donated Acidic Basic Environments Everything is Relative in Reactivity Because our goal is understanding dynamic chemical reactivity we do NOT need to know the specific amount of the protonated and unprotonated forms of a compound We simply need to know which form is predominate When the pH of the environment is less than the pKa of the compound the environment is considered acidic and the compound will exist predominately in its protonated form When the pH of the environment is greater than the pKa of the compound the environment is considered basic and the compound will exist predominately in its deprotonated form For example the pKa of acetic acid is about At a pH of the environment is considered acidic and acetic acid exists predominately in its protonated form At pH the environment is considered basic and acetic acid becomes deprotonated to form acetate CHCO Conversely the pKa of phenol is At pH the environment is considered acidic for phenol and it remains primarily protonated It is also important to remember that organic chemistry does NOT have to occur in water so pKa values can be as high as Exercise

formulas for any given molecular formula write the molecular formula of a compound given its Kekulé structure draw the shorthand structure of a compound given its Kekulé structure interpret shorthand structures and convert them to Kekulé structures write the molecular formula of a compound given its shorthand structure Study Notes When drawing the structure of a neutral organic compound you will find it helpful to remember that each carbon atom has four bonds each nitrogen atom has three bonds each oxygen atom has two bonds each hydrogen atom has one bond Through general chemistry you may have already experienced looking at molecular structures using Lewis structures Because organic chemistry can involve large molecules it would be beneficial if Lewis structures could be abbreviated The three different ways to draw organic molecules include Kekulé Formulas Condensed Formulas and Skeletal structures also called linebond strutures or line formulas During this course you will view molecules written in all three forms It will be more helpful if you become comfortable going from one style of drawing to another and look at drawings and understanding what they represent Developing the ability to convert between different types of formulas requires practice and in most cases the aid of molecular models Many kinds of model kits are available to students and professional chemists and the beginning student is encouraged to obtain one Simplification of structural formulas may be achieved without any loss of the information they convey Kekule formulas is just organic chemistrys term for Lewis structures you have previously encountered In condensed structural formulas the bonds to each carbon are omitted but each distinct structural unit group is written with subscript numbers designating multiple substituents including the hydrogens Line formulas omit the symbols for carbon and hydrogen entirely unless the hydrogen is bonded to an atom other than carbon Each straight line segment represents a bond the ends and intersections of the lines are carbon atoms and the correct number of hydrogens is calculated from the tetravalency of carbon Nonbonding valence shell electrons are omitted in these formulas Kekulé aka Lewis Structures A Kekulé Formula or structural formula displays the atoms of the molecule in the order they are bonded It also depicts how the atoms are bonded to one another for example single double and triple covalent bond Covalent bonds are shown using lines The number of dashes indicate whether the bond is a single double or triple covalent bond All atom labels are shown and all lone pairs are shown A BC Condensed Formula A condensed formula is made up of the elemental symbols Condensed structural formulas show the order of atoms like a structural formula but are written in a single line to save space and make it more convenient and faster to write out The order of the atoms suggests the connectivity in the molecule Condensed structural formulas are also helpful when showing that a group of atoms is connected to a single atom in a compound When this happens parenthesis are used around the group of atoms to show they are together Also if more than one of the same substituent is attached to a given atom it is show with a subscript number An example is CH which represents four hydrogens attached to the same carbon Condensed formulas can be read from either direction and HC is the same as CH although the latter is more common Look at the examples below and match them with their identical molecule under the Kekulé structures and the line formulas A CHCHOH B ClCHCHCHOCHCH C HCNHCHCOOH Lets look closely at example B As you go through a condensed formula you want to focus on the carbons and other elements that arent hydrogen The hydrogens are important but are usually there to complete octets Also notice the OCH is in written in parentheses which tell you that it not part of the main chain of carbons As you read through a a condensed formula if you reach an atom that doesnt have a complete octet by the time you reach the next hydrogen then its possible that there are double or triple bonds In example C the carbon is double bonded to oxygen and single bonded to another oxygen Notice how COOH means COOH instead of CHCOOH because carbon does not have a complete octet and oxygens Line Formula Because organic compounds can be complex at times lineangle formulas are used to write carbon and hydrogen atoms more efficiently by replacing the letter C with lines A carbon atom is present wherever a line intersects another line Hydrogen atoms are omitted but are assumed to be present to complete each of carbons four bonds Hydrogens that are attached to elements other than carbon are shown Atom labels for all other elements are shown Lone pair electrons are usually omitted They are assumed to be present to complete the octet of noncarbon atoms Line formulas help show the structure and order of the atoms in a compound A B C These molecules correspond to the exact same molecules depicted for Kekulé structures and condensed formulas Notice how the carbons are no longer drawn in and are replaced by the ends and bends of a lines In addition the hydrogens have been omitted but could be easily drawn in see practice problems Although we do not usually draw in the Hs that are bonded to carbon we do draw them in if they are connected to other atoms besides carbon example is the OH group above in example A This is done because it is not always clear if the noncarbon atom is surrounded by lone pairs or hydrogens Also in example A notice how the OH is drawn with a bond to the second carbon but it does not mean that there is a third carbon at the end of that bond line Kekulé Formula Condensed Formula Line Formula Table Structural Formulas for CHO isomers Example Converting between Structural Formulas It is helpful to convert compounds into different structural formulas Kekule Line and Condensed depending on the type of question that is asked Standardized exams frequently include a high percentage of condensed formulas because it is easier and cheaper to type letters and numbers than to import figures Initially it can be difficult writing a Line structure directly from a condensed formula First write the Kekule structure from the condensed formula and then draw the Line structure from the Kekule a The condensed formula for propanal is CHCHCHO Draw the Kekule structure The Kekule structure for propanal is shown below Remember that every carbon will have four bonds and oxygens octet is filled with lone pairs The bondline structure for propanal is shown below First remove hydrogens The hydrogen attached to the aldehyde group remains because it is part of a functional group The remove the C lables from the structure and keep the lines in place Lastly remove any lone pairs All three structures represent the same compound propanal b The following is the line structure of the molecule trimethyl amine To convert it to a Kekule structure first identify the carbons in the molecule The will be at the corners and ends of line without an atom label Trimethyl amine has three carbons Next add hydrogens to the carbons until four bonds are present Each carbon in trimethyl amine is singly bonded to nitrogen This means each carbon will need three additional CH bonds to create its octet Lastly add lone pairs to other elements to fill their octets The nitrogen in trimethyl amine is bonded to three carbons This means it will require one of lone pair electrons to complete its octet Exercises How many carbons are in the following drawing How many hydrogens How many carbons are in the following drawing How many hydrogens How many carbons are in

be able to draw the resonance structures of molecules or ions that exhibit delocalization determine the relative stability of resonance structures using a set of rules use the concept of resonance to explain structural features of molecules and ions key words resonance structure resonance hybrid Curved Arrows Communicate Electron Flow movement Organic chemistry has developed a system to show how electrons move between resonance structures This system will also be used to help describe how electrons from in reactions Curved double barbed arrows indicates the flow of two electrons The base of the curved arrow is placed at the source of the electrons that are moving The head of the arrow is placed at the destination of the electrons It is also important to consciously use the correct type of arrow There are four primary types of arrows used by chemists to communicate one of the following completion reaction equilibrium reaction electron movement and resonance forms The three other types of arrows are shown below to build discernment between them Note the electron movement arrows are the only ones that are curved Using Curved Arrows to Show Electron Movement Because the double barbed arrow represents the movement of two electrons they usually involve lone pair electrons or pi bonds There are only three types of electron motion in resonance They are A lone pair forms a pi bond to an adjacent atom A pi bond forms a new pi bond to an adjacent atom A pi bond forms a lone pair on adjacent atom Lets look at the resonance within acrylic acid to demonstrate these three types of resonance The curved arrow in structure A represents the type resonance motion the pi bond between the carbon and oxygen breaks to form another lone pair on the oxygen The curved arrow in structure B represents type resonance motion the pi bond breaks to form a new pi bond to the carbocation carbon In structure C there are two curved arrows The curved arrow from the oxygen lone pair is type resonance motion the lone pairs forms a new pi bond between the oxygen and carbon The other arrow in structure C moves the pi bond to the end of the chain and represents resonance type By combining these three basic types of electron movement we can describe virtually any type of resonance Example Below are a few more examples of legal resonance expressions Confirm for yourself that the octet rule is not exceeded for any atoms that formal charges are correct and identify which type of electron movement is being represented by each arrow Exercise Draw the resonance contributors that correspond to the curved twoelectron movement arrows in the resonance expressions below Then identify the type of resonance motion in each structure below Answer Exercise In each resonance expression identify the type of resonance motion Then draw curved arrows on the leftside contributor that shows how we get to the rightside contributor Answer Recognizing Common Patterns of Resonance If you examine a large number of resonance examples you will begin to notice that they nearly always match common patterns of which there are only three It is important to be able to identify atoms that participate in resonance In complex resonance cases multiple types of resonance may occur simultaneously Type I The electrons of a pi bond move to become a set of lone pair electrons on a electronegative atom The resonance structure made has a carbon with a violated octet which make it a minor contributor This type of resonance is commonly used to the polarity in certain double bonds Type I Example Type II Type II resonance is only seen with a charge and usually involves a positive charge on oxygen or nitrogen being shared onto a carbon the carbocation form has only six valence electrons on the carbon so it is a less stable form than the major form which has complete octets Type II Example Type III Type III resonance is very common and important because is serves to stabilize positive charges negative charges or lone pairs It is sometimes referred to as allylic resonance especially in cases with all carbon This type of resonance can be identified by a threeatom group of atoms each with sp hybridization and a p orbital Type III Example Atoms with lone pair electrons next to a pi bond can be sp hybridized and have the lone pair of electrons in a p orbital despite the fact that they are surrounded by four electron groups The lone pair electrons contained in the p orbital cause the ion to be stabilized due to resonance Similarly carbocations are sphybridized with an empty p orbital oriented perpendicular to the plane formed by three sigma bonds If a carbocation is adjacent to a double bond then three p orbitals can overlap and share the two pi electrons another kind of conjugated pi system in which the positive charge is shared over two carbons Exercise Each of the illegal resonance expressions below contains one or more mistakes Explain what is incorrect in each Answer The first pair are not resonance structures since there is an additional hydrogen on the second structure oxygen The second pair pushed electrons toward nitrogen which already has a lone pair and would exceed its octet The third pair includes a structure with bonds to carbon The fourth pair requires moving carbonhydrogen bonds therefore is not resonance The fifth pair show electrons moving toward the negatively charged oxygen which would exceed an octet The fifth pair shows a sigma bond breaking on the ring rather than pi bond Exercise a Draw three additional resonance contributors for the carbocation below Include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how one contributor is converted to the next b Fill in the blanks the conjugated pi system in this carbocation is composed of ______ p orbitals sharing ________ delocalized pi electrons Answer a b The conjugated pi system in this carbocation is composed of seven p orbitals containing six delocalized pi electrons Example Draw the major resonance contributor of the structure below Include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how you got from the given structure to your structure Explain why your contributor is the major one In what kind of orbitals are the two lone pairs on the oxygen Solution In the structure above the carbon with the positive formal charge does not have a complete octet of valence electrons Using the curved arrow convention a lone pair on the oxygen can be moved to the adjacent bond to the left and the electrons in the double bond shifted over to the left see the rules for drawing resonance contributors to convince yourself that these are legal moves The resulting resonance contributor in which the oxygen bears the formal charge is the major one because all atoms have a complete octet and there is one additional bond drawn resonance rules and both apply This system can be thought of as four parallel p orbitals one each on C C and C plus one on oxygen sharing four pi electrons One lone pair on the oxygen is in an unhybridized p orbital and is part of the conjugated pi system and the other is located in an sp orbital Also note that one additional contributor can be drawn but it is also minor because it has a carbon with an incomplete octet Exercise The figure below shows how the negative formal charge on an oxygen of an enol can be delocalized to the carbon indicated by an arrow More resonance contributors can be drawn in which negative charge is delocalized to three other atoms on the molecule a Circle these atoms that can also have a resonance structure with a negative charge b Draw the two most important resonance contributors for the enolate ion Answer The two major contributors are those in which the negative formal charge is located on an oxygen rather than on a carbon Exercise a Draw three additional resonance contributors for the carbocation below Include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how one contributor is converted to the next b Fill in the blanks the conjugated pi system in this carbocation is composed of ______ p orbitals sharing ________ delocalized pi electrons Exercise Draw the major resonance contributor for each of the anions below c Fill in the blanks the conjugated pi system in part a is composed of ______ p orbitals containing ________ delocalized pi electrons Exercise The figure below shows how the negative formal charge on the oxygen can be delocalized to the carbon indicated by an arrow More resonance contributors can be drawn in which negative charge is delocalized to three other atoms on the molecule a Circle these atoms b Draw the two most important resonance contributors for the molecule A word of advice Becoming adept at drawing resonance contributors using the curved arrow notation to show how one contributor can be converted to another and understanding the concepts of conjugation and resonance delocalization are some of the most challenging but also most important jobs that you will have as a beginning student of organic chemistry If you work hard now to gain a firm grasp of these ideas you will have come a long way toward understanding much of what follows in your organic chemistry course Conversely if you fail to come to grips with these concepts now a lot of what you see later in the course will seem like a

sections is integrated into the above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and The electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells Commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Introduction Before assigning the electrons of an atom into orbitals one must become familiar with the basic concepts of electron configurations Every element on the Periodic Table consists of atoms which are composed of protons neutrons and electrons Electrons exhibit a negative charge and are found around the nucleus of the atom in electron orbitals defined as the volume of space in which the electron can be found within probability The four different types of orbitals spd and f have different shapes and one orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons The p d and f orbitals have different sublevels thus can hold more electrons As stated the electron configuration of each element is unique to its position on the periodic table The energy level is determined by the period and the number of electrons is given by the atomic number of the element Orbitals on different energy levels are similar to each other but they occupy different areas in space The s orbital and s orbital both have the characteristics of an s orbital radial nodes spherical volume probabilities can only hold two electrons etc but as they are found in different energy levels they occupy different spaces around the nucleus Each orbital can be represented by specific blocks on the periodic table The sblock is the region of the alkali metals including helium Groups the dblock are the transition metals Groups to the pblock are the main group elements from Groups to and the fblock are the lanthanides and actinides series Using the periodic table to determine the electron configurations of atoms is key but also keep in mind that there are certain rules to follow when assigning electrons to different orbitals The periodic table is an incredibly helpful tool in writing electron configurations For more information on how electron configurations and the periodic table are linked visit the Connecting Electrons to the Periodic Table module Rules for Assigning Electron Orbitals Occupation of Orbitals Electrons fill orbitals in a way to minimize the energy of the atom Therefore the electrons in an atom fill the principal energy levels in order of increasing energy the electrons are getting farther from the nucleus The order of levels filled looks like this s s p s p s d p s d p s f d p s f d and p One way to remember this pattern probably the easiest is to refer to the periodic table and remember where each orbital block falls to logically deduce this pattern Another way is to make a table like the one below and use vertical lines to determine which subshells correspond with each other Pauli Exclusion Principle The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers The first three n l and ml may be the same but the fourth quantum number must be different A single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons which must have opposing spins otherwise they would have the same four quantum numbers which is forbidden One electron is spin up ms and the other would spin down ms This tells us that each subshell has double the electrons per orbital The s subshell has orbital that can hold up to electrons the p subshell has orbitals that can hold up to electrons the d subshell has orbitals that hold up to electrons and the f subshell has orbitals with electrons Example Hydrogen and Helium The first three quantum numbers of an electron are n l ml Only two electrons can correspond to these which would be either ms or ms As we already know from our studies of quantum numbers and electron orbitals we can conclude that these four quantum numbers refer to the s subshell If only one of the ms values are given then we would have s denoting hydrogen if both are given we would have s denoting helium Visually this is be represented as As shown the s subshell can hold only two electrons and when filled the electrons have opposite spins Hunds Rule When assigning electrons in orbitals each electron will first fill all the orbitals with similar energy also referred to as degenerate before pairing with another electron in a halffilled orbital Atoms at ground states tend to have as many unpaired electrons as possible When visualizing this processes think about how electrons are exhibiting the same behavior as the same poles on a magnet would if they came into contact as the negatively charged electrons fill orbitals they first try to get as far as possible from each other before having to pair up Example Oxygen and Nitrogen If we look at the correct electron configuration of the Nitrogen Z atom a very important element in the biology of plants s s p We can clearly see that p orbitals are halffilled as there are three electrons and three p orbitals This is because Hunds Rule states that the three electrons in the p subshell will fill all the empty orbitals first before filling orbitals with electrons in them If we look at the element after Nitrogen in the same period Oxygen Z its electron configuration is s s p for an atom Oxygen has one more electron than Nitrogen and as the orbitals are all half filled the electron must pair up The Aufbau Process Aufbau comes from the German word aufbauen meaning to build When writing electron configurations orbitals are built up from atom to atom When writing the electron configuration for an atom orbitals are filled in order of increasing atomic number However there are some exceptions to this rule Example rd row elements Following the pattern across a period from B Z to Ne Z the number of electrons increases and the subshells are filled This example focuses on the p subshell which fills from boron to neon B Z configuration s s p C Z configurations s p N Z configurations s p O Z configurations s p F Z configurations s p Ne Z configurations s p Example The electron configuration for sulfur is s s p s p and can be represented using the orbital diagram below Exercises Write the electron configuration for phosphorus and draw the orbital diagram Solution The electron configuration for phosphorus is s s p s p and the orbital diagram is drawn below Patterns of electronegativity in the Periodic TableTrends in electronegativity across a periodTrends in electronegativity down a groupExplaining the patterns in electronegativityWhy does electronegativity increase across a periodWhy does electronegativity fall as you go down a groupBond Polarity Dipole MomentPolarity and Structure of MoleculesGeometric ConsiderationsA spectrum of bondsExercisesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective Identify polar bonds and compounds Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons The Pauling scale is the most commonly used Fluorine the most electronegative element is assigned a value of and values range down to cesium and francium which are the least electronegative at Patterns of electronegativity in the Periodic Table Electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom in a particular molecule to attract electrons to itself The greater the value the greater the attractiveness for electrons Trends in electronegativity across a period The positively charged protons in the nucleus attract the negatively charged electrons As the number of protons in the nucleus increases the electronegativity or attraction will increase Therefore electronegativity increases from left to right in a row in the periodic table This effect only holds true for a row in the periodic table because the attraction between charges falls off rapidly with distance The chart shows electronegativities from sodium to chlorine ignoring argon since it does not does not form bonds Trends in electronegativity down a group As you go down a group electronegativity decreases If it increases up to fluorine it must decrease as you go down The chart shows the patterns of electronegativity in Groups and Explaining the patterns in electronegativity The attraction that a bonding pair of electrons feels for a particular nucleus depends on the number of protons in the nucleus the distance from the nucleus the amount of screening by inner electrons Why does electronegativity increase across a period Consider sodium at the beginning of period and chlorine at the end ignoring the noble gas argon Think of sodium chloride as if it were covalently bonded Both sodium and chlorine have their bonding electrons in the level The electron pair is screened from both nuclei by the s s and p electrons but the chlorine nucleus has more protons in it It is no wonder the electron pair gets dragged so far towards the chlorine that ions are formed Electronegativity increases across a period because the number of charges on the nucleus increases That attracts the bonding pair of electrons more strongly Why does electronegativity fall as you go down a group As you go down a group electronegativity decreases because the bonding pair of electrons is increasingly distant from the attraction of the nucleus Consider the hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride molecules The bonding pair is shielded from the fluorines nucleus only by the s electrons In the chlorine case it is shielded by all the ssp electrons In each case there is a net pull from the center of the fluorine or chlorine of But fluorine has the bonding pair in the level rather than the level as it is in chlorine If it is closer to the nucleus the attraction is greater Dipole moments occur when there is a separation of charge They can occur between two ions in an ionic bond or between atoms in a covalent bond dipole moments arise from differences in electronegativity The larger the difference in electronegativity the larger the dipole moment The distance between the charge separation is also a deciding factor into the size of the dipole moment The dipole moment is a measure of the polarity of the molecule Bond Polarity Dipole Moment Atoms with differences in electronegativity will share electrons unequally The shared electrons of the covalent bond are held more tightly at the more electronegative element creating a partial negative charge while the less electronegative element has a partial positive charge The larger the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms the more polar the bond To be considered a polar bond the difference in electronegativity must on the Pauling scale Since the two electrical partial charges have opposite sign and equal magnitude and are separated by a distance a dipole is established Dipole moment is measured in debye units which is equal to the distance between the charges multiplied by the charge debye equals x coulombmeters Figure The Electron Distribution in a Nonpolar Covalent Bond a Polar Covalent Bond and an Ionic Bond Using Lewis Electron Structures In a purely covalent bond a the bonding electrons are shared equally between the atoms In a purely ionic bond c an electron has been transferred completely from one atom to the other A polar covalent bond b is intermediate between the two extremes the bonding electrons are shared unequally between the two atoms and the electron distribution is asymmetrical with the electron density being greater around the more electronegative atom Electronrich negatively charged regions are shown in blue electronpoor positively charged regions are shown in red Polarity and Structure of Molecules The shape of a molecule AND the polarity of its bonds A molecule that contains polar bonds might not have any overall polarity depending upon its shape The simple definition of whether a complex molecule is polar or not depends upon whether its overall centers of positive and negative charges overlap If these centers lie at the same point in space then the molecule has no overall polarity and is non polar Figure Charge distrubtions If a molecule is completely symmetric then the dipole moment vectors on each molecule will cancel each other out making the molecule nonpolar A molecule can only be polar if the structure of that molecule is not symmetric A good example of a nonpolar molecule that contains polar bonds is carbon dioxide This is a linear molecule and the CO bonds are in fact polar The central carbon will have a net positive charge and the two outer oxygens a net negative charge However since the molecule is linear these two bond dipoles cancel each other out ie vector addition of the dipoles equals zero And the overall molecule has no dipole μ Although a polar bond is a prerequisite for a molecule to have a dipole not all molecules with polar bonds exhibit dipoles Geometric Considerations Example Polar Bonds vs Polar Molecules In a simple diatomic molecule like HCl if the bond is polar then the whole molecule is polar What about more complicated molecules Figure left CCl right CHCl Consider CCl left panel in figure above which as a molecule is not polar in the sense that it doesnt have an end or a side which is slightly negative and one which is slightly positive The whole of the outside of the molecule is somewhat negative but there is no overall separation of charge from top to bottom or from left to right In contrast CHCl is a polar molecule right panel in figure above The hydrogen at the top of the molecule is less electronegative than carbon and so is slightly positive This means that the molecule now has a slightly positive top and a slightly negative bottom and so is overall a polar molecule A polar molecule will need to be lopsided in some way Example CCl Although the CCl bonds are rather polar the individual bond dipoles cancel one another in this symmetrical structure and ClCCCl does not have a net dipole moment Example CHCl CCl the key polar bond is pm Measurement reveals D From this data ionic character can be computed If this bond were ionic based on proton electron μDD Example HCl Since measurement D ionic x HCl u D measured HCl bond length pm If ionic μDD ionic x A spectrum of bonds The implication of all this is that there is no clearcut division between covalent and ionic bonds In a pure covalent bond the electrons are held on average exactly half way between the atoms In a polar bond the electrons have been dragged slightly towards one end How far does this dragging have to go before the bond counts as ionic There is no real answer to that Sodium chloride is typically considered an ionic solid but even here the sodium has not completely lost control of its electron Because of the properties of sodium chloride however we tend to count it as if it were purely ionic Lithium iodide on the other hand would be described as being ionic with some covalent character In this case the pair of electrons has not moved entirely over to the iodine end of the bond Lithium iodide for example dissolves in organic solvents like ethanol not something which ionic substances normally do Summary No electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a pure nonpolar covalent bond A small electronegativity difference leads to a polar covalent bond A large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond Example Polar Bonds vs Polar Molecules In a simple diatomic molecule like HCl if the bond is polar then the whole molecule is polar What about more complicated molecules Figure left CCl right CHCl Consider CCl left panel in figure above which as a molecule is not polar in the

carbon and so is slightly positive This means that the molecule now has a slightly positive top and a slightly negative bottom and so is overall a polar molecule A polar molecule will need to be lopsided in some way Exercises For the following compounds a add lone pairs of electrons to complete octets b add dipole moment arrows or partial signs to indicate polar bonds c predict the molecular

University Emeritus A General CharacteristicsB Effects of Conjugation on Electronic SpectraC Applications of Electronic SpectroscopyReferences A General Characteristics A year after Herschel discovered infrared radiation Johann Ritter discovered radiation beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum This radiation came to be known as ultraviolet and soon was recognized as being especially effective in causing chemical reactions Absorption of light in the ultraviolet and visible regions produces changes in the electronic energies of molecules associated with excitation of an electron from a stable to an unstable orbital Because the energy required to excite the valenceshell electrons of molecules is comparable to the strengths of chemical bonds absorption may lead to chemical reactions We discussed this briefly in Chapter in connection with photochemical halogenation of alkanes a more detailed account of photochemistry is given in Chapter Figure Schematic representation of electronic vibrational and rotational energy levels The vertical scale is greatly distorted rotational energy levels are normally apart vibrational energy levels are apart while electronic transitions involve The transition of an electron from the ground state to an excited electronic state is accompanied by vibrational and rotational changes in the molecule as shown in Figure In condense phase samples it usually is not possible to resolve the resulting absorption bands well enough to see the fine structure due to vibrationrotation transitions Consequently absorptions due to electronic excitation are relatively broad Figure The ultraviolet spectrum of propanone acetone in cyclohexane The ultraviolet spectrum of propanone acetone is shown in Figure The weak absorption which peaks ie has at is the result of excitation of one of the unshared electrons on oxygen to a higher energy level This is called an often transition in which denotes that the excited electron is one of the unshared electrons on oxygen and pi star denotes that the excited electron goes to a highenergy antibonding orbital of the carbonoxygen double bond cf Sections and C The same kind of n rightarrow pi transition occurs at about the same wavelength and intensity for many simple compounds of the type and in which is an alkyl group In a very schematic way we can write There also is an absorption of propanone with at the maximum is not shown in Figure which is a different kind of excitation This is ascribed to raising an electron in the bonding orbital Section C of the carbonoxygen double bond to the orbital Such transitions are called and occur generally for substances with double bonds Table lists the wavelengths of maximum absorption for some typical electronic absorption bands of simple molecules If we remember that absorptions at longer wavelengths correspond to less energetic transition it can be deduced from the values that less energy is required to excite unshared nonbonding electrons than electrons in double or triple bonds which in turn require less energy than electrons in single bonds Figure Figure Sequence of electronic orbital energies showing different kinds of transitions in approximate order of increasing energy left to right The and transitions usually have low transition probabilities meaning the bands have low or zero intensities B Effects of Conjugation on Electronic Spectra The transition for ethene has and It would be expected that an alkadiene would give an absorption spectrum similar to that of ethene but with a larger because there are more double bonds per mole to absorb radiation This expectation is more or less realized for compounds such as hexadiene and dimethylenecyclobutane which have isolated double bonds but not for butadiene or ethenylbenzene which have conjugated double bonds Section In general conjugated systems of double bonds absorb radiation of longer wavelengths and with greater intensity than corresponding systems of isolated double bonds This means that the difference in energy between the normal and excited states of conjugated systems is less than for isolated systems of double bonds For butadiene and hexadiene we can calculate from Equation that the transition energy is about less for the conjugated system The ground state of butadiene is stabilized by perhaps relative to a nonconjugated system of double bonds which means that the excited state must be much more stabilized than this if the transition energy is to be less than for hexadiene Why is the excited state of a conjugated system of double bonds stabilized more relative to the ground state than for a nonconjugated system Resonance theory provides an explanation see Section Of the several conventional valencebond structures that can be written for butadiene four of which are shown here only structure has a low enough energy to be dominant for the ground state of butadiene Now when the molecule is excited to the extent of by ultraviolet light its energy is so large that pairing schemes such as and which are too unfavorable to contribute very much to the ground state can be very important for the excited state Thus the stabilization energy of the excited state which has a multiplicity of nearly equalenergy pairing schemes is expected to be greater than that of the ground state with one dominant pairing scheme The more double bonds in the conjugated system the smaller the energy difference between the normal and excited states The diphenylpolyenes of formula absorb radiation at progressively longer wavelengths as is increased This is apparent from the colors of the compounds which range from colorless with to orange with to red with as goes from the ultraviolet into the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum Similar effects are found with conjugated and double bonds For example the electronic spectra of butanone and butenone are shown in Figure The absorption at for butanone is an transition and with butenone this absorption shifts to longer wavelengths There is also an intense absorption band for butenone at which is a transition With butanone a corresponding absorption occurs at which is out of the range of the spectrometer used to take the spectra of Figure Conjugation also can influence infrared spectra Transitions arising from and stretching vibrations generally are more intense and are shifted to slightly lower frequencies longer wavelengths for conjugated compounds relative to nonconjugated compounds Thus the stretching of butene occurs at whereas that of butadiene is observed at Alkanes and cycloalkanes have no lowenergy electronic transitions comparable to conjugated systems or molecules with nonbonding electrons Therefore alkanes and cycloalkanes show no absorption above and are good solvents to use for electronic spectroscopy Figure Electronic spectra of a butanone and b butenone in cyciohexane solution C Applications of Electronic Spectroscopy How do we use electronic spectroscopy in chemical analysis The two principal applications are structure determinations and quantitative analysis The position and intensity of an electronic absorption band provides information as to chemical structure Such absorptions normally are not as useful as infrared absorptions because they do not give as detailed information For our purposes here the main points to remember are A weak absorption suggests an transition of an isolated carbonyl group If this absorption is found in the region an aldehyde or ketone is probable Somewhat stronger absorptions between and may correspond to transitions Strong absorptions usually are characteristic of transitions If absorption occurs above a conjugated system of multiple bonds is indicated Each additional carboncarbon double bond shifts about to longer wavelengths and enhances the intensity of absorption Conjugation also shifts of transitions to longer wavelengths If we are dealing with compounds for which the wavelengths and the molar intensities of the absorption bands are known then we can use the degree of absorption for quantitative analysis with the aid of the BeerLambert law see Table for definitions By measuring the absorbance of a sample of known in a cell of known path length the concentration may be determined Because changes in absorbance reflect changes in concentration it is possible to use absorbance measurements to follow rates of chemical reactions to determine equilibrium constants such as the dissociation constants of acids and bases and to follow conformational changes in bioorganic molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids The capacity of electronic spectroscopy for performing qualitative and quantitative of the elements in chemical compounds has been done and applications have been made to elements of low atomic number such as carbon and oxygen Electronic spectra has been developed in the study of this

configurations to orbital diagrams is a useful skill as we transition to organic chemistry These skills are practiced in the next section The Wave Nature of Light A wave is a periodic oscillation by which energy is transmitted through space All waves are periodic repeating regularly in both space and time Waves are characterized by several interrelated properties Electronic structure arrangement of electrons in atoms Electromagnetic radiation aka radiant energy form of energy that has wave characteristics and carries energy through space All types of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum at a speed of X ms speed of light Wavelength the distance between identical points on successive waves Frequency the number of complete wavelengths that pass a given point in s where frequency wavelength and speed of light Wavelength is expressed in units of length Electromagnetic spectrum various types of electromagnetic radiations arranged in order of increasing wavelength Frequency is expressed in Hertz Hz also denoted by s or s Quantum Effects and Photons Quantum smallest quantity of energy that can be emitted or absorbed as electromagnetic radiation where energy Plancks constant frequency Plancks constant X Js According to Plancks theory energy is always emitted or absorbed in wholenumber multiples of hv for example hv hv hv and so forth We say that the allowed energies are quantized that is their values are restricted to certain quantities Quantized Energy and Photons Blackbody radiation is the radiation emitted by hot objects and could not be explained with classical physics Max Planck postulated that energy was quantized and may be emitted or absorbed only in integral multiples of a small unit of energy known as a quantum The energy of a quantum is proportional to the frequency of the radiation the proportionality constant h is a fundamental constant Plancks constant Albert Einstein used the quantization of energy to explain the photoelectric effect The photoelectric effect when photons of sufficiently high energy strike a metal surface electrons are emitted from the metal The emitted electrons are drawn toward the other electrode which is a positive terminal As a result current flows in a circuit Photon smallest increment a quantum of radiant energy a photon of light with frequency v has an energy equal to hv When a photon strikes the metal its energy is transferred to an electron in the metal A certain amount of energy is required for the electron to overcome the attractive forces that hold it within the metal If the photons have less energy that this energy threshold the electrons cannot escape from the metal surface If a photon has sufficient energy an electron is emitted If the photon has more energy than necessary the excess appears as kinetic energy of the emitted electron Line Spectra and the Bohr Model There is an intimate connection between the atomic structure of an atom and its spectral characteristics Most light is polychromatic and contains light of many wavelengths Light that has only a single wavelength is monochromatic and is produced by devices called lasers which use transitions between two atomic energy levels to produce light in a very narrow range of wavelengths Atoms can also absorb light of certain energies resulting in a transition from the ground state or a lowerenergy e Line Spectra Radiation composed of a single wavelength is said to be monochromatic Spectrum distribution among various wavelengths of the radiant energy emitted or absorbed by an object Continuous spectrum rainbow of colors containing light of all wavelengths Not all radiation sources produce a continuous spectrum Line spectrum spectrum containing radiation of only specific wavelengths with and constant Bohrs Model Electrons in a permitted orbit have a specific energy and are said to be in an allowed energy state An electron in an allowed energy state will not radiate energy and therefore will not spiral into the nucleus Rydberg constant X J principal quantum number corresponds to the different allowed orbits for the electron All energies given by this equation will be negative The lower more negative the energy is the more stable the atom is The lowest energy state is that for which n Ground state lowest energy state of an atom Excited state when the electron is in higher energy orbit less negative n or higher If n becomes infinitely large the electron is completely separated from the nucleus Thus the state in which the electron is removed from the nucleus is the reference or zeroenergy state of the hydrogen atom It is important to remember that this zeroenergy state is higher in energy than the states with negative energies Electrons can change from one energy state to another by absorbing or emitting radiant energy Radiant energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to a higher energy state but is emitted when the electron moves to a lower energy state If then E is positive radiant energy is absorbed If then E is negative radiant energy is emitted The Wave Behavior of Matter An electron possesses both particle and wave properties Louis de Broglie showed that the wavelength of a particle is equal to Plancks constant divided by the mass times the velocity of the particle The electron in Bohrs circular orbits could thus be described as a standing wave one that does not move through space Werner Heisenbergs uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to precisely describe both the location and the speed of particles that exhibit wavelike behavior Momentum the product of the mass m and the velocity v of a particle Matter waves term used to describe the wave characteristics of a particle where is the wavelength is Plancks constant is the particle mass and is the velocity The Uncertainty Principle Uncertainty principle theory first put forth by Heisenberg states that is it impossible to determine both the exact momentum of the electron and its exact location Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Orbitals There is a relationship between the motions of electrons in atoms and molecules and their energies that is described by quantum mechanics Because of waveparticle duality scientists must deal with the probability of an electron being at a particular point in space To do so required the development of quantum mechanics which uses wavefunctions to describe the mathematical relationship between the motion of electrons in atoms and molecules and their energies Wave functions represented by ψ square of wave function ψ provides information about an electrons location when it is in an allowed energy state Probability density represented by ψ value that represents the probability that an electron will be found at a given point in space Electron density the probability of finding and electron at any particular point in an atom Equals ψ Orbitals and Quantum Numbers Orbital allowed energy state of an electron in the quantummechanical model of the atom also used to describe the spatial distribution of an electron Defined by the value of quantum numbers n l and ml Value of l Letter used s p d f The principal quantum number n can have integral values of and so forth As n increases the orbital becomes larger the electron has a higher energy and is farther away from the nucleus The second quantum number l can have integral values from to n for each value of n This quantum number defines the shape of the orbital Generally designated by the letters s p d and f These correspond to values ranging from to The magnetic quantum number ml can have integral values between l and l including zero This quantum number describes the orientation of the orbital in space Electron shell collection of orbitals with the same value of n Subshell one or more orbitals with the same set of n and l values Each shell is divided into the number of subshells equal to the principal quantum number n for that shell The first shell consists of only the s subshell the second shell consists of two subshells s and p the third of three subshell s p and d and so forth Each subshell is divided into orbitals Each s subshell consists of one orbital each p subshell of three orbitals each d subshell of five and each f subshell of seven orbitals D Representation of Orbitals Orbitals with l are s orbitals and are spherically symmetrical with the greatest probability of finding the electron occurring at the nucleus Orbitals with values of n and l contain one or more nodes Orbitals with l are p orbitals and contain a nodal plane that includes the nucleus giving rise to a dumbbell shape Orbitals with l are d orbitals and have more complex shapes with at least two nodal surfaces l orbitals are f orbitals which are still more complex The s Orbitals s orbital most stable spherically symmetric figure indicates that the probability decreases as we move away from the nucleus ALL s ORBITALS ARE SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC Nodal surfaces nodes intermediate regions where ψ goes to zero The number of nodes increases with increasing value for the principal quantum number n The p Orbitals Electron density is concentrated on two sides of the nucleus separated by a node at the nucleus The orbitals of a given subshell have the same size and shape but differ from each other in orientation The axis along which the orbital is oriented is not related to ml ManyElectron Atoms In addition to the three quantum numbers dictated by quantum mechanics a fourth quantum number is required to explain certain properties of atoms This is the electron spin quantum number which can have values of ½ or ½ for any electron corresponding to the two possible orientations of an electron in a magnetic field This is important for chemistry because the Pauli exclusion principle implies that no orbital can contain more than two electrons with opposite spin Although the shapes of the orbitals for manyelectron atoms are the same as those for hydrogen the presence of more than one electron greatly changes the energies of the orbitals In hydrogen the energy of an orbital depends only on its principal quantum number however in manyelectron atoms electronelectron repulsions cause different subshells to be at different energies Effective Nuclear Charge Effective nuclear charge net positive charge attracting electrons where is the effective nuclear charge is the number of protons in the nucleus and is the average number of electrons between the nucleus and electron in question Screening effect effect of inner electrons in decreasing the nuclear charge experienced by outer electrons Energies of Orbitals The extent to which an electron will be screened by the other electrons depends on its electron distribution as we move outward from the nucleus In a manyelectron atom for a given value of n Zeff decreases with increasing value of l In a manyelectron atom for a given value of n the energy of an orbital increases with increasing value of l Degenerate orbitals that have the same energy Electron Spin and the Pauli Exclusion Principle Electron spin property of the electron that makes it behave as though it were a tiny magnet The electron behaves as if it were spinning on its axis electron spin is quantized Electron spin quantum number denoted as ms It can only have two possible values ½ and ½ which we can interpret as indicating the two opposite directions in which the electron can spin Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers n l ml ms This means that if we wish to put two electrons in an orbital and satisfy Paulis exclusion principle our only choice is to assign different ms values to the electrons Because there are only two values we can conclude that an electron can hold a maximum of two electrons and they must have opposite spins Electron Configurations Based on the Pauli principle and a knowledge of orbital energies obtained using hydrogenlike orbitals it is possible to construct the periodic table by filling up the available orbitals beginning with the lowestenergy orbitals the aufbau principle which gives rise to a particular arrangement of electrons for each element its electron configuration Hunds rule says that the lowestenergy arrangement of electrons is the one that places them in degenerate orbitals with parallel spins Electron configuration the way in which the electrons are distributed among the various orbitals The most stable or ground electron configuration of an atom is that in which the electrons are in the lowest possible energy level Orbital diagram representation of electron configuration in which each orbital is represented by a box and each electron by a halfarrow A halfarrow pointing upward represents an electron with positive spin one pointing downward represents an electron with a negative spin Writing Electron Configurations Hunds rule rule stating that electrons occupy degenerate orbitals in such a way as to maximize the number of electrons with the same spin In other words each orbital has one electron placed in it before paring of electron in orbitals occurs Note that this rule applies to orbitals that are degenerate which means that they have the same energy Valence electrons electrons in the outer shells Core electrons electrons in the inner shells Transition elements aka Transition metals elements of the d orbitals Lanthanide elements aka Rareearth elements elements of the f orbitals Actinide elements elements of f orbitals Most are not found in nature Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table The arrangement of atoms in the periodic table results in blocks corresponding to filling of the ns np nd and nf orbitals to produce the distinctive chemical properties of the elements in the s block p block d block and f block respectively Main group elements aka Representatives s and p block elements Fblock metals elements located below the table f block elements Contributors and Attributions In predicting bond angles in small molecules we find we can do a great deal with the simple idea that unlike charges produce attractive forces while like charges produce repulsive forces We will have electronnuclear attractions electronelectron repulsions and nucleusnucleus repulsions Let us first consider the case of a molecule with just two electronpair bonds as might be expected to be formed by combination of beryllium and hydrogen to give beryllium hydride The problem will be how to formulate the bonds and how to predict what the angle will be If we proceed as we did with the bond we might try to formulate bond formation in by bringing two hydrogen atoms in the state up to beryllium in the ground state Table But there is a problem in the groundstate configuration of beryllium the orbital is full and cannot accommodate any more electrons The way around this is to promote one of the electrons of beryllium to a orbital The resulting beryllium atom called the valence state then could form a bond with a hydrogen by overlap of the and orbitals as shown in also see Figure We might formulate a second bond involving the orbital but a new problem arises as to where the hydrogen should be located relative to the beryllium orbital Is it as in or some other way The and nuclei will be farther apart in than they will be in or any other similar arrangement so there will be less internuclear repulsion with We therefore expect the hydrogen to locate along a line going through the greatest extension of the orbital According to this simple picture beryllium hydride should have two different types of bonds one as in and the other as in This is intuitively unreasonable for such a simple compound Furthermore the bond angle is unspecified by this picture because the orbital is spherically symmetrical and could form bonds equally well in any direction However if we forget about the orbitals and only consider the possible repulsions between the electron pairs and between the hydrogen nuclei we can see that these repulsions will be minimized when the bond angle is Thus arrangement should be more favorable than with a angle less than Unfortunately we cannot check this particular bond angle by experiment because is unstable and reacts with itself to give a highmolecularweight solid However a number of other compounds such as and are known to have bonds involving valence states Measurements of the bond angles at the metal of these substances in the vapor state has shown them to be uniformly Figure Representation of the relative sizes of and orbitals How are the and orbitals deployed in this kind of bonding It turns out that stronger bonds are formed when the degree of overlap of the orbitals is high The degree of overlap will depend on the sizes of the orbital and particularly on how far out they extend from the nucleus Figure shows how far and orbitals extend relative to one another Bonding with these orbitals as in and does not utilize the overlapping power of the orbitals to the fullest extent With we have overlap that uses only part of the orbital and with only a part of the orbital Molecules such as can be formulated with better overlap and equivalent bonds with the aid of the concept of orbital hybridization This concept published independently by L Pauling and J C Slater in involves determining which if any combinations of and orbitals may overlap better and make more effective bonds than do the individual and orbitals The mathematical procedure for orbital hybridization predicts that an and a orbital of one atom can form two stronger covalent bonds if they combine to form two new orbitals called hybridized orbitals Figure Each hybrid orbital has an overlapping power of compared to the pure orbital taken as unity and a pure orbital as Bond angles of are expected for bonds to an atom using hybrid orbitals and of course this also is the angle we expect on the basis of our consideration of minimum electronpair and internuclear repulsions Henceforth we will proceed on the basis that molecules of the type may form hybrid bonds Figure Diagram of two hybrid orbitals composed of an orbital and a orbital One of the orbitals solid line has its greatest extension in the plus direction while the other orbital dotted line has its greatest extension in the minus direction Bonds utilizing both of these orbitals would form at an angle of On the basis of repulsion between electron pairs and between nuclei molecules such as and in which the central atom forms three covalent bonds using the valencestate electronic configuration are expected to be planar with bond angles of For example Any departure from the planar arrangement will be less stable because it will increase internuclear and interelectronic repulsion by bringing nuclei closer together and the electron pairs closer together The and orbitals used in bonding in these compounds can be hybridized to give three equivalent orbitals Figure These orbitals have their axes in a common plane and are at to one another The predicted overlapping power is Figure Diagram of three hybrid orbitals made from an orbital a orbital and a orbital Each orbital is shown with a different kind of line With atoms such as carbon and silicon the valencestate electronic configuration to form four covalent bonds has to be Repulsion between the electron pairs and between the attached nuclei will be minimized by formation of a tetrahedral arrangement of the bonds the same geometry is predicted from hybridization one one and three orbitals which gives four hybrid orbitals directed at angles of to each other The predicted relative overlapping power of hybrid orbitals is Figure Figure Diagram of the hybrid

Electrophilic Addition Reactions EARs Understanding the Electrophilic Addition Mechanism In the final step the lone pair on Y is attracted to the positively charged carbocation and they react to form a second covalent bond and the product below EAR MechanismRegiochemistry and Regioselective ReactionsContributors Learning Objective draw the general Electrophilic Addition Reaction EAR mechanism for an alkene Introduction We are going to start by looking at ethene because it is the simplest molecule containing a carboncarbon double bond What is true of CC in ethene will be equally true of CC in more complicated alkenes Ethene CH is often modeled as shown above The double bond between the carbon atoms is of course two pairs of shared electrons What the diagram doesnt show is that the two pairs arent the same as each other One of the pairs of electrons is held on the line between the two carbon nuclei as you would expect but the other is held in a molecular orbital above and below the plane of the molecule A molecular orbital is a region of space within the molecule where there is a high probability of finding a particular pair of electrons In this diagram the line between the two carbon atoms represents a normal sigma bond the pair of shared electrons lies in a molecular orbital on the line between the two nuclei where you would expect them to be The other pair of electrons is found somewhere in the shaded part above and below the plane of the molecule This bond is called a pi bond The electrons in the pi bond are free to move around anywhere in this shaded region and can move freely from one half to the other The pi electrons are not as fully under the control of the carbon nuclei as the electrons in the sigma bond Because the pi bond electrons lie exposed above and below the rest of the molecule they are relatively open to reaction with other compounds Electrophilic Addition Reactions EARs In a sense the pi bond is an unnecessary bond The structure would hold together perfectly well with a single bond rather than a double bond The pi bond often breaks and the electrons in it are used to join other atoms or groups of atoms onto the alkene molecule To continue with our example ethene undergoes addition reactions An addition reaction is a reaction in which two molecules join together to make a bigger one Nothing is lost in the process All the atoms in the original molecules are found in the bigger one The pi bond is electron rich and takes the role of the nucleophile seeking out an electrophile with its full or partial positive charge Using a general molecule XY as the electrophile reacting with ethene the atoms X and Y are added to the carbon chain across the vinylic carbons as shown below Understanding the Electrophilic Addition Mechanism The mechanism for the reaction between ethene and a molecule XY begins by recognizing the electrophilic nature of XY Trends in relative electronegativity help identify bonds to create partial positives within polar compounds As shown below we are going to assume that Y is more electronegative than X so that the pair of electrons is pulled slightly towards the Y end of the bond This polarity means that the X atom carries a slight positive charge partial positive The slightly positive X atom is an electrophile and attracts the exposed pi electrons in the ethene Now imagine what happens as they approach each other The electrons in the half of the pi bond nearest the XY are attracted to the partial positive charge as shown below The two electrons in the pi bond move closer towards the X until a covalent bond is made Simultaneously the electrons in the XY bond are pushed entirely onto the Y to form the anion Y ion and a carbocation as shown below In the final step the lone pair on Y is attracted to the positively charged carbocation and they react to form a second covalent bond and the product below EAR Mechanism The movements of the electrons for the EAR mechanism are shown with curved arrows Regiochemistry and Regioselective Reactions Regiochemistry is the orientation of the electrophile relative to the pi bond of the alkene Electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes can be regioselective depending on the symmetry and structure of the alkene The details will be discussed in a later sections of this chapter Stereoselective Reactions Different stereoisomeric reactants produce different stereoisomeric products Electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes can be stereoselective depending on the symmetry and structure of the alkene The details will be discussed in a later sections of this chapter Exercise In the next section we will apply the Electrophilic Addition mechanism to actual compounds Draw the complete mechanism when hydrogen bromide gas is bubbled through a solution of cyclopentene Answer Contributors Jim Clark Chemguidecouk Addition to symmetrical alkenesMechanismReaction ratesContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to explain the term electrophilic addition reaction using the reaction of a protic acid HX with an alkene as an example write the mechanism for the reaction of a protic acid HX with an alkene sketch a reaction energy diagram for the electrophilic addition of an acid HX to an alkene Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below carbocation carbonium ion electrophilic addition reaction Study Notes An electrophilic addition reaction is a reaction in which a substrate is initially attacked by an electrophile and the overall result is the addition of one or more relatively simple molecules across a multiple bond The mechanism for the addition of hydrogen halide to propene shown in the reading is quite detailed Normally an organic chemist would write this mechanism as follows However the more detailed mechanism shown in the reading does allow you to see the exact fate of all the electrons involved in the reaction In your previous chemistry course you were probably taught the importance of balancing chemical equations It may come as a surprise to you that organic chemists usually do not balance their equations and often represent reactions using a format which is quite different from the carefully written balanced equations encountered in general chemistry courses In fact organic chemists are rarely interested in the inorganic products of their reactions furthermore most organic reactions are nonquantitative in nature In many of the reactions in this course the percentage yield is indicated beneath the products you are not expected to memorize these figures The question of yield is very important in organic chemistry where two five ten or even twenty reactions may be needed to synthesize a desired product For example if a chemist wishes to prepare compound D by the following reaction sequence and each of the individual steps gives only a yield one mole of A would give only mol mol of D You will gain firsthand experience of such situations in the laboratory component of this course This page looks at the reaction of the carboncarbon double bond in alkenes such as ethene with hydrogen halides such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide Symmetrical alkenes like ethene or butene are dealt with first These are alkenes where identical groups are attached to each end of the carboncarbon double bond Addition to symmetrical alkenes What happens All alkenes undergo addition reactions with the hydrogen halides A hydrogen atom joins to one of the carbon atoms originally in the double bond and a halogen atom to the other For example with ethene and hydrogen chloride you get chloroethane Figure Electrophilic addition of HCl to ethene With butene you get chlorobutane Figure Electrophilic addition of HCl to butene What happens if you add the hydrogen to the carbon atom at the righthand end of the double bond and the chlorine to the lefthand end You would still have the same product The chlorine would be on a carbon atom next to the end of the chain you would simply have drawn the molecule flipped over in space That would be different of the alkene was unsymmetrical thats why we have to look at them separately Mechanism The addition of hydrogen halides is one of the easiest electrophilic addition reactions because it uses the simplest electrophile the proton Hydrogen halides provide both a electrophile proton and a nucleophile halide First the electrophile will attack the double bond and take up a set of π electrons attaching it to the molecule This is basically the reverse of the last step in the E reaction deprotonation step The resulting molecule will have a single carbon carbon bond with a positive charge on one of them carbocation The next step is when the nucleophile halide bonds to the carbocation producing a new molecule with both the original hydrogen and halide attached to the organic reactant The second step will only occur if a good nucleophile is used Figure Mechanism of Electrophilic Addition of Hydrogen Halide to Ethene Figure Mechanism of Electrophilic Addition of Hydrogen Halide to Propene All of the halides HBr HCl HI HF can participate in this reaction and add on in the same manner Although different halides do have different rates of reaction due to the HX bond getting weaker as X gets larger poor overlap of orbitalss Reaction rates Variation of rates when you change the halogen Reaction rates increase in the order HF HCl HBr HI Hydrogen fluoride reacts much more slowly than the other three and is normally ignored in talking about these reactions When the hydrogen halides react with alkenes the hydrogenhalogen bond has to be broken The bond strength falls as you go from HF to HI and the hydrogenfluorine bond is particularly strong Because it is difficult to break the bond between the hydrogen and the fluorine the addition of HF is bound to be slow Variation of rates when you change the alkene This applies to unsymmetrical alkenes as well as to symmetrical ones For simplicity the examples given below are all symmetrical ones but they dont have to be Reaction rates increase as the alkene gets more complicated in the sense of the number of alkyl groups such as methyl groups attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond For example There are two ways of looking at the reasons for this both of which need you to know about the mechanism for the reactions Alkenes react because the electrons in the pi bond attract things with any degree of positive charge Anything which increases the electron density around the double bond will help this Alkyl groups have a tendency to push electrons away from themselves towards the double bond The more alkyl groups you have the more negative the area around the double bonds becomes The more negatively charged that region becomes the more it will attract molecules like hydrogen chloride The more important reason though lies in the stability of the intermediate ion formed during the reaction The three examples given above produce these carbocations carbonium ions at the halfway stage of the reaction The stability of the intermediate ions governs the activation energy for the reaction As you go towards the more complicated alkenes the activation energy for the reaction falls That means that the reactions become

Pasteur contributed to the development of the concept of the tetrahedral carbon atom Because enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in achiral environments separation of the stereoisomeric components of a racemic mixture or racemate is normally not possible by the conventional techniques of distillation and crystallization In some cases however the crystal habits of solid enantiomers and racemates permit the chemist acting as a chiral resolving agent to discriminate enantiomeric components of a mixture As background for the following example it is recommended that the section on crystal properties be reviewed Tartaric acid its potassium salt known in antiquity as tartar has served as the locus of several landmark events in the history of stereochemistry In the French chemist Jean Baptiste Biot observed that tartaric acid obtained from tartar was optically active rotating the plane of polarized light clockwise dextrorotatory An optically inactive higher melting form of tartaric acid called racemic acid was also known A little more than a decade later young Louis Pasteur conducted a careful study of the crystalline forms assumed by various salts of these acids He noticed that under certain conditions the sodium ammonium mixed salt of the racemic acid formed a mixture of enantiomorphic hemihedral crystals a drawing of such a pair is shown on the right Pasteur reasoned that the dissymmetry of the crystals might reflect the optical activity and dissymmetry of its component molecules After picking the different crystals apart with a tweezer he found that one group yielded the known dextrorotatory tartaric acid measured by Biot the second led to a previously unknown levorotatory tartaric acid having the same melting point as the dextrorotatory acid Today we recognize that Pasteur had achieved the first resolution of a racemic mixture and laid the foundation of what we now call stereochemistry Optical activity was first observed by the French physicist JeanBaptiste Biot He concluded that the change in direction of planepolarized light when it passed through certain substances was actually a rotation of light and that it had a molecular basis His work was supported by the experimentation of Louis Pasteur Pasteur observed the existence of two crystals that were mirror images in tartaric acid an acid found in wine Through meticulous experimentation he found that one set of molecules rotated polarized light clockwise while the other rotated light counterclockwise to the same extent He also observed that a mixture of both a racemic mixture or racemic modification did not rotate light because the optical activity of one molecule canceled the effects of the other molecule Pasteur was the first to show the

you should be able to use molecular models to show that only a tetrahedral carbon atom satisfactorily accounts for the lack of isomerism in molecules of the type CHXY and for the existence of optical isomerism in molecules of the type CHXYZ determine whether two differently oriented wedgeandbrokenline structures are identical or represent a pair of enantiomers Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below enantiomer Study Notes Stereoisomers are isomers that differ in spatial arrangement of atoms rather than order of atomic connectivity One of the most interesting types of isomer is the mirrorimage stereoisomer a nonsuperimposable set of two molecules that are mirror images of one another The existence of these molecules are determined by a a concept known as chirality The word chiral was derived from the Greek word for hand because our hands are a good example of chirality since they are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other Introduction The opposite of chiral is achiral Achiral objects are superimposable with their mirror images If the molecules are superimposable they are identical to each other For example two pieces of paper are achiral In contrast chiral objects like our hands are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other Try to line up your left hand perfectly with your right hand so that the palms are both facing in the same directions Spend about a minute doing this Do you see that they cannot line up exactly The same thing applies to some molecules A chiral molecule has a mirror image that cannot line up with it perfectly the mirror images are nonsuperimposable This pair of nonsuperimposable mirror image molecules are called enantiomers But why are chiral molecules so interesting Just like your left hand will not fit properly in your right glove one of the enantiomers of a molecule may not work the same way in your body as the other It turns out that many of the biological molecules such as our DNA amino acids and sugars are chiral molecules This must mean that enantiomers have properties that make them different from their mirror image molecule One of these properties is that chiral molecules do not have a plane of symmetry or an internal mirror plane So a chiral molecule cannot be divided into two identical halves Another property of chiral molecules is optical activity Organic compounds molecules created around a chain of carbon atoms more commonly known as the the carbon backbone play an essential role in the chemistry of life These molecules derive their importance from the energy they carry mainly in a form of potential energy Since potential energy can be widely affected due to changes in atomic placement it is important to understand the concept of an isomer a molecule sharing the same atomic connectivity as another but differing in structural arrangements This section is devoted to a specific type of isomer called stereoisomers and their property of chirality Figure Figure Two enantiomers of a tetrahedral complex from Wikipedia The concepts of steroisomerism and chirality command a great deal of importance in modern organic chemistry as these ideas help to explain the physical and theoretical reasons behind the formation and structures of numerous organic molecules the main reason behind the energy embedded in these essential chemicals In contrast to more wellknown constitutional isomerism which develops isotopic compounds simply by different atomic connectivity stereoisomerism generally maintains equal atomic connections and orders of building blocks as well as having same numbers of atoms and types of elements What then makes stereoisomers so unique To answer this question the learner must be able to think and imagine in not just twodimensional images but also threedimensional space This is due to the fact that stereoisomers are isomers because their atoms are different from others in terms of spatial arrangement Spatial Arrangement First and foremost one must understand the concept of spatial arrangement in order to understand stereoisomerism and chirality Spatial arrangement of atoms concern how different atomic particles and molecules are situated about in the space around the organic compound namely its carbon chain In this sense spatial arrangement of an organic molecule are different another if an atom is shifted in any threedimensional direction by even one degree This opens up a very broad possibility of different molecules each with their unique placement of atoms in threedimensional space Stereoisomers Stereoisomers are as mentioned above molecules that contain different types of isomers within itself each with distinct characteristics that further separate each other as different chemical entities having different properties Type called entaniomer are the previouslymentioned mirrorimage stereoisomers and will be explained in detail in this article Another type diastereomer has different properties and will be introduced afterwards Enantiomers This type of stereoisomer is the essential mirrorimage nonsuperimposable type of stereoisomer introduced in the beginning of the article Figure provides a perfect example note that the gray plane in the middle denotes the mirror plane between the two molecules Figure Note that even if one were to flip the left molecule over to the right the atomic spatial arrangement will not be equal This is equivalent to the left hand right hand relationship and is aptly referred to as handedness in molecules This can be somewhat counterintuitive so this article recommends the reader try the hand example Placeyour hands next to each other with the palms Now flip either side over to the other One hand should be showing the back of the hand while the other one is showing the palm They are not same and nonsuperimposable This is where the concept of chirality comes in as one of the most essential and defining idea of stereoisomerism Chirality Chirality essentially means mirrorimage nonsuperimposable molecules and to say that a molecule is chiral is to say that its mirror image it must have one is not the same as it self Whether a molecule is chiral or achiral depends upon a certain set of overlapping conditions Figure shows an example of two molecules chiral and achiral respectively Notice the distinct characteristic of the achiral molecule it possesses two atoms of same element In theory and reality if one were to create a plane that runs through the other two atoms they will be able to create what is known as bisecting plane The images on either side of the plan is the same as the other Figure Figure In this case the molecule is considered achiral In other words to distinguish chiral molecule from an achiral molecule one must search for the existence of the bisecting plane in a molecule All chiral molecules are deprive of bisecting plane whether simple or complex As a universal rule no molecule with different surrounding atoms are achiral Chirality is a simple but essential idea to support the concept of stereoisomerism being used to explain one type of its kind The chemical properties of the chiral molecule differs from its mirror image and in this lies the significance of chilarity in relation to modern organic chemistry It is pretty interesting that our hands seem to serve the same purpose but most people are only able to use one of their hands to write Similarly this is true with chiral biological molecules and interactions Contributors and Attributions Dr

molecule apart from its translational and nuclear energy can be expressed as the sum of three terms Absorption of electromagnetic radiation by molecules occurs not only by electronic excitation of the type described for atoms but also by changes in the vibrational and rotational energies Both rotations and vibrations of molecules are quantized This means that only particular values of rotational

elimination reactions including halocyclohexanes Cyclohexane Conformation Anticoplanar Orientation The concerted mechanism of the E reaction requires that the base and leaving group are orientated anticoplanar to each other When the betahydrogen and leaving group halide for this chapter are located on a membered ring then Zaitsevs Rule may not be followed The betahydrogen and leaving group must both be in the axial position for the E reaction to occur Consequently E reactions of certain cycloalkyl halides show unusual rates and regioselectivity that are not explained by the principles thus far discussed For example transmethylchlorocyclohexane reacts with alcoholic KOH at a much slower rate than does its cisisomer Furthermore the product from elimination of the transisomer is methylcyclohexene not predicted by the Zaitsev rule whereas the cisisomer gives the predicted methylcyclohexene as the chief product These differences are described by the first two equations in the following diagram Unlike open chain structures cyclic compounds generally restrict the spatial orientation of ring substituents to relatively few arrangements Consequently reactions conducted on such substrates often provide us with information about the preferred orientation of reactant species in the transition state Stereoisomers are particularly suitable in this respect so the results shown here contain important information about the E transition state The most sensible interpretation of the elimination reactions of and substituted halocyclohexanes is that this reaction prefers an anti orientation of the halogen and the betahydrogen which is attacked by the base These anti orientations are colored in red in the above equations The compounds used here all have sixmembered rings so the anti orientation of groups requires that they assume a diaxial conformation The observed differences in rate are the result of a steric preference for equatorial orientation of large substituents which reduces the effective concentration of conformers having an axial halogen In the case of the bromotertbutylcyclohexane isomers the tertbutyl group is so large that it will always assume an equatorial orientation leaving the bromine to be axial in the cisisomer and equatorial in the trans Because of symmetry the two axial betahydrogens in the cisisomer react equally with base resulting in rapid elimination to the same alkene actually a racemic mixture This reflects the fixed anti orientation of these hydrogens to the chlorine atom To assume a conformation having an axial bromine the transisomer must tolerate serious crowding distortions Such conformers are therefore present in extremely low concentration and the rate of elimination is very slow Indeed substitution by hydroxide anion predominates A similar analysis of the chloromethylcyclohexane isomers explains both the rate and regioselectivity differences Both the chlorine and methyl groups may assume an equatorial orientation in a chair conformation of the transisomer as shown in the top equation The axial chlorine needed for the E elimination is present only in the less stable alternative chair conformer but this structure has only one axial betahydrogen colored red and the resulting elimination gives methylcyclohexene In the cisisomer the smaller chlorine atom assumes an axial position in the more stable chair conformation and here there are two axial beta hydrogens The more stable methylcyclohexene is therefore the predominant product and the overall rate of elimination is relatively fast An orbital drawing of the antitransition state is shown on the right Note that the base attacks the alkyl halide from the side opposite the halogen just as in the SN mechanism In this drawing the α and β carbon atoms are undergoing a rehybridization from sp to sp and the developing πbond is drawn as dashed light blue lines The symbol R represents an alkyl group or hydrogen Since both the base and the alkyl halide are present in this transition state the reaction is bimolecular and should exhibit second order kinetics We should note in passing that a syntransition state would also provide good orbital overlap for elimination and in some cases where an antiorientation is prohibited by structural constraints synelimination has been observed Alkyl Halide Chains Instead in an E reaction stereochemistry of the double bond that is whether the E or Z isomer results is dictated by the stereochemistry of the starting material if it is diastereomeric In other words if the carbon with the hydrogen and the carbon with the halogen are both chiral then one diastereomer will lead to one product and the other diastereomer will lead to the other product The following reactions of potassium ethoxide with dibromostilbene dibromodiphenylethane both occurred via an E mechanism Two different diastereomers were used Two different stereoisomers E vs Z resulted Exercise Which of the following compounds will

After completing this section you should be able to explain the unusual products formed in certain reactions in terms of the rearrangement of an intermediate carbocation Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below alkyl shift hydride shift Study Notes Whenever possible carbocations will rearrange from a less stable isomer to a more stable isomer This rearrangement can be achieved by either a hydride shift where a hydrogen atom migrates from one carbon atom to the next taking a pair of electrons with it or an alkyl shift in which an alkyl group undergoes a similar migration again taking a bonding pair of electrons with it These migrations usually occur between neighbouring carbon atoms and hence are termed hydride shifts or alkyl shifts A hydride ion consists of a proton and two electrons that is H Hydride ions exist in compounds such as sodium hydride NaH and calcium hydride CaH An electrophilic reaction such as HX with an alkene will often yield more than one product This is strong evidence that the mechanism includes intermediate rearrangement steps of the cation Hydride Shift A hydride shift is a carbocation rearrangement in which a hydrogen atom in a carbocation migrates to the carbon atom bearing the formal charge of carbon from an adjacent carbon carbon see also aryl shift Alkyl Shift A alkyl shift is a carbocation rearrangement in which an alkyl group migrates to the carbon atom bearing the formal charge of carbon from an adjacent carbon atom carbon eg see also aryl shift hydride shift alkyl shift Exercises

communicated the stereochemical orentation of compounds using the wedges and dashes of perspective formulas For example the perspective formula for RLactic acid is shown below A Fischer projection is a convention used to depict stereochemistry in two dimensions The horizontal bonds are seen as wedges and the vertical bonds are seen as dashed lines as shown below in the example below for

Structure of Ionic Molecular CompoundsUsing Formal Charges to Distinguish between Lewis StructuresCOExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to calculate the formal charge of an atom in an organic molecule or ion identify and recognize the bonding patterns for atoms of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and the halogens that have a formal charge of zero Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below valence electrons bonding and nonbonding electrons formal charge carbocations Study Notes It is more important that students learn to easily identify atoms that have formal charges of zero than it is to actually calculate the formal charge of every atom in an organic compound Students will benefit by memorizing the normal number of bonds and nonbonding electrons around atoms whose formal charge is equal to zero Determining the Formal Charge on an Atom A formal charge compares the number of electrons around a neutral atom an atom not in a molecule versus the number of electrons around an atom in a molecule Formal charge is assigned to an atom in a molecule by assuming that electrons in all chemical bonds are shared equally between atoms regardless of relative electronegativity To calculate formal charges we assign electrons in the molecule to individual atoms according to these rules Nonbonding electrons are assigned to the atom on which they are located Bonding electrons are divided equally between the two bonded atoms so one electron from each bond goes to each atom The formal charge of each atom in a molecule can be calculated using the following equation Formal Charge of valence electrons in free atom of lonepair electrons of bond pair electrons Eqn To illustrate this method lets calculate the formal charge on the atoms in ammonia NH whose Lewis structure is as follows A neutral nitrogen atom has five valence electrons it is in group From the Lewis structure the nitrogen atom in ammonia has one lone pair and three bonds with hydrogen atoms Substituting into Equation we obtain Formal Charge of N valence e lone pair e x bond pair e A neutral hydrogen atom has one valence electron Each hydrogen atom in the molecule has no nonbonding electrons and one bond Using Equation to calculate the formal charge on hydrogen we obtain Formal Charge of H valence e lone pair e x bond pair e The sum of the formal charges of each atom must be equal to the overall charge of the molecule or ion In this example the nitrogen and each hydrogen has a formal charge of zero When summed the overall charge is zero which is consistent with the overall neutral charge of the NH molecule Typically the structure with the most formal charges of zero on atoms is the more stable Lewis structure In cases where there MUST be positive or negative formal charges on various atoms the most stable structures generally have negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms and positive formal charges on the less electronegative atoms The next example further demonstrates how to calculate formal charges for polyatomic ions Example Calculate the formal charges on each atom in the NH ion Given chemical species Asked for formal charges Strategy Identify the number of valence electrons in each atom in the NH ion Use the Lewis electron structure of NH to identify the number of bonding and nonbonding electrons associated with each atom and then use Equation to calculate the formal charge on each atom Solution The Lewis electron structure for the NH ion is as follows The nitrogen atom in ammonium has zero nonbonding electrons and bonds Using Equation the formal charge on the nitrogen atom is therefore Formal Charge of N valence e lone pair e x bond pair e formalchargeN Each hydrogen atom in has one bond and zero nonbonding electrons The formal charge on each hydrogen atom is therefore Formal Charge of H valence e lone pair e x bond pair e formalchargeH The formal charges on the atoms in the NH ion are thus Adding together the formal charges on the atoms should give us the total charge on the molecule or ion In this case the sum of the formal charges is which is the same a s the overall charge of the ammonium polyatomic ion Exercise Write the formal charges on all atoms in BH Answer Determining the Charge of Atoms in Organic Structures The calculation method reviewed above for determining formal charges on atoms is an essential starting point for a novice organic chemist and works well when dealing with small structures But this method becomes unreasonably timeconsuming when dealing with larger structures It would be exceptionally tedious to determine the formal charges on each atom in deoxycytidine one of the four nucleoside building blocks that make up DNA using equation As you get more experience with organic structures you will be able to quickly look at this type of complicated structure and determine charges on each atom You need to develop the ability to quickly and efficiently draw large structures and determine formal charges Fortunately this only requires some practice with recognizing common bonding patterns Organic chemistry only deals with a small part of the periodic table so much so that it becomes convenient to be able to recognize the bonding forms of these atoms The figure below contains the most important bonding forms These will be discussed in detail below An important idea to note is most atoms in a molecule are neutral Pay close attention to the neutral forms of the elements below because that is how they will appear most of the time Figure Structures of common organic atoms and ions Carbon Carbon the most important element for organic chemists In the structures of methane methanol ethane ethene and ethyne there are four bonds to the carbon atom And each carbon atom has a formal charge of zero In other words carbon is tetravalent meaning that it commonly forms four bonds Carbon is tetravalent in most organic molecules but there are exceptions Later in this chapter and throughout this book are examples of organic ions called carbocations and carbanions in which a carbon atom has a positive or negative formal charge respectively Carbocations occur when a carbon has only three bonds and no lone pairs of electrons Carbocations have only valence electrons and a formal charge of Carbanions occur when the carbon atom has three bonds plus one lone pair of electrons Carbanions have valence electrons and a formal charge of Two other possibilities are carbon radicals and carbenes both of which have a formal charge of zero A carbon radical has three bonds and a single unpaired electron Carbon radicals have valence electrons and a formal charge of zero Carbenes are a highly reactive species in which a carbon atom has two bonds and one lone pair of electrons giving it a formal charge of zero Though carbenes are rare you will encounter them in section Addition of Carbenes to Alkenes You should certainly use the methods you have learned to check that these formal charges are correct for the examples given above More importantly you will need before you progress much further in your study of organic chemistry to simply recognize these patterns and the patterns described below for other atoms and be able to identify carbons that bear positive and negative formal charges by a quick inspection Hydrogen The common bonding pattern for hydrogen is easy hydrogen atoms in organic molecules typically have only one bond no unpaired electrons and a formal charge of zero The exceptions to this rule are the proton H the hydride ion H and the hydrogen radical H The proton is a hydrogen with no bonds and no lone pairs and a formal charge of The hydride ion is a is a hydrogen with no bonds a pair of electrons and a formal charge of The hydrogen radical is a hydrogen atom with no bonds a single unpaired electron and a formal charge of Because this book concentrates on organic chemistry as applied to living things however we will not be seeing naked protons and hydrides as such because they are too reactive to be present in that form in aqueous solution Nonetheless the idea of a proton will be very important when we discuss acidbase chemistry and the idea of a hydride ion will become very important much later in the book when we discuss organic oxidation and reduction reactions As a rule though all hydrogen atoms in organic molecules have one bond and no formal charge Oxygen The common arrangement of oxygen that has a formal charge of zero is when the oxygen atom has bonds and lone pairs Other arrangements are oxygen with bond and lone pairs that has a formal charge and oxygen with bonds and lone pair that has a formal charge of All three patterns of oxygen fulfill the octet rule If it has two bonds and two lone pairs as in water it will have a formal charge of zero If it has one bond and three lone pairs as in hydroxide ion it will have a formal charge of If it has three bonds and one lone pair as in hydronium ion it will have a formal charge of Oxygen can also exist as a radical such as where an oxygen atom has one bond two lone pairs and one unpaired free radical electron giving it a formal charge of zero For now however concentrate on the three main nonradical examples as these will account for most oxygen containing molecules you will encounter in organic chemistry Nitrogen Nitrogen has two major bonding patterns both of which fulfill the octet rule If a nitrogen has three bonds and a lone pair it has a formal charge of zero If it has four bonds and no lone pair it has a formal charge of In a fairly uncommon bonding pattern negatively charged nitrogen has two bonds and two lone pairs Phosphorus and Sulfur Two third row elements are commonly found in biological organic molecules phosphorus and sulfur Although both of these elements have other bonding patterns that are relevant in laboratory chemistry in a biological context sulfur almost always follows the same bondingformal charge pattern as oxygen while phosphorus is present in the form of phosphate ion PO where it has five bonds almost always to oxygen no lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Remember that elements in the third row of the periodic table have d orbitals in their valence shell as well as s and p orbitals and thus are not bound by the octet rule Halogens The halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are very important in laboratory and medicinal organic chemistry but less common in naturally occurring organic molecules Halogens in organic compounds usually are seen with one bond three lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Sometimes especially in the case of bromine we will encounter reactive species in which the halogen has two bonds usually in a threemembered ring two lone pairs and a formal charge of These rules if learned and internalized so that you dont even need to think about them will allow you to draw large organic structures complete with formal charges quite quickly Once you have gotten the hang of drawing Lewis structures it is not always necessary to draw lone pairs on heteroatoms as you can assume that the proper number of electrons are present around each atom to match the indicated formal charge or lack thereof Occasionally though lone pairs are drawn if doing so helps to make an explanation more clear Exercise Please identify an atom with a nonneutral charge in the following atom Answer Drawing the Lewis Structure of Ionic Molecular Compounds The hydroxide ion OH is drawn simply by showing the oxygen atom with its six valence electrons then adding one more electron to account for the negative charge By changing the number of valence electrons the bonding characteristic of oxygen are now changed Now the oxygen has three nonbonding lone pairs and can only form one bond to a hydrogen To draw a Lewis structure of the hydronium ion HO you again start with the oxygen atom with its six valence electrons then take one away to account for the positive charge to give oxygen five valence electrons The oxygen has one nonbonding lone pair and three unpaired electrons which can be used to form bonds to three hydrogen atoms Using Formal Charges to Distinguish between Lewis Structures As an example of how formal charges can be used to determine the most stable Lewis structure for a substance we can compare two possible structures for CO Both structures conform to the rules for Lewis electron structures CO C is less electronegative than O so it is the central atom C has valence electrons and each O has valence electrons for a total of valence electrons Placing one electron pair between the C and each O gives OCO with electrons left over Dividing the remaining electrons between the O atoms gives three lone pairs on each atom This structure has an octet of electrons around each O atom but only electrons around the C atom No electrons are left for the central atom To give the carbon atom an octet of electrons we can convert two of the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms to bonding electron pairs There are however two ways to do this We can either take one electron pair from each oxygen to form a symmetrical structure or take both electron pairs from a single oxygen atom to give an asymmetrical structure Both Lewis electron structures give all three atoms an octet How do we decide between these two possibilities The formal charges for the two Lewis electron structures of CO are as follows Both Lewis structures have a net formal charge of zero but the structure on the right has a charge on the more electronegative atom O Thus the symmetrical Lewis structure on the left is predicted to be more stable and it is in fact the structure observed experimentally Remember though that formal charges do not represent the actual charges on atoms in a molecule or ion They are used simply as a bookkeeping method for predicting the most stable Lewis structure for a compound Note The Lewis structure with the set of formal charges closest to zero is usually the most stable Example The thiocyanate ion SCN which is used in printing and as a corrosion inhibitor against acidic gases has at least two possible Lewis electron structures Draw two possible structures assign formal charges on all atoms in both and decide which is the preferred arrangement of electrons Given chemical species Asked for Lewis electron structures formal charges and preferred arrangement Strategy A Use the stepbystep procedure to write two plausible Lewis electron structures for SCN B Calculate the formal charge on each atom using Equation C Predict which structure is preferred based on the formal charge on each atom and its electronegativity relative to the other atoms present Solution A Possible Lewis structures for the SCN ion are as follows B We must calculate the formal charges on each atom to identify the more stable structure If we begin with carbon we notice that the carbon atom in each of these structures shares four bonding pairs the number of bonds typical for carbon so it has a formal charge of zero Continuing with sulfur we observe that in a the sulfur atom shares one bonding pair and has three lone pairs and has a total of six

productsspecify the reagents for hydrohalogenation of alkenes Introduction The proton is not the only electrophilic species that initiates addition reactions to the double bond of alkenes Lewis acids like the halogens boron hydrides and certain transition metal ions are able to accept the alkene pielectrons The resulting positively charged intermediates attract nucleophiles to give addition productsThe electrophilic character of the halogens is well known Fluorine adds uncontrollably with alkenes and the addition of iodine is unfavorable so these are not useful preparative methods Chlorine Cl and bromine Br react selectively with the double bond of alkenes so we will focus on these reactions The addition of chlorine and bromine to alkenes as shown below produces vicinal dihalocompounds In this reaction we can assume that the solvent was something that is not nucleophilic such as tetrahydrofuran THF RCCR X RCXCRX If this same reaction is performed in a nucleophilic solvent like water or an alcohol then the solvent becomes the nucleophile in the second step and reacts with the bromonium or chloronium ion to form a halohydrin as shown below RCCR X HO RCOHCRX There are also other halogencontaining reagents that add to double bonds such as hypohalous acids HOX and sulfenyl chlorides RSCl These reagents are unsymmetrical so their addition to unsymmetrical double bonds may in principle take place in two ways In practice these addition reactions are regioselective with one of the two possible constitutionally isomeric products being favored The electrophilic moiety in both of these reagents is the halogen CHCCH HOBr CHCOHCHBr CHCCH CHSCl CHCClCHSCH Mechanisms explain the Regioselectivity XHO or XROH The regioselectivity of halohydrin formation from an alkene reaction with a halogen in a nucleophilic solvent is analogous to the oxymercurationdemercuration pathway The halogen molecule takes the role of electrophile accepting nucleophilic pi electrons from the alkene while simultaneously forming a bond with the other vinyl carbon to create a bromonium or chloroium ion The bromonium or chloronium ion formation stabilizes the positive charge and prevents carbocation rearrangement The solvent takes the role of the nucleophile because it is present is a much greater percentage than the leaving group and reacts with the most substituted carbon of the cyclic bromonium or chloronium ion to create regiochemistry The stereochemistry of this reaction is antiaddition because the solvent approaches the bromonium ion with back side orientation to produce the addition product However since the interaction of the halogen with the alkene can occur from above or below there is no stereochemical control in this reaction and a mixture of enantiomers will be produced when applicable The final step of this mechanism is a proton transfer to a solvent water molecule to neutralize the addition product HOX or RSCl The regioselectivity of the hypohalous acids and sulfenyl chloride reactions may be explained by the same mechanism we used to rationalize the Markovnikov rule Bonding of an electrophilic species to the double bond of an alkene forms preferentially to produce the more stable more highly substituted carbocation This intermediate should then combine rapidly with a nucleophilic species to produce the addition product To apply this mechanism we need to determine the electrophilic moiety in each of the reagents By using electronegativity differences we can dissect common addition reagents into electrophilic and nucleophilic moieties as shown on the right In the case of hypochlorous and hypobromous acids HOX these weak Brønsted acids pKas ca do not react as proton donors and since oxygen is more electronegative than chlorine or bromine the electrophile will be a halide cation The nucleophilic species that bonds to the intermediate carbocation is then hydroxide ion or more likely water the usual solvent for these reagents and the products are called halohydrins Sulfenyl chlorides add in the opposite manner because the electrophile is a sulfur cation RS whereas the nucleophilic moiety is chloride anion chlorine is more electronegative than sulfur Below are some examples illustrating the addition of various electrophilic halogen reagents to alkene groups Notice the specific regiochemistry of the products as explained above Exercise Predict the product of the following reaction When butene is treated with NBS in the presence of water the product shows that the bromine is on the least substituted carbon is this Markovnikov or antiMarkovnikov Answer Since the bromine is the first addition to the alkene this addition would be an antiMarkovnikov addition Contributors Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State

structure of a simple example of each of the compound types listed in Objective Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below functional group Study Notes The concept of functional groups is a very important one We expect that you will need to refer back to tables at the end of Section quite frequently at first as it is not really feasible to learn the names and structures of all the functional groups and compound types at one sitting Gradually they will become familiar and eventually you will recognize them automatically Functional groups are small groups of atoms that exhibit a characteristic reactivity A particular functional group will almost always display its distinctive chemical behavior when it is present in a compound Because of their importance in understanding organic chemistry functional groups have specific names that often carry over in the naming of individual compounds incorporating the groups As we progress in our study of organic chemistry it will become extremely important to be able to quickly recognize the most common functional groups because they are the key structural elements that define how organic molecules react For now we will only worry about drawing and recognizing each functional group as depicted by Lewis and line structures Much of the remainder of your study of organic chemistry will be taken up with learning about how the different functional groups tend to behave in organic reactions Drawing abbreviated organic structures Often when drawing organic structures chemists find it convenient to use the letter R to designate part of a molecule outside of the region of interest If we just want to refer in general to a functional group without drawing a specific molecule for example we can use R groups to focus attention on the group of interest The R group is a convenient way to abbreviate the structures of large biological molecules especially when we are interested in something that is occurring specifically at one location on the molecule Common Functional Groups In the following sections many of the common functional groups found in organic chemistry will be described Tables of these functional groups can be found at the bottom of the page Hydrocarbons The simplest functional group in organic chemistry which is often ignored when listing functional groups is called an alkane characterized by single bonds between two carbons and between carbon and hydrogen Some examples of alkanes include methane CH is the natural gas you may burn in your furnace or on a stove Octane CH is a component of gasoline Alkanes Alkenes sometimes called olefins have carboncarbon double bonds and alkynes have carboncarbon triple bonds Ethene the simplest alkene example is a gas that serves as a cellular signal in fruits to stimulate ripening If you want bananas to ripen quickly put them in a paper bag along with an apple the apple emits ethene gas setting off the ripening process in the bananas Ethyne commonly called acetylene is used as a fuel in welding blow torches Alkenes and alkynes Alkenes have trigonal planar electron geometry due to sp hybrid orbitals at the alkene carbons while alkynes have linear geometry due to sp hybrid orbitals at the alkyne carbons Furthermore many alkenes can take two geometric forms cis or trans or Z and E which will be explained in detail in Chapter The cis and trans forms of a given alkene are different molecules with different physical properties there is a very high energy barrier to rotation about a double bond In the example below the difference between cis and trans alkenes is readily apparent Alkanes alkenes and alkynes are all classified as hydrocarbons because they are composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms Alkanes are said to be saturated hydrocarbons because the carbons are bonded to the maximum possible number of hydrogens in other words they are saturated with hydrogen atoms The double and triplebonded carbons in alkenes and alkynes have fewer hydrogen atoms bonded to them they are thus referred to as unsaturated hydrocarbons As we will see in Chapter hydrogen can be added to double and triple bonds in a type of reaction called hydrogenation The aromatic group is exemplified by benzene which used to be a commonly used solvent on the organic lab but which was shown to be carcinogenic and naphthalene a compound with a distinctive mothball smell Aromatic groups are planar flat ring structures and are widespread in nature We will learn more about the structure and reactions of aromatic groups in Chapter Aromatics Functional Groups with Carbon Single Bonds to other Atoms Halides When the carbon of an alkane is bonded to one or more halogens the group is referred to as a alkyl halide or haloalkane The presence of a halogen atom F Cl Br or I is often represented by X due to the similar chemistry of halogens Chloroform is a useful solvent in the laboratory and was one of the earlier anesthetic drugs used in surgery Chlorodifluoromethane was used as a refrigerant and in aerosol sprays until the late twentieth century but its use was discontinued after it was found to have harmful effects on the ozone layer Bromoethane is a simple alkyl halide often used in organic synthesis Alkyl halides groups are quite rare in biomolecules Alcohols and Thiols In the alcohol functional group a carbon is singlebonded to an OH group the OH group by itself is referred to as a hydroxyl Except for methanol all alcohols can be classified as primary secondary or tertiary In a primary alcohol the carbon bonded to the OH group is also bonded to only one other carbon In a secondary alcohol and tertiary alcohol the carbon is bonded to two or three other carbons respectively When the hydroxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring the resulting group is called a phenol The sulfur analog of an alcohol is called a thiol the prefix thio derived from the Greek refers to sulfur Ethers and sulfides In an ether functional group a central oxygen is bonded to two carbons Below are the line and Lewis structures of diethyl ether a common laboratory solvent and also one of the first medical anaesthesia agents In sulfides the oxygen atom of an ether has been replaced by a sulfur atom Amines Amines are characterized by nitrogen atoms with single bonds to hydrogen and carbon Just as there are primary secondary and tertiary alcohols there are primary secondary and tertiary amines Ammonia is a special case with no carbon atoms One of the most important properties of amines is that they are basic and are readily protonated to form ammonium cations In the case where a nitrogen has four bonds to carbon which is somewhat unusual in biomolecules it is called a quaternary ammonium ion Note Do not be confused by how the terms primary secondary and tertiary are applied to alcohols and amines the definitions are different In alcohols what matters is how many other carbons the alcohol carbon is bonded to while in amines what matters is how many carbons the nitrogen is bonded to Carbonyl Containing Functional Groups Aldehydes and Ketones There are a number of functional groups that contain a carbonoxygen double bond which is commonly referred to as a carbonyl Ketones and aldehydes are two closely related carbonylbased functional groups that react in very similar ways In a ketone the carbon atom of a carbonyl is bonded to two other carbons In an aldehyde the carbonyl carbon is bonded on one side to a hydrogen and on the other side to a carbon The exception to this definition is formaldehyde in which the carbonyl carbon has bonds to two hydrogens Carboxylic acids and acid derivatives If a carbonyl carbon is bonded on one side to a carbon or hydrogen and on the other side to a heteroatom in organic chemistry this term generally refers to oxygen nitrogen sulfur or one of the halogens the functional group is considered to be one of the carboxylic acid derivatives a designation that describes a grouping of several functional groups The eponymous member of this grouping is the carboxylic acid functional group in which the carbonyl is bonded to a hydroxyl OH group As the name implies carboxylic acids are acidic meaning that they are readily deprotonated to form the conjugate base form called a carboxylate much more about carboxylic acids in Chapter In amides the carbonyl carbon is bonded to a nitrogen The nitrogen in an amide can be bonded either to hydrogens to carbons or to both Another way of thinking of an amide is that it is a carbonyl bonded to an amine In esters the carbonyl carbon is bonded to an oxygen which is itself bonded to another carbon Another way of thinking of an ester is that it is a carbonyl bonded to an alcohol Thioesters are similar to esters except a sulfur is in place of the oxygen In an acid anhydride there are two carbonyl carbons with an oxygen in between An acid anhydride is formed from combination of two carboxylic acids with the loss of water anhydride an anhydride In an acyl phosphate the carbonyl carbon is bonded to the oxygen of a phosphate and in an acid chloride the carbonyl carbon is bonded to a chlorine Nitriles and Imines In a nitrile group a carbon is triplebonded to a nitrogen Nitriles are also often referred to as cyano groups Molecules with carbonnitrogen double bonds are called imines or Schiff bases Phosphates Phosphorus is a very important element in biological organic chemistry and is found as the central atom in the phosphate group Many biological organic molecules contain phosphate diphosphate and triphosphate groups which are linked to a carbon atom by the phosphate ester functionality Because phosphates are so abundant in biological organic chemistry it is convenient to depict them with the abbreviation P Notice that this P abbreviation includes the oxygen atoms and negative charges associated with the phosphate groups Molecules with Multiple Functional Groups A single compound may contain several different functional groups The sixcarbon sugar molecules glucose and fructose for example contain aldehyde and ketone groups respectively and both contain five alcohol groups a compound with several alcohol groups is often referred to as a polyol Capsaicin the compound responsible for the heat in hot peppers contains phenol ether amide and alkene functional groups capsaicin The male sex hormone testosterone contains ketone alkene and secondary alcohol groups while acetylsalicylic acid aspirin contains aromatic carboxylic acid and ester groups While not in any way a complete list this section has covered most of the important functional groups that we will encounter in biological and laboratory organic chemistry The

PetroleumGasolineOctane RatingsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe the general nature of petroleum deposits and recognize why petroleum is such an important source of organic compounds explain in general terms the processes involved in the refining of petroleum define the octane number of a fuel and relate octane number to chemical structure Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below catalytic cracking catalytic reforming fractional distillation octane number octane rating Study Notes The refining of petroleum into usable fractions is a very important industrial process In the laboratory component of this course you will have the opportunity to compare this industrial process to the distillation procedure as it is performed in the student laboratory Petroleum The petroleum that is pumped out of the ground is a complex mixture of several thousand organic compounds including straightchain alkanes cycloalkanes alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons with four to several hundred carbon atoms The identities and relative abundance of the components vary depending on the source Texas crude oil is somewhat different from Saudi Arabian crude oil In fact the analysis of petroleum from different deposits can produce a fingerprint of each which is useful in tracking down the sources of spilled crude oil For example Texas crude oil is sweet meaning that it contains a small amount of sulfurcontaining molecules whereas Saudi Arabian crude oil is sour meaning that it contains a relatively large amount of sulfurcontaining molecules Gasoline Petroleum is converted to useful products such as gasoline in three steps distillation cracking and reforming Recall from Chapter Introduction to Chemistry that distillation separates compounds on the basis of their relative volatility which is usually inversely proportional to their boiling points Part a in Figure shows a cutaway drawing of a column used in the petroleum industry for separating the components of crude oil The petroleum is heated to approximately C F and becomes a mixture of liquid and vapor This mixture called the feedstock is introduced into the refining tower The most volatile components those with the lowest boiling points condense at the top of the column where it is cooler while the less volatile components condense nearer the bottom Some materials are so nonvolatile that they collect at the bottom without evaporating at all Thus the composition of the liquid condensing at each level is different These different fractions each of which usually consists of a mixture of compounds with similar numbers of carbon atoms are drawn off separately Part b in Figure shows the typical fractions collected at refineries the number of carbon atoms they contain their boiling points and their ultimate uses These products range from gases used in natural and bottled gas to liquids used in fuels and lubricants to gummy solids used as tar on roads and roofs Figure The Distillation of Petroleum a This is a diagram of a distillation column used for separating petroleum fractions b Petroleum fractions condense at different temperatures depending on the number of carbon atoms in the molecules and are drawn off from the column The most volatile components those with the lowest boiling points condense at the top of the column and the least volatile those with the highest boiling points condense at the bottom The economics of petroleum refining are complex For example the market demand for kerosene and lubricants is much lower than the demand for gasoline yet all three fractions are obtained from the distillation column in comparable amounts Furthermore most gasolines and jet fuels are blends with very carefully controlled compositions that cannot vary as their original feedstocks did To make petroleum refining more profitable the less volatile lowervalue fractions are converted to more volatile highervalue mixtures that have carefully controlled formulas The first process used to accomplish this transformation is cracking in which the larger and heavier hydrocarbons in the kerosene and higherboilingpoint fractions are heated to temperatures as high as C Hightemperature reactions cause the carboncarbon bonds to break which converts the compounds to lighter molecules similar to those in the gasoline fraction Thus in cracking a straightchain alkane with a number of carbon atoms corresponding to the kerosene fraction is converted to a mixture of hydrocarbons with a number of carbon atoms corresponding to the lighter gasoline fraction The second process used to increase the amount of valuable products is called reforming it is the chemical conversion of straightchain alkanes to either branchedchain alkanes or mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons Using metals such as platinum brings about the necessary chemical reactions The mixtures of products obtained from cracking and reforming are separated by fractional distillation Octane Ratings The quality of a fuel is indicated by its octane rating which is a measure of its ability to burn in a combustion engine without knocking or pinging Knocking and pinging signal premature combustion Figure which can be caused either by an engine malfunction or by a fuel that burns too fast In either case the gasolineair mixture detonates at the wrong point in the engine cycle which reduces the power output and can damage valves pistons bearings and other engine components The various gasoline formulations are designed to provide the mix of hydrocarbons least likely to cause knocking or pinging in a given type of engine performing at a particular level Figure The Burning of Gasoline in an Internal Combustion Engine a Normally fuel is ignited by the spark plug and combustion spreads uniformly outward b Gasoline with an octane rating that is too low for the engine can ignite prematurely resulting in uneven burning that causes knocking and pinging The octane scale was established in using a standard test engine and two pure compounds nheptane and isooctane trimethylpentane nHeptane which causes a great deal of knocking on combustion was assigned an octane rating of whereas isooctane a very smoothburning fuel was assigned an octane rating of Chemists assign octane ratings to different blends of gasoline by burning a sample of each in a test engine and comparing the observed knocking with the amount of knocking caused by specific mixtures of nheptane and isooctane For example the octane rating of a blend of isooctane and nheptane is simply the average of the octane ratings of the components weighted by the relative amounts of each in the blend Converting percentages to decimals we obtain the octane rating of the mixture As shown in Figure many compounds that are now available have octane ratings greater than which means they are better fuels than pure isooctane In addition antiknock agents also called octane enhancers have been developed One of the most widely used for many years was tetraethyl lead CHPb which at approximately ggal gives a point increase in octane rating Since however lead compounds have been phased out as gasoline additives because they are highly toxic Other enhancers such as methyl tbutyl ether MTBE have been developed to take their place They combine a high octane rating with minimal corrosion to engine and fuel system parts Unfortunately when gasoline containing MTBE leaks from underground storage tanks the result has been contamination of the groundwater in some locations resulting in limitations or outright bans on the use of MTBE in certain areas As a result the use of alternative octane enhancers such as ethanol which can be obtained from renewable resources such as corn sugar cane and eventually corn stalks and grasses is increasing Figure The Octane Ratings of Some Hydrocarbons and Common Additives Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University A Naming a Compound of Known StructureB Translating a Name into its Chemical StructureContributors and Attributions There are two aspects to consider how to derive the name from the structure and how to derive the structure from the name We will discuss each by example A Naming a Compound of Known Structure You first should decide what type of compound it is The decision usually is straightforward for hydrocarbons which will fall in one or the other of the categories alkanes alkenes alkynes arenes cycloalkanes and so on But when the compound has more than one functional group it is not always obvious which is the parent function For example Compound could be named as an alkene because of the doublebond function or as an alcohol because of the function There are no simple rules to follow that dictate which is the parent function and we suggest that the order of precedence of functional groups set by Chemical Abstracts be used whenever possible see Table By this system the group takes precedence over hydrocarbons and Compound therefore is named as an alcohol not as an alkene Having decided on the main classification our next step is to identify the longest chain that includes the main functional group Then this chain is numbered starting at the end that gives the main function the lowest possible number The remaining groups functional or nonfunctional are taken as substituents and are assigned numbers according to their position along the chain Thus for Compound The longest continuous carbon chain carrying the group is a sixcarbon unit The prefix for a sixcarbon hydrocarbon is hex The chain is numbered so the group is at the lowest possible number Therefore the IUPAC suffix is ol in which ol signifies alcohol see Section The remaining functions are methyl at and ene at The complete name is Notice that the final e is dropped from the suffix ene when followed by another suffix beginning with a vowel One further point of possible confusion is where to locate the numerical symbol for the main functional group in the name For instance if the double bond in were absent we could name the compound either methylhexanol or methylhexanol The rule is to not divide the name unnecessarily Thus methylhexanol would be correct and methylhexanol would be incorrect B Translating a Name into its Chemical Structure The first step is to identify the parent function which usually is determined from the suffix or word at the end of the name Suppose for example that a structure is to be written for a compound having the name methoxybutanal The suffix al is the IUPAC suffix for aldehyde therefore the compound is an aldehyde and the function is The next step is to set up the carbon chain that includes the aldehyde carbon The prefix butan denotes a saturated fourcarbon chain and a partial structure with numbering may be written to place the aldehyde function at The rest of the name which generally precedes the parent name describes the substituent and its position on the parent chain In our example methoxy means a group at Thus the complete structure of methoxybutanal is The foregoing examples illustrate that naming compounds from structures or deducing structures from names requires knowledge of both the parent names and the substituent names of the important types of functional and nonfunctional groups This information is summarized in the following sections and in Table Contributors and

You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions We now wish to discuss displacements by nucleophilic reagents on alkyl derivatives These are ionic or polar reactions involving attack by a nucleophile at carbon A typical example is the reaction of hydroxide ion with bromomethane to displace bromide ion The electron pair of the bond can be regarded as having been donated by the hydroxide ion while the electron pair of the bond departs with the leaving bromide ion The name for this type of reaction is abbreviated for substitution and for nucleophilic Reactions of this type are very useful They can lead to compounds in which the new bond to carbon in the alkyl group is to chlorine bromine iodine oxygen sulfur carbon nitrogen or phosphorus depending on the nature of the nucleophile used Nucleophilic substitutions are especially important for alkyl halides but they should not be considered to be confined to alkyl halides Many other alkyl derivatives such as alcohols ethers esters and onium ions also can undergo reactions if conditions are appropriate The scope of reactions is so broad that it is impossible to include all the various alkyl compounds and nucleophiles that react in this manner Rather we shall approach the subject here through consideration of the mechanisms of reactions and then develop the scope of the reactions in later chapters The mechanism of an reaction and the reactivity of a given alkyl compound toward a nucleophile depend upon the nature of and and upon the nature of the solvent For an reaction to occur at a reasonable rate it is very important to select a solvent that will dissolve both the alkyl compound and the nucleophilic reagent considerable assistance may be required from both the solvent and the nucleophile to break what usually is a slightly polar bond However the solvents that best dissolve slightly polar organic compounds seldom will dissolve the common rather highly polar nucleophilic agents such as and In practice relatively polar solvents or solvent mixtures such as propanone acetone aqueous propanone ethanol aqueous dioxacyclohexane dioxane and so on provide the best compromise for reactions between alkyl compounds and saltlike nucleophilic reagents The importance of the solvent in stabilizing ions can be evaluated from the estimated thermochemistry of ionic reactions discussed in Section Examples of onium cations are Contributors and Attributions

Molecular DisorderC Why Do Methane and Chlorine Fail to React in the Dark at D Why Does Light Induce the Chlorination of MethaneE Can We Predict Whether Reactions Will Be Fast or SlowF How Should We Go about Formulating a Reaction MechanismContributors and Attributions The economies of the highly industrialized nations of the world are based in large part on energy and chemicals produced from petroleum Although the most important and versatile intermediates for conversion of petroleum to chemicals are compounds with double or triple bonds it also is possible to prepare many valuable substances by substitution reactions of alkanes In such substitutions a hydrogen is removed from a carbon chain and another atom or group of atoms becomes attached in its place A simple example of a substitution reaction is the formation of chloromethane and chlorine The equation for the reaction is simple the ingredients are cheap and the product is useful However if we want to decide in advance whether such a reaction is actually feasible we have to know more Particularly we have to know whether the reaction proceeds in the direction it is written and if so whether conditions can be found under which it proceeds at a convenient rate Obviously if one were to mix methane and chlorine and find that at most only conversion to the desired product occurred and that the conversion could be achieved only after a day or so of strong heating this reaction would be both too unfavorable and too slow for an industrial process One way of visualizing the problems involved is with energy diagrams which show the energy in terms of some arbitrary reaction coordinate that is a measure of progress between the initial and final states Figure Diagrams such as Figure may not be familiar to you and a mechanical analogy may be helpful to provide better understanding of the very important ideas involved Consider a twolevel box containing a number of tennis balls An analog to an energetically favorable reaction would be to have all of the balls Figure Schematic energy diagrams for reactions that are energetically favorable and unfavorable when proceeding from left to right along the reaction coordinate on the upper level where any disturbance would cause them to roll down to the lower level under the influence of gravity thereby losing energy If the upper level is modified and a low fence added to hold the balls in place it will be just as energetically favorable as when the fence is not there for the balls to be at the lower level The difference is that the process will not occur spontaneously without some major disturbance We can say there is an energy barrier to occurrence of the favorable process The situation here has a parallel in the left side of Figure where we show an energy barrier to the spontaneous conversion of reactants to products for an energetically favorable chemical reaction Now if we shake the box hard enough the balls on the upper level can acquire enough energy to bounce over the barrier and drop to the lower level The balls then can be said to acquire enough activation energy to surmount the barrier At the molecular level the activation energy must be acquired either by collisions between molecules as the result of their thermal motions or from some external agency to permit the reactants to get over the barrier and be transformed into products We shortly will discuss this more but first we wish to illustrate another important concept with our mechanical analogy that of equilibrium and equilibration With gentle shaking of our twolevel box all of the balls on the upper level are expected to wind up on the lower level There will not be enough activation to have them go from the lower to the upper level In this circumstance we can say that the balls are not equilibrated between the lower and upper levels However if we shake the box vigorously and continuously no matter whether we start with all of the balls on the lower or upper level an equilibrium will be set up with on the average most of the balls in the energetically more favorable lower level but some in the upper level as well To maintain a constant average fraction of the balls at each level with vigorous and continued shaking the rate at which balls go from the upper to the lower level must be equal to the rate that they go in the opposite direction The balls now will be equilibrated between the two levels At equilibrium the fraction of the balls on each of the two levels is wholly independent of the height of the barrier just as long as the activation shaking is sufficient to permit the balls to go both ways The diagrams of Figure are to be interpreted in the same general way If thermal agitation of the molecules is sufficient then equilibrium can be expected to be established between the reactants and the products whether the overall reaction is energetically favorable left side of Figure or energetically unfavorable right side of Figure But as with our analogy when equilibrium is established we expect the major portion of the molecules to be in the more favorable energy state What happens when methane is mixed with chlorine No measurable reaction occurs when the gases are mixed and kept in the dark at room temperature Clearly either the reaction is energetically unfavorable or the energy barrier is high The answer as to which becomes clear when the mixture is heated to temperatures in excess of or when exposed to strong violet or ultraviolet light whereby a rapid or even explosive reaction takes place Therefore the reaction is energetically favorable but the activation energy is greater than can be attained by thermal agitation alone at room temperature Heat or light therefore must initiate a pathway for the reactants to be converted to products that has a low barrier or activation energy Could we have predicted the results of this experiment ahead of time First we must recognize that there really are several questions here Could we have decided whether the reaction was energetically favorable That the dark reaction would be slow at room temperature That light would cause the reaction to be fast We consider these and some related questions in detail because they are important questions and the answers to them are relevant in one way or another to the study of all reactions in organic chemistry A The Question of the Equilibrium Constant Presumably methane could react with chlorine to give chloromethane and hydrogen chloride or chloromethane could react with hydrogen chloride to give methane and chlorine If conditions were found for which both reactions proceeded at a finite rate equilibrium finally would be established when the rates of the reactions in each direction became equal At equilibrium the relationship among the amounts of reactants and products is given by the equilibrium constant expression in which is the equilibrium constant The quantities within the brackets of Equation denote either concentrations for liquid reactants or partial pressures for gaseous substances If the equilibrium constant is greater than then on mixing equal volumes of each of the participant substances all are gases above reaction to the right will be initially faster than reaction to the left until equilibrium is established at this point there will be more chloromethane and hydrogen chloride present than methane and chlorine However if the equilibrium constant were less than the reaction initially would proceed faster to the left and at equilibrium there would be more methane and chlorine present than chloromethane and hydrogen chloride For methane chlorination we know from experiment that the reaction goes to the right and that is much greater than unity Naturally it would be helpful in planning other organic preparations to be able to estimate in advance It is a common experience to associate chemical reactions with equilibrium constants greater than one with the evolution of heat in other words with negative values There are in fact many striking examples Formation of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride from methane and chlorine has a of and of per mole of formed at Combustion of hydrogen with oxygen to give water has a of and per mole of water formed at However this correlation between and is neither universal nor rigorous Reactions are known that absorb heat are endothermic and yet have Other reactions have large values and equilibrium constants much less than The problem is that the energy change that correlates with is not but the socalled change of standard Gibbs energy and if we know we can calculate by the equation in which is the gas constant and is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin For our calculations we shall use as and you should not forget to convert to Tables of values for formation of particular compounds at various temperatures and states from the elements are available in handbooks and the literature With these we can calculate equilibrium constants quite accurately For example handbooks give the following data which are useful for methane chlorination Combining these with proper regard for sign gives and so Unfortunately insufficient values for formation reactions are available to make this a widely applicable method for calculating values The situation is not wholly hopeless because there is a relationship between and that also involves and another quantity the standard entropy change of the process This equation shows that and are equal when is zero Therefore the sign and magnitude of determine how well correlates with Now we have to give attention to whether we can estimate values well enough to decide whether the of a given reaction calculated from bond energies or other information will give a good or poor measure of B Entropy and Molecular Disorder To decide whether we need to worry about with regard to any particular reaction we have to have some idea what physical meaning entropy has To be very detailed about this subject is beyond the scope of this book but you should try to understand the physical basis of entropy because if you do then you will be able to predict at least qualitatively whether will be about the same or very different from Essentially the entropy of a chemical system is a measure of its molecular disorder or randomness Other things being the same the more random the system is the more favorable the system is Different kinds of molecules have different degrees of translational vibrational and rotational freedom and hence different average degrees of molecular disorder or randomness Now if for a chemical reaction the degree of molecular disorder is different for the products than for the reactants there will be a change in entropy and A spectacular example of the effect of molecular disorder in contributing to the difference between and is afforded by the formation of liquid nonane from solid carbon and hydrogen gas at with and Equations and can be rearranged to calculate and from and and These and values can be compared to those for for which is is and is Obviously there is something unfavorable about the entropy change from carbon and hydrogen to nonane The important thing is that there is a great difference in the constraints on the atoms on each side of the equation In particular hydrogen molecules in the gaseous state have great translational freedom and a high degree of disorder the greater part of which is lost when the hydrogen atoms become attached to a chain of carbons This makes for a large negative which corresponds to a decrease in The differences in constraints of the carbons are less important Solid carbon has an ordered rigid structure with little freedom of motion of the individual carbon atoms These carbons are less constrained in nonane and this would tend to make more positive and more negative corresponding to an increase in Equations and However this is a small effect on compared to the enormous difference in the degree of disorder of hydrogen between hydrogen gas and hydrogen bound to carbon in nonane Negative entropy effects usually are observed in ringclosure reactions such as the formation of cyclohexane from hexene which occur with substantial loss of rotational freedom disorder about the bonds There is an even greater loss in entropy on forming cyclohexane from ethene because substantially more freedom is lost in orienting three ethene molecules to form a ring For simple reactions with the same number of molecules on each side of the equation with no ring formation or other unusual changes in the constraints between the products and reactants usually is relatively small In general for such processes we know from experience that usually is greater than if is more negative than and usually is less than for more positive than We can use this as a rule of thumb to predict whether should be greater or less than unity for vaporphase reactions involving simple molecules Some idea of the degree of success to be expected from this rule may be inferred from the examples in Table which also contains a further comparison of some experimental values with those calculated from bond energies Suppose is positive what hope do we have of obtaining a useful conversion to a desired product There is no simple straightforward and general answer to this question When the reaction is reversible the classic procedure of removing one or more of the products to prevent equilibrium from being established has many applications in organic chemistry as will be seen later When this approach is inapplicable a change in reagents is necessary Thus iodine does not give a useful conversion with dimethylpropane to give iododimethylpropane because the position of equilibrium is too far to the left Alternative routes with favorable values are required Development of ways to make indirectly by efficient processes what cannot be made directly is one of the most interesting and challenging activities of organic chemists C Why Do Methane and Chlorine Fail to React in the Dark at To reach an understanding of why methane and chlorine do not react in the dark we must consider the details of how the reaction occurs that is the reaction mechanism The simplest mechanism would be for a chlorine molecule to collide with a methane molecule in such a way as to have chloromethane and hydrogen chloride formed directly as a result of a concerted breaking of the and bonds and making of the and bonds see Figure The failure to react indicates that there must be an energy barrier too high for this mechanism to operate Why should this be so Figure Fourcenter collision of chlorine with methane as visualized with ballandstick models First this mechanism involves a very precisely oriented fourcenter collision between chlorine and methane that would have a low probability of occurrence ie a large decrease in entropy because a precise orientation means high molecular ordering Second it requires pushing a chlorine molecule sufficiently deeply into a methane molecule so one of the chlorine atoms comes close enough to the carbon to form a bond and yield chloromethane Figure Graph of the potential energy of pairs of neon atoms as a function of the internuclear distance The energy values are per mole of neon atoms Generally to bring nonbonded atoms to nearbonding distances to requires a large expenditure of energy as can be seen in Figure Interatomic repulsive forces increase rapidly at short distances and pushing a chlorine molecule into a methane molecule to attain distances similar to the carbonchlorine bond distance in chloromethane would require a considerable amount of compression see Figure Valuable information Figure Models showing the degree of atomic compression required to bring a chlorine molecule to within bonding distance of carbon and hydrogen of methane about interatomic repulsions can be obtained with spacefilling models of the CPK type Section which have radii scaled to correspond to actual atomic interference radii that is the interatomic distance at the point where curves of the type of Figure start to rise steeply With such models the degree of atomic compression required to bring the nonbonded atoms to within nearbonding distance is more evident than with the ballandstick models It may be noted that fourcenter reactions of the type postulated in Figure are encountered only rarely If the concerted fourcenter mechanism for formation of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride from chlorine and methane is discarded all the remaining possibilities are stepwise reaction mechanisms A slow stepwise reaction is dynamically analogous to the flow of sand through a succession of funnels with different stem diameters The funnel with the smallest stem will be the most important bottleneck and if its stem diameter is much smaller than the others it alone will determine the flow rate Generally a multistep chemical reaction will have a slow ratedetermining step analogous to the funnel with the small stem and other relatively fast steps which may occur either before or after the slow step A possible set of steps for the chlorination of methane follows Reactions and involve dissociation of chlorine into chlorine atoms and the breaking of a bond of methane to give a methyl radical and a hydrogen atom The methyl radical like chlorine and hydrogen atoms has one election not involved in bonding Atoms and radicals usually are highly reactive so formation of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride should proceed readily by Reactions and The crux then will be whether Steps and are reasonable under the reaction conditions In the absence of some external stimulus only collisions due to the usual thermal motions of the molecules can provide the energy needed to break the bonds At temperatures below it is very rare indeed that the thermal agitation alone can supply sufficient energy to break any significant number of bonds stronger than to The bond energy from Table is which is much too great to allow bond breaking from thermal agitation at in accord with Reaction For Reaction it is not advisable to use the bond energy from Table because this is one fourth of the energy required to break all four bonds Section More specific bonddissociation energies are given in Table and it will be seen that to break one bond of methane requires at which again is too much to be gained by thermal agitation Therefore we can conclude that Reactions can not be an important mechanism for chlorination of methane at room temperature One might ask whether dissociation into ions would provide viable mechanisms for methane chlorination Part of the answer certainly is Not in the vapor phase as the following thermochemical data show Ionic dissociation simply does not occur at ordinarily accessible temperatures by collisions between molecules in the vapor state What is needed for formation of ions is either a highly energetic external stimulus such as bombardment with fastmoving electrons or an ionizing solvent that will assist ionization Both of these processes will be discussed later The point here is that ionic dissociation is not a viable step for the vaporphase chlorination of methane D Why Does Light Induce the Chlorination of Methane First we should make clear that the light does more than provide energy merely to lift the molecules of methane and chlorine over the barrier of Figure This is evident from the fact that very little light is needed far less than one light photon per molecule of chloromethane produced The light could activate either methane or chlorine or both However methane is colorless and chlorine is yellowgreen This indicates that chlorine not methane interacts with visible light A photon of nearultraviolet light such as is absorbed by chlorine gas provides more than enough energy to split the molecule into two chlorine atoms Once produced a chlorine atom can remove a hydrogen atom from a methane molecule and form a methyl radical and a hydrogen chloride molecule The bonddissociation energies of and suggest that this reaction is endothermic by about The attack of a chlorine atom on a methane hydrogen is not expected to require a precisely oriented collision Moreover the interatomic repulsions should be considerably smaller than in the fourcenter mechanism discussed previously for the reaction of molecular chlorine with methane because only two centers have to come close together Figure The methyl radical resulting from the attack of atomic chlorine on a hydrogen of methane then can remove a chlorine atom from molecular chlorine and form chloromethane and a new chlorine atom Use of bonddissociation energies gives a calculated of for this reaction which is certainly large enough by our rule of thumb to predict that will be greater than Attack of a methyl radical on molecular chlorine is expected to require somewhat more oriented collision than for a chlorine atom reacting with methane the chlorine molecule probably should be endwise not sidewise to the radical but the interatomic repulsion probably should not be much different The net result of and is formation of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride from methane and chlorine Notice that the chlorine atom consumed in the first step is replaced by another one in the second step This kind of sequence of reactions is called a chain reaction because in principle one atom can induce the reaction of an infinite number of molecules through operation of a chain or cycle of reactions In our example chlorine atoms formed by the action of light on Figure Models showing the degree of atomic compression required to bring a chlorine atom to within bonding distance of a methane hydrogen Compare with Figure can induce the chlorination of methane by the chainpropagating steps In practice chain reactions are limited by socalled termination processes In our example chlorine atoms or methyl radicals are destroyed by reacting with one another as shown in the following equations Chain reactions may be considered to involve three phases First chain initiation must occur which for methane chlorination is activation and conversion of chlorine molecules to chlorine atoms by light Second chainpropagation steps convert reactants to products with no net consumption of atoms or radicals The propagation reactions occur in competition with chainterminating steps which result in destruction of atoms or radicals Putting everything together we can write The chaintermination reactions are expected to be exceedingly fast because atoms and radicals have electrons in unfilled shells that normally are bonding As a result bond formation can begin as soon as the atoms or radicals approach one another closely without need for other bonds to begin to break The evidence is strong that bondforming reactions between atoms and radicals usually are diffusioncontrolled that there is almost no barrier or activation energy required and the rates of combination are simply the rates at which encounters between radicals or atoms occur If the rates of combination of radicals or atoms are so fast you might well wonder how chain propagation ever could compete Of course competition will be possible if the propagation reactions themselves are fast but another important consideration is the fact that the atom or radical concentrations are very low Suppose that the concentration of is and the concentration The probability of encounters between two atoms will be proportional to and between and atoms it will be Thus other things being the same propagation would be favored over termination by a factor of Under favorable conditions the methanechlorination chain may go through to cycles before termination occurs by radical or atom combination Consequently the efficiency or quantum yield of the reaction is very high in terms of the amount of chlorination that occurs relative to the amount of the light absorbed The overall rates of chain reactions usually are slowed very much by substances that can combine with atoms or radicals and convert them into species incapable of participating in the chainpropagation steps Such substances are called radical traps or inhibitors Oxygen acts as an inhibitor in the chlorination of methane by rapidly combining with a methyl radical to form the comparatively stable less reactive peroxymethyl radical This effectively terminates the chain E Can We Predict Whether Reactions Will Be Fast or Slow To a considerable degree we can predict relative reactivities provided we use common sense to limit our efforts to reasonable situations In the preceding section we argued that reactions in which atoms or radicals combine can well be expected to be extremely fast because each entity has a potentially bonding electron in an outer unfilled shell and bringing these together to form a bond does not require that other bonds be broken For the reaction the methane hydrogen and carbon valence shells are filled and as approaches it can combine with a hydrogen only if a bond is broken This kind of process is associated with a barrier but is very different from a nonreactive encounter such as two neon atoms coming together see Figure As and get closer together the new bond starts to form and the old bond starts to break At the top of the barrier the hydrogen will be bonded partly to chlorine and partly to carbon and this we call the activated complex or transition state The concept of the transition state is an important one which we will use repeatedly later in connection with many other kinds of reactions The value of the concept lies in the fact that the reacting system when it reaches the top of the barrier can be though of as a chemical entity with a particular even if not welldefined structure and definite thermodynamic properties The difference between the average energy of the reactants and the energy of the transition state is called the activation energy Figure We expect this energy to be smaller lower barrier if a weak bond is being broken and a strong bond is being made The perceptive reader will notice that we are suggesting a parallel between reaction rate and because depends on the difference in strengths of the bonds being broken and formed Yet previously Section A we pointed out that the energy barrier for a reaction need bear no relationship to how energetically feasible the reaction is and this is indeed true for complex reactions involving many steps But our intuitive parallel between rate and usually works quite well for the rates of individual steps This is borne out by experimental data on rates of removal of a hydrogen atom from methane by atoms or radicals such as which generally parallel the strength of the new bond formed Similarly if we look at the bonddissociation energies of the hydrocarbons shown in Table we would infer that would remove a hydrogen most rapidly from the carbon forming the weakest bond and again this is very much in accord with experience For example the chlorination of methylbenzene toluene in sunlight leads to the substitution of a methyl hydrogen rather than a ring hydrogen for the reason that the methyl bonds are weaker and are attacked more rapidly than the ring bonds This can be seen explicitly in the values for the chainpropagation steps calculated from the bonddissociation energies of Table Methyl substitution observed Ring substitution not observed The of ringhydrogen abstraction is unfavorable by because of the high bond energy Thus this step is not observed It is too slow in comparison with the more favorable reaction at the methyl group even though the second propagation step is energetically favorable by and presumably would occur very rapidly Use of bonddissociation energies to predict relative reaction rates becomes much less valid when we try to compare different kinds of reactions To illustrate ethane might react with to give fluoromethane or hydrogen fluoride It is not a good idea to try to predict the relative rates of these two reactions on the basis of their overall values because the nature of the bonds made and broken is too different F How Should We Go about Formulating a Reaction Mechanism Faced with proposing a mechanism for a reaction that involves overall making or breaking of more than two bonds the beginner almost invariably tries to concoct a process wherein with a single step all of the right bonds break and all of the right bonds form Such mechanisms called concerted mechanisms have three disadvantages First they are almost impossible to prove correct Second prediction of the relative rates of reactions involving concerted mechanisms is especially difficult Third concerted mechanisms have a certain sterility in that one has no control over what happens while they are taking place except an overall control of rate by regulating concentrations temperature pressure choice of solvents and so on To illustrate suppose that methane chlorination appeared to proceed by way of a onestep concerted mechanism At the instant of reaction the reactant molecules in effect would disappear into a dark closet and later emerge as product molecules There is no way to prove experimentally that all of the bonds were made and formed simultaneously All one could do would be to use the most searching possible tests to probe for the existence of discrete steps If these tests fail the reaction still would not be proved concerted because other still more searching tests might be developed later that would give a different answer The fact is once you accept that a particular reaction is concerted you in effect accept the proposition that further work on its mechanism is futile no matter how important you might feel that other studies would be regarding the factors affecting the reaction rate The experienced practitioner in reaction mechanisms accepts a concerted mechanism for a reaction involving the breaking and making of more than two bonds as a last resort He first will try to analyze the overall transformation in terms of discrete steps that are individually simple enough surely to be concerted and that also involves energetically reasonable intermediates Such an analysis of a reaction in terms of discrete mechanistic steps offers many possibilities for experimental studies especially in development of procedures for detecting the existence even if highly transitory of the proposed intermediates We shall give many examples of the fruitfulness of this kind of approach in subsequent discussions If calculations based on chemical equilibrium constants are unfamiliar to you we suggest you study one of the general chemistry texts listed for supplemental reading at the end of Chapter Many books and references use instead of The difference between standard Gibbs energy and the Gibbs energy is that is defined as the value of the free energy when all of the participants are in standard states The free energy for for a reaction is equal to where the products and the reactants do not have to be in standard states We shall use only in this book The entropy unit has the

Notes In the laboratory you will test a number of compounds for the presence of a carboncarbon double bond A common test is the decolourization of a reddishbrown bromine solution by an alkene The twostep mechanism shown in the LibreText pages gives you an idea of how the reaction between an alkene and a halogen occurs Note the formation of the bridged bromonium ion intermediate and the anti stereochemistry of the final product because the two bromine atoms come from opposite faces of the double bond Additional evidence in support of the bromonium ion mechanism comes from the results obtained when an alkene such as cyclopentene reacts with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride see Figure Reaction of an alkene with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride below Figure Reaction of an alkene with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride Once formed the bromonium ion is susceptible to attack by two nucleophileschloride ion and bromide ionand in fact a mixture of two products both produced by anti attack is formed Halogens can act as electrophiles to which can be attacked by a pi bond from an alkene Pi bonds represents a region of electron density and therefore function as a nucleophiles How is it possible for a halogen to obtain positive charge to be an electrophile Introduction A halogen molecule for example Br approaches a double bond of the alkene electrons in the double bond repel electrons in the bromine molecule causing polarization of the halogenhalogen bond This creates a dipole moment in the halogenhalogen bond Heterolytic bond cleavage occurs and one of the halogens obtains a positive charge and reacts as an electrophile The reaction of the addition is not regioselective but is stereoselective Stereochemistry of this addition can be explained by the mechanism of the reaction In the first step the electrophilic halogen with the positive charge approaches the pi bond and p orbitals of the halogen bond with two carbon atoms creating a cyclic ion with a halogen as the intermediate In the second step the remaining halide ion halogen with the negative charge attacks either of the two carbons in the cyclic ion from the back side of the cycle as in the SN reaction Therefore stereochemistry of the product is anti addition of vicinal dihalides Step In the first step of the addition the BrBr bond polarizes heterolytic cleavage occurs and Br with the positive charge forms a cyclic intermediate with the two carbons from the alkene Step In the second step bromide anion attacks either carbon of the bridged bromonium ion from the back side of the ring The ring opens up and two halogens are have anti stereochemistry Halogens that are commonly used in this type of the reaction are and In thermodynamical terms is too slow for this reaction because of the size of its atom and is too vigorous and explosive Because the halide ionh can attack any carbon from the opposite side of the ring it creates a mixture of steric products

bromohydrin halohydrin Study Notes Bromohydrin and chlorohydrin are examples of halohydrins where X Br or Cl Chemists often abbreviate the names of frequently used chemicals DMSO for dimethyl sulfoxide NBS for Nbromosuccinimide etc You should already be familiar with some similar examples from everyday life DDT for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane PCB for polychlorinated biphenyl and ASA for acetylsalicylic acid aspirin You can see how someone with a limited knowledge of chemistry could misinterpret the abbreviation NBSit is not a compound containing nitrogen boron and sulfur NBS can serve as a less dangerous and easier to handle replacement for Br in the formation of bromohydrins The proton is not the only electrophilic species that initiates addition reactions to the double bond of alkenes Lewis acids like the halogens boron hydrides and certain transition metal ions are able to bond to the alkene pielectrons and the resulting complexes rearrange or are attacked by nucleophiles to give addition productsThe electrophilic character of the halogens is well known Chlorine Cl and bromineBr react selectively with the double bond of alkenes and these reactions are what we will focus on Fluorine adds uncontrollably with alkenesand the addition of iodine is unfavorable so these are not useful preparative methods The addition of chlorine and bromine to alkenes as shown below proceeds by an initial electrophilic attack on the pielectrons of the double bond Dihalocompounds in which the halogens are bound to adjacent carbons are called vicinal from the Latin vicinalis meaning neighboring RCCR X RCXCRX Other halogencontaining reagents which add to double bonds include hypohalous acids HOX and sulfenyl chlorides RSCl These reagents are unsymmetrical so their addition to unsymmetrical double bonds may in principle take place in two ways In practice these addition reactions are regioselective with one of the two possible constitutionally isomeric products being favored The electrophilic moiety in both of these reagents is the halogen CHCCH HOBr CHCOHCHBr CHCCH CHSCl CHCClCHSCH The regioselectivity of the above reactions may be explained by the same mechanism we used to rationalize the Markovnikov rule Thus bonding of an electrophilic species to the double bond of an alkene should result in preferential formation of the more stable more highly substituted carbocation and this intermediate should then combine rapidly with a nucleophilic species to produce the addition product To apply this mechanism we need to determine the electrophilic moiety in each of the reagents By using electronegativity differences we can dissect common addition reagents into electrophilic and nucleophilic moieties as shown on the right In the case of hypochlorous and hypobromous acids HOX these weak Brønsted acids pKas ca do not react as proton donors and since oxygen is more electronegative than chlorine or bromine the electrophile will be a halide cation The nucleophilic species that bonds to the intermediate carbocation is then hydroxide ion or more likely water the usual solvent for these reagents and the products are called halohydrins Sulfenyl chlorides add in the opposite manner because the electrophile is a sulfur cation RS whereas the nucleophilic moiety is chloride anion chlorine is more electronegative than sulfur Below are some examples illustrating the addition of various electrophilic halogen reagents to alkene groups Notice the specific regiochemistry of the products as explained above Exercises Questions Q Predict the

BDEBond BreakageFormationTrends in CH BDEsInterpretation of CH BDEs for sp Hybridized CarbonsReferencesFurther ReadingContributors and Attributions Learning Objective calculate reaction enthalpies from bond dissociation energies Introduction The homolytic bond dissociation energy is the amount of energy needed to break apart one mole of covalently bonded gases into a pair of radicals The SI units used to describe bond energy are kiloJoules per mole of bonds kJMol It indicates how strongly the atoms are bonded to each other Solvation is the interaction between solvent molecules and the ions or molecules dissolved in that solvent Breaking a covalent bond between two partners AB can occur either heterolytically where the shared pair of electron goes with one partner or another AB rightarrow A B or AB rightarrow A B or homolytically where one electron stays with each partner AB rightarrow A B The products of homolytic cleavage are radicals and the energy that is required to break the bond homolytically is called the Bond Dissociation Energy BDE and is a measure of the strength of the bond Calculation of the BDE The BDE for a molecule AB is calculated as the difference in the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants for homolysis Officially the IUPAC definition of bond dissociation energy refers to the energy change that occurs at K and the symbol is However it is commonly referred to as BDE the bond dissociation energy and it is generally used albeit imprecisely interchangeably with the bond dissociation enthalpy which generally refers to the enthalpy change at room temperature K Although there are technically differences between BDEs at K and K those difference are not large and generally do not affect interpretations of chemical processes Bond BreakageFormation Bond dissociation energy or enthalpy is a state function and consequently does not depend on the path by which it occurs Therefore the specific mechanism in how a bond breaks or is formed does not affect the BDE Bond dissociation energies are useful in assessing the energetics of chemical processes For chemical reactions combining bond dissociation energies for bonds formed and bonds broken in a chemical reaction using Hesss Law can be used to estimate reaction enthalpies Example Chlorination of Methane Consider the chlorination of methane CH_ Cl_ rightarrow CH_Cl HCl the overall reaction thermochemistry can be calculated exactly by combining the BDEs for the bonds broken and bonds formed CH CH H BDECHH Cl Cl BDECl H Cl HCl BDEHCl CH Cl CHCl BDECHCl CH_ Cl_ rightarrow CH_Cl HCl Because reaction enthalpy is a state function it does not matter what reactions are combined to make up the overall process using Hesss Law However BDEs are convenient to use because they are readily available Alternatively BDEs can be used to assess individual steps of a mechanism For example an important step in free radical chlorination of alkanes is the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane to form a free radical RH Cl R HCl The energy change for this step is equal to the difference in the BDEs in RH and HCl This relationship shows that the hydrogen abstraction step is more favorable when BDERH is smaller The difference in energies accounts for the selectivity in the halogenation of hydrocarbons with different types of CH bonds Table Representative CH BDEs in Organic Molecules RH Do kJmol D kJmol RH Do kJmol D kJmol CHH HCCHH CHCHH CHH CHCHH HCCH CHCH HCCHCHH HCOH CHCHH CHCOH Trends in CH BDEs It is important to remember that CH BDEs refer to the energy it takes to break the bond and is the difference in energy between the reactants and the products Therefore it is not appropriate to interpret BDEs solely in terms of the stability of the radical products as is often done Analysis of the BDEs shown in the table above shows that there are some systematic trends BDEs vary with hybridization Bonds with sp hybridized carbons are weakest and bonds with sp hybridized carbons are much stronger The vinyl and phenyl CH bonds are similar reflecting their sp hybridization The correlation with hybridization can be viewed as a reflection of the CH bond lengths Longer bonds formed with sp orbitals are consequently weaker Shorter bonds formed with orbitals that have more scharacter are similarly stronger CH BDEs vary with substitution Among sp hybridized systems methane has the strongest CH bond CH bonds on primary carbons are stronger than those on secondary carbons which are stronger than those on tertiary carbons Interpretation of CH BDEs for sp Hybridized Carbons The interpretation of the BDEs in saturated molecules has been subject of recent controversy As indicated above the variation in BDEs with substitution has traditionally been interpreted as reflecting the stabilities of the alkyl radicals with the assessment that more highly substituted radicals are more stable as with carbocations Although this is a popular explanation it fails to account fo the fact the bonds to groups other than H do not show the same types of variation R BDERCH BDERCl BDERBr BDEROH CH CHCH CHCH CHC Therefore although CCH bonds get weaker with more substitution the effect is not nearly as large as that observed with CH bonds The strengths of CCl and CBr bonds are not affected by substitution despite the fact that the same radicals are formed as when breaking CH bonds and the COH bonds in alcohols actually increase with more substitution Gronert has proposed that the variation in BDEs is alternately explained as resulting from destabilization of the reactants due to steric repulsion of the substituents which is released in the nearly planar radicals Considering that BDEs reflect the relative energies of reactants and products either explanation can account for the trend in BDEs Another factor that needs to be considered is the electronegativity The Pauling definition of electronegativity says that the bond dissociation energy between unequal partners is going to be dependent on the difference in electrongativities according to the expression where and are the electronegativities and the bond energies are in eV Therefore the variation in BDEs can be interpreted as reflecting variation in the electronegativities of the different types of alkyl fragments There is likely some merit in all three interpretations Since Gronerts original publication of his alternate explanation there have been many desperate attempts to defend the radical stability explanation Exercise Given that ΔH for

melting point or constancy of boiling point Important though these analytical and physical criteria are they can be misleading or even useless For instance the analytical criterion is of no help with possible mixtures of isomers because these mixtures have the same elemental composition The simple physical criteria are not applicable to substances that decompose when one attempts to determine the melting point or boiling point Furthermore boiling points are not very helpful for liquids that are mixtures of substances with nearly the same boiling point or are azeotropes Similar difficulties may be encountered with mixtures of solid substances that form mixed crystals or are eutectics Much sharper criteria for the purity of organic compounds now are provided through use of superseparation methods to see if any contaminants can be separated or by spectroscopic techniques as will be discussed later in this chapter We begin here with a brief description of chromatographic methods of separation An azeotrope is a mixture of two or more substances that boils at a constant temperature either higher or lower than any of its constituents Thus an mole mixture of ethanol and water boils like a pure substance distilling at which is lower than the boiling point of ethanol or of water In contrast a mole mixture of methanoic formic acid and water boils at which is higher than the boiling

breakage and between heterogenic and homogenic bond formation state the two reaction types involved in symmetrical and unsymmetrical processes Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below heterogenic heterolytic homogenic homolytic polar reaction radical reaction reaction mechanism Study Notes Upon first reading first four key terms it is easy to be puzzled The ending of the word tells you whether a bond is being formed genic or broken lytic while the root of the word describes the nature of that formation or decomposition So hetero meaning different reactions involve asymmetrical bond making or breaking and homo meaning same involve symmetrical processes Because one pair of electrons constitutes a single bond the unsymmetrical making or breaking of that bond in a hetero processes are described as polar reactions Similarly symmetrical homo processes of bond making and breaking are called radical reactions Radicals sometimes referred to as free radicals are highly reactive neutral chemical species with one unpaired electron In later sections we discuss radical and polar reactions in more detail The Arrow Notation in Mechanisms Since chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds a consideration of the movement of bonding and nonbonding valence shell electrons is essential to this understanding It is now common practice to show the movement of electrons with curved arrows and a sequence of equations depicting the consequences of such electron shifts is termed a mechanism In general two kinds of curved arrows are used in drawing mechanisms A full head on the arrow indicates the movement or shift of an electron pair A partial head fishhook on the arrow indicates the shift of a single electron The use of these symbols in bondbreaking and bondmaking reactions is illustrated below If a covalent single bond is broken so that one electron of the shared pair remains with each fragment as in the first example this bondbreaking is called homolysis If the bond breaks with both electrons of the shared pair remaining with one fragment as in the second and third examples this is called heterolysis BondBreaking BondMaking Other Arrow Symbols Chemists also use arrow symbols for other purposes and it is essential to use them correctly The Reaction Arrow The Equilibrium Arrow The Resonance Arrow The following equations illustrate the proper use of these symbols Reactive Intermediates The products of bond breaking shown above are not stable in the usual sense and cannot be isolated for prolonged study Such species are referred to as reactive intermediates and are believed to be transient intermediates in many reactions The general structures and names of four such intermediates are given below A pair of widely used terms related to the Lewis acidbase notation should also be introduced here Electrophile An electron deficient atom ion or molecule that has an affinity for an electron pair and will bond to a base or nucleophile Nucleophile An atom ion or molecule that has an electron pair that may be donated in bonding to an electrophile or Lewis acid Using these definitions it is clear that carbocations called carbonium ions in the older literature are electrophiles and carbanions are nucleophiles Carbenes have only a valence shell sextet of electrons and are therefore electron deficient In this sense they are electrophiles but the nonbonding electron pair also gives carbenes nucleophilic character As a rule the electrophilic character dominates carbene reactivity Carbon radicals have only seven valence electrons and may be considered electron deficient however they do not in general bond to nucleophilic electron pairs so their chemistry exhibits unique differences from that of conventional electrophiles Radical intermediates are often called free radicals The importance of electrophile nucleophile terminology comes from the fact that many organic reactions involve at some stage the bonding of a nucleophile to an electrophile a process that generally leads to a stable intermediate or product Reactions of this kind are sometimes called ionic reactions since ionic reactants or products are often involved Some common examples of ionic reactions and their mechanisms may be examined below The shapes ideally assumed by these intermediates becomes important when considering the stereochemistry of reactions in which they play a role A simple tetravalent compound like methane CH has a tetrahedral configuration Carbocations have only three bonds to the charge bearing carbon so it adopts a planar trigonal configuration Carbanions are pyramidal in shape tetrahedral if the electron pair is viewed as a substituent but these species invert rapidly at room temperature passing through a higher energy planar form in which the electron pair occupies a porbital Radicals are intermediate in configuration the energy difference between pyramidal and planar forms being very small Since three points determine a plane the shape of carbenes must be planar however the valence electron distribution varies Ionic Reactions The principles and terms introduced in the previous sections can now be summarized and illustrated by the following three examples Reactions such as these are called ionic or polar reactions because they often involve charged species and the bonding together of electrophiles and nucleophiles Ionic reactions normally take place in liquid solutions where solvent molecules assist the formation of charged intermediates The substitution reaction shown on the left can be viewed as taking place in three steps The first is an acidbase equilibrium in which HCl protonates the oxygen atom of the alcohol The resulting conjugate acid then loses water in a second step to give a carbocation intermediate Finally this electrophile combines with the chloride anion nucleophile to give the final product The addition reaction shown on the left can be viewed as taking place in two steps The first step can again be considered an acidbase equilibrium with the pielectrons of the carboncarbon double bond functioning as a base The resulting conjugate acid is a carbocation and this electrophile combines with the nucleophilic bromide anion The elimination reaction shown on the left takes place in one step The bond breaking and making operations that take place in this step are described by the curved arrows The initial stage may also be viewed as an acidbase interaction with hydroxide ion serving as the base and a hydrogen atom component of the alkyl chloride as an acid There are many kinds of molecular rearrangements The examples shown on the left are from an important class called tautomerization or more specifically ketoenol tautomerization Tautomers are rapidly interconverted constitutional isomers usually distinguished by a different bonding location for a labile hydrogen atom colored red here and a differently located double bond The equilibrium between tautomers is not only rapid under normal conditions but it often strongly favors one of the isomers acetone for example is keto tautomer Even in such onesided equilibria evidence for the presence of the minor tautomer comes from the chemical behavior of the compound Tautomeric equilibria are catalyzed by traces of acids or bases that are generally

Objectives predict the hybridization and geometry of atoms in a molecule refer to section draw accurate D representations of molecules with approximate bond angles Formation of sigma bonds the H molecule The simplest case to consider is the hydrogen molecule H When we say that the two electrons from each of the hydrogen atoms are shared to form a covalent bond between the two atoms what we mean in valence bond theory terms is that the two spherical s orbitals overlap allowing the two electrons to form a pair within the two overlapping orbitals These two electrons are now attracted to the positive charge of both of the hydrogen nuclei with the result that they serve as a sort of chemical glue holding the two nuclei together Bonding in Methane Now lets turn to methane the simplest organic molecule Recall the valence electron configuration of the central carbon This picture however is problematic How does the carbon form four bonds if it has only two halffilled p orbitals available for bonding A hint comes from the experimental observation that the four CH bonds in methane are arranged with tetrahedral geometry about the central carbon and that each bond has the same length and strength In order to explain this observation valence bond theory relies on a concept called orbital hybridization In this picture the four valence orbitals of the carbon one s and three p orbitals combine mathematically remember orbitals are described by equations to form four equivalent hybrid orbitals which are named sp orbitals because they are formed from mixing one s and three p orbitals In the new electron configuration each of the four valence electrons on the carbon occupies a single sp orbital The sp hybrid orbitals like the p orbitals of which they are partially composed are oblong in shape and have two lobes of opposite sign Unlike the p orbitals however the two lobes are of very different size The larger lobes of the sp hybrids are directed towards the four corners of a tetrahedron meaning that the angle between any two orbitals is o This geometric arrangement makes perfect sense if you consider that it is precisely this angle that allows the four orbitals and the electrons in them to be as far apart from each other as possibleThis is simply a restatement of the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion VSEPR theory that you learned in General Chemistry electron pairs in orbitals will arrange themselves in such a way as to remain as far apart as possible due to negativenegative electrostatic repulsion Each CH bond in methane then can be described as an overlap between a halffilled s orbital in a hydrogen atom and the larger lobe of one of the four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals in the central carbon The length of the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane is Å x m While previously we drew a Lewis structure of methane in two dimensions using lines to denote each covalent bond we can now draw a more accurate structure in three dimensions showing the tetrahedral bonding geometry To do this on a twodimensional page though we need to introduce a new drawing convention the solid dashed wedge system In this convention a solid wedge simply represents a bond that is meant to be pictured emerging from the plane of the page A dashed wedge represents a bond that is meant to be pictured pointing into or behind the plane of the page Normal lines imply bonds that lie in the plane of the page This system takes a little bit of getting used to but with practice your eye will learn to immediately see the third dimension being depicted Example Imagine that you could distinguish between the four hydrogens in a methane molecule and labeled them Ha through Hd In the images below the exact same methane molecule is rotated and flipped in various positions Draw the missing hydrogen atom labels It will be much easier to do this if you make a model Exercise Describe with a picture and with words the bonding in chloroform CHCl Solutions The bonding arrangement here is also tetrahedral the three NH bonds of ammonia can be pictured as forming the base of a trigonal pyramid with the fourth orbital containing the lone pair forming the top of the pyramid Recall from your study of VSEPR theory in General Chemistry that the lone pair with its slightly greater repulsive effect pushes the three NH sbonds away from the top of the pyramid meaning that the HNH bond angles are slightly less than tetrahedral at rather than VSEPR theory also predicts accurately that a water molecule is bent at an angle of approximately It would seem logical then to describe the bonding in water as occurring through the overlap of sphybrid orbitals on oxygen with sorbitals on the two hydrogen atoms In this model the two nonbonding lone pairs on oxygen would be located in sp orbitals Some experimental evidence however suggests that the bonding orbitals on the oxygen are actually unhybridized p orbitals rather than sp hybrids Although this would seem to imply that the HOH bond angle should be remember that p orbitals are oriented perpendicular to one another it appears that electrostatic repulsion has the effect of distorting this porbital angle to Both the hybrid orbital and the nonhybrid orbital models present reasonable explanations for the observed bonding arrangement in water so we will not concern ourselves any further with the distinction Exercise Draw in the same style as the figures above an orbital picture for the bonding in methylamine Solution Formation of bonds and hybridization The valence bond theory along with the hybrid orbital concept does a very good job of describing doublebonded compounds such as ethene Three experimentally observable characteristics of the ethene molecule need to be accounted for by a bonding model Ethene is a planar flat molecule Bond angles in ethene are approximately o and the carboncarbon bond length is Å significantly shorter than the Å single carboncarbon bond in ethane There is a significant barrier to rotation about the carboncarbon double bond Clearly these characteristics are not consistent with an sp hybrid bonding picture for the two carbon atoms Instead the bonding in ethene is described by a model involving the participation of a different kind of hybrid orbital Three atomic orbitals on each carbon the s px and py orbitals combine to form three sp hybrids leaving the pz orbital unhybridized The three sp hybrids are arranged with trigonal planar geometry pointing to the three corners of an equilateral triangle with angles of between them The unhybridized pz orbital is perpendicular to this plane in the next several figures sp orbitals and the sigma bonds to which they contribute are represented by lines and wedges only the pz orbitals are shown in the spacefilling mode The carboncarbon double bond in ethene consists of one sbond formed by the overlap of two sp orbitals and a second bond calleda π pi bond which is formed by the sidebyside overlap of the two unhybridized pz orbitals from each carbon spacefilling image of bonding in ethene The pi bond does not have symmetrical symmetry Because they are the result of sidebyside overlap rather then endtoend overlap like a sigma bond pi bonds are not free to rotate If rotation about this bond were to occur it would involve disrupting the sidebyside overlap between the two pz orbitals that make up the pi bond The presence of the pi bond thus locks the six atoms of ethene into the same plane This argument extends to larger alkene groups in each case the six atoms of the group form a single plane Conversely sbonds such as the carboncarbon single bond in ethane CHCH exhibit free rotation and can assume many different conformations or shapes this is one of the main subjects of Chapter Exercise Circle the six atoms in the molecule below that are locked into the same plane Exercise What kinds of orbitals are overlapping in bonds ad indicated below Exercise What is wrong with the way the following structure is drawn Solutions A similar picture can be drawn for the bonding in carbonyl groups such as formaldehyde In this molecule the carbon is sphybridized and we will assume that the oxygen atom is also sp hybridized The carbon has three sigma bonds two are formed by overlap between two of its sp orbitals with the sorbital from each of the hydrogens and the third sigma bond is formed by overlap between the remaining carbon sp orbital and an sp orbital on the oxygen The two lone pairs on oxygen occupy its other two sp orbitals The pi bond is formed by sidebyside overlap of the unhybridized pz orbitals on the carbon and the oxygen Just like in alkenes the pz orbitals that form the pi bond are perpendicular to the plane formed by the sigma bonds

to explain the structures of simple species containing these atoms Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below lone pair electrons Study Notes Nitrogen is frequently found in organic compounds As with carbon atoms nitrogen atoms can be sp sp or sphybridized Note that in this course the term lone pair is used to describe an unshared pair of electrons The valencebond concept of orbital hybridization can be extrapolated to other atoms including nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur In other compounds covalent bonds that are formed can be described using hybrid orbitals Nitrogen Bonding in NH The nitrogen in NH has five valence electrons After hybridization these five electrons are placed in the four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals The electron configuration of nitrogen now has one sp hybrid orbital completely filled with two electrons and three sp hybrid orbitals with one unpaired electron each The two electrons in the filled sp hybrid orbital are considered nonbonding because they are already paired These electrons will be represented as a lone pair on the structure of NH The three unpaired electrons in the hybrid orbitals are considered bonding and will overlap with the s orbitals in hydrogen to form NH sigma bonds Note This bonding configuration was predicted by the Lewis structure of NH The four sp hybrid orbitals of nitrogen orientate themselves to form a tetrahedral geometry The three NH sigma bonds of NH are formed by spNsH orbital overlap The fourth sp hybrid orbital contains the two electrons of the lone pair and is not directly involved in bonding Methyl amine The nitrogen is sp hybridized which means that it has four sp hybrid orbitals Two of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with s orbitals from hydrogens to form the two NH sigma bonds One of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with an sp hybridized orbital from carbon to form the CN sigma bond The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen are contained in the last sp hybridized orbital Due to the sp hybridization the nitrogen has a tetrahedral geometry However the HNH and HNC bonds angles are less than the typical o due to compression by the lone pair electrons Oxygen Bonding in HO The oxygen in HO has six valence electrons After hybridization these six electrons are placed in the four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals The electron configuration of oxygen now has two sp hybrid orbitals completely filled with two electrons and two sp hybrid orbitals with one unpaired electron each The filled sp hybrid orbitals are considered

bonding and will overlap with the s orbitals in hydrogen to form OH sigma bonds Note This bonding configuration was predicted by the Lewis structure of HO The four sp hybrid orbitals of oxygen orientate themselves to form a tetrahedral geometry The two OH sigma bonds of HO are formed by spOsH orbital overlap The two remaining sp hybrid orbitals each contain two electrons in the form of a lone pair Methanol The oxygen is sp hybridized which means that it has four sp hybrid orbitals One of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with s orbitals from a hydrogen to form the OH sigma bonds One of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with an sp hybridized orbital from carbon to form the CO sigma bond Both the sets of lone pair electrons on the oxygen are contained in the remaining sp hybridized orbital Due to the sp hybridization the oxygen has a tetrahedral geometry However the HOC bond angles are less than the typical o due to compression by the lone pair electrons Phosphorus Methyl phosphate The bond pattern of phosphorus is analogous to nitrogen because they are both in period However phosphorus can have have expanded octets because it is in the n row Typically phosphorus forms five covalent bonds In biological molecules phosphorus is usually found in organophosphates Organophosphates are made up of a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygens with one of the oxygens also bonded to a carbon In methyl phosphate the phosphorus is sp hybridized and the OPO bond angle varies from to o Methyl Phosphate An Organophosphate Sulfur Methanethiol Dimethyl Sulfide Sulfur has a bonding pattern similar to oxygen because they are both in period of the periodic table Because sulfur is positioned in the third row of the periodic table it has the ability to form an expanded octet and the ability to form more than the typical number of covalent bonds In biological system sulfur is typically found in molecules called thiols or sulfides In a thiol the sulfur atom is bonded to one hydrogen and one carbon and is analogous to an alcohol OH bond In a sulfide the sulfur is bonded to two carbons The simplest example of a thiol is methane thiol CHSH and the simplest example of a sulfide is dimethyl sulfide CHS In both cases the sulfur is sp hybridized however the sulfur bond angles are much less than the typical tetrahedral o being o and o respectively

products specify the reagents and discern most efficient reaction for hydration of alkenes acid catalyzed hydration or oxymercurationdemercuration or hydroborationoxidation What Is Electrophilic Hydration Electrophilic hydration is the addition of hydrogen and a hydroxyl group across the two carbons of a double bond Electrophilic hydration is the reverse of dehydration of alcohols and so begins the circular nature of organic chemistry Alcohols can be dehydrated to form alkenes and alkenes can undergo electrophilic addition reactions to form alcohols Electrophilic hydrogen is essentially a proton a hydrogen atom stripped of its electrons Electrophilic hydrogen is commonly used to help break double bonds or restore catalysts Electrophilic hydration of alkenes has practical applications in making alcohols for fuels and reagents for other reactions The basic reaction under certain temperatures given below is the following In later sections we will learn that mercury II sulfate and borane are also electrophiles that can react with alkenes to form hydration products Each reaction pathway has its own regio and stereochemical considerations In the example below we see that the same alkene produces different hydration products depending on the hydration pathway Mechanism for Acidcatalyzed Hydration of Alkenes Temperatures for Types of Alcohol Synthesis Heat is used to catalyze electrophilic hydration because the reaction is in equilibrium with the dehydration of an alcohol which requires higher temperatures to form an alkene lower temperatures are required to form an alcohol The exact temperatures used are highly variable and depend on the product being formed Primary Alcohol Less than ºC Secondary Alcohol Less than ºC Tertiary Alcohol Less than ºC ButWhy Does Electrophilic Hydration Work An alkene placed in an aqueous nonnucleophilic strong acid immediately reaches out with its double bond and attacks one of the acids hydrogen atoms meanwhile the bond between oxygen and hydrogen performs heterolytic cleavage toward the oxygenin other words both electrons from the oxygenhydrogen single bond move onto the oxygen atom A carbocation is formed on the original alkene now alkane in the moresubstituted position where the oxygen end of water attacks with its nonbonded valence electrons oxygen has total valence electrons because it is found in Group on the periodic table and the second row down two electrons in a sorbital and four in porbitals Oxygen donates one valence electron to each bond it forms leaving four nonbonded valence electrons After the blue oxygen atom forms its third bond with the moresubstituted carbon it develops a positive charge bonds and valence electrons give the blue oxygen atom a formal charge of The bond between the green hydrogen and the blue oxygen undergoes heterolytic cleavage and both the electrons from the bond move onto the blue oxygen The now negativelycharged strong acid picks up the green electrophilic hydrogen Now that the reaction is complete the nonnucleophilic strong acid is regenerated as a catalyst and an alcohol forms on the most substituted carbon of the current alkane At lower temperatures more alcohol product can be formed What is Regiochemistry and How Does It Apply Regiochemistry deals with where the substituent bonds on the product Zaitsevs and Markovnikovs rules address regiochemistry but Zaitsevs rule applies when synthesizing an alkene while Markovnikovs rule describes where the substituent bonds onto the product In the case of electrophilic hydration Markovnikovs rule is the only rule that directly applies See the following for an indepth explanation of regiochemistry Markovnikov explanation Radical AdditionsAntiMarkovnikov Product Formation In the mechanism for a º alcohol shown above the red H is added to the leastsubstituted carbon connected to the nucleophilic double bonds it has less carbons attached to it This means that the carbocation forms on the º carbon causing it to be highly stabilized by hyperconjugationelectrons in nearby sigma single bonds help fill the empty porbital of the carbocation which lessens the positive charge More substitution on a carbon means more sigma bonds are available to help out by using overlap with the positive charge which creates greater carbocation stability In other words carbocations form on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond Carbocations are also stabilized by resonance but resonance is not a large factor in this case because any carboncarbon double bonds are used to initiate the reaction and other double bonded molecules can cause a completely different reaction If the carbocation does originally form on the less substituted part of the alkene carbocation rearrangements occur to form more substituted products Carbocation Rearrangements a review Hydride shifts a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom next to the carbocation leaves that carbon to bond with the carbocation after the hydrogen has taken both electrons from the single bond it is known as a hydride This changes the once neighboring carbon to a carbocation and the former carbocation becomes a neighboring carbon atom In a more complex case when alkenes undergo hydration we also observe hydride shift Below is the reaction of methylbutene with HO that furnishes to make methylbutanol Once again we see multiple products In this case however we see two minor products and one major product We observe the major product because the OH substitutent is attached to the more substituted carbon When the reactant undergoes hydration the proton attaches to carbon The carbocation is therefore on carbon Hydride shift now occurs when the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon formally switch places with the carbocation The carbocation is now ready to be attacked by HO to furnish an alkyloxonium ion because of stability and hyperconjugation The final step can be observed by another water molecule attacking the proton on the alkyloxonium ion to furnish an alcohol We see this mechanism below Alkyl shifts if no hydrogen atoms are available for a hydride shift an entire methyl group performs the same shift The nucleophile attacks the positive charge formed on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond because the nucleophile is seeking that positive charge In the mechanism for a º alcohol shown above water is the nucleophile When the green H is removed from the water molecule the alcohol attached to the most substituted carbon Hence electrophilic hydration follows Markovnikovs rule Stereochemistry of Acidcatalyzed Hydration Stereochemistry deals with how the substituent bonds on the product directionally Dashes and wedges denote stereochemistry by showing whether the molecule or atom is going into or out of the plane of the board Whenever the bond is a simple single straight line the molecule that is bonded is equally likely to be found going into the plane of the board as it is out of the plane of the board This indicates that the product is a racemic mixture There is no stereochemical control in acidcatalyzed hydration reactions The carbocation intermediate has the trigonal planar geometry of sp hybridization which allows the subsequent reaction with water from either orientation Electrophilic hydration adopts a stereochemistry wherein the substituent is equally likely to bond pointing into the plane of the board as it is pointing out of the plane of the board The º alcohol product could look like either of the following products Note Whenever a straight line is used along with dashes and wedges on the same molecule it could be denoting that the straight line bond is in the same plane as the board Practice with a molecular model kit and attempting the practice problems at the end can help eliminate any ambiguity Is this a Reversible Synthesis Electrophilic hydration is reversible because an alkene in water is in equilibrium with the alcohol product To sway the equilibrium one way or another the temperature or the concentration of the nonnucleophilic strong acid can be changed For example Less sulfuric or phosphoric acid and an excess of water help synthesize more alcohol product Lower temperatures help synthesize more alcohol product Is There a Better Way to Add Water to Synthesize an Alcohol From an Alkene A more efficient pathway does exist see Oxymercuration Demercuration A Special Electrophilic Addition Oxymercuration does not allow for rearrangements but it does require the use of mercury which is highly toxic Detractions for using electrophilic hydration to make alcohols include Allowing for carbocation rearrangements Poor yields due to the reactants and products being in equilibrium

and borane write an equation for the oxidation of a trialkylborane to an alcohol draw the structure of the alcohol produced by the hydroboration and subsequent oxidation of a given alkene determine whether a given alcohol should be prepared by oxymercurationdemercuration or by hydroborationoxidation and identify the alkene and reagents required to carry out such a synthesis write the detailed mechanism for the addition of borane to an alkene and explain the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of the reaction Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below hydroboration Study Notes The two most important factors influencing organic reactions are polar or electronic effects and steric effects HydroborationOxidation is a two step pathway used to produce alcohols The reaction proceeds in an AntiMarkovnikov manner where the hydrogen from BH or BHR attaches to the more substituted carbon and the boron attaches to the least substituted carbon in the alkene bouble bond Furthermore the borane acts as a lewis acid by accepting two electrons in its empty p orbital from an alkene that is electron rich This process allows boron to have an electron octet A very interesting characteristic of this process is that it does not require any activation by a catalyst The Hydroboration mechanism has the elements of both hydrogenation and electrophilic addition and it is a stereospecific syn addition meaning that the hydroboration takes place on the same face of the double bond this leads cis stereochemistry Introduction Hydroborationoxidation of alkenes has been a very valuable laboratory method for the stereoselectivity and regioselectivity of alkenes An Additional feature of this reaction is that it occurs without rearrangement The Borane Complex First off it is very imporatnt to understand little bit about the structure and the properties of the borane molecule Borane exists naturally as a very toxic gas and it exists as dimer of the general formula BH diborane Additionally the dimer BHignites spontaneously in air Borane is commercially available in ether and tetrahydrofuran THF in these solutions the borane can exist as a lewis acidbase complex which allows boron to have an electron octetBHBH The Mechanism Step Part Hydroboration of the alkene In this first step the addittion of the borane to the alkene is initiated and prceeds as a concerted reaction because bond breaking and bond formation occurs at the same time This part consists of the vacant p orbital of the boron electrophile pairing with the electron pair of the bondof the nucleophile Transition state Note that a carbocation is not formed Therefore no rearrangement takes place Part The Anti Markovnikov addition of Boron The boron adds to the less substituted carbon of the alkene which then places the hydrogen on the more substituted carbon Both the boron and the hydrogen add simultaneously on the same face of the double bond syn addition Oxidation of the Trialkylborane by Hydrogen Peroxide Step Part the first part of this mechanism deals with the donation of a pair of electrons from the hydrogen peroxide ion the hydrogen peroxide is the nucleophile in this reaction because it is the electron donor to the newly formed trialkylborane that resulted from hydroboration Part In this second part of the mechanism a rearrangement of an R group with its pair of bonding electrons to an adjacent oxygen results in the removal of a hydroxide ion Two more of these reactions with hydroperoxide will occur in order give a trialkylborate Part This is the final part of the Oxidation process In this part the trialkylborate reacts with aqueous NaOH to give the alcohol and sodium borate If you need additional visuals to aid you in understanding the mechanism click on the outside links provided here that will take you to other pages and media that are very helpful as well Stereochemistry of hydroboration The hydroboration reaction is among the few simple addition reactions that proceed cleanly in a syn fashion As noted above this is a singlestep reaction Since the bonding of the double bond carbons to boron and hydrogen is concerted it follows that the geometry of this addition must be syn Furthermore rearrangements are unlikely inasmuch as a discrete carbocation intermediate is never formed These features are illustrated for the hydroboration of αpinene Since the hydroboration procedure is most commonly used to hydrate alkenes in an antiMarkovnikov fashion we also need to know the stereoselectivity of the second oxidation reaction which substitutes a hydroxyl group for the boron atom Independent study has shown this reaction takes place with retention of configuration so the overall addition of water is also syn The hydroboration of αpinene also provides a nice example of steric hindrance control in a chemical reaction In the less complex alkenes used in earlier examples the plane of the double bond was often a plane of symmetry and addition reagents could approach with equal ease from either side In this case one of the methyl groups bonded to C colored blue in the equation covers one face of the double bond blocking any approach from that side All reagents that add to this double bond must therefore approach from the side opposite this methyl Outside links

Electrophilic Hydration Electrophilic hydration is the reverse dehydration of alcohols and has practical application in making alcohols for fuels and reagents for other reactions The basic reaction under certain temperatures given below is the following The phrase electrophilic literally means electron loving whereas nucleophilic means nucleus loving Electrophilic hydrogen is essentially a proton a hydrogen atom stripped of its electrons Electrophilic hydrogen is commonly used to help break double bonds or restore catalysts see SN for more details How Does Electrophilic Hydration Work Mechanism for º Alcohol º and º mechanisms are similar Temperatures for Types of Alcohol Synthesis Heat is used to catalyze electrophilic hydration because the reaction is in equilibrium with the dehydration of an alcohol which requires higher temperatures to form an alkene lower temperatures are required to form an alcohol The exact temperatures used are highly variable and depend on the product being formed Primary Alcohol Less than ºC Secondary Alcohol Less than ºC Tertiary Alcohol Less than ºC ButWhy Does Electrophilic Hydration Work An alkene placed in an aqueous nonnucleophilic strong acid immediately reaches out with its double bond and attacks one of the acids hydrogen atoms meanwhile the bond between oxygen and hydrogen performs heterolytic cleavage toward the oxygenin other words both electrons from the oxygenhydrogen single bond move onto the oxygen atom A carbocation is formed on the original alkene now alkane in the moresubstituted position where the oxygen end of water attacks with its nonbonded valence electrons oxygen has total valence electrons because it is found in Group on the periodic table and the second row down two electrons in a sorbital and four in porbitals Oxygen donates one valence electron to each bond it forms leaving four nonbonded valence electrons After the blue oxygen atom forms its third bond with the moresubstituted carbon it develops a positive charge bonds and valence electrons give the blue oxygen atom a formal charge of The bond between the green hydrogen and the blue oxygen undergoes heterolytic cleavage and both the electrons from the bond move onto the blue oxygen The now negativelycharged strong acid picks up the green electrophilic hydrogen Now that the reaction is complete the nonnucleophilic strong acid is regenerated as a catalyst and an alcohol forms on the most substituted carbon of the current alkane At lower temperatures more alcohol product can be formed What is Regiochemistry and How Does It Apply Regiochemistry deals with where the substituent bonds on the product Zaitsevs and Markovnikovs rules address regiochemistry but Zaitsevs rule applies when synthesizing an alkene while Markovnikovs rule describes where the substituent bonds onto the product In the case of electrophilic hydration Markovnikovs rule is the only rule that directly applies See the following for an indepth explanation of regiochemistry Markovnikov explanation Radical AdditionsAntiMarkovnikov Product Formation In the mechanism for a º alcohol shown above the red H is added to the leastsubstituted carbon connected to the nucleophilic double bonds it has less carbons attached to it This means that the carbocation forms on the º carbon causing it to be highly stabilized by hyperconjugationelectrons in nearby sigma single bonds help fill the empty porbital of the carbocation which lessens the positive charge More substitution on a carbon means more sigma bonds are available to help out by using overlap with the positive charge which creates greater carbocation stability In other words carbocations form on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond Carbocations are also stabilized by resonance but resonance is not a large factor in this case because any carboncarbon double bonds are used to initiate the reaction and other double bonded molecules can cause a completely different reaction If the carbocation does originally form on the less substituted part of the alkene carbocation rearrangements occur to form more substituted products Hydride shifts a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom next to the carbocation leaves that carbon to bond with the carbocation after the hydrogen has taken both electrons from the single bond it is known as a hydride This changes the once neighboring carbon to a carbocation and the former carbocation becomes a neighboring carbon atom Alkyl shifts if no hydrogen atoms are available for a hydride shift an entire methyl group performs the same shift The nucleophile attacks the positive charge formed on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond because the nucleophile is seeking that positive charge In the mechanism for a º alcohol shown above water is the nucleophile When the green H is removed from the water molecule the alcohol attached to the most substituted carbon Hence electrophilic hydration follows Markovnikovs rule What is Stereochemistry and How Does It Apply Stereochemistry deals with how the substituent bonds on the product directionally Dashes and wedges denote stereochemistry by showing whether the molecule or atom is going into or out of the plane of the board Whenever the bond is a simple single straight line the molecule that is bonded is equally likely to be found going into the plane of the board as it is out of the plane of the board This indicates that the product is a racemic mixture Electrophilic hydration adopts a stereochemistry wherein the substituent is equally likely to bond pointing into the plane of the board as it is pointing out of the plane of the board The º alcohol product could look like either of the following products Note Whenever a straight line is used along with dashes and wedges on the same molecule it could be denoting that the straight line bond is in the same plane as the board Practice with a molecular model kit and attempting the practice problems at the end can help eliminate any ambiguity Is this a Reversible Synthesis Electrophilic hydration is reversible because an alkene in water is in equilibrium with the alcohol product To sway the equilibrium one way or another the temperature or the concentration of the nonnucleophilic strong acid can be changed For example Less sulfuric or phosphoric acid and an excess of water help synthesize more alcohol product Lower temperatures help synthesize more alcohol product Is There a Better Way to Add Water to Synthesize an Alcohol From an Alkene A more efficient pathway does exist see Oxymercuration Demercuration A Special Electrophilic Addition Oxymercuration does not allow for rearrangements but it does require the use of mercury which is highly toxic Detractions for using electrophilic hydration to make alcohols include Allowing for carbocation rearrangements Poor yields due to the reactants and products being in equilibrium Allowing for product mixtures such as an Renantiomer and an Senantiomer Using sulfuric or phosphoric acid Oxymercuration is a special electrophilic addition It is antistereospecific and regioselective Regioselectivity is a process in which the substituents choses one direction it prefers to be attached to over all the other possible directions The good thing about this reaction is that there are no carbocation rearrangement due to stabilization of the reactive intermediate Similar stabilization is also seen in bromination addition to alkenes Introduction Carbocation rearrangement is a process in which the carbocation intermediate can form a more stable ion With carbocation rearrangement the reaction would not be able to hydrate quickly under mild conditions and be produced in high yields This reaction is very fast and proceeds with yield This reaction involves a mercury acting as a reagent attacking the alkene double bond to form a Mercurinium Ion Bridge A water molecule will then attack the most substituted carbon to open the mercurium ion bridge followed by proton transfer to solvent water molecule The organomercury intermediate is then reduced by sodium borohydride the mechanism for this final step is beyond the scope of our discussion here Notice that overall the oxymercuration demercuration mechanism follows Markovnikovs Regioselectivity with the OH group is attached to the most substituted carbon and the H is attach to the least substituted carbon The reaction is useful however because strong acids are not required and carbocation rearrangements are avoided because no discreet carbocation intermediate forms References Vollhardt K Peter C Organic chemistry structure and function New York WH Freeman Smith Michael B and Jerry March Marchs Advanced Organic Chemistry

Rearrangement isotope effects and mechanism J Am Chem Soc pp Some Practice Problems Practice problems What are the end products of these reactants Answer The end product to these practice problems are pretty much very similar First you locate where the double bond is on the reactant side Then you look at what substituents are attached to each side of the double bond and add the OH group to the more substituent side and the hydrogen on the less substituent side More Problems Predict the product of each reaction How does the cyclopropane group affect the reaction Hint What is different about this problem Hint Consider stereochemistry Indicate any shifts as well as the major product Answer This is a simple electrophilic hydration The answer is additional side products but the major product formed is still the same the product shown Depending on the temperatures used the cyclopropane may open up into a straight chain which makes it unlikely that the major product will form after the reaction it is unlikely that the º carbon will remain as such A hydride shift actually occurs from the carbon of the methylcyclopentene to where the carbocation had formed This reaction will have poor yields due to a very unstable intermediate For a brief moment carbocations can form on the two center carbons which are more stable than the outer two carbons The carbocations have an sp hybridization and when the water is added on the carbons change their hybridization to sp This makes the methyl and alcohol groups equally likely to be found going into or out of the plane of the paper the product is racemic In the first picture shown below an alkyl shift occurs but a hydride shift which occurs faster is possible Why doesnt a hydride shift occur The answer is because the alkyl shift leads to a more stable product There is a noticeable amount of side product that forms where the two methyl groups are but the major product shown below is still the most significant due to the hyperconjugation that occurs by being in between the two cyclohexanes Exercises Questions Q In each case predict the products of these reactants of oxymercuration Q Propose the alkene that was the reactant for each of

equilibrium tautomerism tautomers Study Notes Rapid interconversion between tautomers is called tautomerism however as the two tautomers are in equilibrium the term tautomeric equilibrium may be used This section demonstrates the equilibrium between a ketone and an enol hence the term ketoenol tautomeric equilibrium is appropriate The term enol indicates the presence of a carboncarbon double bond and a hydroxyl ie alcohol group Later in the course you will see the importance of ketoenol tautomerism in discussions of the reactions of ketones carbohydrates and nucleic acids It is important to note that tautomerism is not restricted to ketoenol systems Other examples include imineenamine tautomerism and nitrosooxime tautomerism However at the moment you need only concern yourself with ketoenol tautomerism Notice how hydroboration complements hydration in the chemistry of both alkenes and alkynes Reaction Hydration of Alkynes As with alkeneshydration addition of water to alkynes requires a strong acid usually sulfuric acid and is facilitated by mercuric sulfate However unlike the additions to double bonds which give alcohol products addition of water to alkynes gives ketone products except for acetylene which yields acetaldehyde The explanation for this deviation lies in enolketo tautomerization illustrated by the following equation The initial product from the addition of water to an alkyne is an enol a compound having a hydroxyl substituent attached to a doublebond and this immediately rearranges to the more stable keto tautomer Tautomers are defined as rapidly interconverted constitutional isomers usually distinguished by a different bonding location for a labile hydrogen atom colored red here and a differently located double bond The equilibrium between tautomers is not only rapid under normal conditions but it often strongly favors one of the isomers acetone for example is keto tautomer Even in such onesided equilibria evidence for the presence of the minor tautomer comes from the chemical behavior of the compound Tautomeric equilibria are catalyzed by traces of acids or bases that are generally present in most chemical samples The three examples shown below illustrate these reactions for different substitutions of the triplebond The tautomerization step is indicated by a red arrow For terminal alkynes the addition of water follows the Markovnikov rule as in the second example below and the final product ia a methyl ketone except for acetylene shown in the first example For internal alkynes the triplebond is within a longer chain the addition of water is not regioselective If the triplebond is not symmetrically located ie if R R in the third equation are not the same two isomeric ketones will be formed HCCH HO HgSO HSO HCCHOH HCCHO RCCH HO HgSO HSO RCOHCH RCOCH RCCR HO HgSO HSO RHCCOHR RCOHCHR RCHCOR RCOCHR With the addition of water alkynes can be hydrated to form enols that spontaneously tautomerize to ketones Reaction is catalyzed by mercury ions Follows Markovnikovs Rule Terminal alkynes give methyl ketones The first step is an acidbase reaction where the π electrons of the triple bond acts as a Lewis base and attacks the proton therefore protinating the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents The second step is the attack of the nucleophilic water molecule on the electrophilic carbocation which creates an oxonium ion Next you deprotonate by a base generating an alcohol called an enol which then tautomerizes into a ketone Tautomerism is a simultaneous proton and double bond shift which goes from the enol form to the keto isomer form as shown above in Figure Now lets look at some Hydration Reactions Hydration of Terminal Alkyne produces methyl ketones Just as described in Figure the π electrons will attack a proton forming a carbocation which then gets attacked by the nucleophilic water molecules After deprotination we generate an enol which then tautomerizes into the ketone form shown Hydration of Alkyne As you can see here the π electrons of the triple bond are attacking the proton which forms a covalent bond on the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents Once the hydrogen is bound you have a carbocation which gets attacked by the water molecule Now you have a positive charge on the oxygen which results in a base coming in and deprotinating the molecule Once deprotinated you have an enol which then gets tautomerized Tautomerism is shown here when the proton gets attacked by the double bond π electrons forming a covalent bond between the carbon and the hydrogen on the less substituted carbon Electrons from the Oxygen end up moving to the carbon forming a double bond with carbon and giving itself a positive charge which then gets attacked by the base The base deprotinates the Oxygen resulting in the more stable final product at equilibrium which is a ketone Exercise Draw the structure of the product formed when each of the substances below is

the reagents for the antiMarkovnikovproducts of alkyne hydration Introduction The hydroborationoxidation of alkynes is similar to the reaction with alkenes However there is one important difference The alkyne has two pi bonds and both are capable of reacting with borane BH To limit the reactivity to only one of the pi bonds within the alkyne a dialkyl borane reagent RBH is used Replacing two of the hydrogens on the borane with alkyl groups also creates steric hindrance so that the hydroboration reaction produces the regioselective antiMarkovnikov product Disiamylborane SiaBH and borabicyclononane BBN are two common reagents for the hydroboration step Their structures are shown below The oxidation reagents a basic hydrogen peroxide solution are the same for both alkenes and alkynes The overall reaction is shown below Mechanism The hydroboration reaction of alkynes has the same stereo and regiochemistry as the alkene reaction The primary difference is the steric hindrance of the two isoamyl groups of the dialkyl borane creates antiMarkovnikov regeioselectivity The hydrogen and boron bond with the same orientation to the alkyne carbon with synaddition stereochemistry to

hydration of alkenes through the addition of the first water molecule However this first hydration reaction forms an enol an alcohol bonded to a vinyl carbon Enols immediately undergo a special type of isomerization reaction called tautomerization to form carbonyl groups aldehydes or ketones To keep things simple this reaction is called enolketo tautomerization with the understanding that aldehydes form on terminal alkyne carbons As with alkenes hydration addition of water to alkynes requires a strong acid usually sulfuric acid with a mercuric sulfate catalyst as shown below EnolKeto

Unsaturation DUReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective distinguish between the different hydrocarbon functional groups Saturated vs Unsaturated Molecules Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen The broadest distinction between hydrocarbons is whether they are saturated and unsaturated Saturated hydrocarbons only contain carboncarbon single bonds with the maximum number of hydrogens relative to the number of carbon atoms It can be said that the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen atoms in the same way a saturated solution has dissolved the maximum amount of solute Hydrocarbons that contain pi bonds as carboncarbon double or triple bonds are classified as unsaturated hydrocarbons Unsaturation indicates that some of the carbonhydrogen bonds were lost to from pi bonds between carbon atoms There are less than the maximum number os hydrogens relative to the number of carbon atoms Saturated hydrocarbons alkanes are the simplest of the hydrocarbon species They are composed entirely of single bonds and are saturated with hydrogen Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched speciesThe simplest alkanes have their C atoms bonded in a straight chain these are called normal alkanes They are named according to the number of C atoms in the chain The smallest alkane is methane Unsaturated hydrocarbons have one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms Those with double bond are called alkenes and those with one double bond have the formula assuming noncyclic structures Those containing triple bonds are called alkynes with general formula CnHn The smallest alkeneethenehas two C atoms and is also known by its common name ethylene The smallest alkyne is ethyne which is also known as acetylene For now we will focus on benzene as the representative aromatic hydrocarbon Aromatic compounds were first noted for their strong aromas and low chemical reactivity compared to other saturated hydrocarbons Aromatic compounds will be discussed in greater detail in the second semester to organic chemistry Hydrocarbon Functional Groups The four distinct hydrocarbon functional groups are alkanes alkenes alkynes and arenes Aromatic compounds derive their names from the fact that many of these compounds in the early days of discovery were grouped because they were oils with fragrant odors Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of singlebonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups Alkanes have the general formula CnHn Alkanes can be subdivided into the following three groups the linear straightchain alkanes branched alkanes and cycloalkanes Alkanes are also saturated hydrocarbons Alkanes are the simplest and least reactive hydrocarbon species containing only carbons and hydrogens The distinguishing feature of an alkane making it distinct from other compounds that also exclusively contain carbon and hydrogen is its lack of unsaturation That is to say it contains no double or triple bonds which are highly reactive in organic chemistry Though not totally devoid of reactivity their lack of reactivity under most laboratory conditions makes them a relatively uninteresting though very important component of organic chemistry As you will learn about later the energy confined within the carboncarbon bond and the carbonhydrogen bond is quite high and their rapid oxidation produces a large amount of heat typically in the form of fire The general formula for saturated hydrocarbons is CnHnassuming noncyclic structures as shown in hexane CH below Cycloalkanes are hydrocarbons containing one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached The general formula for a cyclic hydrocarbon containing one ring is CnHn as shown in cyclohexane CH below Akenes contain at least one carboncarbon double bond and alkynes contain at least one carboncarbon triple bond Alkenes have the general formula CnHn Alkynes have the general formula CnHn The ratio of carbon to hydrogen increased because hydrogen atoms are replaced with pi bonds as shown in transbutene CH and butyne CH below Since both double and triple bonds include pi bonds Alkenes and alkynes share similar chemical reactivity Aromatic hydrocarbons also known as arenes are hydrocarbons that have at least one aromatic ring Aromatic compounds contain the benzene unit Benzene itself is composed of six C atoms in a ring with alternating single and double CC bonds Calculating Degrees of Unsaturation DU There are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule Although nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and infrared radiation IR are the primary ways of determining molecular structures calculating the degrees of unsaturation DU is useful information Knowing the degrees of unsaturation tells us the combined number of pi bonds and rings within a compound which makes it easier to figure out the molecular structure Degree of Unsaturation DU can be calculated with the equation below and the molecular formula DU CNXH where C is the number of carbons N is the number of nitrogens X is the number of halogens F Cl Br I and H is the number of hydrogens from the molecular formula As stated before a saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings Another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane Thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by C which is the general molecular representation of an alkane As an example for the molecular formula CH the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is Cx The compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens Degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated Hence the DoB formula divides by The formula subtracts the number of Xs because a halogen X replaces a hydrogen in a compound For instance in chloroethane CHCl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane CH For a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present Therefore we add the number of nitrogens N This can be seen with CHN compared to CH Oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements As seen in alcohols the same number of hydrogens in ethanol CHOH matches the number of hydrogens in ethane CH The following chart illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for a given degree of unsaturation Each row corresponds to a different combination One degree of unsaturation is equivalent to ring or double bond bond Two degrees of unsaturation is equivalent to double bonds ring and double bond rings or triple bond bonds DU Possible combinations of rings bonds of rings of double bonds of triple bonds Remember the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor rings For instance a degree of unsaturation of can contain rings rings double bond ring double bonds ring triple bond double bond triple bond or double bonds Example What is the Degree of Unsaturation for benzene Solution Thinking it through The molecular formula for benzene is CH Thus DU where C NX and H DU can equal ring or double bond This corresponds to benzene containing ring and double bonds Even though there are other possible structures with a DU like the ones shown below We will learn the benzene rings have unusual stability and occur frequently in the world of organic chemistry When the DU for a compound is we can assume the presence of at least one benzene ring Exercise Are the following molecules saturated or unsaturated b c d CHN Using the molecules from give the degrees of unsaturation for each Calculate the

insights into the chemical structure For example lets look at some of the possible structures and chemical formulas for hydrocarbons containing six carbon atoms The saturated alkane has the highest ratio of hydrogen to carbon The unsaturated alkene and the six membered alkane ring share the same chemical formula It is important to remember this relationship The unsaturated alkyne has a lower

Attributions With the modern concept of a hydrogen atom we do not visualize the orbital electron traversing a simple planetary orbit Rather we speak of an atomic orbital in which there is only a probability of finding the electron in a particular volume a given distance and direction from the nucleus The boundaries of such an orbital are not distinct because there always remains a finite even if small probability of finding the electron relatively far from the nucleus There are several discrete atomic orbitals available to the electron of a hydrogen atom These orbitals differ in energy size and shape and exact mathematical descriptions for each are possible Following is a qualitative description of the nature of some of the hydrogen atomic orbitals The most stable or ground state of a hydrogen atom is designated In the state the electron is on the average closest to the nucleus ie it is the state with the smallest atomic orbital The orbital is spherically symmetrical This means that the probability of finding the electron at a given distance from the nucleus is independent of the direction from the nucleus We shall represent the orbital as a sphere centered on the nucleus with a radius such that the probability of finding the electron within the boundary surface is high to see Figure This may seem arbitrary but an orbital representation that would have a probability of for finding the electron within the boundary surface would have an infinite radius The reason is that there is a finite even if small probability of finding the electron at any given distance from the nucleus The boundary surfaces we choose turn out to have sizes consistent with the distances between the nuclei of bonded atoms The orbital is very much like the orbital except that it is larger and therefore more diffuse and it has a higher energy For principal quantum number there are also three orbitals of equal energies called orbitals which have different geometry than the orbitals These are shown in Figure Figure Representation of the hydrogen orbital in which we see that the respective axes passing through the tangent spheres of the three orbitals lie at right angles to one another The orbitals are not spherically symmetrical The and states are similar to the and states but are of higher energy The orbitals have still higher energies and quite different geometries they are not important for bonding in most organic substances at least for carbon compounds with hydrogen and elements in the first main row of the periodic table The sequence of orbital energies is shown in Figure Figure The shapes and orientations of the three orbitals of a hydrogen atom Notice that orbitals have two lobes one on each side of the nucleus Figure Schematic diagram of the relative energies of the hydrogenlike atomic orbitals The famous Pauli exclusion principle states that no more than two elections can occupy a given orbital and then only if they differ with respect to a property of electrons called electron spin An electron can have only one of two possible orientations of electron spin as may be symbolized by and Two electrons with paired spins often are represented as Such a pair of electrons can occupy a single orbital The symbols or represent two unpaired electrons which may not go into a single orbital If we assume that all atomic nuclei have orbitals like those of the hydrogen atom we can see how atoms more complex than hydrogen can be built up by adding electrons to the orbitals in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle The lowestenergy states will be those in which the electrons are added to the lowestenergy orbitals For example the electronic configuration of the lowestenergy state of a carbon atom is shown in Figure which also shows the relative energies of the through atomic orbitals The orbitals of lowest energy are populated with the proper number of electrons to balance the nuclear charge of for carbon and to preserve the Pauli condition of no more than two paired electrons per orbital However the two highestenergy electrons are put into different orbitals with unpaired spins in accordance with Hunds rule The rationale of Hunds rule depends on the fact that electrons come closer together Now suppose there are two electrons that can go into two different orbitals of the same energy socalled degenerate orbitals Hunds rule tells us that the repulsion energy between these electrons will be less if they have unpaired spins Why is this so Because if they have unpaired Figure Diagram showing the most stable electronic configuration of a carbon atom Addition of more electrons in accord with Hunds rule gives the electronic configuration of the other atoms indicated by the atomic symbols spins they cannot be in the same orbital at the same time Therefore they will not be able to approach each other as closely as they would if they could be in the same orbital at the same time For this reason the electronic configuration is expected to be more stable than the configuration if both orbitals have the same energy States such as the one shown in Figure for carbon are built up through the following steps Helium has two paired electrons in the orbital its configuration can be written as the superscript outside the parentheses denoting two paired electrons in the orbital For lithium we expect to be the ground state in which the electrons must be paired according to the exclusion principle Continuing in this way we can derive the electronic configurations for the elements in the first three rows of the periodic table as shown in Table These configurations conform to the principle that an orbital can accommodate a maximum ot two paired electrons and a set of three orbitals a maximum of six paired electrons The first electronic configuration should conform to Hunds rule as shown by the example of carbon in Figure The index number refers to the principal quantum number and corresponds to the shell designation often used for the electron of the normal hydrogen atom The principal quantum number corresponds to the shell to the shell and so on The notation also to come later has been carried over from the early days of atomic spectroscopy and was derived from descriptions of spectroscopic lines as sharp principal diffuse and fundamental which once were used to identify transitions from particular atomic states

high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst The source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum These fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking The hydrocarbons are mixed with a very fine catalyst powder These days the catalysts are zeolites complex aluminosilicates these are more efficient than the older mixtures of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide The whole mixture is then blown rather like a liquid through a reaction chamber at a temperature of about C Because the mixture behaves like a liquid this is known as fluid catalytic cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking Although the mixture of gas and fine solid behaves as a liquid this is nevertheless an example of heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants The catalyst is recovered afterwards and the cracked mixture is separated by cooling and further fractional distillation There isnot any single unique reaction happening in the cracker The hydrocarbon

DeterminationReferences At the turn of the nineteenth century Sir William Herschel discovered invisible radiation beyond the red end of the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum This radiation appropriately is called infrared meaning beneath the red and it encompasses the wavelength region from to You probably are familiar with the common applications of infrared to radiant heating and photography In addition to these uses infrared spectroscopy has become the most widely used spectroscopic technique for investigating organic structures Infrared spectroscopy was the province of physicists and physical chemists until about At that time the potential of infrared spectroscopy as an analytical tool began to be recognized by organic chemists The change was due largely to the production of small quite rugged infrared spectrophotometers and instruments of this kind now are virtually indispensable for chemical analysis A brief description of the principles and practice of this spectroscopic method is the topic of this section A General Considerations of Infrared Spectroscopy Absorption of infrared radiation causes transitions between vibrational energy states of a molecule A simple diatomic molecule such as has only one vibrational mode available to it a stretching vibration somewhat like balls on the ends of a spring Molecules with three or more atoms can vibrate by stretching and also by bending of the chemical bonds as indicated below for carbon dioxide The absorption frequencies in the infrared spectra of molecules correspond to changes in the stretching or bending vibrations or both In general a polyatomic molecule with atoms will have modes of vibration of which are stretching vibrations and are bending vibrations There are circumstances however where fewer vibrational modes are possible If the molecule is linear like then there are possible vibrations and some of these vibrations may be equivalent degenerate vibrations in the language of spectroscopists For example should have or vibrational modes two of which are stretching and two of which are bending modes However the two bending modes are equivalent because the direction in which the molecule bends is immaterial inplane or outofplane bending are the same Diatomic molecules such as have one vibrational mode but it is important to note that symmetrical diatomic molecules such as and do not absorb in the infrared region of the spectrum This is because absorption cannot occur if the vibration is electrically symmetrical Fortunately then the infrared spectra can be recorded in air because the main components of air and do not interfere In practice infrared spectra can be obtained with gaseous liquid or solid samples The sample containers cells and the optical parts of the instrument are made of rock salt or similar material that transmits infrared radiation glass is opaque Typical infrared spectra are shown in Figure for propanone acetone and butanone methyl ethyl ketone In accord with current practice the position of absorption horizontal scale is recorded in units of wave numbers see Section The vertical scale measures the intensity of radiation transmitted through the sample Zero transmission means complete absorption of radiation by the sample as at in Figure The other absorption bands in Figure that correspond to excitation of stretching or bending vibrations are not as intense as the absorption at Figure Infrared absorption spectra of a propanone and b butanone in the vapor phase B Characteristic Stretching Vibrations of Infrared Spectroscopy What information can we derive about molecular structure from the vibrational bands of infrared spectra Absorption of radiation in the range of is characteristic of the types of bonds present in the molecule and corresponds for the most part to stretching vibrations For example we know that the bonds of alkanes and alkyl groups have characteristic absorption bands around an unidentified compound that shows absorption in this region will very likely have alkanetype bonds More explicitly the band observed for propanone Figure a at arises from absorption of infrared radiation which causes transitions between the ground vibrational state or lowest vibrational energy level of a bond and the first excited vibrational energy level for stretching of that bond The band at corresponds to the infrared absorption that causes transitions between vibrational energy levels of the bond The reason that these are transitions from the vibrational ground state is because at room temperature by far the largest portion of the molecules are in this state cf Exercise Stretching frequencies characteristic of the most important types of bonds found in organic molecules are given in Table You will notice that the absorption band for each bond type is described by its position within a more or less broad frequency range and by its shape broad sharp and intensity strong medium weak A qualitative discussion of the factors that determine infrared band position and band intensities follows To a first approximation a chemical bond resembles a mechanical spring that vibrates with a stretching frequency in which is the force constant and and are the masses of the individual atoms at each end of the bond The force constant is a measure of the stiffness of the bond and usually is related to the bond strength From Equation we can see that the heavier the bonded atoms the smaller will be the vibrational frequency of the bond provided remains essentially constant Thus if we increase while holding and constant we expect the frequency to decrease This is just what occurs when we change the bond to a bond We also see that the frequency decreases in the order which also is in the order of increasing but here matters are more complicated because also changes Other things being equal it requires more energy to stretch a bond than to bend it Therefore the infrared bands arising from changes in the stretching vibrations are found at higher frequencies than are those arising from changes in the bending vibrations Another consequence of Equation is that if and remain the same the larger the value of the higher will be the vibrational frequency Because is expected to run more or less parallel to the bond strength and because multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds the absorption frequencies of multiple bonds are higher than for single bonds Examples are the absorption of at at and at Other effects besides mass and bond strength also affect infrared absorption frequencies The structural environment of a bond is particularly important Thus the absorption frequency of a bond depends on whether it is an alkyl alkenyl alkynyl or aryl bond see Table The intensity of an infrared absorption band arising from changes in the vibrational energy is related to the electrical symmetry of the bond More symmetrical less polarized bonds give weaker absorptions In fact if the bond is completely symmetrical there is no infrared absorption In contrast unsymmetrical molecules in which the bonds are quite polarized such as bonds show strong infrared absorptions Notice in Figure that infrared spectra of organic molecules do not show very sharp absorption lines This is because changes in rotational energies can occur together with the vibrational changes The reason can be seen more clearly in Figure in which each vibrational level such as and of a molecule has associated with it closely spaced rotational levels Transitions between and also may involve changes in rotational levels This gives a band of closely spaced lines for any given vibrational change For complex molecules particularly in the liquid state the rotational fine structure of a given vibrational band usually cannot be resolved Figure Schematic vibrational and rotational energy levels The arrows correspond to infrared vibrationalrotational transitions of different energies Table Some Characteristic Infrared Absorption Frequencies Absorption of infrared radiation over the range from to corresponds to energylevel differences as in Figure of to C The Fingerprint Region Infrared absorption bands between and generally are associated with complex vibrational and rotational energy changes of the molecule as a whole and are quite characteristic of particular molecules This part of the spectrum is often called the fingerprint region and is extremely useful for determining whether the samples are chemically identical The spectra of propanone and butanone are seen to be very similar in the region to but quite different from to The fingerprint region of the spectrum is individual enough so that if the infrared spectra of two samples are indistinguishable in the range of frequencies from to it is highly probable that the two samples are of the same compound or the same mixture of compounds Characteristic stretching and bending frequencies occur in the fingerprint region but they are less useful for identifying functional groups because they frequently overlap with other bands This region is sufficiently complex that a complete analysis of the spectrum is seldom possible D Alkanes and Cycloalkanes The infrared spectra of the alkanes show clearly absorptions corresponding to the stretching frequencies at to The stretching absorptions have variable frequencies and are usually weak Methyl and methylene groups normally have characteristic bending vibrations at to Methyl groups also show a weaker band near Two sample infrared spectra that illustrate these features are given in Figure The infrared spectra of the cycloalkanes are similar to those of the alkanes except that when there are no alkyl substituents the characteristic Figure Infrared spectra of a octane and b trimethylpentane as pure liquids Notice the stretching around and bending frequency around The bands near for trimethylpentane are characteristic of methyl bending frequencies bending frequencies of methyl groups at are absent A moderately strong scissoring frequency is observed between and the position depending somewhat on the size of the ring These features of the infrared spectra of cycloalkanes are illustrated in Figure using cyclooctane and methylcyclohexane as examples Figure Infrared spectra of a cyclooctane and b methylcyclohexane These spectra can be compared profitably with those in Figure E Applications of Infrared Spectroscopy to Structure Determination Infrared spectra are very useful both for identification of specific organic compounds and for determining types of compounds For example Figure shows the infrared spectrum of a substance for which we wish to determine the compound type and if possible the specific structure The most informative infrared absorptions for determining the compound type are between and Two groups of bands in this region can be seen at about and where means strong if we used it would mean medium and would mean weak From Table we can see that these bands are indicative of and hydrogenbonded of carboxylic acids The presumption is that there is a group in the molecule and we can derive some reassurance from the fact that the molecular formula has enough oxygens to allow for this possibility Table also shows that a group should have a absorption band between and and absorption bending frequency between and and there is indeed a band of medium intensity at and a strong band at These absorptions being in the fingerprint region do not prove that the compound is a carboxylic acid but if there were no absorptions in the to range the presence of a group would be highly questionable Figure Infrared spectrum of a compound Tentatively then we may write a partial structure for as A propyl group would be and has two hydrogens less which indicates the presence of a double bond or a ring However Table shows that a double bond should have an absorption of variable intensity at to and there is no clear sign of such an absorption in Figure The alternative to a double bond would be a ring which for has to be a cyclopropyl ring The structure that is most compatible with the spectrum is Final identification may be possible by comparison with an authentic spectrum of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid if it is available in one of the several standard compendia of infrared spectra A total of about infrared spectra are available for comparison purposes You should check with the reference section of your library to see what atlases of spectral data are available to you The foregoing example illustrates the way structures can be determined from infrared spectral data For many purposes the infrared frequencies given in Table are both approximate and incomplete However you could be easily frustrated in interpreting spectral data by being burdened with a very detailed table in which the unimportant is mixed with the important The ability to use extensive tables effectively comes with experience You should remember that tabulated infrared frequencies indicate only the range in which a given vibrational transition will fall The exact value for a particular compound usually is meaningless because it will change depending on whether the spectrum is taken of the solid liquid or gaseous states the solvent used the concentration and the temperature Remember that lower frequency means longer wavelengths and lower energy References John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin

Intermolecular forces IMFs can be used to predict relative boiling points The stronger the IMFs the lower the vapor pressure of the substance and the higher the boiling point Therefore we can compare the relative strengths of the IMFs of the compounds to predict their relative boiling points Hbonding dipoledipole London dispersion van der Waals When comparing compounds with the same IMFs we use size and shape as tie breakers since the London dispersion forces increase as the surface area increases Since all compounds exhibit some level of London dispersion forces and compounds capable of Hbonding also exhibit dipoledipole we will use the phrase dominant IMF to communicate the IMF most responsible for the physical properties of the compound In the table below we see examples of these relationships When comparing the structural isomers of pentane pentane isopentane and neopentane they all have the same molecular formula CH However as the carbon chain is shortened to create the carbon branches found in isopentane and neopentane the overall surface area of the molecules decreases The visual image of MO theory can be helpful in seeing each compound as a cloud of electrons in an all encompassing MO system Branching creates more spherical shapes noting that the sphere allows the maximum volume with the least surface area The structural isomers with the chemical formula CHO have different dominant IMFs The Hbonding of ethanol results in a liquid for cocktails at room temperature while the weaker dipoledipole of the dimethylether results in a gas a room temperature In the last example we see the three IMFs compared directly to illustrate the relative strength IMFs to boiling points Boiling points and melting points The observable melting and boiling points of different organic molecules provides an additional illustration of the effects of noncovalent interactions The overarching principle involved is simple the stronger the noncovalent interactions between molecules the more energy that is required in the form of heat to break them apart Higher melting and boiling points signify stronger noncovalent intermolecular forces Consider the boiling points of increasingly larger hydrocarbons More carbons means a greater surface area possible for hydrophobic interaction and thus higher boiling points As you would expect the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipoledipole interactions is reflected in higher boiling points Just look at the trend for hexane nonpolar London dispersion interactions only hexanone dipoledipole interactions and hexanol hydrogen bonding Of particular interest to biologists and pretty much anything else that is alive in the universe is the effect of hydrogen bonding in water Because it is able to form tight networks of intermolecular hydrogen bonds water remains in the liquid phase at temperatures up to OC slightly lower at high altitude The world would obviously be a very different place if water boiled at OC Exercise Based on their structures rank phenol benzene benzaldehyde and benzoic acid in terms of lowest to highest boiling point Solution By thinking about noncovalent intermolecular interactions we can also predict relative melting points All of the same principles apply stronger intermolecular interactions result in a higher melting point Ionic compounds as expected usually have very high melting points due to the strength of ionion interactions there are some ionic compounds however that are liquids at room temperature The presence of polar and especially hydrogenbonding groups on organic compounds generally leads to higher melting points Molecular shape and the ability of a molecule to pack tightly into a crystal lattice has a very large effect on melting points The flat shape of aromatic compounds such as napthalene and biphenyl allows them to stack together efficiently and thus aromatics tend to have higher melting points compared to alkanes or alkenes with similar molecular weights Comparing the melting points of benzene and toluene you can see that the extra methyl group on toluene disrupts the molecules ability to stack thus decreasing the cumulative strength of intermolecular London dispersion forces Note also that the boiling point for toluene is oC well above the boiling point of benzene oC The key factor for the boiling point trend in this case is size toluene has one more carbon whereas for the melting point trend shape plays a much more important role This makes sense when you consider that melting involves unpacking the molecules from their ordered array whereas boiling involves simply separating them from their already loose liquid association with each other If you are taking an organic lab course you may have already learned that impurities in a crystalline substance will cause the observed melting point to be lower compared to a pure sample of the same substance This is because impurities disrupt the ordered packing arrangement of the crystal and make the cumulative intermolecular interactions weaker The melting behavior of lipid structures An interesting biological example of the relationship between molecular structure and melting point is provided by the observable physical difference between animal fats like butter or lard which are solid at room temperature and vegetable oils which are liquid Both solid fats and liquid oils are based on a triacylglycerol structure where three hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains of varying length are attached to a glycerol backbone through an ester functional group compare this structure to that of the membrane lipids discussed in section B Interactive D image of a saturated triacylglycerol BioTopics Saturated vs monounsaturated fatty acid BioTopics In vegetable oils the hydrophobic chains are unsaturated meaning that they contain one or more double bonds Solid animal fat in contrast contains saturated hydrocarbon chains with no double bonds The double bonds in vegetable oils cause those hydrocarbon chains to be more rigid and bent at an angle remember that rotation is restricted around double bonds with the result that they dont pack together as closely and thus can be broken apart ie melted more readily Shown in the figure above is a polyunsaturated fatty acid chain two double bonds and you can click on the link to see

IMFs of organic compounds The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids In contrast to intramolecular forces such as the covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules and polyatomic ions intermolecular forces hold molecules together in a liquid or solid Intermolecular forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds For example it requires kJ to overcome the intramolecular forces and break both OH bonds in mol of water but it takes only about kJ to overcome the intermolecular attractions and convert mol of liquid water to water vapor at C Despite this seemingly low value the intermolecular forces in liquid water are among the strongest such forces known Given the large difference in the strengths of intra and intermolecular forces changes between the solid liquid and gaseous states almost invariably occur for molecular substances without breaking covalent bonds The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids Intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the boiling points of liquids Liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid Similarly solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature that is they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species Like covalent and ionic bonds intermolecular interactions are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components Because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids where the molecules are close together These interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law at high pressures For more information on the behavior of real gases and deviations from the ideal gas law In this section we explicitly consider three kinds of intermolecular interactions There are two additional types of electrostatic interaction that you are already familiar with the ionion interactions that are responsible for ionic bonding and the iondipole interactions that occur when ionic substances dissolve in a polar substance such as water The first two are often described collectively as van der Waals forces DipoleDipole Interactions Polar covalent bonds behave as if the bonded atoms have localized fractional charges that are equal but opposite ie the two bonded atoms generate a dipole If the structure of a molecule is such that the individual bond dipoles do not cancel one another then the molecule has a net dipole moment Molecules with net dipole moments tend to align themselves so that the positive end of one dipole is near the negative end of another and vice versa as shown in Figure Figure Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions a and b Molecular orientations in which the positive end of one dipole δ is near the negative end of another δ and vice versa produce attractive interactions c and d Molecular orientations that juxtapose the positive or negative ends of the dipoles on adjacent molecules produce repulsive interactions These arrangements are more stable than arrangements in which two positive or two negative ends are adjacent Figure Hence dipoledipole interactions such as those in Figure are attractive intermolecular interactions whereas those in Figure are repulsive intermolecular interactions Because molecules in a liquid move freely and continuously molecules always experience both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions simultaneously as shown in Figure On average however the attractive interactions dominate Figure Both Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions Occur in a Liquid Sample with Many Molecules Because each end of a dipole possesses only a fraction of the charge of an electron dipoledipole interactions are substantially weaker than the interactions between two ions each of which has a charge of at least or between a dipole and an ion in which one of the species has at least a full positive or negative charge In addition the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do the ionion interactions Recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r where r is the distance between the ions Doubling the distance r r decreases the attractive energy by onehalf In contrast the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to r so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction by or fold Thus a substance such as which is partially held together by dipoledipole interactions is a gas at room temperature and atm pressure whereas which is held together by interionic interactions is a highmeltingpoint solid Within a series of compounds of similar molar mass the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases as shown in Table Table Relationships between the Dipole Moment and the Boiling Point for Organic Compounds of Similar Molar Mass Compound Molar Mass gmol Dipole Moment D Boiling Point K CH cyclopropane CHOCH dimethyl ether CHCN acetonitrile The attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r whereas the attractive energy between two dipoles is proportional to r Example Arrange ethyl methyl ether CHOCHCH methylpropane isobutane CHCHCH and acetone CHCOCH in order of increasing boiling points Their structures are as follows Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Compare the molar masses and the polarities of the compounds Compounds with higher molar masses and that are polar will have the highest boiling points Solution The three compounds have essentially the same molar mass gmol so we must look at differences in polarity to predict the strength of the intermolecular dipoledipole interactions and thus the boiling points of the compounds The first compound methylpropane contains only CH bonds which are not very polar because C and H have similar electronegativities It should therefore have a very small but nonzero dipole moment and a very low boiling point Ethyl methyl ether has a structure similar to HO it contains two polar CO single bonds oriented at about a angle to each other in addition to relatively nonpolar CH bonds As a result the CO bond dipoles partially reinforce one another and generate a significant dipole moment that should give a moderately high boiling point Acetone contains a polar CO double bond oriented at about to two methyl groups with nonpolar CH bonds The CO bond dipole therefore corresponds to the molecular dipole which should result in both a rather large dipole moment and a high boiling point Thus we predict the following order of boiling points methylpropane ethyl methyl ether acetone This result is in good agreement with the actual data methylpropane boiling point C and the dipole moment μ D methyl ethyl ether boiling point C and μ D acetone boiling point C and μ D Exercise Arrange carbon tetrafluoride CF ethyl methyl sulfide CHSCH dimethyl sulfoxide CHSO and methylbutane isopentane CHCHCHCH in order of decreasing boiling points Answer dimethyl sulfoxide boiling point C ethyl methyl sulfide boiling point C methylbutane boiling point C carbon tetrafluoride boiling point C London Dispersion Forces Thus far we have considered only interactions between polar molecules but other factors must be considered to explain why many nonpolar molecules such as bromine benzene and hexane are liquids at room temperature and others such as iodine and naphthalene are solids Even the noble gases can be liquefied or solidified at low temperatures high pressures or both Table What kind of attractive forces can exist between nonpolar molecules or atoms This question was answered by Fritz London a German physicist who later worked in the United States In London proposed that temporary fluctuations in the electron distributions within atoms and nonpolar molecules could result in the formation of shortlived instantaneous dipole moments which produce attractive forces called London dispersion forces between otherwise nonpolar substances Table Normal Melting and Boiling Points of Some Elements and Nonpolar Compounds Substance Molar Mass gmol Melting Point C Boiling Point C Ar Xe N O F I CH Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms for example On average the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed around the nucleus Because the electrons are in constant motion however their distribution in one atom is likely to be asymmetrical at any given instant resulting in an instantaneous dipole moment As shown in part a in Figure the instantaneous dipole moment on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom pulling them toward the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end The net effect is that the first atom causes the temporary formation of a dipole called an induced dipole in the second Interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another These attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance London was able to show with quantum mechanics that the attractive energy between molecules due to temporary dipoleinduced dipole interactions falls off as r Doubling the distance therefore decreases the attractive energy by or fold Figure Instantaneous Dipole Moments The formation of an instantaneous dipole moment on one He atom a or an H molecule b results in the formation of an induced dipole on an adjacent atom or molecule Instantaneous dipoleinduced dipole interactions between nonpolar molecules can produce intermolecular attractions just as they produce interatomic attractions in monatomic substances like Xe This effect illustrated for two H molecules in part b in Figure tends to become more pronounced as atomic and molecular masses increase Table For example Xe boils at C whereas He boils at C The reason for this trend is that the strength of London dispersion forces is related to the ease with which the electron distribution in a given atom can be perturbed In small atoms such as He the two s electrons are held close to the nucleus in a very small volume and electronelectron repulsions are strong enough to prevent significant asymmetry in their distribution In larger atoms such as Xe however the outer electrons are much less strongly attracted to the nucleus because of filled intervening shells As a result it is relatively easy to temporarily deform the electron distribution to generate an instantaneous or induced dipole The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule is called its polarizability Because the electron distribution is more easily perturbed in large heavy species than in small light species we say that heavier substances tend to be much more polarizable than lighter ones For similar substances London dispersion forces get stronger with increasing molecular size The polarizability of a substance also determines how it interacts with ions and species that possess permanent dipoles Thus London dispersion forces are responsible for the general trend toward higher boiling points with increased molecular mass and greater surface area in a homologous series of compounds such as the alkanes part a in Figure The strengths of London dispersion forces also depend significantly on molecular shape because shape determines how much of one molecule can interact with its neighboring molecules at any given time For example part b in Figure shows dimethylpropane neopentane and npentane both of which have the empirical formula CH Neopentane is almost spherical with a small surface area for intermolecular interactions whereas npentane has an extended conformation that enables it to come into close contact with other npentane molecules As a result the boiling point of neopentane C is more than C lower than the boiling point of npentane C Figure Mass and Surface Area Affect the Strength of London Dispersion Forces a In this series of four simple alkanes larger molecules have stronger London forces between them than smaller molecules and consequently higher boiling points b Linear npentane molecules have a larger surface area and stronger intermolecular forces than spherical neopentane molecules As a result neopentane is a gas at room temperature whereas npentane is a volatile liquid All molecules whether polar or nonpolar are attracted to one another by London dispersion forces in addition to any other attractive forces that may be present In general however dipoledipole interactions in small polar molecules are significantly stronger than London dispersion forces so the former predominate Example Arrange nbutane propane methylpropane isobutene CHCHCH and npentane in order of increasing boiling points Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Determine the intermolecular forces in the compounds and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution The four compounds are alkanes and nonpolar so London dispersion forces are the only important intermolecular forces These forces are generally stronger with increasing molecular mass so propane should have the lowest boiling point and npentane should have the highest with the two butane isomers falling in between Of the two butane isomers methylpropane is more compact and nbutane has the more extended shape Consequently we expect intermolecular interactions for nbutane to be stronger due to its larger surface area resulting in a higher boiling point The overall order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses propane C methylpropane C nbutane C npentane C Exercise Arrange GeH SiCl SiH CH and GeCl in order of decreasing boiling points Answer GeCl C SiCl C GeH C SiH C CH C Hydrogen Bonds Molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms such as O N and F and to a much lesser extent Cl and S tend to exhibit unusually strong intermolecular interactions These result in much higher boiling points than are observed for substances in which London dispersion forces dominate as illustrated for the covalent hydrides of elements of groups in Figure Methane and its heavier congeners in group form a series whose boiling points increase smoothly with increasing molar mass This is the expected trend in nonpolar molecules for which London dispersion forces are the exclusive intermolecular forces In contrast the hydrides of the lightest members of groups have boiling points that are more than C greater than predicted on the basis of their molar masses The effect is most dramatic for water if we extend the straight line connecting the points for HTe and HSe to the line for period we obtain an estimated boiling point of C for water Imagine the implications for life on Earth if water boiled at C rather than C Figure The Effects of Hydrogen Bonding on Boiling Points These plots of the boiling points of the covalent hydrides of the elements of groups show that the boiling points of the lightest members of each series for which hydrogen bonding is possible HF NH and HO are anomalously high for compounds with such low molecular masses Why do strong intermolecular forces produce such anomalously high boiling points and other unusual properties such as high enthalpies of vaporization and high melting points The answer lies in the highly polar nature of the bonds between hydrogen and very electronegative elements such as O N and F The large difference in electronegativity results in a large partial positive charge on hydrogen and a correspondingly large partial negative charge on the O N or F atom Consequently HO HN and HF bonds have very large bond dipoles that can interact strongly with one another Because a hydrogen atom is so small these dipoles can also approach one another more closely than most other dipoles The combination of large bond dipoles and short dipoledipole distances results in very strong dipoledipole interactions called hydrogen bonds as shown for ice in Figure A hydrogen bond is usually indicated by a dotted line between the hydrogen atom attached to O N or F the hydrogen bond donor and the atom that has the lone pair of electrons the hydrogen bond acceptor Because each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs a tetrahedral arrangement maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed In the structure of ice each oxygen atom is surrounded by a distorted tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms that form bridges to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules The bridging hydrogen atoms are not equidistant from the two oxygen atoms they connect however Instead each hydrogen atom is pm from one oxygen and pm from the other In contrast each oxygen atom is bonded to two H atoms at the shorter distance and two at the longer distance corresponding to two OH covalent bonds and two OH hydrogen bonds from adjacent water molecules respectively The resulting open cagelike structure of ice means that the solid is actually slightly less dense than the liquid which explains why ice floats on water rather than sinks Figure The HydrogenBonded Structure of Ice Each water molecule accepts two hydrogen bonds from two other water molecules and donates two hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bonds with two more water molecules producing an open cagelike structure The structure of liquid water is very similar but in the liquid the hydrogen bonds are continually broken and formed because of rapid molecular motion Hydrogen bond formation requires both a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor Because ice is less dense than liquid water rivers lakes and oceans freeze from the top down In fact the ice forms a protective surface layer that insulates the rest of the water allowing fish and other organisms to survive in the lower levels of a frozen lake or sea If ice were denser than the liquid the ice formed at the surface in cold weather would sink as fast as it formed Bodies of water would freeze from the bottom up which would be lethal for most aquatic creatures The expansion of water when freezing also explains why automobile or boat engines must be protected by antifreeze and why unprotected pipes in houses break if they are allowed to freeze Example Considering CHOH CH Xe and CHN which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Given compounds Asked for formation of hydrogen bonds and structure Strategy Identify the compounds with a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F These are likely to be able to act as hydrogen bond donors Of the compounds that can act as hydrogen bond donors identify those that also contain lone pairs of electrons which allow them to be hydrogen bond acceptors If a substance is both a hydrogen donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor draw a structure showing the hydrogen bonding Solution A Of the species listed xenon Xe ethane CH and trimethylamine CHN do not contain a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F hence they cannot act as hydrogen bond donors B The one compound that can act as a hydrogen bond donor methanol CHOH contains both a hydrogen atom attached to O making it a hydrogen bond donor and two lone pairs of electrons on O making it a hydrogen bond acceptor methanol can thus form hydrogen bonds by acting as either a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor The hydrogenbonded structure of methanol is as follows Exercise Considering CHCOH CHN NH and CHF which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Answer CHCOH and NH Although hydrogen bonds are significantly weaker than covalent bonds with typical dissociation energies of only kJmol they have a significant influence on the physical properties of a compound Compounds such as HF can form only two hydrogen bonds at a time as can on average pure liquid NH Consequently even though their molecular masses are similar to that of water their boiling points are significantly lower than the boiling point of water which forms four hydrogen bonds at a time Example Buckyballs Arrange C buckminsterfullerene which has a cage structure NaCl He Ar and NO in order of increasing boiling points Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Identify the intermolecular forces in each compound and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution Electrostatic interactions are strongest for an ionic compound so we expect NaCl to have the highest boiling point To predict the relative boiling points of the other compounds we must consider their polarity for dipoledipole interactions their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their molar mass for London dispersion forces Helium is nonpolar and by far the lightest so it should have the lowest boiling point Argon and NO have very similar molar masses and gmol respectively but NO is polar while Ar is not Consequently NO should have a higher boiling point A C molecule is nonpolar but its molar mass is gmol much greater than that of Ar or NO Because the boiling points of nonpolar substances increase rapidly with molecular mass C should boil at a higher temperature than the other nonionic substances The predicted order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses He C Ar C NO C C C NaCl C Exercise Arrange dimethylheptane Ne CS Cl and KBr in order of decreasing boiling points Answer KBr C dimethylheptane C CS C Cl C Ne C Example Identify the most significant intermolecular force in each substance CH CHOH HS Solution a Although CH bonds are polar they are only minimally polar The most significant intermolecular force for this substance would be dispersion forces b This molecule has an H atom bonded to an O atom so it will experience hydrogen bonding c Although this molecule does not experience hydrogen bonding the Lewis electron dot diagram and VSEPR indicate that it is bent so it has a permanent dipole The most significant force in this substance is dipoledipole interaction Exercise Identify the most significant intermolecular force in each substance HF HCl Answer a hydrogen bonding Answer b dipoledipole interactions More complex examples of hydrogen bonding The hydration of negative ions When an ionic substance dissolves in water water molecules cluster around the separated ions This process is called hydration Water frequently attaches to positive ions by coordinate dative covalent bonds It bonds to negative ions using hydrogen bonds If you are interested in the bonding in hydrated positive ions you could follow this link to coordinate dative covalent bonding The diagram shows the potential hydrogen bonds formed to a chloride ion Cl Although the lone pairs in the chloride ion are at the level and would not normally be active enough to form hydrogen bonds in this case they are made more attractive by the full negative charge on the chlorine Figure Hydrogen bonding between chloride ions and water However complicated the negative ion there will always be lone pairs that the hydrogen atoms from the water molecules can hydrogen bond to Hydrogen bonding in alcohols An alcohol is an organic molecule containing an OH group Any molecule which has a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen or a nitrogen is capable of hydrogen bonding Such molecules will always have higher boiling points than similarly sized molecules which dont have an OH or an NH group The hydrogen bonding makes the molecules stickier and more heat is necessary to separate them Ethanol CHCHOH and methoxymethane CHOCH are structural isomers with the same molecular formula CHO They have the same number of electrons and a similar length to the molecule The van der Waals attractions both dispersion forces and dipoledipole attractions in each will be much the same However ethanol has a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen and that oxygen still has exactly the same two lone pairs as in a water molecule Hydrogen bonding can occur between ethanol molecules although not as effectively as in water The hydrogen bonding is limited by the fact that there is only one hydrogen in each ethanol molecule with sufficient charge In methoxymethane lone pairs on the oxygen are still there but the hydrogens are not sufficiently for hydrogen bonds to form Except in some rather unusual cases the hydrogen atom has to be attached directly to the very electronegative element for hydrogen bonding to occur The boiling points of ethanol and methoxymethane show the dramatic effect that the hydrogen bonding has on the stickiness of the ethanol molecules ethanol with hydrogen bonding C methoxymethane without hydrogen bonding C The hydrogen bonding in the ethanol has lifted its boiling point about C It is important to realize that hydrogen bonding exists in addition to van der Waals attractions For example all the following molecules contain the same number of electrons and the first two are much the same length The higher boiling point of the butanol is due to the additional hydrogen bonding Comparing the two alcohols containing OH groups both boiling points are high because of the additional hydrogen bonding due to the hydrogen attached directly to the oxygen but they are not the same The boiling point of the methylpropanol isnt as high as the butanol because the branching in the molecule makes the van der Waals attractions less effective than in the longer butanol Hydrogen bonding in organic molecules containing nitrogen Hydrogen bonding also occurs in organic molecules containing NH groups in the same sort of way that it occurs in ammonia Examples range from simple molecules like CHNH methylamine to large molecules like proteins and DNA The two strands of the famous double helix in DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen on one strand and lone pairs on another nitrogen or an oxygen on the other one Donors and Acceptors In order for a hydrogen bond to occur there must be both a hydrogen donor and an acceptor present The donor in a hydrogen bond is the atom to which the hydrogen atom participating in the hydrogen bond is covalently bonded and is usually a strongly electronegative atom such as NO or F The hydrogen acceptor is the neighboring electronegative ion or molecule and must posses a lone electron pair in order to form a hydrogen bond Why does a hydrogen bond occur Since the hydrogen donor is strongly electronegative it pulls the covalently bonded electron pair closer to its nucleus and away from the hydrogen atom The hydrogen atom is then left with a partial positive charge creating a dipoledipole attraction between the hydrogen atom bonded to the donor and the lone electron pair on the accepton This results in a hydrogen bondsee Interactions Between Molecules With Permanent Dipoles Types of hydrogen bonds Hydrogen bonds can occur within one single molecule between two like molecules or between two unlike molecules Intramolecular hydrogen bonds Intramolecular hydrogen bonds are those which occur within one single molecule This occurs when two functional groups of a molecule can form hydrogen bonds with each other In order for this to happen both a hydrogen donor an acceptor must be present within one molecule and they must be within close proximity of each other in the molecule For example intramolecular hydrogen bonding occurs in ethylene glycol CHOH between its two hydroxyl groups due to the molecular geometry Intermolecular hydrogen bonds Intermolecular hydrogen bonds occur between separate molecules in a substance They can occur between any number of like or unlike molecules as long as hydrogen donors and acceptors are present an in positions in which they can interactFor example intermolecular hydrogen bonds can occur between NH molecules alone between HO molecules alone or between NH and HO molecules Properties and effects of hydrogen bonds On Boiling Point When we consider the boiling points of molecules we usually expect molecules with larger molar masses to have higher normal boiling points than molecules with smaller molar masses This without taking hydrogen bonds into account is due to greater dispersion forces see Interactions Between Nonpolar Molecules Larger molecules have more space for electron distribution and thus more possibilities for an instantaneous dipole moment However when we consider the table below we see that this is not always the case Compound Molar Mass Normal Boiling Point gmol K gmol K gmol K gmol K gmol K gmol K We see that HO HF and NH each have higher boiling points than the same compound formed between hydrogen and the next element moving down its respective group indicating that the former have greater intermolecular forces This is because HO HF and NH all exhibit hydrogen bonding whereas the others do not Furthermore has a smaller molar mass than HF but partakes in more hydrogen bonds per molecule so its boiling point is consequently higher On Viscosity The same effect that is seen on boiling point as a result of hydrogen bonding can also be observed in the viscosity of certain substances Those substances which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds tend to have a higher viscosity than those that do not Substances which have the possibility for multiple hydrogen bonds exhibit even higher viscosities Factors preventing Hydrogen bonding Electronegativity Hydrogen bonding cannot occur without significant electronegativity differences between hydrogen and the atom it is bonded to Thus we see molecules such as PH which no not partake in hydrogen bonding PH exhibits a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry like that of ammmonia but unlike NH it cannot hydrogen bond This is due to the similarity in the electronegativities of phosphorous and hydrogen Both atoms have an electronegativity of and thus no dipole moment occurs This prevents the hydrogen bonding from acquiring the partial positive charge needed to hydrogen bond with the lone electron pair in another molecule see Polarizability Atom Size The size of donors and acceptors can also effect the ability to hydrogen bond This can account for the relatively low ability of Cl to form hydrogen bonds When the radii of two atoms differ greatly or are large their nuclei cannot achieve close proximity when they interact resulting in a weak interaction Hydrogen Bonding in Nature Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in many biological processes and can account for many natural phenomena such as the Unusual properties of Water In addition to being present in water hydrogen bonding is also important in the water transport system of plants secondary and tertiary protein structure and DNA base pairing Plants The cohesionadhesion theory of transport in vascular plants uses hydrogen bonding to explain many key components of water movement through the plants xylem and other vessels Within a vessel water molecules hydrogen bond not only to each other but also to the cellulose chain which comprises the wall of plant cells This creates a sort of capillary tube which allows for capillary action to occur since the vessel is relatively small This mechanism allows plants to pull water up into their roots Furthermorehydrogen bonding can create a long chain of water molecules which can overcome the force of gravity and travel up to the high altitudes of leaves Proteins Hydrogen bonding is present abundantly in the secondary structure of proteins and also sparingly in tertiary conformation The secondary structure of a protein involves interactions mainly hydrogen bonds between neighboring polypeptide backbones which contain NitrogenHydrogen bonded pairs and oxygen atoms Since both N and O are strongly electronegative the hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen in one polypeptide backbone can hydrogen bond to the oxygen atoms in another chain and visaversa Though they are relatively weakthese bonds offer great stability to secondary protein structure because they repeat a great number of times In tertiary protein structureinteractions are primarily between functional R groups of a polypeptide chain one such interaction is called a hydrophobic interaction These interactions occur because of hydrogen bonding between water molecules around the hydrophobe and further reinforce

has led to the epithet carbonbased life The truth is we know of no other kind of life Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms plants and animals as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially and these substances were thus known as organic compounds Figure All organic compounds contain carbon and most are formed by living things although they are also

annszypWikimedia Commons credit right modification of work by George Shuklin Jöns Jacob Berzelius a physician by trade first coined the term organic chemistry in for the study of compounds derived from biological sources Up through the early th century naturalists and scientists observed critical differences between compounds that were derived from living things and those that were not In Friedrich Wöhler widely regarded as a pioneer in organic chemistry successfully completed an organic synthesis by heating ammonium cyanate and synthesizing of the biological compound urea a component of urine in many animals in what is now called the Wöhler synthesis Until this discovery it was widely believed by chemists that organic substances could only be formed under the influence of the vital force in the bodies of animals and plants Wöhlers synthesis dramatically proved that view to be false Urea synthesis was a critical discovery for biochemists because it showed that a compound known to be produced in nature only by biological organisms could be produced in a laboratory under controlled conditions from inanimate matter This in vitro synthesis of organic matter disproved the common theory vitalism about the vis vitalis a transcendent life force needed for producing organic compounds The ability to manipulate organic compounds includes fermentation to create wine and the making of soap both of which have been a part of society so long their discovery has been lost in antiquity Evidence has shown the Babylonians as early as BC were creating soap by mixing animal fat with wood ashes It wasnt until the th century that the chemical nature of the creation of soap was discovered by Eugène Chevreul In a reaction now call saponification fats are heated in the presence of a strong base KOH or NaOH to produce fatty acid salts and glycerol The fatty acid salts are the soap which improve waters ability to dissolve grease Although originally defined as the chemistry of biological molecules organic chemistry has since been redefined to refer specifically to carbon compounds even those with nonbiological origin Some carbon molecules are not considered organic with carbon dioxide being the most well known and most common inorganic carbon compound but such molecules are the exception and not the rule Organic chemistry focuses on carbon compounds and following movement of the electrons in carbon chains and rings and also how electrons are shared with other carbon atoms and heteroatoms Organic chemistry is primarily concerned with the properties of covalent bonds and nonmetallic elements though ions and metals do play critical roles in some reactions Why is carbon so special The answer to this question involves carbons special ability to bond with itself which will be discussed in this chapter Carbon is unique in its ability to form a wide variety of compounds from simple to complex There are literally millions of organic compounds known to science from methane which contains one carbon atom to DNA which contains millions of carbons More importantly organic chemistry gives us the ability to make and alter the structure of organic compounds which is the main topic in this book The applications of organic chemistry are myriad and include all sorts of plastics dyes flavorings scents detergents explosives fuels and many many other products Read the ingredient list for almost any kind of food that you eat or even your shampoo bottle and you will see the handiwork of organic chemists listed there The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry In this chapter we discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds how those compounds are classified and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial settings The field of organic chemistry is probably the most active and important field of chemistry at the moment due to its extreme applicability to both biochemistry especially in the pharmaceutical industry and petrochemistry especially in the energy industry Organic chemistry has a relatively recent history but it will have an enormously important future affecting the lives of everyone around the world for many many years to come Contributors and Attributions Paul Flowers

recognize the relationships between constitutional structural isomers conformational isomers and geometric isomers Isomers Isomers always have the same chemical formula When the chemical formulae are different then the compounds are completely different Important information can be gained from the chemical formulas when comparing compounds Structural constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but a different bonding arrangement among the atoms Stereoisomers have identical molecular formulas and arrangements of atoms They differ from each other only in the spatial orientation of groups in the molecule For organic chemistry there are several types of stereoisomers enantiomers diasteriomers geometric isomers and conformers These stereoisomers will be introduced and explained throughout several chapters Structural Constitutional Isomers Because carbon forms four bonds there can be multiple ways to form molecules that follow the octet rule Even with only four carbon atoms there are two possible structures for the carbon backbone The carbon atoms can be bonded to make a four carbon chain butane or there can be a one carbon branch from a three carbon chain methylpropane Butane and methylpropane are structural isomers because they both have the chemical formula CH Identical vs Conformer The rotation about single bonds creates dynamic molecules When drawing and discussing molecules it is important to be aware that our drawing are static while the molecule themselves are rotating Although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical Rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations Conformers are the simplest example of stereoisomerism Identical compounds are the same compound shown with ALL atoms in the same spatial orientation Conformers are the same compound shown with different rotations about single bonds In the example below we can compare two identical structures for ethane with two conformers of ethane Geometric Isomers an example of stereoisomerism The rigidity of the pi bonds in double bonds can create geometric isomerism Without rotation there are two different orientations possible across the carboncarbon double bond CC The rigidity of the double bond creates a line of reference for spatial orientation The prefixes cis and trans are used to distinguish between geometric isomers The cisstereoisomer has both nonhydrogen atoms on the same side of the double bond Whereas the transstereoisomer has the nonhydrogen atoms across the double bond In the same way we cross the ocean an a transAtlantic journey This small difference may seem insignificant but geometric isomers are different chemical compounds with different physical properties as shown in the example below For now it is important to distinguish between structural differences and spatial differences when comparing compounds In the future we will look more closely at isomerism Example Lets look ate the bondline structures below and determine the relationships between the following pairs of compounds identical conformers structural isomers geometric isomers or completely different compounds The first important step that is often skipped is to determine the chemical formula of each compound If the chemical formulas are different then the compounds are completely different and there is NO isomeric relationship If the chemical formulas are the same then we identify the difference between to the compounds to determine their relatioship If there are structural differences in the bonding patterns then the compounds are constitutional structural isomers If the compounds have the same structural connections but the spatial orientations are different then the compounds are stereoisomers For now the possible stereoisomers are conformers showing the same compound with different carboncarbon single bond rotations or geometric isomers of compounds with different orientations at the carboncarbon double bonds Applying the logic above to our example we determine the following Exercise What is the relationship between the following pairs of compounds identical conformers structural isomers geometric isomers or completely different compounds Answer a geometric isomers b conformers c structural isomers d completely different compounds e identical Conformational IsomersStructural Constitutional IsomersStereoisomersContributors and Attributions Learning Objective distinguish and discern the structural and chemical relationships between isomeric compounds The various types of isomers have been introduced and explored over several chapters It can be helpful to review compare and contrast all of the forms of isomerism to build our skills of discernment A brief review of each type of isomerism follows the summary diagram See the respective chapter for a complete explanation Conformational Isomers The rotation of CC single bonds both carbon chains creates conformers the same compound shown in different rotations Consequently many different arrangements of the atoms are possible each corresponding to different degrees of rotation Differences in threedimensional structure resulting from rotation about a σ bond are called differences in conformation and each different arrangement is called a conformational isomer or conformer While complete rotation of CC single bonds is not possible in rings The freedom of bond movement does allow the rings to assume different conformations such as the chair and boat for membered rings Structural Constitutional Isomers Unlike conformational isomers structural isomers differ in connectivity as illustrated below for propanol and propanol Although these two alcohols have the same molecular formula CHO the position of the OH group differs creating a unique compounds with differences in their physical and chemical properties Consider for example the following five structures represented by the formula CH In the conversion of one structural isomer to another at least one bond must be broken and reformed at a different position in the molecule Structures a and d above represent the same compound npentane Structures b and c represent the same compound methylbutane No bonds need to be broken and reformed to convert between a and d or between b and c The molecules are simply rotated about a vertical axis Structure e is named dimethylpropane There are only three structural isomers possible with the chemical formula CH npentane methylbutane and dimethylpropane Structural isomers have distinct physical and chemical properties Stereoisomers Enantiomers are pairs of compounds that are nonsuperimposable images When there are two or more chiral centers in a compounds the diatereomers can exist Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are NOT enantiomers Enatiomers share all physical properties except for their interaction with plane polarized light Diastereomers have different physical properties melting points and boiling points and densities Exercise What kind of isomers are the following pairs Note It can be difficult to answer this question directly from the names It can be helpful to draw the structures

University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry A Position IsomersContributors and Attributions More than one stable substance can correspond to a given molecular formula Examples are butane and methylpropane isobutane each of which has the molecular formula Similarly methoxymethane dimethyl ether and ethanol have the same formula Compounds having the same number and kinds of atoms are called isomers Whereas only one stable substance is known corresponding to the formula thirtyfive stable isomers have been prepared of the formula From this one may begin to sense the rich variety of organic chemistry which leads to many problems in telling one compound from another in determining structures and also in finding suitable names for compounds In the rest of this chapter we will describe one type of isomer the position isomer and in later chapters we will discuss another type of isomer the stereoisomer and the experimental approaches that are used to establish the purity identity structure and stereochemistry of organic compounds A Position Isomers Compounds having the same number and kind of atoms but having different bonding arrangements between the atoms are called position isomers Butane and methylpropane are examples of position isomers The atoms are connected differently in the two structures because the carbon chain in butane is a straight or continuous chain whereas in methylpropane it is branched Therefore these two molecules are structurally different and accordingly do not have the same chemical and physical properties They cannot be converted one into the other without breaking and remaking and bonds Methoxymethane and ethanol are also position isomers because the oxygen clearly is connected differently in the two molecules The term position isomer means the same as constitutional isomer The designation structural isomer also is used but this term is taken by some to include both position isomers and stereoisomers that is structure can mean both the way in which atoms are connected and their different arrangements in space The number of position isomers possible for a given formula rapidly increases with the increasing number of carbon atoms as can be seen from the number of theoretically possible structures of formula up to given in Table In it was reported that all of the compounds with values of to had been prepared in the laboratory Before we can begin to discuss the chemistry of these compounds it is necessary to know how to name them without convenient and systematic rules for nomenclature that are adopted universally catastrophic confusion would result We shall tackle this problem in the next chapter The prefix iso is from the

join two rings Bicyclic Ring Systems There are three ways to join two rings If two rings share two or more atoms then the structure is called a bicyclic compound If the two rings share a single atom then the structure is called a spirocyclic compound Examples of each way to join rings is shown below Bicyclic Compounds Fused rings share two adjacent carbon atoms Decalin is a fused bicyclic compound Its IUPAC name is bibyclodecane to communicate the bonding arrangement Bridged rings share two nonadjacent carbon atoms and one or more carbon atoms between them Bicycloheptane shows the difference between the bridgehead carbons and the bridge carbons Spirocyclic Compounds A spirobicycloalkane is a molecule in which only one carbon atom is shared by the two rings in the molecule The carbon atom shared by the two rings is called the spirocarbon A chain of bonds originating and ending at the spirocarbon is called a bridge The compound below is named spirodecane to communicate the number of carbons in each bridge with the spirocarbon Steroids Steroids include such well known compounds as cholesterol sex hormones birth control pills cortisone and anabolic steroids The best known and most abundant steroid in the body is cholesterol Cholesterol is formed in brain tissue nerve tissue and the blood stream It is the major compound found in gallstones and bile salts Cholesterol also contributes to the formation of deposits on the inner walls of blood vessels These deposits harden and obstruct the flow of blood This condition known as atherosclerosis results in various heart diseases strokes and high blood pressure Much research is currently underway to determine if a correlation exists between cholesterol levels in the blood and diet Not only does cholesterol come from the diet but cholesterol is synthesized in the body from carbohydrates and proteins as well as fat Therefore the elimination of cholesterol rich foods from the diet does not necessarily lower blood cholesterol levels Some studies have found that if certain unsaturated fats and oils are substituted for saturated fats the blood cholesterol level decreases The research is incomplete on this problem Structures of Sex Hormones Sex hormones are also steroids The primary male hormone testosterone is responsible for the development of secondary sex characteristics Two female sex hormones progesterone and estrogen or estradiol control the ovulation cycle Notice that the male and female hormones have only slight differences in structures but yet have very different physiological effects Testosterone promotes the normal development of male genital organs ans is synthesized from cholesterol in the testes It also promotes secondary male sexual characteristics such as deep voice facial and body hair Estrogen along with progesterone regulates changes occurring in the uterus and ovaries known as the menstrual cycle For more details see Birth Control Estrogen is synthesized from testosterone by making the first ring aromatic which results in mole double bonds the loss of a methyl group and formation of an alcohol group Exercise Someone stated that transdecalin is more stable than cisdecalin Explain why this is incorrect Answer Cisdecalin has fewer steric interactions than transdecalinbecause each ring can assume the chair form in both conformations Working with models can be helpful

ExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to list and describe the four important kinds of reactions that occur in organic chemistry Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below addition reaction elimination reaction rearrangement reaction substitution reaction Study Notes It is sufficient that you know the general form of each kind of reaction However given a chemical equation you should be able to recognize which kind of reaction it involves If you scan any organic textbook you will encounter what appears to be a very large often intimidating number of reactions These are the tools of a chemist and to use these tools effectively we must organize them in a sensible manner and look for patterns of reactivity that permit us make plausible predictions Most of these reactions occur at special sites of reactivity known as functional groups and these constitute one organizational scheme that helps us catalog and remember reactions Ultimately the best way to achieve proficiency in organic chemistry is to understand how reactions take place and to recognize the various factors that influence their course First we identify four broad classes of reactions based solely on the structural change occurring in the reactant molecules This classification does not require knowledge or speculation concerning reaction paths or mechanisms The four main reaction classes are additions eliminations substitutions and rearrangements Addition Reaction Elimination Reaction Substitution Reaction Rearrangement Reaction In an addition reaction the number of σbonds in the substrate molecule increases usually at the expense of one or more πbonds The reverse is true of elimination reactions iethe number of σbonds in the substrate decreases and new πbonds are often formed Substitution reactions as the name implies are characterized by replacement of an atom or group Y by another atom or group Z Aside from these groups the number of bonds does not change A rearrangement reaction generates an isomer and again the number of bonds normally does not change The examples illustrated above involve simple alkyl and alkene systems but these reaction types are general for most functional groups including those incorporating carbonoxygen double bonds and carbonnitrogen double and triple bonds Some common reactions may actually be a combination of reaction types Example Reaction of an Ester with Ammonia The reaction of an ester with ammonia to give an amide as shown below appears to be a substitution reaction Y CHO Z NH however it is actually two reactions an addition followed by an elimination Example The Addition of water to a Nitrile The addition of water to a nitrile does not seem to fit any of the above reaction types but it is simply a slow addition reaction followed by a rapid rearrangement as shown in the following equation Rapid rearrangements of this kind are called tautomerizations Exercises Questions Q Classify each reaction as addition elimination substitution or rearrangement Solutions S A Substitution B Elimination C

LinksReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective Use the definition of Lewis Acids and Bases to recognize electron movement in reactions Acids and bases are an important part of chemistry One of the most applicable theories is the Lewis acidbase motif that extends the definition of an acid and base beyond H and OH ions as described by BrønstedLowry acids and bases Introduction The Brø nsted acidbase theory has been used throughout the history of acid and base chemistry However this theory is very restrictive and focuses primarily on acids and bases acting as proton donors and acceptors Sometimes conditions arise where the theory doesnt necessarily fit such as in solids and gases In GN Lewis from UC Berkeley proposed an alternate theory to describe acids and bases His theory gave a generalized explanation of acids and bases based on structure and bonding Through the use of the Lewis definition of acids and bases chemists are now able to predict a wider variety of acidbase reactions Lewis theory used electrons instead of proton transfer and specifically stated that an acid is a species that accepts an electron pair while a base donates an electron pair Figure Above A Lewis Base B donates it electrons to a Lewis Acid A resulting in a coordinate covalently bonded compound also known as an adduct The reaction of a Lewis acid and a Lewis base will produce a coordinate covalent bond as shown in Figure above A coordinate covalent bond is just a type of covalent bond in which one reactant gives it electron pair to another reactant In this case the lewis base donates its electrons to the lewis acid When they do react this way the resulting product is called an addition compound or more commonly an adduct Lewis Acid a species that accepts an electron pair ie an electrophile and will have vacant orbitals Lewis Base a species that donates an electron pair ie a nucleophile and will have lonepair electrons Lewis Acids Lewis acids accept an electron pair Lewis Acids are Electrophilic meaning that they are electron attracting When bonding with a base the acid uses its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital or LUMO Figure Various species can act as Lewis acids All cations are Lewis acids since they are able to accept electrons eg Cu Fe Fe An atom ion or molecule with an incomplete octet of electrons can act as an Lewis acid eg BF AlF Molecules where the central atom can have more than valence shell electrons can be electron acceptors and thus are classified as Lewis acids eg SiBr SiF Molecules that have multiple bonds between two atoms of different electronegativities eg CO SO Lewis Bases Lewis Bases donate an electron pair Lewis Bases are Nucleophilic meaning that they attack a positive charge with their lone pair They utilize the highest occupied molecular orbital or HOMO Figure An atom ion or molecule with a lonepair of electrons can thus be a Lewis base Each of the following anions can give up their electrons to an acid eg Lewis bases HOMO highest occupied molecular orbital interacts with the Lewis acids LUMO lowest unoccupied molecular orbital to create bonded molecular orbitals Both Lewis Acids and Bases contain HOMO and LUMOs but only the HOMO is considered for Bases and only the LUMO is considered for Acids Figure Figure Lewis Acids have vacant orbitals so they are in a lower energy level While lewis bases have lone pair electrons to share and thus occupy a higher energy level Complex Ion Coordination Compounds Complex ions are polyatomic ions which are formed from a central metal ion that has other smaller ions joined around it While Brønsted theory cant explain this reaction Lewis acidbase theory can help A Lewis Base is often the ligand of a coordination compound with the metal acting as the Lewis Acid see Oxidation States of Transition Metals The aluminum ion is the metal and is a cation with an unfilled valence shell and it is a Lewis Acid Water has lonepair electrons and is an anion thus it is a Lewis Base Figure Aluminum ion acts as a Lewis acid and accepts the electrons from water which is acting as a Lewis base This helps explain the resulting hexaaquaaluminumIII ion The Lewis Acid accepts the electrons from the Lewis Base which donates the electrons Another case where Lewis acidbase theory can explain the resulting compound is the reaction of ammonia with Zn Zn NH_ rightarrow ZnNH__ label Similarly the Lewis Acid is the zinc Ion and the Lewis Base is NH Note how Brønsted Theory of Acids and Bases will not be able to explain how this reaction occurs because there are no or ions involved Thus Lewis Acid and Base Theory allows us to explain the formation of other species and complex ions which do not ordinarily contain hydronium or hydroxide ions One is able to expand the definition of an acid and a base via the Lewis Acid and Base Theory The lack of or ions in many complex ions can make it harder to identify which species is an acid and which is a base Therefore by defining a species that donates an electron pair and a species that accepts an electron pair the definition of a acid and base is expanded Amphoterism As of now you should know that acids and bases are distinguished as two separate things however some substances can be both an acid and a base You may have noticed this with water which can act as both an acid or a base This ability of water to do this makes it an amphoteric molecule Water can act as an acid by donating its proton to the base and thus becoming its conjugate acid OH However water can also act as a base by accepting a proton from an acid to become its conjugate base HO Water acting as an Acid Water acting as a Base H_O HCl rightarrow Cl H_O label You may have noticed that the degree to which a molecule acts depends on the medium in which the molecule has been placed in Water does not act as an acid in an acid medium and does not act as a base in a basic medium Thus the medium which a molecule is placed in has an effect on the properties of that molecule Other molecules can also act as either an acid or a base For example where AlOH is acting as a Lewis Base where AlOH is acting as an Lewis Acid Note how the amphoteric properties of the AlOH depends on what type of environment that molecule has been placed in Lewis Bases Acids as Nucleophiles Electrophiles The emphasis on electron flow in the Lewis Theory of acids and bases is an important foundation for learning and predicting reaction mechanisms The electron rich Lewis base can be described as a nucleophile Nucleophiles are attracted to and can react with compounds or ions that have full or partial positive charge like the nucleus The electron poor Lewis acids can be described as electrophiles Electrophiles attract nucleophiles until orbital overlap occurs between them triggering a reaction At this point in the course we can indicate electron flow using curved arrows when both the reactants and products are given Example Exercises For the following reactions a add curved arrows to indicate the electron flow b label each reactant as the Nu nucleophile or E electrophile Solutions Outside Links Very

above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and Lewis Structures Lewis structures also known as Lewisdot diagrams show the bonding relationship between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons in the molecule While it can be helpful initially to write the individual shared electrons this approach quickly becomes awkward A single line is used to represent one pair of shared electrons Line representations are only used for shared electrons Lone pair unshared electrons are still shown as individual electrons Double and triple bonds can also be communicated with lines as shown below shared electrons form a single bond shown as or shared electrons form a double bond shown as or shared electrons form at triple bond shown as or Unshared electrons are also called Lone Pairs and are shown as Seeing the Lone Pairs Since the lone pair electrons are often NOT shown in chemical structures it is important to see mentally add the lone pairs In the beginning it can be helpful to physically add the lone pair electrons Bonding Patterns For organic chemistry the common bonding patterns of carbon oxygen and nitrogen have useful applications when evaluating chemical structures and reactivity Formal charges Organic molecules can also have positive or negative charges associated with them During chemical reactions it is common to have charge reactant intermediates andor products Recognizing and distinguishing between neutral and charged bonding patterns will be helpful in learning reaction mechanisms Consider the Lewis structure of methanol CHOH methanol is the socalled wood alcohol that unscrupulous bootleggers sometimes sold during the prohibition days in the s often causing the people who drank it to go blind Methanol itself is a neutral molecule but can lose a proton to become a molecular anion CHO or gain a proton to become a molecular cation CHOH The molecular anion and cation have overall charges of and respectively But we can be more specific than that we can also state for each molecular ion that a formal charge is located specifically on the oxygen atom rather than on the carbon or any of the hydrogen atoms Figuring out the formal charge on different atoms of a molecule is a straightforward process its simply a matter of adding up valence electrons A unbound oxygen atom has valence electrons When it is bound as part of a methanol molecule however an oxygen atom is surrounded by valence electrons nonbonding electrons two lone pairs and electrons in each of its two covalent bonds one to carbon one to hydrogen In the formal charge convention we say that the oxygen owns all nonbonding electrons However it only owns one electron from each of the two covalent bonds because covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms Therefore the oxygen atom in methanol owns ½ x valence electrons The formal charge on an atom is calculated as the number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom minus the number of valence electrons owned by the bound atom in the molecule Determining formal charge on an atom formal charge number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom number of valence electrons owned by the bound atom or formal charge number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom number of nonbonding electrons on the bound atom ½ the number of bonding electrons on the bound atom Using this formula for the oxygen atom of methanol we have formal charge on oxygen valence electrons on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons Thus oxygen in methanol has a formal charge of zero in other words it has no formal charge How about the carbon atom in methanol An isolated carbon owns valence electrons The bound carbon in methanol owns ½ x valence electrons formal charge on carbon valence electron on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons So the formal charge on carbon is zero For each of the hydrogens in methanol we also get a formal charge of zero formal charge on hydrogen valence electron on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons Now lets look at the cationic form of methanol CHOH The bonding picture has not changed for carbon or for any of the hydrogen atoms so we will focus on the oxygen atom The oxygen owns nonbonding electrons and bonding elections so the formal charge calculations becomes formal charge on oxygen valence electrons in isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons A formal charge of is located on the oxygen atom For methoxide the anionic form of methanol the calculation for the oxygen atom is formal charge on oxygen valence electrons in isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons A formal charge of is located on the oxygen atom A very important rule to keep in mind is that the sum of the formal charges on all atoms of a molecule must equal the net charge on the whole molecule When drawing the structures of organic molecules it is very important to show all nonzero formal charges being clear about where the charges are located A structure that is missing nonzero formal charges is not correctly drawn and will probably be marked as such on an exam At this point thinking back to what you learned in general chemistry you are probably asking What about dipoles Doesnt an oxygen atom in an OH bond own more of the electron density than the hydrogen because of its greater electronegativity This is absolutely correct and we will be reviewing the concept of bond dipoles later on For the purpose of calculating formal charges however bond dipoles dont matter we always consider the two electrons in a bond to be shared equally even if that is not an accurate reflection of chemical reality Formal charges are just that a formality a method of electron bookkeeping that is tied into the Lewis system for drawing the structures of organic compounds and ions Later we will see how the concept of formal charge can help us to visualize how organic molecules react Finally dont be lured into thinking that just because the net charge on a structure is zero there are no atoms with formal charges one atom could have a positive formal charge and another a negative formal charge and the net charge would still be zero Zwitterions such as amino acids have both positive and negative formal charges on different atoms Even though the net charge on glycine is zero it is still neccessary to show the location of the positive and negative formal charges Exercise Fill in all missing lone pair electrons and formal charges in the structures below Assume that all atoms have a complete valence shell of electrons Net charges are shown outside the brackets Solutions to exercises Orbitals of Lone Pair Electrons Learning Objective identify the orbitals occupied by lone pair electrons Valence Bond and Molecular Orbital Theories The table below summarizes the main points of the two complementary bonding theories Both theories provide different useful ways of describing molecular structure We will use both theories and often blend them to analyze and predict chemical structure and reactivity The bonding theories are reviewed in greater detail in the next two sections Comparison of Bonding Theories Valence Bond Theory Molecular Orbital Theory considers bonds as localized between one pair of atoms considers electrons delocalized throughout the entire molecule creates bonds from overlap of atomic orbitals s p d and hybrid orbitals sp sp sp combines atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals σ σ π π forms σ or π bonds creates bonding and antibonding interactions based on which orbitals are filled predicts molecular shape based on the number of regions of electron density predicts the arrangement of electrons in molecules needs multiple structures to describe resonance Orbitals of Lone Pair Electrons There are situations in which we will want to integrate molecular orbital and valence bond theories Identifying the orbitals of lone pair electrons is one situation Hybridized orbitals create sigma bonds and hold lone pairs The sigma bonds create the framework that holds all the atoms together as a molecule or ion Unhybridized p orbitals create pi bonds perpendicular to this sigma framework In the future we will learn that some lone pair electrons on heteroatoms of rings can occupy p orbitals to create aromaticity Stay tuned for upcoming attractions For the first ten chapters of this text we will only focus on nonaromatic compounds To identify the orbitals of the lone pair electrons in nonaromatic compounds we can follow a twostep approach Step Add any missing lone pair electrons to the heteroatoms atoms other than carbon and hydrogen Step Determine the hybridization of any atoms with lone pairs heteroatoms Lone pairs occupy the hybridized orbitals Example To identify the orbitals of the lone pair electrons in the compound below we will follow the approach above Step Add lone pairs Step Determine the hybridization of any atom with lone pairs The lone pairs on each heteroatom occupy the indicated hybridized orbital NOTE These guidelines only apply for nonaromatic compounds There can be exceptions to these guidelines for some heterocyclic aromatic compounds These exceptions are fully explained in a later chapter of this text Exercise For the compound below a add the lone pair electrons b label the hybridization and electron geometry for all nonhydrogen atoms c specify the hybridization of the orbital for each lone pair d What is the chemical formula of this compound Answer References The usual application of mass spectroscopy to organic molecules involves bombardment with a beam of mediumenergy electrons or in high vacuum and analysis of the charged particles and fragments so produced Most mass spectrometers are set up to analyze positively charged fragments although negativeion mass spectrometry also is possible The elements of a mass spectrometer are shown in Figure The positive ions produced by electron impact are accelerated by the negatively charged accelerating plates and sweep down to the curve of the analyzer tube where they are sorted as to their masstocharge ratio by the analyzing magnet With good resolution only the ions of a single mass number will pass through the slit and impinge on the collector even when the mass numbers are in the neighborhood of several thousand The populations of the whole range of mass numbers of interest can be determined by plotting the rate of ion collection as a function of the magnetic field of the analyzing magnet Figure Schematic diagram of a mass spectrometer Mass spectra of propanone butanone and propanal are shown in Figure Each peak represents ions of particular masses formed as the result of fragmentation of the molecule produced by electron impact into and so on The cracking patterns are of course functions of the energy of the bombarding electrons and serve as an extraordinarily individual fingerprint of the particular molecules For instance propanone and propanal are isomers yet their cracking patterns are strikingly different Figure The mass spectra of a butanone b propanal and c propanone These spectra were supplied through the courtesy of Dr D P Stevenson of the Shell Development Company The peak that is highest in mass number is of considerable importance because it corresponds to the parent molecule minus one electron designated as and provides a highly accurate method for measuring molecular weights Incorrect molecular weights will be obtained if the positive ion becomes fragmented before it reaches the collector or if two fragments combine to give a fragment heavier than The peak of is especially weak with alcohols and branchedchain hydrocarbons which readily undergo fragmentation by loss of water or sidechain groups With such compounds the peak corresponding to may be or less of the highest peak in the spectrum which is called the base peak and usually is assigned an arbitrary intensity of The pressure of the sample in the ion source of a mass spectrometer is usually about and under these conditions buildup of fragments to give significant peaks with greater than is rare One exception to this is the formation of peaks resulting from transfer of a hydrogen atom from to The relative intensities of such peaks are usually sensitive to the sample pressure and may be identified in this way With the molecular weight available from the peak with reasonable certainty the next step is to determine the molecular formula If the resolution of the instrument is sufficiently high quite exact masses can be measured which means that ions with values differing by one part in can be distinguished At this resolution it is possible to determine the elemental composition of each ion from its exact value Many mass spectrometers in routine use are incapable of resolving ions with values that differ by less than one mass unit In this event the determination of elemental composition can be determined by the method of isotope abundance We will illustrate this with the following simple example The highest peaks corresponding to in the mass spectrum of an unknown sample have equal to and with relative intensities of What is the elemental composition The abundance ratio is uniquely characteristic of the chlorine isotopes The mass peaks at and are therefore both molecular ions the peak is of an ion containing and the peak is of an ion containing The remaining atoms in the molecule must add up to or mass units There are several possible combinations of and that give mass they are and Of these the combination with that makes the most chemical sense is and the formula of the molecule therefore is chloroethane This example illustrates how values of ions that differ only in isotopic composition can be used to determine elemental compositions The important isotopes for this purpose in addition to those of chlorine are the stable isotopes of natural abundance and As a further example suppose that we have isolated a hydrocarbon and have determine from its mass spectrum that mass units In the absence of any combination reactions there will be an ion corresponding to the same molecular ion but with one ion in place of The intensity ratio will depend on the number of carbon atoms present because the more carbons there are the greater the probability will be that one of them is The greater the probability the larger the ratio For carbons we expect If the measured ratio is then The only hydrocarbon formula with and is Nitrogen and oxygen as also contribute to if present while and two s contribute to The calculated intensities of and relative to as are tabulated in Table for elemental composition of ions up to The table applies to fragment ions as well as molecular ions but the intensity data from fragment ions very often is complicated by overlapping peaks Table Isotopic Contributions for Carbon and other Elements to Intensities of and relative to The next step in the analysis of a mass spectrum is to see what clues as to structure can be obtained from the fragment ions It would be a serious error to imagine that in mass spectra nothing is observed but simple nonspecific fragmentation of organic molecules on electron impact Actually even though electron impact produces highly unstable molecular ions there is a strong tendency for breakdown to occur by reasonable chemical processes and this may involve straightforward fragmentation or rearrangement of atoms from one part of the molecule to another In general fragmentation occurs at the weakest bonds and the most abundant fragments also are the most stable ones For instance hydrocarbons fragment preferentially at branch points partly because the bonds are weaker here than elsewhere along the chain and partly because the ionic fragments are more stable As an example consider dimethylbutane There is no molecular ion evident in its mass spectrum because it cleaves so readily at the quaternary carbon to give the peak corresponding to the most abundant fragment ion This ion is presumably the tertbutyl cation and the alternate cleavage to the less stable ethyl cation with is much less significant An excellent example of a rearrangement with fragmentation is provided by the ion of ethyl butanoate which breaks down to give ethene and the ion of an isomer of ethyl ethanoate called its enol form An interesting and complex rearrangement occurs on electron impact with methylbenzene toluene An intense peak is observed having for but the ion involved appears to be a symmetrical ion rather than a phenylmethyl cation The evidence for this is that the fragmentation patterns found in the mass spectrometry of the ion itself are the same no matter which of the monodeuteriomethylbenzenes is used as starting material This rearrangement occurs because of the high delocalization energy of the symmetrical ion usually called tropylium cation and because its charge is spread out more evenly over the carbons than would be the charge for the phenylmethyl cation see Section B Tabulations of elemental compositions of and for mass values up to are listed in many texts on mass spectrometry Consult these tables to see all possible alternatives See also J H Beynon Mass Spectrometry and its Applications to Organic Chemistry

of Substitution MechanismsB SolvolysisContributors and Attributions Two simple mechanisms can be written for the reaction of chloromethane with hydroxide ion in aqueous solution that differ in the timing of bond breaking relative to bond making In the first mechanism the overall reaction is the result of two steps the first of which involves a slow dissociation of chloromethane to solvated methyl carbocation and solvated chloride ion The second step involves a fast reaction between the carbocation and hydroxide ion or water to yield methanol Mechanism or In the second mechanism the reaction proceeds in a single step Attack of hydroxide ion at carbon occurs simultaneously with the loss of chloride ion that is the carbonoxygen bond is formed as the carbonchlorine bond is broken Mechanism Both of these mechanisms are important in the displacement reactions of alkyl compounds although chloromethane appears to react only by Mechanism Now we will discuss the criteria for distinguishing between the concerted and stepwise mechanisms A Kinetics of Substitution Mechanisms Of the two mechanisms requires that the reaction rate be determined solely by the rate of the first step cf earlier discussion in Section C This means that the rate at which methanol is formed measured in moles per unit volume per unit time will depend on the chloromethane concentration but not on the hydroxide ion concentration because hydroxide ion is not utilized except in a fast secondary reaction In contrast Mechanism requires the rate to depend on the concentrations of both reagents because the slow step involves collisions between hydroxide ions and chloromethane molecules More precisely the reaction rate may be expressed in terms of Equation for Mechanism and Equation for Mechanism Customarily is expressed in moles of product formed per liter of solution per unit of time most frequently in seconds The concentration terms and are then in units of moles per liter and the proportionality constant called the specific rate constant has the units of for Mechanism and for Mechanism It is important to recognize the difference between the order of a reaction with respect to a specific reactant and the overall order of a reaction The order of a reaction with respect to a particular reactant is the power to which the concentration of that reactant must be raised to have direct proportionality between concentration and reaction rate According to Equation the rate of the chloromethanehydroxide ion reaction is first order with respect to chloromethane and first order with respect to hydroxide ion In Equation the rate is first order with respect to chloromethane and zero order with respect to hydroxide ion because The overall order of reaction is the sum of the orders of the respective reactants Thus Equations and express the rates of overall firstorder and secondorder reactions respectively We can use the overall reaction order to distinguish between the two possible mechanisms and Experimentally the rate of formation of methanol is found to be proportional to the concentrations both of chloromethane and of hydroxide ion Therefore the reaction rate is second order overall and is expressed correctly by Equation This means that the mechanism of the reaction is the singlestep process Such reactions generally are classified as bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions often designated for substitution for nucleophilic and for bimolecular because there are two reactant molecules in the transition state To summarize For an reaction rate mechanism The stepwise Mechanism is a unimolecular nucleophilic substitution and accordingly is designated The numeral or used in these designations does not refer to the kinetic order of the reaction but refers to the number of molecules not including solvent molecules that make up the transition state Thus for rate mechanism or B Solvolysis Many reactions are carried out using the solvent as the nucleophilic agent They are called solvolysis reactions and involve solvents such as water ethanol ethanoic acid and methanoic acid Two examples are In these examples solvolysis is necessarily a firstorder reaction because normally the solvent is in such great excess that its concentration does not change appreciably during reaction and hence its contribution to the rate does not change However that the overall rate is first order does not mean the reaction necessarily proceeds by an mechanism particularly in solvents such as water alcohols or amines which are reasonably good nucleophilic agents The solvent can act as the displacing agent in an reaction To distinguish between and mechanisms of solvolysis requires other criteria notably stereochemistry Sections and and the effect of added nucleophiles on the rate and nature of the reaction products For example it often is possible to distinguish between and solvolysis by adding to the reaction mixture a relatively small concentration of a substance that is expected to be a more powerful nucleophile than the solvent If the reaction is strictly the rate at which disappears should remain essentially unchanged because it reacts only as fast as forms and the rate of this step is not changed by addition of the nucleophile even if the nucleophile reacts with However if the reaction is the rate of disappearance of should increase because reacts with the nucleophile in an reaction and now the rate depends on both the nature and the concentration of the nucleophile Many organic chemists and indeed the previous versions of this book use the term carbonium ion for species of this kind However there is wellestablished usage of the onium suffix for ammonium oxonium chloronium and so on to denote positively charged atoms with filled valence shells In the interest of greater uniformity of nomenclature we shall use carbocation for carbon positive ions that have unfilled valence shells electrons Contributors and Attributions

compoundsOptical Activity AnalysisAchiral Diastereomers mesoCompoundsProblemsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to determine whether or not a compound containing two chiral carbon atoms will have a meso form given its Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure or its IUPAC name draw wedgeandbrokenline structures for the enantiomers and meso form of a compound such as tartaric acid given its IUPAC name or its Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure make a general comparison of the physical properties of the enantiomers meso form and racemic mixture of a compound such as tartaric acid Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below meso compound Study Notes You may be confused by the two sets of structures showing rotations Of course in each case the two structures shown are identical they represent the same molecule looked at from two different perspectives In the first case there is a rotation around the single carboncarbon bond In the second the whole molecule is rotated top to bottom Meso Compounds A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers It is superimposed on its mirror image and is optically inactive although it contains two or more stereocenters Introduction In general a meso compound should contain two or more identical substituted stereocenters Also it has an internal symmetry plane that divides the compound in half These two halves reflect each other by the internal mirror The stereochemistry of stereocenters should cancel out What it means here is that when we have an internal plane that splits the compound into two symmetrical sides the stereochemistry of both left and right side should be opposite to each other and therefore result in optically inactive Cyclic compounds may also be meso Identification If A is a meso compound it should have two or more stereocenters an internal plane and the stereochemistry should be R and S Look for an internal plane or internal mirror that lies in between the compound The stereochemistry eg R or S is very crucial in determining whether it is a meso compound or not As mentioned above a meso compound is optically inactive so their stereochemistry should cancel out For instance R cancels S out in a meso compound with two stereocenters transdichloroethanediol mesodibromobutane Tips An interesting thing about single bonds or sporbitals is that we can rotate the substituted groups that attached to a stereocenter around to recognize the internal plane As the molecule is rotated its stereochemistry does not change For example Another case is when we rotate the whole molecule by degree Both molecules below are still meso Remember the internal plane here is depicted on two dimensions However in reality it is three dimensions so be aware of it when we identify the internal mirror Example has a plane of symmetry the horizonatal plane going through the red broken line and therefore is achiral has chiral centers Thus is a meso compound Example This molecules has a plane of symmetry the vertical plane going through the red broken line perpendicular to the plane of the ring and therefore is achiral but has has two chiral centers Thus its is a meso compound Other Examples of meso compounds Meso compounds can exist in many different forms such as pentane butane heptane and even cyclobutane They do not necessarily have to be two stereocenters but can have more Optical Activity Analysis When the optical activity of a meso compound is attempted to be determined with a polarimeter the indicator will not show or It simply means there is no certain direction of rotation of the polarized light neither levorotatory and dexorotatory Achiral Diastereomers mesoCompounds The chiral centers in the preceding examples have all been different In the case of dihydroxybutanedioic acid known as tartaric acid the two chiral centers have the same four substituents and are equivalent As a result two of the four possible stereoisomers of this compound are identical due to a plane of symmetry so there are only three stereoisomeric tartaric acids Two of these stereoisomers are enantiomers and the third is an achiral diastereomer called a meso compound Meso compounds are achiral optically inactive diastereomers of chiral stereoisomers Investigations of isomeric tartaric acid salts carried out by Louis Pasteur in the mid th century were instrumental in elucidating some of the subtleties of stereochemistry Some physical properties of the isomers of tartaric acid are given in the following table tartaric acid αD º mp ºC tartaric acid αD º mp ºC mesotartaric acid αD º mp ºC Fischer projection formulas provide a helpful view of the configurational relationships within the structures of these isomers In the following illustration a mirror line is drawn between formulas that have a mirrorimage relationship In

lowenergy radiation such as is produced by radio transmitters operating in the microwave region suffices to change molecular rotational energies Because electronic and vibrational energy levels are spaced much more widely and because changes between them are induced only by higherenergy radiation microwave absorptions by gaseous substances can be characterized as essentially pure rotational spectra It is possible to obtain rotational moments of inertia from microwave spectra and from these moments to obtain bond angles and bond distances for simple molecules An example of the use of microwave spectra is provided by Figure which shows separate rotational absorptions observed for trans and gauche conformations of propyl iodide cf Section Although microwave spectroscopy being confined to gases is not a routine method in the organic laboratory it is important to us here in setting the stage for the consideration of more complex absorptions that occur with infrared radiation Figure A small part of the microwave spectrum of at a pressure of showing absorptions of the trans and gauche conformations Notice the regular spacings of the lines for each conformation That the spacings are different for the two conformations reflects their different moments of inertia The horizontal scale is gigahertz and corresponds to which from Equation can be calculated to mean a

empirical and molecular formulas from combustion data Molecular formulas tell you how many atoms of each element are in a compound and empirical formulas tell you the simplest or most reduced ratio of elements in a compound If a compounds molecular formula cannot be reduced any more then the empirical formula is the same as the molecular formula Combustion analysis can determine the empirical formula of a compound but cannot determine the molecular formula other techniques can though Once known the molecular formula can be calculated from the empirical formula Empirical Formulas An empirical formula tells us the relative ratios of different atoms in a compound The ratios hold true on the molar level as well Thus HO is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and atom of oxygen Likewise mole of HO is composed of moles of hydrogen and mole of oxygen We can also work backwards from molar ratios since if we know the molar amounts of each element in a compound we can determine the empirical formula Example Mercury Chloride Mercury forms a compound with chlorine that is mercury and chlorine by mass What is the empirical formula Lets say we had a gram sample of this compound The sample would therefore contain grams of mercury and grams of chlorine How many moles of each atom do the individual masses represent For Mercury For Chlorine What is the molar ratio between the two elements Thus we have twice as many moles ie atoms of Cl as Hg The empirical formula would thus be remember to list cation first anion last Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula The chemical formula for a compound obtained by composition analysis is always the empirical formula We can obtain the chemical formula from the empirical formula if we know the molecular weight of the compound The chemical formula will always be some integer multiple of the empirical formula ie integer multiples of the subscripts of the empirical formula The general flow for this approach is shown in Figure and demonstrated in Example Figure The general flow chart for solving empirical formulas from known mass percentages Example Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C ascorbic acid contains C H and O by mass The experimentally determined molecular mass is amu What is the empirical and chemical formula for ascorbic acid Solution Consider an arbitrary amount of grams of ascorbic acid so we would have grams C grams H grams O This would give us how many moles of each element Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen Determine the simplest whole number ratio by dividing by the smallest molar amount moles in this case see oxygen Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen The relative molar amounts of carbon and oxygen appear to be equal but the relative molar amount of hydrogen is higher Since we cannot have fractional atoms in a compound we need to normalize the relative amount of hydrogen to be equal to an integer would appear to be and so if we multiply the relative amounts of each atom by we should be able to get integer values for each atom C H O or CHO This is our empirical formula for ascorbic acid What about the chemical formula We are told that the experimentally determined molecular mass is amu What is the molecular mass of our empirical formula amu The molecular mass from our empirical formula is significantly lower than the experimentally determined value What is the ratio between the two values amu amu Thus it would appear that our empirical formula is essentially one half the mass of the actual molecular mass If we multiplied our empirical formula by then the molecular mass would be correct Thus the actual molecular formula is CHO CHO Combustion Analysis When a compound containing carbon and hydrogen is subject to combustion with oxygen in a special combustion apparatus all the carbon is converted to CO and the hydrogen to HO Figure The amount of carbon produced can be determined by measuring the amount of CO produced This is trapped by the sodium hydroxide and thus we can monitor the mass of CO produced by determining the increase in mass of the CO trap Likewise we can determine the amount of H produced by the amount of HO trapped by the magnesium perchlorate Figure Combustion analysis apparatus One of the most common ways to determine the elemental composition of an unknown hydrocarbon is an analytical procedure called combustion analysis A small carefully weighed sample of an unknown compound that may contain carbon hydrogen nitrogen andor sulfur is burned in an oxygen atmosphereOther elements such as metals can be determined by other methods and the quantities of the resulting gaseous products CO HO N and SO respectively are determined by one of several possible methods One procedure used in combustion analysis is outlined schematically in Figure and a typical combustion analysis is illustrated in Examples and Figure Steps for Obtaining an Empirical Formula from Combustion Analysis Example Combustion of Isopropyl Alcohol What is the empirical formulate for isopropyl alcohol which contains only C H and O if the combustion of a grams isopropyl alcohol sample produces grams of CO and grams of HO Solution From this information quantitate the amount of C and H in the sample Since one mole of CO is made up of one mole of C and two moles of O if we have moles of CO in our sample then we know we have moles of C in the sample How many grams of C is this How about the hydrogen Since one mole of HO is made up of one mole of oxygen and two moles of hydrogen if we have moles of HO then we have moles of hydrogen Since hydrogen is about grammole we must have grams of hydrogen in our original sample When we add our carbon and hydrogen together we get grams C grams H grams But we know we combusted grams of isopropyl alcohol The missing mass must be from the oxygen atoms in the isopropyl alcohol grams grams grams oxygen This much oxygen is how many moles Overall therefore we have moles Carbon moles Hydrogen moles Oxygen Divide by the smallest molar amount

of mothballs is an organic compound that contains carbon and hydrogen only Complete combustion of a mg sample of naphthalene in oxygen yielded mg of CO and mg of HO Determine the empirical formula of naphthalene Given mass of sample and mass of combustion products Asked for empirical formula Strategy Use the masses and molar masses of the combustion products CO and HO to calculate the masses of carbon and hydrogen present in the original sample of naphthalene Use those masses and the molar masses of the elements to calculate the empirical formula of naphthalene Solution A Upon combustion mol of is produced for each mole of carbon atoms in the original sample Similarly mol of HO is produced for every mol of hydrogen atoms present in the sample The masses of carbon and hydrogen in the original sample can be calculated from these ratios the masses of CO and HO and their molar masses Because the units of molar mass are grams per mole we must first convert the masses from milligrams to grams B To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of both elements present we need to calculate the number of moles of each and divide by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount Dividing each number by the number of moles of the element present in the smaller amount gives Thus naphthalene contains a ratio of moles of carbon to moles of hydrogen CH Because the ratios of the elements in the empirical formula must be expressed as small whole numbers multiply both subscripts by which gives CH as the empirical formula of naphthalene In fact the molecular formula of naphthalene is CH which is consistent with our results Exercise Xylene an organic compound that is a major component of many gasoline blends contains carbon and hydrogen only Complete combustion of a

Learning Objective write and interpret molecular orbital MO diagrams Overview Molecular orbital MO theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wavefunctions The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by inphase combinations of atomic wavefunctions and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule Antibonding molecular orbitals result from outofphase combinations and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals Using quantum mechanics the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function Ψ analogous to the behavior in an atom Just like electrons around isolated atoms electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete quantized energies The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital Ψ Like an atomic orbital a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms H or Cl for example Such molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules In these diatomic molecules several types of molecular orbitals occur The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear combination of atomic orbitals LCAO The wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions Combining waves can lead to constructive interference in which peaks line up with peaks or destructive interference in which peaks line up with troughs Figure In orbitals the waves are three dimensional and they combine with inphase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and outofphase waves producing nodes or regions of no electron density Figure a When inphase waves combine constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude b When outofphase waves combine destructive interference produces a wave with less or no amplitude There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms The two types are illustrated in Figure The inphase combination produces a lower energy σs molecular orbital read as sigmas in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei The outofphase addition which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions produces a higher energy molecular orbital read as sigmasstar molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital Electrons in a σs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable of lower energy than they would be in the isolated atoms Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals Electrons in the orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart Hence these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals Electrons fill the lowerenergy bonding orbital before the higherenergy antibonding orbital just as they fill lowerenergy atomic orbitals before they fill higherenergy atomic orbitals Figure Sigma σ and sigmastar σ molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of two s atomic orbitals The plus signs indicate the locations of nuclei In p orbitals the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases analogous to how a twodimensional wave has both parts above and below the average We indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors When orbital lobes of the same phase overlap constructive wave interference increases the electron density When regions of opposite phase overlap the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes When p orbitals overlap end to end they create σ and σ orbitals Figure If two atoms are located along the xaxis in a Cartesian coordinate system the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx bonding and antibonding read as sigmapx and sigmapx star respectively Just as with sorbital overlap the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei which is a higherenergy antibonding orbital Figure Combining wave functions of two p atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis creates two molecular orbitals σp and The sidebyside overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi π bonding molecular orbital and a π antibonding molecular orbital as shown in Figure In valence bond theory we describe π bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals with electron density on either side of the node In molecular orbital theory we describe the π orbital by this same shape and a π bond exists when this orbital contains electrons Electrons in this orbital interact with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together making it a bonding orbital For the outofphase combination there are two nodal planes created one along the internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei Figure Sidebyside overlap of each two p orbitals results in the formation of two π molecular orbitals Combining the outofphase orbitals results in an antibonding molecular orbital with two nodes One contains the internuclear axis and one is perpendicular to the axis Combining the inphase orbitals results in a bonding orbital There is a node blue plane containing the internuclear axis with the two lobes of the orbital located above and below this node In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules each atom also has two sets of p orbitals oriented side by side py and pz so these four atomic orbitals combine pairwise to create two π orbitals and two π orbitals The πpy and orbitals are oriented at right angles to the πpz and orbitals Except for their orientation the πpy and πpz orbitals are identical and have the same energy they are degenerate orbitals The and antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and identical except for their orientation A total of six molecular orbitals results from the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms σpx and πpy and πpz and Example Molecular Orbitals Predict what type if any of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave functions so each pair of orbitals shown overlap The orbitals are all similar in energy Solution This is an inphase combination resulting in a σp orbital This will not result in a new orbital because the inphase component bottom and outofphase component top cancel out Only orbitals with the correct alignment can combine This is an outofphase combination resulting in a orbital Exercise Label the molecular orbital shown as σ or π bonding or antibonding and indicate where the node occurs Answer The orbital is located along the internuclear axis so it is a σ orbital There is a node bisecting the internuclear axis so it is an antibonding orbital Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram Figure For a diatomic molecule the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left and those of the other atom are shown on the right Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine one lowerenergy bonding molecular orbital and one higherenergy antibonding orbital result Thus we can see that combining the six p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals one σ and two π and three antibonding orbitals one σ and two π Figure This is the molecular orbital diagram for the homonuclear diatomic showing the molecular orbitals of the valence shell only The molecular orbitals are filled in the same manner as atomic orbitals using the Aufbau principle and Hunds rule We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals by the Aufbau principle Lowerenergy orbitals fill first electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins Figure Just as we write electron configurations for atoms we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present For clarity we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy In this case each orbital is at a different energy so parentheses separate each orbital Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons such as would have the molecular electron configuration It is common to omit the core electrons from molecular orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence electrons Bond Order The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms Thus a single bond has a bond order of a double bond has a bond order of and a triple bond has a bond order of We define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons but the resulting bond order is usually the same The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails but both methods describe the same phenomenon In the molecular orbital model an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital The bond order is calculated by subtracting the destabilizing antibonding electrons from the stabilizing bonding electrons Since a bond consists of two electrons we divide by two to get the bond order We can determine bond order with the following equation The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases If the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero a stable bond does not form We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders Bonding in Diatomic Molecules A dihydrogen molecule H forms from two hydrogen atoms When the atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine the electrons occupy the molecular orbital of lowest energy the σs bonding orbital A dihydrogen molecule H readily forms because the energy of a H molecule is lower than that of two H atoms The σs orbital that contains both electrons is lower in energy than either of the two s atomic orbitals A molecular orbital can hold two electrons so both electrons in the H molecule are in the σs bonding orbital the electron configuration is We represent this configuration by a molecular orbital energy diagram Figure in which a single upward arrow indicates one electron in an orbital and two upward and downward arrows indicate two electrons of opposite spin Figure The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that H will be a stable molecule with lower energy than the separated atoms A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons so we have Because the bond order for the HH bond is equal to the bond is a single bond A helium atom has two electrons both of which are in its s orbital Two helium atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule He with four electrons because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the lowerenergy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the two electrons in the higherenergy antibonding molecular orbital We would write the hypothetical electron configuration of He as as in Figure The net energy change would be zero so there is no driving force for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule In fact helium exists as discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules The bond order in a hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms Figure The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that He will not be a stable molecule since it has equal numbers of bonding and antibonding Contributors and Attributions

Attributions We have seen examples of molecules with one chiral center that exist in two mirrorimage configurations which we call enantiomers What happens when there is more than one chiral center How many stereoisomers should we expect Consider the stereoisomers of the important amino acid threonine aminohydroxybutanoic acid For this substance if we write all of the possible configurations of its two chiral carbons we have four different projection formulas corresponding to four different stereoisomers You should build a ballandstick model of by the procedure shown in Figure also see Figure and by putting the model over verify that none of these projections have the configurations of both chiral carbons the same as your model of Figure Translation of a projection formula to a ballandstick model and then to a Newman formula The first step is to assemble the model over the projection formula in the same way as shown in Figure except that configurations at each of two atoms are involved Next the model is turned and rotated around the center bond to put the methyl and carboxyl groups anti to one another The Newman formula is then drawn to correspond to the ballandstick model Because each chiral center added to a chain doubles the number of possible configurations we expect eight different stereoisomers with three chiral carbons sixteen with four and so on the simple rule the is possible different stereoisomers for chiral centers As we shall see later this rule has to be modified in some special cases What is the relationship between stereoisomers This will be clearer if we translate each of the projection formulas into a threedimensional representation as shown in Figure You will be helped greatly if you work through the sequence yourself with a ballandstick model Drawn as Newman projections come out as shown in It should be clear and if it isnt ballandstick models will be invaluable that and a are mirror images of one another and that and are similarly mirror images What about other combinations such as and or and If you look at the pairs closely you will find that they are not mirror images and are not identical Such substances related to each other in this way and which can be converted one into the other only by changing the configurations at one or more chiral centers are called diastereomers The difference between enantiomers and diastereomers is more than just geometry Diastereomers have substantially different chemical and physical properties whereas enantiomers have identical physical properties apart from their optical rotations This is illustrated in Table for the threonine stereoisomers The reason for the difference in physical properties between diastereomers can be seen very simply for a substance with two chiral centers by noting that a right shoe on a right foot is a mirror image or has the same physical properties as a left shoe on a left foot but is not a mirror image nor does it have the same physical properties as a left show on a right foot or a right shoe on a left foot A Meso Compounds Achiral Diastereomers All of the threonine stereoisomers are chiral substances that is they are not identical with their mirror images However it is important to recognize that not all diastereomers are chiral To illustrate this point we return to the tartaric acids mentioned previously in connection is Pasteurs discoveries Section C Proceeding as we did for threonine we can write four projection formulas for tartaric acid dihydroxybutanedioic acid as shown by These projection formulas can be translated into the respective Newman representations We highly recommend that you verify this by the procedure of Figure There are two pairs of mirror images and as well as and However what will not be so immediately clear but what you must verify for yourself is that and are in fact identical This means that and are representations of a single achiral substance identical with its mirror image Substances that have chiral centers but are themselves achiral are called meso compounds The condition that makes possible the existence of meso compounds is an appropriate degree of molecular symmetry There are several kinds of such molecular symmetry In the case of projection formulas or there is a plane of symmetry which means that a plane can be placed through the molecule such that one half of the molecule is a mirror image of the other half The mirror plane for mesotartaric acid can be seen easily from its projection formulas and These two formulas are superimposable if one is rotated in the plane of the paper The Newman representations and of mesotartaric acid does not have a mirror plane Why is it different from the Fischer projections in this respect The reason is that the projection formulas represent a particular eclipsed conformation of mesotartaric acid that does have a mirror plane Therefore if you are confronted with a particular sawhorse or Newman formula and you have to decide whether it represents a meso compound the best procedure is to make a ballandstick model of the conformation and then rotate around the bonds to see if it can be brought into a conformation staggered or eclipsed that has a plane of symmetry such as or is identical with its mirror image As expected from our previous discussions diastereomers of tartaric acid have different physical properties Table If you find yourself confused about the and meso forms of tartaric acid a simple analogy may help keep matters straight Consider three sets of shoes A right shoe beside a left shoe is a meso combination with a plane of symmetry A left shoe next to a left shoe is not identical with but is the mirror image of a right shoe next to a right shoe None of the three combinations are identical Each right or left shoe corresponds to a right or left configuration of a tartaric acid carbon so the three sets correspond to meso and tartaric acid respectively There is another symmetry test for meso configurations that is applicable to staggered conformations and can be illustrated with the tartaric acids If you make models of and you will find that they are mirror images and identical but as we have said they have no plane of symmetry In this conformation the molecules do have a center of symmetry Thus a line drawn at any angle through the midpoint of the central bond of or has an identical environment on each side of the midpoint Another way of putting it is that each half of the molecule is the photographic image ie reverse of the other half For a molecule with chiral centers if its projection formula has a plane of symmetry or if we can find a rotational conformation with either a plane or center of symmetry then it will be meso and achiral The idea that for every chiral centers there can be different configurations will be true only if none of the configurations has sufficient symmetry to be identical with its mirror image For every meso form there will be one less pair of enantiomers and one less total number of possible configurations than is theoretically possible according to the number of chiral centers At most one meso compounds is possible for structures with four chiral centers An example is offered by the meso forms of tetrahydroxyhexanedioic acid which with four chiral atoms have configurations and The same information can be obtained from projection formulas You can see that projections and are mirror images and that or can not be superimposed on However in some situations confusion can result in making such comparisons and it is important to be able to translate the projection formulas into ballandstick models or perspective drawings Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio

AlkanesExercises ExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to provide the correct IUPAC name for any given alkane structure Kekulé condensed or shorthand draw the Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure of an alkane given its IUPAC name Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below IUPAC system Study Notes The IUPAC system of nomenclature aims to ensure that every organic compound has a unique unambiguous name that the IUPAC name of any compound conveys the structure of that compound to a person familiar with the system One way of checking whether the name you have given to an alkane is reasonable is to count the number of carbon atoms implied by the chosen name For example if you named a compound ethylmethylheptane you have indicated that the compound contains a total of carbon atomsseven carbon atoms in the main chain two carbon atoms in an ethyl group and one carbon atom in a methyl group If you were to check the given structure and find carbon atoms you would know that you had made a mistake Perhaps the name you should have written was ethyldimethylheptane When naming alkanes a common error of beginning students is a failure to pick out the longest carbon chain For example the correct name for the compound shown below is methylheptane not ethylhexane Remember that every substituent must have a number and do not forget the prefixes di tri tetra etc You must use commas to separate numbers and hyphens to separate numbers and substituents Notice that methylhexane is one word Hydrocarbons having no double or triple bond functional groups are classified as alkanes or cycloalkanes depending on whether the carbon atoms of the molecule are arranged only in chains or also in rings Although these hydrocarbons have no functional groups they constitute the framework on which functional groups are located in other classes of compounds and provide an ideal starting point for studying and naming organic compounds The alkanes and cycloalkanes are also members of a larger class of compounds referred to as aliphatic Simply put aliphatic compounds are compounds that do not incorporate any aromatic rings in their molecular structure The following table lists the IUPAC names assigned to simple continuouschain alkanes from C to C A common ane suffix identifies these compounds as alkanes Longer chain alkanes are well known and their names may be found in many reference and text books The names methane through decane should be memorized since they constitute the root of many IUPAC names Fortunately common numerical prefixes are used in naming chains of five or more carbon atoms Table Simple Unbranched Alkanes Name Molecular Formula Structural Formula Isomers Name Molecular Formula Structural Formula Isomers methane CH CH hexane CH CHCHCH ethane CH CHCH heptane CH CHCHCH propane CH CHCHCH octane CH CHCHCH butane CH CHCHCHCH nonane CH CHCHCH pentane CH CHCHCH decane CH CHCHCH Some important behavior trends and terminologies The formulas and structures of these alkanes increase uniformly by a CH increment A uniform variation of this kind in a series of compounds is called homologous These formulas all fit the CnHn rule This is also the highest possible HC ratio for a stable hydrocarbon Since the HC ratio in these compounds is at a maximum we call them saturated with hydrogen Beginning with butane CH and becoming more numerous with larger alkanes we note the existence of alkane isomers For example there are five CH isomers shown below as abbreviated line formulas A through E Although these distinct compounds all have the same molecular formula only one A can be called hexane How then are we to name the others The IUPAC system requires first that we have names for simple unbranched chains as noted above and second that we have names for simple alkyl groups that may be attached to the chains Examples of some common alkyl groups are given in the following table Note that the ane suffix is replaced by yl in naming groups The symbol R is used to designate a generic unspecified alkyl group Table Alkyl Groups Names Group CH CH CHCHCH CHCH CHCHCHCH CHCHCH CHCHCHCH CHC R Name Methyl Ethyl Propyl Isopropyl Butyl Isobutyl secButyl tertButyl Alkyl IUPAC Rules for Alkane Nomenclature Find and name the longest continuous carbon chain Identify and name groups attached to this chain Number the chain consecutively starting at the end nearest a substituent group Designate the location of each substituent group by an appropriate number and name Assemble the name listing groups in alphabetical order The prefixes di tri tetra etc used to designate several groups of the same kind are not considered when alphabetizing Example Alkanes The IUPAC names of the isomers of hexane are A hexane B methylpentane C methylpentane D dimethylbutane E dimethylbutane Alkyl Groups Halogen substituents are easily accommodated using the names fluoro F chloro Cl bromo Br and iodo I Example Halogen Substitution For example CHCHCHCHBr would be named bromomethylbutane If the halogen is bonded to a simple alkyl group an alternative alkyl halide name may be used Thus CHCl may be named chloroethane no locator number is needed for a two carbon chain or ethyl chloride Alkyl Groups Alkanes can be described by the general formula CnHn An alkyl group is formed by removing one hydrogen from the alkane chain and is described by the formula CnHn The removal of this hydrogen results in a stem change from ane to yl Take a look at the following examples The same concept can be applied to any of the straight chain alkane names provided in the table above Name Molecular Formula Condensed Structural Formula Methane CH CH Ethane CH CHCH Propane CH CHCHCH

Pentadecane CH CHCHCH Hexadecane CH CHCHCH Heptadecane CH CHCHCH Octadecane CH CHCHCH Nonadecane CH CHCHCH Eicosane CH CHCHCH Three Rules for Naming Alkanes Choose the longest most substituted carbon chain containing a functional group A carbon bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number If there are no functional groups then any substituent present must have the lowest possible number Take the alphabetical order into consideration that is after applying the first two rules given above make sure that your substituents andor functional groups are written in alphabetical order Example What is the name of the follow molecule Solution Rule Choose the longest most substituted carbon chain containing a functional group This example does not contain any functional groups so we only need to be concerned with choosing the longest most substituted carbon chain The longest carbon chain has been highlighted in red and consists of eight carbons Rule Carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number If there are no functional groups then any substitute present must have the lowest possible number Because this example does not contain any functional groups we only need to be concerned with the two substitutes present that is the two methyl groups If we begin numbering the chain from the left the methyls would be assigned the numbers and respectively If we begin numbering the chain from the right the methyls would be assigned the numbers and Therefore to satisfy the second rule numbering begins on the right side of the carbon chain as shown below This gives the methyl groups the lowest possible numbering Rule In this example there is no need to utilize the third rule Because the two substitutes are identical neither takes alphabetical precedence with respect to numbering the carbons This concept will become clearer in the following examples The name of this molecule is dimethyloctane Example What is the name of the follow molecule Solution Rule Choose the longest most substituted carbon chain containing a functional group This example contains two functional groups bromine and chlorine The longest carbon chain has been highlighted in red and consists of seven carbons Rule Carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number If there are no functional groups then any substituent present must have the lowest possible number In this example numbering the chain from either the left or the right would satisfy this rule If we number the chain from the left bromine and chlorine would be assigned the second and sixth carbon positions respectively If we number the chain from the right chlorine would be assigned the second position and bromine would be assigned the sixth position In other words whether we choose to number from the left or right the functional groups occupy the second and sixth positions in the chain To select the correct numbering scheme we need to utilize the third rule Rule After applying the first two rules take the alphabetical order into consideration Alphabetically bromine comes before chlorine Therefore bromine is assigned the second carbon position and chlorine is assigned the sixth carbon position The name of this molecule is bromochloroheptane Example What is the name of the follow molecule Solution Rule Choose the longest most substituted carbon chain containing a functional group This example contains two functional groups bromine and chlorine and one substitute the methyl group The longest carbon chain has been highlighted in red and consists of seven carbons Rule Carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number After taking functional groups into consideration any substitutes present must have the lowest possible carbon number This particular example illustrates the point of difference principle If we number the chain from the left bromine the methyl group and chlorine would occupy the second fifth and sixth positions respectively This concept is illustrated in the second drawing below If we number the chain from the right chlorine the methyl group and bromine would occupy the second third and sixth positions respectively which is illustrated in the first drawing below The position of the methyl therefore becomes a point of difference In the first drawing the methyl occupies the third position In the second drawing the methyl occupies the fifth position To satisfy the second rule we want to choose the numbering scheme that provides the lowest possible numbering of this substitute Therefore the first of the two carbon chains shown below is correct Therefore the first numbering scheme is the appropriate one to use Once you have determined the correct numbering of the carbons it is often useful to make a list including the functional groups substitutes and the name of the parent chain Rule After applying the first two rules take the alphabetical order into consideration Alphabetically bromine comes before chlorine Therefore bromine is assigned the second carbon position and chlorine is assigned the sixth carbon position Parent chain heptane Substitutents chloro methyl bromo The name of this molecule is bromochloromethylheptane Exercises Exercises Questions Q Are the following structures properly named and if they are not

therefore you need not usually memorize a large number of trivial names However you will encounter some trivial names so frequently in books and articles that they soon become familiar An alkene that can exhibit geometric isomerism has not been properly named unless its name specifies whether the double bond or bonds is or are cis or trans The most effective way of giving this information is discussed and more details of cis and trans follow in Section Alkenes contain carboncarbon double bonds and are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the molecular formula is CnHn this is also the same molecular formula as cycloalkanes Alkenes are named by dropping the ane ending of the parent and adding ene Introduction The parent structure is the longest chain containing both carbon atoms of the double bond The two carbon atoms of a double bond and the four atoms attached to them lie in a plane with bond angles of approximately A double bond consists of one sigma bond formed by overlap of sp hybrid orbitals and one pi bond formed by overlap of parallel p atomic orbitals The Basic Rules For straight chain alkenes it is the same basic rules as nomenclature of alkanes except change the suffix to ene Find the Longest Carbon Chain that Contains the Carbon Carbon double bond If you have two ties for longest Carbon chain and both chains contain a Carbon Carbon double bond then identify the most substituted chain Give the lowest possible number to the Carbon Carbon double bond Do not need to number cycloalkenes because it is understood that the double bond is in the one position Alkenes that have the same molecular formula but the location of the doble bonds are different means they are constitutional isomers Functional Groups with higher priority Add substituents and their position to the alkene as prefixes Of course remember to give the lowest numbers possible Remember to name them in alphabetical order when writting them Next is identifying stereoisomers when there are only two non hydrogen attachments to the alkene then use cis and trans to name the molecule In this diagram this is a cis conformation It has both the substituents going upward This molecule would be called cis chloroheptene Trans would look like this v On the other hand if there are or nonhydrogen different atoms attached to the alkene then use the E Z system E entgegen means the higher priority groups are opposite one another relative to the double bond Z zusammen means the higher priority groups are on the same side relative to the double bond You could think of Z as Zame Zide to help memorize it In this example it is Echloroheptene It is E because the Chlorine and the CHCH are the two higher priorities and they are on opposite sides vi A hydroxyl group gets precedence over th double bond Therefore alkenes containing alchol groups are called alkenols And the prefix becomes enol And this means that now the alcohol gets lowest priority over the alkene vii Lastly remember that

and exocyclic double bonds have only one carbon as part of the ring Cyclopentene is an example of an endocyclic double bond Methylenecylopentane is an example of an exocyclic double bond Name the following compounds methylcyclobutene The methyl group places the double bond It is correct to also name this compound as methylcyclobutene ethenylcyclohexene the methyl group places the double bond It is correct to also name this compound as ethenylcyclohexene A common name would be vinylcyclohexene Try to draw structures for the following compounds vinylcyclohexadiene Examples Both these compounds have double bonds making them alkenes In example the longest chain consists of six carbons so the root name of this compound will be hexene Three methyl substituents colored red are present Numbering the sixcarbon chain begins at the end nearest the double bond the left end so the methyl groups are located on carbons The IUPAC name is therefore trimethylhexene In example the longest chain incorporating both carbon atoms of the double bond has a length of five There is a sevencarbon chain but it contains only one of the double bond carbon atoms Consequently the root name of this compound will be pentene There is a propyl substituent on the inside double bond carbon atom so the IUPAC name is propylpentene The double bond in example is located in the center of a sixcarbon chain The double bond would therefore have a locator number of regardless of the end chosen to begin numbering The right hand end is selected because it gives the lowest firstsubstituent number for the methyl as compared with for the ethyl if numbering were started from the left The IUPAC name is assigned as shown Example is a diene two double bonds Both double bonds must be contained in the longest chain which is therefore five rather than sixcarbons in length The second and fourth carbons of this pentadiene are both substituted so the numbering begins at the end nearest the alphabetically firstcited substituent the ethyl group These examples include rings of carbon atoms as well as some carboncarbon triple bonds Example is best named as an alkyne bearing a cyclobutyl substituent Example is simply a tenmembered ring containing both a double and a triple bond The double bond is cited first in the IUPAC name so numbering begins with those two carbons in the direction that gives the triple bond carbons the lowest locator numbers Because of the linear geometry of a triple bond aten membered ring is the smallest ring in which this functional group is easily accommodated Example is a cyclooctatriene three double bonds in an eightmembered ring The numbering must begin with one of the end carbons of the conjugated diene moiety adjacent double bonds because in this way the double bond carbon atoms are assigned the smallest possible locator numbers Of the two ways in which this can be done we choose the one that gives the vinyl substituent the lower number Outside links

IUPAC system of nomenclature Study Notes Simple alkynes are named by the same rules that are used for alkenes see Section except that the ending is yne instead of ene Alkynes cannot exhibit EZ

two three and four substituents respectively These prefixes are not taken into account in the alphabetical order For example triiododimethylnonyne If there is an alcohol present in the molecule number the longest chain starting at the end closest to it and follow the same rules However the suffix would be ynol because the alcohol group takes priority over the triple bond methyloctynol When there are two triple bonds in the molecule find the longest carbon chain including both the triple bonds Number the longest chain starting at the end closest to the triple bond that appears first The suffix that would be used to name this molecule would be diyne For example methyloctadiyne Rule Substituents containing a triple bond are called alkynyl For example chloroethynylbromocyclohexane Here is a

the Kekulé shorthand or condensed structure for a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkane given its IUPAC name Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below cycloalkane Study Notes Provided that you have mastered the IUPAC system for naming alkanes you should find that the nomenclature of cycloalkanes does not present any particular difficulties Many organic compounds found in nature contain rings of carbon atoms These compounds are known as cycloalkanes Cycloalkanes only contain carbonhydrogen bonds and carboncarbon single bonds The simplest examples of this class consist of a single unsubstituted carbon ring and these form a homologous series similar to the unbranched alkanes Like alkanes cycloalkane molecules are often drawn as skeletal structures in which each intersection between two lines is assumed to have a carbon atom with its corresponding number of hydrogens Cyclohexane one of the most common cycloalkanes is shown below as an example same as same as Cyclic hydrocarbons have the prefix cyclo The IUPAC names molecular formulas and skeleton structures of the cycloalkanes with to carbons are given in Table Note that the general formula for a cycloalkane composed of n carbons is CnHn and not CnHn as for alkanes Although a cycloalkane has two fewer hydrogens than the equivalent alkane each carbon is bonded to four other atoms so are still considered to be saturated with hydrogen Table Examples of Simple Cycloalkanes Cycloalkane Molecular Formula Skeleton Structure Cyclopropane CH Cyclobutane CH Cyclopentane CH Cyclohexane CH Cycloheptane CH Cyclooctane CH Cyclononane CH Cyclodecane CH IUPAC Rules for Nomenclature The naming of substituted cycloalkanes follows the same basic steps used in naming alkanes Determine the parent chain Number the substituents of the ring so that the sum of the numbers is the lowest possible Name the substituents and place them in alphabetical order More specific rules for naming substituted cycloalkanes with examples are given below Determine the cycloalkane to use as the parent If there is an alkyl straight chain that has a greater number of carbons than the cycloalkane then the alkyl chain must be used as the primary parent chain Cycloalkanes substituents have an ending yl If there are two cycloalkanes in the molecule use the cycloalkane with the higher number of carbons as the parent Example The longest straight chain contains carbons compared with cyclopropane which only contains carbons The parent chain in this molecule is decane and cyclopropane is a substituent The name of this molecule is cyclopropylmethyldecane Example Name the cycloalkane structure Solution There are two different cycloalkanes in this molecule Because it contains more carbons the cyclopentane ring will be named as the parent chain The smaller ring cyclobutane is named as a substituent on the parent chain The name of this molecule is cyclobutylcyclopentane When there is only one substituent on the ring the ring carbon attached to the substituent is automatically carbon Indicating the number of the carbon with the substituent in the name is optional Example chlorocyclobutane or cholorocyclobutane propylcyclohexane or propylcyclohexane If there are multiple substituents on the ring number the carbons of the cycloalkane so that the carbons with substituents have the lowest possible number A carbon with multiple substituents should have a lower number than a carbon with only one substituent or functional group One way to make sure that the lowest number possible is assigned is to number the carbons so that when the numbers corresponding to the substituents are added their sum is the lowest possible When naming the cycloalkane the substituents must be placed in alphabetical order Remember the prefixes di tri etc are not used for alphabetization Example NOT In this example the ethyl or the methyl subsistent could be attached to carbon one The ethyl group attachment is assigned carbon because ethyl comes before methyl alphabetically After assigning carbon the cyclohexane ring can be numbered going clockwise or counterclockwise When looking at the numbers produced going clockwise produces lower substituents numbers than when numbered counterclockwise Example Name the following structure using IUPAC rules Solution Remember when dealing with cycloalkanes with more than two substituents finding the lowest possible substituent numbering takes prescient Consider a numbering system with each substituent attachment point as being carbon one Compare them and whichever produces the lowest numbering will be correct Because there are three substituents there are three possible numbering systems The one shown to the left allows for a distinctly lower numbering system Note that alphabetical prioritizing was not used to make this assement The correct name for the molecule is Bromodimethylcyclohesane Example bromochloromethylcyclopentane Notice that b of bromo alphabetically precedes the m of methyl Also notice that the chlorine attachment point is assigned carbon because it comes first alphabetically and the overall sum of numbers would be the same if the methyl attachment carbon was assigned as and the chlorine attachment as Example bromodimethylcyclohexane Although di alphabetically precedes f di is not used in determining the alphabetical order Example fluorodimethylcyclohexane NOT dimethylfluorocyclohexane also fluorodimethylcyclohexane NOT fluorodimethylcyclohexane Although di alphabetically precedes f di is not used in determining the alphabetical order of the substitutents Notice that the attachment point of the two methyl groups is assigned carbon despite the fact that fluorine comes first alphabetically This is because this assignment allows for a lower overall numbering of substituents so assigning alphabetical priority is not necessary Hydrocarbons having more than one ring are common and are referred to as bicyclic two rings tricyclic three rings and in general polycyclic compounds The molecular formulas of such compounds have HC ratios that decrease with the number of rings In general for a hydrocarbon composed of n carbon atoms associated with m rings the formula is CnHn m The structural relationship of rings in a polycyclic compound can vary They may be separate and independent or they may share one or two common atoms Some examples of these possible arrangements are shown in the following table Table Examples of Isomeric CH Bicycloalkanes Isolated Rings Spiro Rings Fused Rings Bridged Rings No common atoms One common atom One common bond Two common atoms Polycyclic compounds like cholesterol shown below

ForcesHydrogen BondsSummaryKey TakeawayProblemsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to identify the various intermolecular forces that may be at play in a given organic compound describe how intermolecular forces influence the physical properties dimensional shape and structure of compounds Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below dipoledipole forces London dispersion forces hydrogen bond intermolecular forces noncovalent interaction van der Waals forces Study Notes Much of the material in this section should be familiar to you from your prerequisite general chemistry course Nonetheless this section is important as it covers some of the fundamental factors that influence many physical and chemical properties Introduction The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids In contrast to intramolecular forces such as the covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules and polyatomic ions intermolecular forces hold molecules together in a liquid or solid Intermolecular forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds For example it requires kJ to overcome the intramolecular forces and break both OH bonds in mol of water but it takes only about kJ to overcome the intermolecular attractions and convert mol of liquid water to water vapor at C Despite this seemingly low value the intermolecular forces in liquid water are among the strongest such forces known Given the large difference in the strengths of intra and intermolecular forces changes between the solid liquid and gaseous states almost invariably occur for molecular substances without breaking covalent bonds Note The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids Intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the boiling points of liquids Liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid Similarly solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature that is they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species Like covalent and ionic bonds intermolecular interactions are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components Because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids where the molecules are close together These interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law In this section we explicitly consider three kinds of intermolecular interactions dipoledipole forces dispersion forces and hydrogen bonds These intermolecular interactions are also called van der Waals forces or noncovalent interactions There are two additional types of electrostatic interaction that you are already familiar with the ionion interactions that are responsible for ionic bonding and the iondipole interactions that occur when ionic substances dissolve in a polar substance such as water These are less common with organic molecules so will not be described further in this section DipoleDipole Interactions Polar covalent bonds behave as if the bonded atoms have localized fractional charges that are equal but opposite ie the two bonded atoms generate a dipole If the structure of a molecule is such that the individual bond dipoles do not cancel one another then the molecule has a net dipole moment Molecules with net dipole moments tend to align themselves so that the positive end of one dipole is near the negative end of another and vice versa as shown in Figure parts a and b Arrangements in which two positive or two negative ends are adjacent parts c and d in Figure are higher energy as the similar charges would repel one another Hence dipoledipole interactions such as those in parts a and b in Figure are attractive intermolecular interactions whereas those in part c and d are repulsive intermolecular interactions Figure Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions a and b Molecular orientations in which the positive end of one dipole δ is near the negative end of another δ and vice versa produce attractive interactions c and d Molecular orientations that juxtapose the positive or negative ends of the dipoles on adjacent molecules produce repulsive interactions Because molecules in a liquid move freely and continuously molecules always experience both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions simultaneously as shown in Figure On average however the attractive interactions dominate Figure Both Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions Occur in a Liquid Sample with Many Molecules Chloromethane is an example of a polar molecule An electrostatic potential map shows a high electron density seen in red around the electronegative chlorine giving it a partial negative charge The other end of the molecule has electron density pulled away from it giving it a partial positive charge seen in blue The positive and negative ends of different chloromethane molecules are attracted to one another through this electrostatic interaction Because each end of a dipole possesses only a fraction of the charge of an electron dipoledipole interactions are substantially weaker than the interactions between two ions each of which has a charge of at least or between a dipole and an ion in which one of the species has at least a full positive or negative charge In addition the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do ionion interactions Recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r where r is the distance between the ions Doubling the distance r r decreases the attractive energy by onehalf In contrast the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to r so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction by or fold Thus a substance such as HCl which is partially held together by dipoledipole interactions is a gas at room temperature and atm pressure whereas NaCl which is held together by ionic interactions is a highmeltingpoint solid Within a series of compounds of similar molar mass the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases as shown in Table Using what we learned about predicting relative bond polarities from the electronegativities of the bonded atoms we can make educated guesses about the relative boiling points of similar molecules Table Relationships between the Dipole Moment and the Boiling Point for Organic Compounds of Similar Molar Mass Compound Molar Mass gmol Dipole Moment D Boiling Point K CH cyclopropane CHOCH dimethyl ether CHCN acetonitrile Note The attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r whereas the attractive energy between two dipoles is proportional to r Example Arrange ethyl methyl ether CHOCHCH methylpropane isobutane CHCHCH and acetone CHCOCH in order of increasing boiling points Their structures are as follows Strategy Compare the molar masses and the polarities of the compounds Compounds with higher molar masses and that are polar will have the highest boiling points Solution The three compounds have essentially the same molar mass gmol so we must look at differences in polarity to predict the strength of the intermolecular dipoledipole interactions and thus the boiling points of the compounds The first compound methylpropane contains only CH bonds which are not very polar because C and H have similar electronegativity values It should therefore have a very small but nonzero dipole moment and a very low boiling point Ethyl methyl ether has a structure similar to HO it contains two polar CO single bonds oriented at about a angle to each other in addition to relatively nonpolar CH bonds As a result the CO bond dipoles partially reinforce one another and generate a significant dipole moment that should give a moderately high boiling point Acetone contains a polar CO double bond oriented at about to two methyl groups with nonpolar CH bonds The CO bond dipole therefore corresponds to the molecular dipole which should result in both a rather large dipole moment and a high boiling point Thus we predict the following order of boiling points methylpropane ethyl methyl ether acetone This result is in good agreement with the actual data methylpropane boiling point C and the dipole moment μ D methyl ethyl ether boiling point C and μ D acetone boiling point C and μ D Exercise Arrange carbon tetrafluoride CF ethyl methyl sulfide CHSCH dimethyl sulfoxide CHSO and methylbutane isopentane CHCHCHCH in order of decreasing boiling points Answer dimethyl sulfoxide boiling point C ethyl methyl sulfide boiling point C methylbutane boiling point C carbon tetrafluoride boiling point C London Dispersion Forces Thus far we have considered only interactions between polar molecules but other factors must be considered to explain why many nonpolar molecules such as bromine benzene and hexane are liquids at room temperature and others such as iodine and naphthalene are solids Even the noble gases can be liquefied or solidified at low temperatures high pressures or both What kind of attractive forces can exist between nonpolar molecules or atoms This question was answered by Fritz London a German physicist who later worked in the United States In London proposed that temporary fluctuations in the electron distributions within atoms and nonpolar molecules could result in the formation of shortlived instantaneous dipole moments which produce attractive forces called London dispersion forces between otherwise nonpolar substances Table Normal Melting and Boiling Points of Some Elements and Nonpolar Compounds Substance Molar Mass gmol Melting Point C Boiling Point C Ar Xe N O F I CH Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms for example On average the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed around the nucleus Because the electrons are in constant motion however their distribution in one atom is likely to be asymmetrical at any given instant resulting in an instantaneous dipole moment As shown in part a in Figure the instantaneous dipole moment on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom pulling them toward the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end The net effect is that the first atom causes the temporary formation of a dipole called an induced dipole in the second Interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another These attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance London was able to show with quantum mechanics that the attractive energy between molecules due to temporary dipoleinduced dipole interactions falls off as r Doubling the distance therefore decreases the attractive energy by or fold Figure Instantaneous Dipole Moments The formation of an instantaneous dipole moment on one He atom a or an H molecule b results in the formation of an induced dipole on an adjacent atom or molecule Instantaneous dipoleinduced dipole interactions between nonpolar molecules can produce intermolecular attractions just as they produce interatomic attractions in monatomic substances like Xe This effect illustrated for two H molecules in part b in Figure tends to become more pronounced as atomic and molecular masses increase Table For example Xe boils at C whereas He boils at C The reason for this trend is that the strength of London dispersion forces is related to the ease with which the electron distribution in a given atom can be perturbed In small atoms such as He the two s electrons are held close to the nucleus in a very small volume and electronelectron repulsions are strong enough to prevent significant asymmetry in their distribution In larger atoms such as Xe however the outer electrons are much less strongly attracted to the nucleus because of filled intervening shells As a result it is relatively easy to temporarily deform the electron distribution to generate an instantaneous or induced dipole The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule is called its polarizability Because the electron distribution is more easily perturbed in large heavy species than in small light species we say that heavier substances tend to be much more polarizable than lighter ones Note For similar substances London dispersion forces get stronger with increasing molecular size The polarizability of a substance also determines how it interacts with ions and species that possess permanent dipoles Thus London dispersion forces are responsible for the general trend toward higher boiling points with increased molecular mass and greater surface area in a homologous series of compounds such as the alkanes part a in Figure The strengths of London dispersion forces also depend significantly on molecular shape because shape determines how much of one molecule can interact with its neighboring molecules at any given time For example part b in Figure shows dimethylpropane neopentane and npentane both of which have the empirical formula CH Neopentane is almost spherical with a small surface area for intermolecular interactions whereas npentane has an extended conformation that enables it to come into close contact with other npentane molecules As a result the boiling point of neopentane C is more than C lower than the boiling point of npentane C Figure Mass and Surface Area Affect the Strength of London Dispersion Forces a In this series of four simple alkanes larger molecules have stronger London forces between them than smaller molecules and consequently higher boiling points b Linear npentane molecules have a larger surface area and stronger intermolecular forces than spherical neopentane molecules As a result neopentane is a gas at room temperature whereas npentane is a volatile liquid All molecules whether polar or nonpolar are attracted to one another by London dispersion forces in addition to any other attractive forces that may be present In general however dipoledipole interactions in small polar molecules are significantly stronger than London dispersion forces so the former predominate Example Arrange nbutane propane methylpropane isobutane and npentane in order of increasing boiling points Strategy Determine the intermolecular forces in the compounds and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution The four compounds are alkanes and nonpolar so London dispersion forces are the only important intermolecular forces These forces are generally stronger with increasing molecular mass so propane should have the lowest boiling point and npentane should have the highest with the two butane isomers falling in between Of the two butane isomers methylpropane is more compact and nbutane has the more extended shape Consequently we expect intermolecular interactions for nbutane to be stronger due to its larger surface area resulting in a higher boiling point The overall order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses propane C methylpropane C nbutane C npentane C Exercise Arrange GeH SiCl SiH CH and GeCl in order of decreasing boiling points Answer GeCl C SiCl C GeH C SiH C CH C Hydrogen Bonds Molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms such as O N and F and to a much lesser extent Cl and S tend to exhibit unusually strong intermolecular interactions These result in much higher boiling points than are observed for substances in which London dispersion forces dominate as illustrated for the covalent hydrides of elements of groups in Figure Methane and its heavier congeners in group form a series whose boiling points increase smoothly with increasing molar mass This is the expected trend in nonpolar molecules for which London dispersion forces are the exclusive intermolecular forces In contrast the hydrides of the lightest members of groups have boiling points that are more than C greater than predicted on the basis of their molar masses The effect is most dramatic for water if we extend the straight line connecting the points for HTe and HSe to the line for period we obtain an estimated boiling point of C for water Imagine the implications for life on Earth if water boiled at C rather than C Figure The Effects of Hydrogen Bonding on Boiling Points These plots of the boiling points of the covalent hydrides of the elements of groups show that the boiling points of the lightest members of each series for which hydrogen bonding is possible HF NH and HO are anomalously high for compounds with such low molecular masses Why do strong intermolecular forces produce such anomalously high boiling points and other unusual properties such as high enthalpies of vaporization and high melting points The answer lies in the highly polar nature of the bonds between hydrogen and very electronegative elements such as O N and F The large difference in electronegativity results in a large partial positive charge on hydrogen and a correspondingly large partial negative charge on the O N or F atom Consequently HO HN and HF bonds have very large bond dipoles that can interact strongly with one another Because a hydrogen atom is so small these dipoles can also approach one another more closely than most other dipoles The combination of large bond dipoles and short dipoledipole distances results in very strong dipoledipole interactions called hydrogen bonds as shown for ice in Figure A hydrogen bond is usually indicated by a dotted line between the hydrogen atom attached to O N or F the hydrogen bond donor and the atom that has the lone pair of electrons the hydrogen bond acceptor Because each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs a tetrahedral arrangement maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed In the structure of ice each oxygen atom is surrounded by a distorted tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms that form bridges to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules The bridging hydrogen atoms are not equidistant from the two oxygen atoms they connect however Instead each hydrogen atom is pm from one oxygen and pm from the other In contrast each oxygen atom is bonded to two H atoms at the shorter distance and two at the longer distance corresponding to two OH covalent bonds and two OH hydrogen bonds from adjacent water molecules respectively The resulting open cagelike structure of ice means that the solid is actually slightly less dense than the liquid which explains why ice floats on water rather than sinks Figure The HydrogenBonded Structure of Ice Each water molecule accepts two hydrogen bonds from two other water molecules and donates two hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bonds with two more water molecules producing an open cagelike structure The structure of liquid water is very similar but in the liquid the hydrogen bonds are continually broken and formed because of rapid molecular motion Note Hydrogen bond formation requires both a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor Because ice is less dense than liquid water rivers lakes and oceans freeze from the top down In fact the ice forms a protective surface layer that insulates the rest of the water allowing fish and other organisms to survive in the lower levels of a frozen lake or sea If ice were denser than the liquid the ice formed at the surface in cold weather would sink as fast as it formed Bodies of water would freeze from the bottom up which would be lethal for most aquatic creatures The expansion of water when freezing also explains why automobile or boat engines must be protected by antifreeze and why unprotected pipes in houses break if they are allowed to freeze Although hydrogen bonds are significantly weaker than covalent bonds with typical dissociation energies of only kJmol they have a significant influence on the physical properties of a compound Compounds such as HF can form only two hydrogen bonds at a time as can on average pure liquid NH Consequently even though their molecular masses are similar to that of water their boiling points are significantly lower than the boiling point of water which forms four hydrogen bonds at a time Example Considering CHOH CH Xe and CHN which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Strategy Identify the compounds with a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F These are likely to be able to act as hydrogen bond donors Of the compounds that can act as hydrogen bond donors identify those that also contain lone pairs of electrons which allow them to be hydrogen bond acceptors If a substance is both a hydrogen donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor draw a structure showing the hydrogen bonding Solution A Of the species listed xenon Xe ethane CH and trimethylamine CHN do not contain a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F hence they cannot act as hydrogen bond donors B The one compound that can act as a hydrogen bond donor methanol CHOH contains both a hydrogen atom attached to O making it a hydrogen bond donor and two lone pairs of electrons on O making it a hydrogen bond acceptor methanol can thus form hydrogen bonds by acting as either a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor The hydrogenbonded structure of methanol is as follows Exercise Considering CHCOH CHN NH and CHF which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Answer CHCOH and NH Example Arrange C buckminsterfullerene which has a cage structure NaCl He Ar and NO in order of increasing boiling points Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Identify the intermolecular forces in each compound and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution Electrostatic interactions are strongest for an ionic compound so we expect NaCl to have the highest boiling point To predict the relative boiling points of the other compounds we must consider their polarity for dipoledipole interactions their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their molar mass for London dispersion forces Helium is nonpolar and by far the lightest so it should have the lowest boiling point Argon and NO have very similar molar masses and gmol respectively but NO is polar while Ar is not Consequently NO should have a higher boiling point A C molecule is nonpolar but its molar mass is gmol much greater than that of Ar or NO Because the boiling points of nonpolar substances increase rapidly with molecular mass C should boil at a higher temperature than the other nonionic substances The predicted order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses He C Ar C NO C C C NaCl C Exercise Arrange dimethylheptane Ne CS Cl and KBr in order of decreasing boiling points Answer KBr C dimethylheptane C CS C Cl C Ne C Summary Molecules in liquids are held to other molecules by intermolecular interactions which are weaker than the intramolecular interactions that hold the atoms together within molecules and polyatomic ions Transitions between the solid and liquid or the liquid and gas phases are due to changes in intermolecular interactions but do not affect intramolecular interactions The three major types of intermolecular interactions are dipoledipole interactions London dispersion forces these two are often referred to collectively as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds Dipoledipole interactions arise from the electrostatic interactions of the positive and negative ends of molecules with permanent dipole moments their strength is proportional to the magnitude of the dipole moment and to r where r is the distance between dipoles London dispersion forces are due to the formation of instantaneous dipole moments in polar or nonpolar molecules as a result of shortlived fluctuations of electron charge distribution which in turn cause the temporary formation of an induced dipole in adjacent molecules Like dipoledipole interactions their energy falls off as r Larger atoms tend to be more polarizable than smaller ones because their outer electrons are less tightly bound and are therefore more easily perturbed Hydrogen bonds are especially strong dipoledipole interactions between molecules that have hydrogen bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as O N or F The resulting partially positively charged H atom on one molecule the hydrogen bond donor can interact strongly with a lone pair of electrons of a partially negatively charged O N or F atom on adjacent molecules the hydrogen bond acceptor Because of strong OHhydrogen bonding between water molecules water has an unusually high boiling point and ice has an open cagelike structure that is less dense than liquid water Key Takeaway Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature and include van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds Problems Which are strongerdipoledipole interactions or London dispersion forces Which are likely to be more important in a molecule with heavy atoms Explain your answers Liquid water is essential for life as we know it but based on its molecular mass water should be a gas under standard conditions Why is water a liquid rather than a gas under standard conditions Why are intermolecular interactions more important for liquids and solids than for gases Under what conditions must these interactions be considered for gases In group elemental fluorine and chlorine are gases whereas bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid Why Identify the most important intermolecular interaction in each of the following a SO b HF c CO d CCl e CHCl Both water and methanol have anomalously high boiling points due to hydrogen bonding but the boiling point of water is greater than that of methanol despite its lower molecular mass Why Draw the structures of these two compounds including any lone pairs and indicate potential hydrogen bonds Do you expect the boiling point of HS to be higher or lower than that of HO Justify your answer Some recipes call for vigorous boiling while others call for gentle simmering What is the difference in the temperature of the cooking liquid between boiling and simmering What is the difference in energy input Solutions DipoleDiple interactions are stronger because molecules polarity is permanent Molecules involved in London dispersion forces are only temporarily polar Water is a liquid under standard conditions because of its unique ability to form four strong hydrogen bonds per molecule In solids and liquids the molecules are in direct contact In gases the molecules only contact during collisions Intermolecules forces become inmportant when gases are cooled to the point where they form a liquid As the atomic mass of the halogens increases so does the number of electrons and the average distance of those electrons from the nucleus Larger atoms with more electrons are more easily polarized than smaller atoms and the increase in polarizability with atomic number increases the strength of London dispersion forces These intermolecular interactions are strong enough to favor the condensed states for bromine and iodine under normal conditions of temperature and pressure a The Vshaped SO molecule has a large dipole moment due to the polar SO bonds so dipoledipole interactions will be most important b The HF bond is highly polar and the fluorine atom has three lone pairs of electrons to act as hydrogen bond acceptors hydrogen bonding will be most important c Although the CO bonds are polar this linear molecule has no net dipole moment hence London dispersion forces are most important d This is a symmetrical molecule that has no net dipole moment and the Cl atoms are relatively polarizable thus London dispersion forces will dominate e This molecule has a small dipole moment as well as polarizable Cl atoms In such a case dipoledipole interactions and London dispersion forces are often comparable in magnitude Water has two polar OH bonds with H atoms that can act as hydrogen bond donors plus two lone pairs of electrons that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors giving a net of four hydrogen bonds per HO molecule Although methanol also has two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors it only has one OH bond with an H atom that can act as a hydrogen bond donor Consequently methanol can only form two hydrogen bonds per molecule on average versus four for water Hydrogen bonding therefore has a much greater effect on the boiling point of water HO would have the higher boiling point because it can form the stronger hydrogen bonding intermolecular force Vigorous boiling causes more water molecule to escape into the vapor phase but does not affect the temperature of the liquid Vigorous boiling requires a higher energy input than does gentle simmering Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry

SpectroscopyReferences Nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy is extremely useful for identification and analysis of organic compounds The principle on which this form of spectroscopy is based is simple The nuclei of many kinds of atoms act like tiny magnets and tend to become aligned in a magnetic field In NMR spectroscopy we measure the energy required to change the alignment of magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field To illustrate the procedure with a simple example consider the behavior of a proton in a magnetic field There are two possible alignments of this magnetic nucleus with respect to the direction of the applied field as shown in Figure The nuclear magnets can be aligned either with the field direction or opposed to it The two orientations are not equivalent and energy is required to change the more stable alignment to the less stable alignment Figure Schematic representation of the possible alignments of a magnetic nucleus here hydrogen in an applied magnetic field Transitions between the two states constitute the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance The arrows through the nuclei represent the average component of their nuclear magnetic moment in the field direction A schematic diagram of an NMR instrument is shown in Figure When a substance such as ethanol the hydrogens of which have nuclei protons that are magnetic is placed in the transmitter coil and the magnetic field is increased gradually at certain field strengths radiofrequency energy is absorbed by the sample and the ammeter indicates an increase in the flow of current in the coil The overall result is a spectrum such as the one shown in Figure This spectrum is detailed enough to serve as a useful fingerprint for ethanol and also is simple enough that we will be able to account for the origin of each line It is the purpose of this section to explain how the complexities of spectra such as that of Figure can be interpreted in terms of chemical structure Figure Essential features of a simple NMR spectrometer For what kinds of substances can we expect nuclear magnetic resonance absorption to occur Magnetic properties always are found with nuclei of oddnumbered masses and so on as well as for nuclei of even mass but odd atomic number and so on Nuclei such as and which have even mass and atomic numbers have no magnetic properties and do not give nuclear magnetic resonance signals For various reasons routine use of NMR spectra in organic chemistry is confined to and We shall be concerned in this chapter only with NMR spectra of hydrogen and of carbon Figure Proton NMR spectrum of ethanol containing a trace of hydrochloric acid Chemical shifts are relative to tetramethylsilane that is TMS The stepped line is an integral of the areas under each of the resonance lines The kind of NMR spectroscopy we shall discuss here is limited in its applications because it can be carried out only with liquids or solutions Fortunately the allowable range of solvents is large from hydrocarbons to concentrated sulfuric acid and for most compounds it is possible to find a suitable solvent Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra may be so simple as to have only a single absorption peak but they also can be much more complex than the spectrum of Figure However it is important to recognize that no matter how complex an NMR spectrum appears to be in involves just three parameters chemical shifts spinspin splittings and kinetic reactionrate processes We shall have more to say about each of these later First let us try to establish the relationship of NMR spectroscopy to some of the other forms of spectroscopy we have already discussed in this chapter A The Relation of NMR to Other Kinds of Spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy involves transitions between possible energy levels of magnetic nuclei in an applied magnetic field see Figure The transition energies are related to the frequency of the absorbed radiation by the familiar equation An important difference between nmr and other forms of spectroscopy is that is influenced by the strength of the applied field This should not be surprising because if we are to measure the energy of changing the direction of alignment of a magnetic nucleus in a magnetic field then the stronger the field the more energy will be invloved Nuclear spin symbolized as is a quantized property that correlates with nuclear magnetism such that when is zero the nucleus has no spin and no magnetic properties Examples are and Several nuclei of particular interest to organic chemists and have spin of With there are only two magnetic energy states of the nucleus in a magnetic field These states are designated with the spin quantum numbers and The difference in energy between these states is given by or in which is Plancks constant is in hertz is a nuclear magnetic constant called the gyromagnetic ratio and is the magnetic field strength at the nucleus In general will not be exactly equal to the applied magnetic field and as we will see this difference leads to important chemical information Each kind of nucleus etc has its own value and consequently will undergo transitions at different frequencies at any particular value of This should become clearer by study of Figure Figure Fieldfrequency diagram that represents the energies in frequency units of the and magnetic states of and nuclei as a function of magnetic field The vertical scale is of frequency in megahertz cycles per sec while the horizontal scale is of magnetic field in gauss For comparison the Earths magnetic field is about gauss The dashed vertical line at gauss tells us that the resonance frequency will be and the resonance frequency will be at this field strength There are several modes of operation of an nmr spectrometer First and most common we hold constant and vary or sweep Close to energy is absorbed by the nuclei and the current flow from the transmitter increases until is exactly equal to Further increase of makes and the current flow decreases The form of the energyabsorption curve as a function of when is changed very slowly is shown in Figure a The peak is centered on the point where When is changed more rapidly transient effects are observed on the peak which are a consequence of the fact that the nuclei do not revert instantly from the to state The resulting Figure Comparison of sweep rates on nmr absorption curves a sweep b sweep c sweep The ringing in the faster sweep curves is a transient effect that has a small effect on the position of the peak and none on the integral phenomenon is called ringing and is shown in Figures b and c Evidence of ringing also will be seen on peaks of Figure An alternative method of running an nmr spectrometer is to hold the magnetic field constant and to sweep the transmitter frequency through the resonances This mode of operation is more like other forms of spectroscopy and gives the same line shapes as sweeping the field Figure What energy is associated with a nmr transition The magnitude of this energy may be calculated from the relationship between energy and wavelength frequency of the absorbed radiation Section That is and The frequency is the operating frequency of the spectrometer which we will take as or cycles and the velocity of light is Hence and This is a very small energy difference which means that only very few more of the nuclei are in the more stable state than in the less stable state The equilibrium constant for calculated from Equation for textK and neglecting possible entropy effects is B The Chemical Shift The plot of signal against magnetic field strength for ethanol in Figure shows three principal groups of lines corresponding to the three varieties of hydrogen present methyl methylene and hydroxyl Differences in the field strengths at which signals are obtained for nuclei of the same kind such as protons but located in different molecular environments are called chemical shifts Another very important point to notice about Figure is that the intensities of the three principal absorptions are in the ratio of corresponding to the ratio of the number of each kind of proton producing the signal In general areas under the peaks of a spectrum such as in Figure are proportional to the number of nuclei in the sample that give those peaks The areas can be measured by electronic integration and the integral often is displayed on the chart as it is in Figure as a stepped line increasing from left to right The height of each step corresponds to the relative number of nuclei of a particular kind Unless special precautions are taken integrals usually should not be considered accurate to better than about Why do protons in different molecular environments absorb at different field strengths The field strength at a particular nucleus is less than the strength of the external magnetic field This is because the valence electrons around a particular nucleus and around neighboring nuclei respond to the applied magnetic field so as to shield the nucleus from the applied field The way this shielding occurs is as follows First when an atom is placed in a magnetic field its electrons are forced to undergo a rotation about the field axis as shown in Figure Second Figure Induced magnetic field at the nucleus as the result of rotation of electrons about the nucleus in an applied magnetic field rotation of the electrons around the nucleus is a circulation of charge and this creates a small magnetic field at the nucleus opposite in the direction to Third the magnitude of this diamagnetic effect is directly proportional to and can be quantified as in which is the proportionality constant It is important to recognize that is not a nuclear property but depends on the chemical environment of the atom Each chemically different proton will have a different value of and hence a different chemical shift The actual field at the nucleus will be Because acts to reduce the strength of the applied field at the nucleus it is called the magnetic shielding parameter The more shielding there is the stronger the applied field must be to satisfy the resonance condition Common usage is upfield more shielding downfield less shielding and you should remember that fieldsweep spectra always are recorded with the field increasing from left to right C Chemical Shift and Stereochemistry The value of nmr spectroscopy in structure determination lies in the fact that chemically different nuclei absorb at different field strengths In later sections we will be concerned with correlating the chemical shifts with structural features However before proceeding furher it is extremely important that you be able to identify the number and kind of nonequivalent protons in a given structure and therefore the number of chemical shifts to expect This number is not always selfevident especially when subtle factors of stereochemistry intervene For this reason we suggest that you inspect structures to convince yourself that the protons labeled with different letter subscripts in any one molecule are indeed chemically different One way of checking whether two protons are in equivalent environments is to imagine that each is separately replaced with a different atom or group If the product of replacing is identical with that obtained by replacing then and are chemically equivalent If the two products are nonidentical then and are nonequivalent For example replacement of or in and by an atom would give different products Therefore and are nonequivalent in and Matters become more complicated with substances such as and Notice that represents a chiral molecule and if and each are replaced with we get and which are diastereomers see Section You can verify this with molecular models if necessary Diastereomers have different chemical and physical properties therefore and in are nonequivalent They often are called diastereotopic hydrogens What of the two methylene protons in ethanol which we have labeled as Are they identical In a sense they are not identical because if each were replaced by we would have a pair of enantiomers Therefore and sometimes are called enantiotopic hydrogens But you will recall that enantiomers are chemically indistinguishable unless they are in a chiral environment Therefore we expect shifts of enantiotopic hydrogens to be identical unless they are in a chiral environment To summarize enantiotopic protons normally will have the same chemical shifts whereas diastereotopic protons normally will have different chemical shifts We so far have ignored the relationship of chemical shifts to conformational equilibria Consider a specific example dibromoethane for which there are three staggered conformations and Each of these conformations is expected to have its own nmr spectrum The two gauche forms and are enantiomers and their spectra should be identical The hydrogens in each are trans to the bromine on the adjacent carbon while the hydrogens are cis to the same bromines see Section A Consequently the and hydrogens are nonequivalent and would be expected to have different chemical shifts In contrast all of the hydrogens of the anti conformer are equivalent and would have the same chemical shift Therefore we would expect to observe three chemical shifts arising from and for a mixture of and However the actual spectrum of dibromoethane shows only one sharp proton signal under ordinary conditions The reason is that the magnetic nuclei can absorb the exciting radiation The result is that we observe an average chemical shift which reflects the relative shifts and populations of the three conformers present If we can go to a sufficiently low temperature to make interconversion of the conformations slow on the order of times per second then we will expect to see the three different chemical shifts and with intensities corresponding to the actual populations of the conformations at the sample temperature This is one example of the effect of rate processes on nmr spectra Other examples and a more detailed account of how to relate the appearance of the signal to the rates of the exchange processes are given in Section D ChemicalShift Standards and Units Chemical shifts always are measured with reference to a standard For protons or in organic molecules the customary standard is a tetramethylsilane which gives strong sharp nmr signals in regions where only a very few other kinds of protons or carbon nuclei absorb Chemical shifts often are expressed in cycles per second relative to tetramethylsilane TMS These may seem odd units for magnetic field strength but because resonance occurs at either frequency units radians or magnetic field units gauss are appropriate Ten years ago most nmr spectrometers operated for protons with radiofrequency rf transmitters set at cycles per second but there has been a proliferation of different protonoperating frequencies and now and machines are commercially available The cost of these machines is roughly proportional to the square of the frequency and one well may wonder why there is such an exotic variety available and what this has to do with the chemical shift High operating frequencies are desirable because chemical shifts increase with spectrometer frequency and this makes the spectra simpler to interpret A fold increase in operating frequency as from to means a fold increase in at the point of resonance remember and this means also a fold increase in Thus resonances that differ because they correspond to different values will be twelve times farther apart at than at This can produce a dramatic simplification of spectra as can be seen from Figure which shows the effect of almost a factor of four in on the proton nmr spectrum of methylbutanol Figure Comparison of the proton nmr spectra of methylbutanol at rf transmitter frequencies of and The line at in the spectrum is due to the protons and this is offscale to the left in the spectrum The large single line in the center of the spectra arises from the resonances of the six methyl hydrogens The line at is TMS in each case To reiterate chemical shifts are strictly proportional to spectrometer frequency thus lines apart at will be apart at This might seem to make comparisons of nmr spectra on different spectrometers hopelessly complex but because of the proportionality of shifts to frequency or field if we divide the measured shifts in relative to the same standard for any spectrometer by the transmitter frequency in we get a set of frequencyindependent shifts in parts per million which are useful for all nmr spectrometers Nmr shifts reported in relative to TMS as zero as shown in Figure are called delta values Thus if at a proton signal comes downfield relative to tetramethylsilane it can be designated as being relative to tetramethylsilane At the line then will be downfield from tetramethylsilane Typical proton chemical shifts relative to TMS are given in Table The values quoted for each type of proton may in practice show variations of This is not unreasonable because the chemical shift of a given proton is expected to depend somewhat on the nature of the particular molecule involved and also on the solvent temperature and concentration A positive value means a shift to lower field or lower frequency with respect to TMS whereas a negative signifies a shift to higher field or higher frequency The convention is accepted widely but you often find in the literature proton shifts with reference to TMS reported as values The scale has the TMS reference at so most proton signals fall in the range of to A value can be converted to the appropriate value by subtracting it from Life with nmr spectra would be simpler if the scale would just go away E Correlations Between Structure and Chemical Shifts Protonc chemical shifts are very valuable for the determination of structures but to use the shifts in this way we must know something about the correlations that exist between chemical shift and structural environment of protons in organic compounds The most important effects arise from differences in electronegativity types of carbon bonding hydrogen bonding and chemical exchange Electronegativity Consider first the chemical shifts of protons attached to an carbon The degree of shielding of the proton by the carbon valence electrons depends on the character of the substituent atoms and groups present and particularly on their electronattracting power or electronegativity For a grouping of the type the shielding will be less as is more electron withdrawing relative to hydrogen If is electronwithdrawing the proton is deshielded For example the proton chemical shifts of the methyl halides Table show decreasing shielding hence progressively lowfield chemical shifts with increasing halogen electronegativity The effect of electronegativity on a more remote proton as in is expected to be smaller as more bonds intervene In fact the resonances of different derivatives fall in a range of not more than compared to for the proton resonances see Table Figure shows how the shift differences between the and the protons in some derivatives depend on the electronegativity of using the electronegativity defined by L Pauling see Section B The trend is not wholly linear but the proton chemicalshift differences become larger the more electronegative becomes We can predict with some confidence therefore that a molecule such as will have lowerfield chemical shifts larger for than for if is more electronegative than Table Typical Proton ChemicalShift Values in Dilute Solutions Figure Chemicalshift differences between the and protons of derivatives as a function of the Pauling electronegativity of see Section A When two electronegative groups and are bonded to the same carbon as in the protons are expected to be less shielded and come into resonance downfield of the methylenes of There is an approximate relationship see below between the shifts of the protons and the effective shielding constants of and known as Shoolerys rule Appropriate values of for use with this equation are given in Table Effects of Carbon Bond Type The shifts of the protons of alkanes and cycloalkanes fall in the range of with protons coming at the lowfield end of this range and protons coming at the highfield end see Table Alkenic hydrogens vinyl hydrogens normally are observed between toward lower fields than the shifts of protons in alkanes and cycloalkanes This means that alkenic hydrogens in an organic compound can be easily distinguished from alkane hydrogens Aromatic protons such as those in benzene have shifts at still lower fields and commonly are observed at In contrast alkynic protons of the type give resonances that are upfield of alkenic or aromatic protons and come at Another effect associated with multiple bonds is the large difference in shift between a proton which normally comes at about and aldehyde protons which are much farter downfield at Clearly the shifts of a proton depend on whether the carbon forms single double or triple bonds In a magnetic field the circulation of electrons in the orbitals of multiple bonds induced by the field Figure generates diamagnetic shielding effects in some regions of the multiple bond and paramagnetic deshielding effects in other regions Apparently protons attached to doublebonded carbons are in the deshielding zones and thus are downfield while protons attached to triplebonded carbons are in the shielding zones and are observed at rather high field Hydrogen Bonding When a proton is directly bonded to a strongly electronegative atom such as oxygen or nitrogen its chemical shift is critically dependent on the nature of the solvent temperature concentration and whether acidic or basic impurities are present The usual variations in chemical shift for such protons are so large up to for alcohols that no very useful correlations exist Hydrogen bonding is the major reason for the variable chemical shifts of and protons In general hydrogen bonding results in deshielding which causes the resonances to move downfield The extent of hydrogen bonding varies with concentration temperature and solvent and changes in the degree of hydrogen bonding can cause substantial shift changes This is very evident in the nmr spectrum of ethanol taken at different concentrations in Figure The hydroxyl resonance will be seen to move upfield by hydrogen bonding through equilibria such as Figure Proton spectra of ethanol at showing how the resonance changes in position with percent concentration in The background noise level increases at the lower concentrations because the receiver gain has been increased to maintain constant height of the resonances The changes in appearance of the resonance broad at compared to Figure a triplet at broad at the other concentrations is a consequence of slow exchange of the protons only from molecule to molecule as will be discussed in Section I There is no significant change in the relative shifts of the and lines as the concentration is changed Chemical Exchange Many and compounds are weak acids and weak bases and can undergo autoprotolysis which means that a proton can be transferred from one molecule to another Suppose we have a compound such as aminoethanol This substance normally would be expected to have an proton resonance at about and an proton resonance at about Autoprotolysis equilibria can exchange the protons between the molecules and also from one end to the other as shown below even if the equilibria are not very favorable Such equilibria can be established very rapidly especially if traces of a strong acid or a strong base are present In such circumstances a single average proton signal is observed because the excitation of a given proton from its lowerenergy magnetic state to its higherenergy magnetic state occurs while it is partly on oxygen and partly on nitrogen This is the same kind of chemical shift averaging that occurs for rapidly equilibrating conformations see Section C F Application of Chemical Shifts to Structure Determination To see how nmr and infrared spectra can be used together for structure determination we shall work through a representative example The objective is to assign a structure to the compound whose nmr spectrum is shown in Figure and whose infrared spectrum shows prominent bands at and Figure Proton nmr spectrum of a compound at relative to TMS The infrared spectrum indicates and The position of the carbonyl band suggests that it is probably an ester A carboxylic acid is ruled out because there is no sign of an stretch The nmr spectrum shows three kinds of signals corresponding to three kinds of protons The integral shows these are in the ratio of From this we can conclude that they are two different kinds of groups and a group The chemical shifts of the presumed groups are at and Because the compound contains only and the data of Table suggest that these resonances arise from groups The lowfield resonance is likely to be we know from the infrared that there probably is an ester function while the higherfield resonance is possibly an ether function If you put all of this information together you find that is the only possible structure To check whether the resonance at is consistent with the assigned structure we can calculate a shift value from Equation The agreement between the calculated and observed shifts is not perfect but is within the usual range of variation for Equation We can be satisfied that the assigned structure is correct Figure Proton nmr spectrum of a compound at relative to TMS at The stepped line is the integral running from left to right G SpinSpin Splitting What We Observe If you look at the nmr spectrum of ethanol in Figure you will see that the resonance is actually a group of four lines and the resonance is a group of three lines This threefour line pattern for the grouping also is evident in the spectrum of methylbutanol Figure and in the spectrum of ethyl iodide Figure Why do certain proton resonances appear as groups of equally spaced lines rather than single resonances The facts are that nonequivalent protons on contiguous carbons such as ethyl derivatives interact magnetically to split each others resonances This multiplicity of lines produced by the mutual interaction of magnetic nuclei is called spinspin splitting and while it complicates nmr spectra it also provides valuable structural information as we shall see An example of a complex proton spectrum is that of ethyl iodide Figure To a first approximation the two main groups of lines appear as equally spaced sets of three and four lines arising from what are called firstorder spinspin interactions Matters are further complicated by additional splitting of the threefour pattern of ethyl iodide as also can be seen in Figure This additional splitting is called secondorder splitting When there are so many lines present how do we know what we are dealing with From where to we measure the chemical shift in a complex group of lines Figure Highresolution nmr spectrum of ethyl iodide at relative to TMS The firstorder splitting pattern is seen in the wellseparated threefour line pattern for the resonances The secondorder splitting is the additional fine structure superimposed on the threefour pattern First the chemical shift normally is at the center of the group of lines corresponding to firstorder splitting In ethyl iodide the chemical shift of the methyl protons is in the center of the quartet Second the chemical shift can be recognized by the fact that it is directly proportional to the transmitter frequency If we double the chemical shifts double In contrast the firstorder spinspin splittings remain the same By this we mean that the magnitude in of the spacing between the lines of a split resonance is independent of the transmitter frequency This spacing corresponds to what is called the spinspin coupling constant or simply the coupling constant and is symbolized by and are directly proportional to the transmitter frequency of the spectrometer but the internal spacings of the split resonances are not see Figure Third the secondorder splitting tends to disappear with increasing transmitter frequency For ethyl iodide Figure the secondorder splitting at is barely discernible at and disappears at This also can be seen to occur for the threefour splitting pattern of methylbutanol as a function of Figure The next question is how can we understand and predict what spinspin splitting patterns will be observed And how do they give us structural information The important point is that the multiplicity of lines for protons of a given chemical shift often is seen to be in which is the number of protons on the contiguous carbons For example the resonance of the ethyl group of ethyl iodide is a quartet of lines because of the spinspin interaction with the neighboring three protons of the methyl group Likewise the group is a triplet of lines because of spinspin interactions with the two protons of the methylene group The spinspin splitting patterns observed for some different combinations of protons on contiguous carbons are given in Figure where and are groups that give no spin interactions with the protons The value of these patterns when observed lies in the way that they indicate the number of equivalent protons on contiguous carbons For instance a twothree line pattern where the twopart has an integrated intensity twice that of the threepart suggests the grouping Figure Schematic proton nmr spectra and are nonmagnetic nuclei For propane derivatives as at the top the ceCH_ resonances are double because of the splitting produced by the single proton on C For the ethane derivatives the right set of lines is always a triplet when observable because of the two protons of the group We assume here that the chemical shifts of the protons are independent of the number of substituents The ratios of the line intensities in the spinspin splitting patterns of Figure usually follow simple rules A doublet appears as two lines of equal intensity a triplet as three lines in the ratio a quartet as four lines in the ratio a quintet as and so on The intensities follow the binomial coefficients for where is the number of protons in the splitting group Thus when we have or The spectrum of Figure provides an excellent example of how nmr shows the presence of contiguous protons The symmetrical doublet and quartet are typical of the interaction between a single proton and an adjacent group of three that is The methyl protons of the groups are too far from the others to give demonstrable spinspin splitting thus they appear as a single sixproton resonance Figure Proton nmr spectrum of dimethoxyethane dimethyl acetal at relative to TMS In general the magnitude of the spinspin splitting effect of one proton on another proton or group of equivalent protons depends on the number and kind of intervening chemical bonds and on the spatial relationships between the groups For simple systems without double bonds and with normal bond angles we usually find for nonequivalent protons ie having different chemical shifts Where restricted rotation or double and triplebonded groups are involved widely divergent splittings are observed For double bonds the twobond couplings between two nonequivalent hydrogens located on one end are characteristically small while the threebond couplings in are larger especially for the trans configuration Coupling through four or more bonds is significant for compounds with double or triple bonds Examples of these socalled longrange couplings and some other useful splitting values follow Finally chemically equivalent protons do not split each others resonances H ProtonProton Splittings and Conformational Analysis A very important characteristic of threebond protonproton couplings is the way that they depend on the conformation at the bond Typical values for several particular conformations are For protons in groups such as ethyl groups in which rotation is rapid and the favored conformations are staggered but none of the staggered conformations is preferred over the others average protonproton splittings are observed The average for splittings is about which corresponds to I ProtonProton Splittings and Chemical Exchange You may have wondered why the hydroxyl proton of ethanol produces a single resonance in the spectrum of Figure It is quite reasonable to expect that the hydroxyl proton would be split by the neighboring methylene protons because they are only three bonds apart however this coupling will not be observed if the hydroxyl protons are exchanging rapidly between the ethanol molecules Section E When proton exchange is rapid the spin interactions between the and protons average to zero At intermediate exchange rates the coupling manifests itself through line broadening or by actually giving multiple lines If you look at the several spectra of ethanol in Figure you will notice how the shape of the resonance varies from a broad singlet to a distinct triplet Rapid chemical exchange of magnetic nuclei is not the only way that spincoupling interactions can be averaged to zero The same effect can be achieved by a technique known as double resonance To understand how this is done consider two coupled protons and having different chemical shifts Suppose that is selectively irradiated at its resonance frequency while at the same time we observe the resonance signal of The coupling between and disappears and shows a single resonance Why is this so By irradiation of the nuclei are changed from the state to and back again sufficiently rapidly that the neighboring nucleus effectively sees neither one state nor the other The magnetic interaction between the states therefore averages to zero This decoupling of magnetic nuclei by double resonance techniques is especially important in NMR spectroscopy Section L but also is used to simplify proton spectra by selectively removing particular couplings J Use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Organic Structural Analysis The solution of a typical structural analysis problem by nmr methods utilizes at least four kinds of information obtained directly from the spectrum They are chemical shifts line intensities signal areas spinspin splitting patterns line mulitplicities and coupling constants We already have shown how chemical shifts are used in the absence of spinspin splitting We now will illustrate how more complex spectra may be analyzed Figure shows the proton nmr spectrum for a compound of formula There are three principal groups of lines at and Look at the multiplicity of these groups before reading further Figure Nmr spectrum and integral for a compound of formula at relative to TMS There are several ways to approach a problem such as this but probably the easiest is to start with the integral The relative heights of the stepped integral for the principal groups of lines can be obtained by a pair of dividers with a ruler or with horizontal lines as in Figure The integral suggests that one hydrogen is responsible for the resonance at two hydrogens at and three at Three hydrogens in a single group suggest a group and because there is a threefour splitting pattern it is reasonable to postulate Subtracting from the given formula leaves which with normal valences has to be The spectrum thus appears to be consistent with the structure propanal as judged from the molecular formula and the spinspin splitting pattern which indicates the grouping To be sure of the structure we should check it against all of the available information First from the shifts Table we see that the single proton at fits almost perfectly for the twoproton resonance at is consistent with that reported for while the threeproton line at checks with for What about the couplings The threefour pattern has a spacing of slightly over which is just right for an ethyl group compare Figures and The doubling up almost obscured by secondorder splitting of the resonance and the splitting of the resonance into a triplet indicate about a coupling for the group Threebond couplings between and adjacent protons appear to be generally smaller than couplings We usually would not rely on nmr alone in a structureanalysis problem of this kind but would seek clues or corroboration from the infrared electronic or other spectra as well as chemical tests In later chapters we will have many problems that will be facilitated by the use of both nmr and infrared spectra A further worked example will illustrate the approach A compound has the composition and gives the infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra shown in Figure The problem is how to use this information to deduce the structure of the compound The molecular formula tells us the number and kind of atoms and the number of multiple bonds or rings The formulas of the corresponding hydrocarbon without the bromine would be or four hydrogens less than the saturated alkane This means there must be two double bonds or the equivalent one triple bond or one ring and one double bond Because from the formula we suspect unsaturation we should check this out with the infrared spectrum There is a band at which is indicative of an unsymmetrically substituted group Table The strong sharp band at further tells us that the substance is a alkyne Figure Infrared and nmr spectra for a compound of formula The infrared spectrum here is different from others shown in this book in being linear in wavelength instead of in wave numbers The units of wavelength here are microns The proton nmr spectrum shows that there are only two principal groups of lines a twoproton doublet at and a oneproton triplet at The twothree splitting pattern combined with the proton ratio suggests a group coupled with a group The structure must be a bromopropyne To confirm the assignment the chemical shifts should be checked Table The at agrees well with the tabulated value of There is no tabulated data for but the observed shift at is at slightly lower fields than the tabulated for This is expected because of the triple bond The correlation of Equation predicts a value of Very often a proton will be spincoupled to two or more different protons and the couplings are not necessarily the same When this happens the resulting spectrum can be quite complex as our next example shows A compound gives the nmr spectrum of Figure There are clearly four kinds of protons in the molecule at and Although the integral is not shown the main groups of lines have intensities from the lowfield to highfield in the ratio of Figure Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of at The calibrations are relative to the protons of TMS The insets show the peaks centered on and with an expanded scale The spacing between the peaks is for Group B at and for Groups A and C at and The protons are coupled to each other not to A B or C The fiveproton signal at is typical of a phenyl group and the oneproton signals at and are in the region for alkenic protons The threeproton signal at is typical of a methyl group on a carboncarbon double bond There are only three ways to put together a phenyl ring and two protons such that they add up to They are We can distinguish between these three possible structures on the basis of the splitting patterns observed and expected from the coupling of the alkenic and methyl protons The observed splittings are shown in expanded form inset in Figure and the three mutually coupled groups are labeled as A B and C Coupling between A and B designated by the constant should give four lines two for A and two for B as shown in Figure Because A and B also are coupled to the three hydrogens of the methyl group C each of the four lines corresponding to will be further split into quartets If then the spacing of the lines in the two sets of quartets will not be the same Figure Spinspin splitting patterns predicted for the nmr signals of the two alkenic protons A and B of a methylsubstituted alkene of the type where According to the foregoing analysis the maximum number of lines observable for the A and B resonances is sixteen for A and for B In fact only eleven are visible for A and for B which means that some of the sixteen possible lines must overlap Without examining all possibilities we can see that the actual situation can be reproduced if The only structure that is consistent with is or phenylpropene the other possibilities are excluded because should be about for and for K ChemicalShift Effects on SpinSpin Splitting The simple rule for predicting the multiplicity of spincoupled proton signals often breaks down whenever the chemicalshift difference between the protons in different groups becomes comparable to coupling constants for magnetic interaction between the groups Under these circumstances you may expect to see more lines or lines in different positions with different intensities than predicted from the simple firstorder treatment One example is the effect of changing chemical shift on a twoproton spectrum with Figure We see in Figure that even when the shift is times larger than the coupling the outside lines are weaker than the inside lines This general kind of asymmetry of line intensities also is apparent in the spectrum of ethyl iodide Figure in which the lines of each group are more like and rather than the and ratios predicted from the firstorder treatment The asymmetry is such that two groups of lines that are connected by spinspin splitting in effect point to one another the lines on the inside of the pattern are stronger than predicted from the firstorder treatment whereas those on the outside are weaker The effect can be put to practical use as illustrated in the following exercise Figure Representation of the changes in line positions and intensities for a twoproton system with a coupling constant of and the indicated chemicalshift differences Only a single sharp line is observed if the shift difference is zero To explain the effect of chemical shifts on secondorder splitting is beyond the scope of this book In fact we havent really explained firstorder splitting although more on this topic will be found in Section But regardless of how many lines appear in a complex nmr spectrum they can be rationalized in terms of the chemical shifts coupling constants and exchange effects Furthermore the overall signal intensities remain proportional to the number of protons giving rise to the signals When there are many hydrogens and small chemicalshift differences as in alkanes the proton nmr spectra may have so many closely spaced resonance lines that they merge together to give a series of smooth moreorless featureless peaks The proton spectrum of octane Figure a is an excellent example of this type of spectrum Useful information often can be obtained from such spectra as to the ratio of by investigation of the integrals over the range of alkane proton absorptions Figure illustrates how this can be done for octane and trimethylpentane Figure Proton nmr spectra of a octane and b trimethylpentane at relative to TMS as standard The upper left curve of b represents the spectrum from at increased sensitivity to show the details of the absorption Notice that the ratio of to usually can be determined from the integrals centered on and and will be for an unbranched alkane with carbons For octane a the integral ratio is or L Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy In recent years nmr spectroscopy using of natural abundance has become an important tool for organic structural analysis That this did not happen sooner is because has a much smaller magnetic moment than and the small moment combined with the small natural abundance means that is harder to detect in the nmr than by a factor of This is a large difference and can be put in the proper context in the following way Suppose two people are talking in a noisy room and one is trying to hear the other The common request is talk louder If this is not possible then the request is say it again or talk more slowly Either of the latter requests amounts to an integration of signal versus noise and takes time Improvement in signaltonoise for a given communication is achieved as the square root of the time of communication On the crucial time basis nmr signals require times more time to get the same signaltonoise ratio as in nmr for the same number of nuclei per unit volume This is a problem Electronic improvements and use of communication theory with emphasis on the sayitagain technique have provided the means for obtaining routine spectra for even fairly dilute solutions of quite complex molecules Some of the same kinds of structural effects are important for chemical shifts as for proton chemical shifts Section E For example there is a similar parallel between shift differences in compounds of the type and electronegativity Figure as between the corresponding proton shifts and electronegativity Figure It is important to notice that shifts in units are much larger than those of protons This is because carbon uses orbitals in forming bonds whereas hydrogen uses orbitals We therefore will expect to find the the nuclei of other elements that use orbitals in bonding such as and also will have larger shifts than for protons as indeed they do Figure Carbon chemical shift differences for C and C of derivatives as a function of Pauling electronegativity The methyl carbons of derivatives are downfield from the of TMS A structural application of nmr which shows its power in an area where nmr is indecisive is shown in Figure Here we see the highfield resonances of a substance known variously as Coumadin or the sodium salt of warfarin which is used widely as a blood anticoagulant in the treatment of diseases such as phlebitis It also has substantial utility as a rat poison because of its anticoagulant action The spectra of Figure show no splittings of the resonances by the hydrogens directly attached to the carbons even though such splittings normally are quite large The reason is that while the spectra were taken protons were simultaneously subjected to strong irradiation at their resonance frequency which as far as spinspin splitting goes causes them to act as nonmagnetic nuclei such as and This doubleresonance technique for removing the splittings is called proton decoupling see Section I Figure Protondecoupled nmr spectrum at of the upfield region of a the sodium salt of warfarin showing on the right side the resonances of C C and C This part of the spectrum can be compared with the more complete spectrum b of warfarin itself and The gaggle of evenly spaced sharp peaks toward the center of the spectrum arises from the solvent There is no indication of any abnormality in the chemical shifts of carbons and shown in Figure a Furthermore there is a downfield resonance from the carbons of TMS not shown in Figure a which is typical of a carbon corresponding to C When is treated with acid we expect the product warfarin of structure to be formed which should have a spectrum much like that shown in Figure a In fact the nmr spectrum of the product Figure b is much more complex The C C and C resonances of Figure a now come in unequal pairs Futhermore the carbon resonance of has disappeared and two new lines are observed at and farther upfield The data indicate clearly that warfarin is not in solution but is a mixture of two diastereomers and called cyclic hemiketals resulting from addition of the group of to the bond This is one example of the power of nmr to solve subtle structural problems Although the principal isotopes of and have magnetic properties because of the special character of all of these isotopes they act in organic compounds as though they were nonmagnetic Resonance in the sense used here means that the radiofrequency absorption takes place at specified resonance frequencies However you will see that almost all of the forms of spectroscopy we discuss in this book involve resonance absorption in the same sense Here is in per gauss physicists usually define in radians per second per gauss From the Greek prefix dia meaning through across The opposite of diamagnetic is paramagnetic para meaning alongside We shall use this term later In addition to giving better separation of the lines and clearer spectra going to higher fields also has the beneficial effect of increasing the proportions of the nuclei in the state thereby giving more intense easiertodetect resonances Many other protonshift values are available in NMR Spectra Catalog Volume and Varian Associates Palo Alto Calif If two rings were present this also would give four hydrogens less than the alkane However two rings are not possible with only three carbons References John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following

BondsIonic BondsSummaryExercisesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective Draw interpret and convert between Lewis Kekule Condensed and Bondline Structures Note The review of general chemistry in sections is integrated into the above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and For organic chemistry the emphasis is on the chemistry of carbon The chemistry of carbon becomes more interesting when carbon is bonded to oxygen andor nitrogen or other heteroatoms atoms that are NOT carbon or hydrogen Therefore the octet rule is a strong factor in organic chemistry and is only violated by noncarbon elements like hydrogen boron aluminum sulfur and phosphorus Why are some substances chemically bonded molecules and others are an association of ions The answer to this question depends upon the electronic structures of the atoms and nature of the chemical forces within the compounds Although there are no sharply defined boundaries chemical bonds are typically classified into three main types ionic bonds covalent bonds and metallic bonds In this chapter each type of bond will be discussed and the general properties found in typical substances in which the bond type occurs Ionic bonds results from electrostatic forces that exist between ions of opposite charge These bonds typically involves a metal with a nonmetal Covalent bonds result from the sharing of electrons between two atoms The bonds typically involves one nonmetallic element with another Metallic bonds These bonds are found in solid metals copper iron aluminum with each metal bonded to several neighboring groups and bonding electrons free to move throughout the dimensional structure Figure G N Lewis and the Octet Rule a Lewis is working in the laboratory b In Lewiss original sketch for the octet rule he initially placed the electrons at the corners of a cube rather than placing them as we do now The Octet Rule In Richard Abegg formulated what is now known as Abeggs rule which states that the difference between the maximum positive and negative valences of an element is frequently eight This rule was used later in when Gilbert N Lewis formulated the octet rule in his cubical atom theory The octet rule refers to the tendency of atoms to prefer to have eight electrons in the valence shell When atoms have fewer than eight electrons they tend to react and form more stable compounds Atoms will react to get in the most stable state possible A complete octet is very stable because all orbitals will be full Atoms with greater stability have less energy so a reaction that increases the stability of the atoms will release energy in the form of heat or light reactions that decrease stability must absorb energy getting colder The Octet Rule Atoms often gain lose or share electrons to achieve the same number of electrons as the noble gas closest to them in the periodic table When discussing the octet rule we do not consider d or f electrons Only the s and p electrons are involved in the octet rule making it a useful rule for the main group elements elements not in the transition metal or innertransition metal blocks an octet in these atoms corresponds to an electron configurations ending with sp Covalent Bonds Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons Hydrogen is a first shell element with only one valence electron so it can only form one bond creating a duet an exception to the octet rule With its four valence electrons carbon can form four bonds to create an octet Normally two electrons pairs up and forms a bond eg For most atoms there will be a maximum of eight electrons in the valence shell octet structure eg Figure Bonding in and methane The other tendency of atoms is to maintain a neutral charge Only the noble gases the elements on the rightmost column of the periodic table have zero charge with filled valence octets All of the other elements have a charge when they have eight electrons all to themselves The result of these two guiding principles is the explanation for much of the reactivity and bonding that is observed within atoms atoms seek to share electrons in a way that minimizes charge while fulfilling an octet in the valence shell Ionic Bonds Some atoms do not share electrons Energetically it is more favorable to fully gain or lose electrons to form ions Ionic compounds form through the eletrostatic attraction of the ions to create a crystal lattice The formula for table salt is NaCl It is the result of Na ions and Cl ions bonding together If sodium metal and chlorine gas mix under the right conditions they will form salt The sodium loses an electron and the chlorine gains that electron In the process a great amount of light and heat is released The resulting salt is mostly unreactive it is stable It will not undergo any explosive reactions unlike the sodium and chlorine that it is made of Why Referring to the octet rule atoms attempt to get a noble gas electron configuration which is eight valence electrons Sodium has one valence electron so giving it up would result in the same electron configuration as neon Chlorine has seven valence electrons so if it takes one it will have eight an octet Chlorine has the electron configuration of argon when it gains an electron The octet rule could have been satisfied if chlorine gave up all seven of its valence electrons and sodium took them In that case both would have the electron configurations of noble gasses with a full valence shell However their charges would be much higher It would be Na and Cl which is much less stable than Na and Cl Atoms are more stable when they have no charge or a small charge Ionic Bonds Example Lewis dot symbols can also be used to represent the ions in ionic compounds The reaction of cesium with fluorine for example to produce the ionic compound CsF can be written as follows No dots are shown on Cs in the product because cesium has lost its single valence electron to fluorine The transfer of this electron produces the Cs ion which has the valence electron configuration of Xe and the F ion which has a total of eight valence electrons an octet and the Ne electron configuration This description is consistent with the statement that among the main group elements ions in simple binary ionic compounds generally have the electron configurations of the nearest noble gas The charge of each ion is written in the product and the anion and its electrons are enclosed in brackets This notation emphasizes that the ions are associated electrostatically no electrons are shared between the two elements Noble Gases The noble gases rarely form compounds They have the most stable configuration full octet no charge so they have no reason to react and change their configuration All other elements attempt to gain lose or share electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration Summary Lewis dot symbols can be used to predict the number of bonds formed by most elements in their compounds One convenient way to predict the number and basic arrangement of bonds in compounds is by using Lewis electron dot symbols which consist of the chemical symbol for an element surrounded by dots that represent its valence electrons grouped into pairs often placed above below and to the left and right of the symbol The structures reflect the fact that the elements in period and beyond tend to gain lose or share electrons to reach a total of eight valence electrons in their compounds the socalled octet rule Hydrogen with only two valence electrons does not obey the octet rule Exercises Lewis Contributors and

HXContributors and Attributions Learning Objective predict the productsspecify the reagents for dihydroxylation of alkenes Epoxide ringopening reactions SN vs SN regioselectivity and stereoselectivity The nonenzymatic ringopening reactions of epoxides provides an oppourtunity to review the nucelophilic substitution mechansims Ringopening reactions can proceed by either SN or SN mechanisms depending on the nature of the epoxide and on the reaction conditions If the epoxide is asymmetric the structure of the product will vary according to which mechanism dominates When an asymmetric epoxide undergoes solvolysis in basic methanol ringopening occurs by an SN mechanism and the less substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under steric considerations and produces product B in the example below Conversely when solvolysis occurs in acidic methanol the reaction occurs by a mechanism with substantial SN character and the more substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under electrostatic considerations and produces product A in the example below These are both good examples of regioselective reactions In a regioselective reaction two or more different constitutional isomers are possible as products but one is formed preferentially or sometimes exclusively Let us examine the basic SN case first The leaving group is an alkoxide anion because there is no acid available to protonate the oxygen prior to ring opening An alkoxide is a poor leaving group and thus the ring is unlikely to open without a push from the nucleophile The nucleophile itself is potent a deprotonated negatively charged methoxide ion When a nucleophilic substitution reaction involves a poor leaving group and a powerful nucleophile it is very likely to proceed by an SN mechanism What about the electrophile There are two electrophilic carbons in the epoxide but the best target for the nucleophile in an SN reaction is the carbon that is least hindered This accounts for the observed regiochemical outcome Like in other SN reactions nucleophilic reactions take place with backside orientation relative to the leaving group resulting in inversion at the electrophilic carbon Probably the best way to depict the acidcatalyzed epoxide ringopening reaction is as a hybrid or cross between an SN and SN mechanism First the oxygen is protonated creating a good leaving group step below Electrostatic considerations have greater importance with a protonated intermediate As the carbonoxygen bond begins to break step positive charge builds on the more substituted carbon with greater carbocation stability Unlike in an SN reaction the nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic carbon step before a complete carbocation intermediate has a chance to form Reaction takes place preferentially from the backside like in an SN reaction because the carbonoxygen bond is still to some degree in place and the oxygen blocks reaction from the front side Notice however the regiochemical outcome is different from the basecatalyzed reaction In the acidcatalyzed process the nucleophile reacts with the more substituted carbon because it is this carbon that holds a greater degree of positive charge and electrostatics carbocation stability take a dominant role in determining the mechanism Example Predict the major products of the ring opening reaction that occurs when the epoxide shown below is treated with ethanol and a small amount of sodium hydroxide ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid Hint be sure to consider both regiochemistry and stereochemistry Solution Addition of HX Epoxides can also be opened by other anhydrous acids HX to form a trans halohydrin When both the epoxide carbons are either primary or secondary the halogen anion will attack the less substituted carbon and an SN like reaction However if one of the epoxide carbons is tertiary the halogen anion will primarily attack the tertialy cabon in a SN like reaction Example Exercise Given the following predict the product assuming only the epoxide is affected Remember stereochemistry Predict the product of the following similar to above but a different nucleophile is used and not in acidic conditions Remember stereochemistry Epoxides are often very useful reagents to use in synthesis when the desired product is a single stereoisomer If the following alkene were reacted with an oxyacid to form an epoxide would the result be a enantiomerically pure If not what would it be Answer Note that the stereochemistry has been inverted First look at the symmetry of the alkene There is a mirror plane shown here Then think about the mechanism of epoxidation with an oxyacid take for example mCPBA The mechanism is concerted so the original cis stereochemistry is not changed This leads to two epoxides However these two mirror images are actually identical due to the mirror plane of the cis geometry It is a meso compound so the final result is a single stereoisomer but not a single

section you should be able to describe the nature of planepolarized light describe the features and operation of a simple polarimeter calculate the specific rotation of a compound given the relevant experimental data Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below analyzer dextrorotatory levorotatory optically active planepolarized light polarimeter polarizer specific rotation cesfalpha_D Study Notes A polarizer is a device through which only light waves oscillating in a single plane may pass A polarimeter is an instrument used to determine the angle through which planepolarized light has been rotated by a given sample You will have the opportunity to use a polarimeter in the laboratory component of the course An analyzer is the component of a polarimeter that allows the angle of rotation of planepolarized light to be determined Specific rotations are normally measured at C and this property may be indicated by the symbol cesfalpha_D Sometimes the solvent is specified in parentheses behind the specific rotation value for example cesfalpha_D chloroform For liquids the specific rotation may be obtained using the neat liquid rather than a solution in such cases the formula is α D temp neat α ld where α is the observed rotation l is the path length of the cell measured in decimetres dm and d is the density of the liquid Identifying and distinguishing enantiomers is inherently difficult since their physical and chemical properties are largely identical Fortunately a nearly two hundred year old discovery by the French physicist JeanBaptiste Biot has made this task much easier This discovery disclosed that the right and lefthanded enantiomers of a chiral compound perturb planepolarized light in opposite ways This perturbation is unique to chiral molecules and has been termed optical activity Polarimetry Planepolarized light is created by passing ordinary light through a polarizing device which may be as simple as a lens taken from polarizing sunglasses Such devices transmit selectively only that component of a light beam having electrical and magnetic field vectors oscillating in a single plane The plane of polarization can be determined by an instrument called a polarimeter shown in the diagram below Monochromatic single wavelength light is polarized by a fixed polarizer next to the light source A sample cell holder is located in line with the light beam followed by a movable polarizer the analyzer and an eyepiece through which the light intensity can be observed In modern instruments an electronic light detector takes the place of the human eye In the absence of a sample the light intensity at the detector is at a maximum when the second movable polarizer is set parallel to the first polarizer α º If the analyzer is turned º to the plane of initial polarization all the light will be blocked from reaching the detector Chemists use polarimeters to investigate the influence of compounds in the sample cell on plane polarized light Samples composed only of achiral molecules eg water or hexane have no effect on the polarized light beam However if a single enantiomer is examined all sample molecules being righthanded or all being lefthanded the plane of polarization is rotated in either a clockwise positive or counterclockwise negative direction and the analyzer must be turned an appropriate matching angle α if full light intensity is to reach the detector In the above illustration the sample has rotated the polarization plane clockwise by º and the analyzer has been turned this amount to permit maximum light transmission The observed rotations of enantiomers are opposite in direction One enantiomer will rotate polarized light in a clockwise direction termed dextrorotatory or and its mirrorimage partner in a counterclockwise manner termed levorotatory or The prefixes dextro and levo come from the Latin dexter meaning right and laevus for left and are abbreviated d and l respectively If equal quantities of each enantiomer are examined using the same sample cell then the magnitude of the rotations will be the same with one being positive and the other negative To be absolutely certain whether an observed rotation is positive or negative it is often necessary to make a second measurement using a different amount or concentration of the sample In the above illustration for example α might be º or º rather than º If the sample concentration is reduced by then the positive rotation would change to º or º while the negative rotation would change to º and the correct α would be identified unambiguously Since it is not always possible to obtain or use samples of exactly the same size the observed rotation is usually corrected to compensate for variations in sample quantity and cell length Thus it is common practice to convert the observed rotation α to a specific rotation by the following formula where is the specific rotation is the cell length in dm is the concentration in gml designates that the light used is the line from a sodium lamp Compounds that rotate the plane of polarized light are termed optically active Each enantiomer of a stereoisomeric pair is optically active and has an equal but oppositeinsign specific rotation Specific rotations are useful in that they are experimentally determined constants that characterize and identify pure enantiomers For example the lactic acid and carvone enantiomers discussed earlier have the following specific rotations Carvone from caraway αD º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or dcarvone Carvone from spearmint αD º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or lcarvone Lactic acid from muscle tissue αD º this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or dlactic acid Lactic acid from sour milk αD º this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or llactic acid A mixture of enantiomers has no observable optical activity Such mixtures are called racemates or racemic modifications and are designated When chiral compounds are created from achiral compounds the products are racemic unless a single enantiomer of a chiral coreactant or catalyst is involved in the reaction The addition of HBr to either cis or transbutene is an example of racemic product formation the chiral center is colored red in the following equation CHCHCHCH HBr CHCHCHBrCH Chiral organic compounds isolated from living organisms are usually optically active indicating that one of the enantiomers predominates often it is the only isomer present This is a result of the action of chiral catalysts we call enzymes and reflects the inherently chiral nature of life itself Chiral synthetic compounds on the other hand are commonly racemates unless they have been prepared from enantiomerically pure starting materials There are two ways in which the condition of a chiral substance may be changed A racemate may be separated into its component enantiomers This process is called resolution A pure enantiomer may be transformed into its racemate This process is called racemization Enantiomeric Excess The optical purity is a comparison of the optical rotation of a pure sample of unknown stereochemistry versus the optical rotation of a sample of pure enantiomer It is expressed as a percentage If the sample only rotates planepolarized light half as much as expected the optical purity is Because R and S enantiomers have equal but opposite optical activity it naturally follows that a racemic mixture of two enantiomers will have no observable optical activity If we know the specific rotation for a chiral molecule however we can easily calculate the ratio of enantiomers present in a mixture of two enantiomers based on its measured optical activity When a mixture contains more of one enantiomer than the other chemists often use the concept of enantiomeric excess ee to quantify the difference Enantiomeric excess can be expressed as For example a mixture containing R enantiomer and S enantiomer has a enantiomeric excess of R x Example Carvone The specific rotation of Scarvone is measured neat pure liquid sample no solvent The optical rotation of a neat sample of a mixture of R and S carvone is measured at Which enantiomer is in excess and what is its ee What are the percentages of R and Scarvone in the sample Answer The observed rotation of the mixture is levorotary negative counterclockwise and the specific rotation of the pure S enantiomer is given as dextrorotary positive clockwise meaning that the pure R enantiomer must be levorotary and the mixture must contain more of the R enantiomer than of the S enantiomer Rotation RS Mix FractionS Rotation S FractionR Rotation R Let Fraction S x therefore Fraction R x Rotation RS Mix xRotation S xRotation R x x Solve for x x and x Therefore the percentages of R and Scarvone in the sample are and respectively ee more abundant enantiomer Chiral molecules are often labeled according to the sign of their specific rotation as in Scarvone and Rcarvone or carvone for the racemic mixture However there is no relationship whatsoever between a molecules RS designation and the sign of its specific rotation Without performing a polarimetry experiment or looking in the literature we would have no idea that carvone has the R configuration and carvone has the S configuration Separation of Chiral Compounds As noted earlier chiral compounds synthesized from achiral starting materials and reagents are generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers Separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called resolution Since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution is extremely difficult Diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates Reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated For example if a racemic mixture of a chiral alcohol is reacted with a enantiomerically pure carboxylic acid the result is a mixture of diastereomers in this case because the pure R entantiomer of the acid was used the product is a mixture of RR and RS diastereomeric esters which can in theory be separated by their different physical properties Subsequent hydrolysis of each separated ester will yield the resolved enantiomerically pure alcohols The used in this technique are known as Exercises For each of the structures indicated below mark the chiral

this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or llactic acid A mixture of enantiomers has no observable optical activity Such mixtures are called racemates or racemic modifications and are designated When chiral compounds are created from achiral compounds the products are racemic unless a single enantiomer of a chiral coreactant or catalyst is involved in the reaction The addition of HBr to either cis or transbutene is an example of racemic product formation the chiral center is colored red in the following equation CHCHCHCH HBr CHCHCHBrCH Chiral organic compounds isolated from living organisms are usually optically active indicating that one of the enantiomers predominates often it is the only isomer present This is a result of the action of chiral catalysts we call enzymes and reflects the inherently chiral nature of life itself Chiral synthetic compounds on the other hand are commonly racemates unless they have been prepared from enantiomerically pure starting materials There are two ways in which the condition of a chiral substance may be changed A racemate may be separated into its component enantiomers This process is called resolution A pure enantiomer may be transformed into its racemate This process is called racemization Enantiomeric Excess The optical purity is a comparison of the optical rotation of a pure sample of unknown stereochemistry versus the optical rotation of a sample of pure enantiomer It is expressed as a percentage If the sample only rotates planepolarized light half as much as expected the optical purity is Because R and S enantiomers have equal but opposite optical activity it naturally follows that a racemic mixture of two enantiomers will have no observable optical activity If we know the specific rotation for a chiral molecule however we can easily calculate the ratio of enantiomers present in a mixture of two enantiomers based on its measured optical activity When a mixture contains more of one enantiomer than the other chemists often use the concept of enantiomeric excess ee to quantify the difference Enantiomeric excess can be expressed as For example a mixture containing R enantiomer and S enantiomer has a enantiomeric excess of R x Example The specific rotation of Scarvone is measured neat pure liquid sample no solvent The optical rotation of a neat sample of a mixture of R and S carvone is measured at Which enantiomer is in excess and what is its ee What are the percentages of R and Scarvone in the sample Solution The observed rotation of the mixture is levorotary negative counterclockwise and the specific rotation of the pure S enantiomer is given as dextrorotary positive clockwise meaning that the pure R enantiomer must be levorotary and the mixture must contain more of the R enantiomer than of the S enantiomer Rotation RS Mix FractionS Rotation S FractionR Rotation R Let Fraction S x therefore Fraction R x Rotation RS Mix xRotation S xRotation R x x Solve for x x and x Therefore the percentages of R and Scarvone in the sample are and respectively ee more abundant enantiomer Chiral molecules are often labeled according to the sign of their specific rotation as in Scarvone and Rcarvone or carvone for the racemic mixture However there is no relationship whatsoever between a molecules RS designation and the sign of its specific rotation Without performing a polarimetry experiment or looking in the literature we would have no idea that carvone has the R configuration and carvone has the S configuration Separation of Chiral Compounds As noted earlier chiral compounds synthesized from achiral starting materials and reagents are generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers Separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called resolution Since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution is extremely difficult Diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates Reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated For example if a racemic mixture of a chiral alcohol is reacted with a enantiomerically pure carboxylic acid the result is a mixture of diastereomers in this case because the pure R entantiomer of the acid was used the product is a mixture of RR and RS diastereomeric esters which can in theory be separated by their different physical properties Subsequent hydrolysis of each separated ester will yield the resolved enantiomerically pure alcohols The used in this technique are known as Exercise A sample with a concentration of gmL was placed in a cell with a length of cm The resulting rotation

ExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to predict the relative acidity of two organic molecules from their structures predict the relative basicity of two organic molecules from their structures This page explains the acidity of simple organic acids and looks at the factors which affect their relative strengths Organic acids as weak acids For the purposes of this topic we are going to take the definition of an acid as a substance which donates hydrogen ions protons to other things We are going to get a measure of this by looking at how easily the acids release hydrogen ions to water molecules when they are in solution in water An acid in solution sets up this equilibrium A hydronium ion is formed together with the anion negative ion from the acid This equilibrium is sometimes simplified by leaving out the water to emphasize the ionization of the acid If you write it like this you must include the state symbols aq Writing Haq implies that the hydrogen ion is attached to a water molecule as HO Hydrogen ions are always attached to something during chemical reactions The organic acids are weak in the sense that this ionization is very incomplete At any one time most of the acid will be present in the solution as unionized molecules For example in the case of dilute ethanoic acid the solution contains about of ethanoic acid molecules at any instant only about have actually ionized The position of equilibrium therefore lies well to the left Weak acid polarization Organic acids can usually can be characterized in electrostatic potential maps by the presence of of a positively polarized hydrogen atom shown in blue When looking at the maps below methanol has a slightly polarized OH bond and is considered very weakly acidic The OH bond in methyl amine is less polarized as shown by the lighter blue color around the hydrogen making it less acidic than methanol However the CH bond in ethane lack virtually any polarity as shown by the lack of a blue color making it nonacidic The following discussion will explain the difference in acidity of these and other organic molecules molecules Comparing the strengths of weak acids Acid strength is strongly correlated to stability of the conjugate base that will form by removing a proton In order to analyze how acidic a molecule is likely to be then you need to estimate the stability of its conjugate base Stabilization of the Conjugate Base Four Main Considerations Size and electronegativity of the atom holding the charge Can the charge be delocalized by resonance Are there any inductive effects Hybridization of orbital holding the charge These considerations are listed in order of importance and are explained individually but must be looked at collectively Size and Electronegativity Effects in Acidity When comparing elements it depends on the positional relationship of the elements on the periodic table When moving a period aka across a row of the main group elements the valence electrons all occupy orbitals in the same shell These electrons have comparable energy so this factor does not help us discern differences relative stability Differences in electronegativity are now the dominant factor This trend is shown when comparing the pKa values of ethane methyl amine and methanol which reflects the relative electonegativities of the C N O The key to understanding this trend is to consider the hypothetical conjugate base in each case the more stable the conjugate base the stronger the acid In general the more electronegative an atom the better it is able to bear a negative charge In the ethyl anion the negative charge is borne by carbon in the methylamine anion a nitrogen and in the methoxide anion an oxygeny Remember the periodic trend in electronegativity it also increases as we move from left to right along a row meaning that oxygen is the most electronegative of three elements being considered This makes the negative charge on the methoxide anion the most stable of the three conjugate bases and methanol the strongest of the three acids Likewise carbon is the least eletronegative making ethane the weakest of the three acids Within a Group aka down a column As we move down the periodic table the electrons are occupying higher energy subshells creating a larger atomic size and volume As the volume of an element increases any negative charge present tends to become more spread out which decreases electron density and increases stability The figure below shows spheres representing the atoms of the s and p blocks from the periodic table to scale showing the two trends for the atomic radius Figure Atomic Radii Trends on the Periodic Table Although there are some reversals in the trend eg see Po in the bottom row atoms generally get smaller as you go across the periodic table and larger as you go down any one column Numbers are the radii in pm This relationship of atomic size and electron density is illustrated when we compare the relative acidities of methanol CHOH with methanethiol CHSH The lower pKa value of for methanethiol indicates that it is a stronger acid than methanol with a pKa value of It is important to remember that neither compound is considered an acid These relationships become useful when trying to deprotonate compounds to increase their chemical reactivity in nonaqueous reaction conditions methanol ionization methanethiol ionization The difference in size can easilty be seen when looking at the electrostatic potential maps for methanol Left and methanethiol Right The sulfur atom methanethiol is larger than the oxygen atom in methanol The larger size of sulfur will be better able to delocalize and stabelize the negative charge in its conjugate base metanethiolate Resonance Effects in Acidity This section will focus on how the resonance structures of different organic groups contributes to their relative acidity even though the same element acts as the proton donor When evaluating conjugate bases for the presence of resonance contributors remember to look for movable electrons lone pairs and pi bonding electrons Delocalizing electrons over two or more atoms spreads out the electron density increasing the stability of the conjugate base and increasing the acidity of the corresponding acid A classic example compares the relative acidity of ethanol and acetic acid but the conclusions we reach will be equally valid for all alcohol and carboxylic acid groups Despite the fact that they are both oxygen acids the pKa values of ethanol and acetic acid are very different In both species the negative charge on the conjugate base is held by an oxygen so periodic trends cannot be invoked For acetic acid however there is a key difference a resonance contributor can be drawn in which the negative charge is drawn on the second oxygen of the group The two resonance forms for the conjugate base are equal in energy according to our rules of resonance Section What this means is that the negative charge on the acetate ion is not located on one oxygen or the other rather it is shared between the two Chemists use the term delocalization of charge to describe this situation In the ethoxide ion by contrast the negative charge is locked on the single oxygen This stabilization leads to a markedly increased acidity The delocalization of charge by resonance has a very powerful effect on the reactivity of organic molecules enough to account for the difference of nearly pKa units between ethanol and acetic acid and remember pKa is a log expression so we are talking about a difference of over between the acidity constants for the two molecules The acetate ion is much more stable than the ethoxide ion due to the effects of resonance delocalization The effects of conjugation can be seen when comparing the electrostatic potential maps of ethanol and acetic acid Conjugation creates a greater polarization in the OH bond in acetic acid as shown by its darker blue color Why is Phenol Acidic Compounds like alcohols and phenol which contain an OH group attached to a hydrocarbon are very weak acids Alcohols are so weakly acidic that for normal lab purposes their acidity can be virtually ignored However phenol is sufficiently acidic for it to have recognizably acidic properties even if it is still a very weak acid A hydrogen ion can break away from the OH group and transfer to a base For example in aqueous solution Since phenol is a very weak acid the position of equilibrium lies well to the left However phenol can lose a hydrogen ion because the phenoxide ion or phenolate ion the two terms can be used interchangeably formed is stabilized due to resonance The negative charge on the oxygen atom is delocalized around the ring since one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom can be in a p orbital and overlap with the pi electrons on the benzene ring This overlap leads to a delocalization which extends from the ring out over the oxygen atom As a result the negative charge is no longer entirely localized on the oxygen but is spread out around the whole ion Spreading the charge around makes the ion more stable than it would be if all the charge remained on the oxygen However oxygen is the most electronegative element in the ion and the delocalized electrons will be drawn towards it That means that there will still be a lot of charge around the oxygen which will tend to attract the hydrogen ion back again That is why phenol is only a very weak acid This explains why phenol is a much stronger acid than cyclohexanol As can be seen in the following energy diagram resonance stabilization is increased for the conjugate base of phenol vs cyclohexanol after removal of a proton The resonance stabilization in these two cases is very different An important principle of resonance is that charge separation diminishes the importance of contributors to the resonance hybrid The contributing structures to the phenol hybrid all suffer charge separation resulting in very modest stabilization of this compound On the other hand the phenolate anion is already charged and the canonical contributors act to disperse the charge resulting in a substantial stabilization of this species The conjugate bases of simple alcohols are not stabilized by charge delocalization so the acidity of these compounds is similar to that of water An energy diagram showing the effect of resonance on cyclohexanol and phenol acidities is shown on the right Since the resonance stabilization of the phenolate conjugate base is much greater than the stabilization of phenol itself the acidity of phenol relative to cyclohexanol is increased Supporting evidence that the phenolate negative charge is delocalized on the ortho and para carbons of the benzene ring comes from the influence of electronwithdrawing substituents at those sites Acidity of hydrogen α alpha to carbonyl Alkyl hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbon atom in a α alpha position directly adjacent relative to a CO group display unusual acidity While the pKa values for alkyl CH bonds in is typically on the order of pKa values for these alpha hydrogens is more on the order of This is almost exclusively due to the resonance stabilization of the product carbanion called an enolate as illustrated in the diagram below The effect of the the stabilizing CO is seen when comparing the pKa for the α hydrogens of aldehydes ketones and esters Inductive Effects The inductive effect is an experimentally observed effect of the transmission of charge through a chain of atoms in a molecule resulting in a permanent dipole in a bond For example in a carboxylic acid group the presence of chlorine on adjacent carbons increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid group A chlorine atom is more electronegative than hydrogen and thus is able to induce or pull electron density towards itself away from the carboxylate group This further spreads out the electron density of the conjugate base which has a stabilizing effect In this context the chlorine substituent is called an electronwithdrawing group Notice that the pKalowering effect of each chlorine atom while significant is not as dramatic as the delocalizing resonance effect illustrated by the difference in pKa values between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid In general resonance effects are more powerful than inductive effects Compare the pKa values of acetic acid and its mono di and trichlorinated derivatives The inductive effects of chlorine can be clearly seen when looking at the electrostatic potential maps of acetic acid Left and trichloroacetic acid Right The OH bond in trichloroacetic acid is highly polarized as shown by the dark blue color This illustrates that tricholoracetic acid is a much stronger acid than acetic acid Because the inductive effect depends on electronegativity fluorine substituents have a more pronounced pKalowering effect than chlorine substituents In addition the inductive takes place through covalent bonds and its influence decreases markedly with distance thus a chlorine two carbons away from a carboxylic acid group has a decreased effect compared to a chlorine just one carbon away chloropropanoic acid has a pKa of while for chloropropanoic acid the pKa is Alkyl groups hydrocarbons are weak inductive electron donators In this case the inductive effect pushes electron density onto the conjugate base causing the electron density to become more concentrated and producing a destabilizing effect The inductive effects of alkyl groups causes a significant variation in the acidities of different carboxylic acids Notice that the inductive effect drops off after the alkyl chain is about three carbons long pKa HCOOH Methanoic Acid CHCOOH Ethanoic Acid or Acetic Acid CHCHCOOH Propanoic Acid CHCHCHCOOH Butanoic Acid Orbital Hybridization The hybridization of an orbital affects its electronegativity Within a shell the s orbitals occupy the region closer to the nucleus than the p orbitals Therefore the spherical s orbitals are more electronegative than the lobed p orbitals The relative electronegativity of hybridized orbitals is sp sp sp since the percentage of scharacter is decreasing as more porbitals are added to the hybrids This trend indicates the sp hybridized orbitals are more stable with a negative charge than sp hybridized orbitals The table below shows how orbital hybridization influences relative acidity Comparing the Strengths of Weak Bases Technically organic bases are characterized by the presence of an atom with lone pair electrons These lone pairs contain a high electron density which is shown red in the electrostatic potential maps and can bond to H Below are the maps of methanol methyl amine and acetone All three compounds can be protonated with a sufficiently strong acid Note that all three of these compounds also have the ability to donate a proton when reacted with a strong enough base Whether these compounds act as a acid or base depends on the conditions It is common to compare basicitys quantitatively by using the pKas of their conjugate acids rather than their pKbs Since pKa pKb the higher the pKa the stronger the base in contrast to the usual inverse relationship of pKa with acidity Recall that ammonia NH acts as a base because the nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons that can accept a proton The conjugate acid of most simple alkyl amines have pKas in the range to and their water solutions are basic have a pH of to depending on concentration This can be illustrated by the reaction below where an amine removes a proton from water to form substituted ammonium eg NH ions and hydroxide OH ions Amines are one of the only neutral functional groups which are considered basic This is a direct consequence of the presence of the unshared electron pair on the nitrogen The unshared electron pair is less tightly held by the nitrogen of an amine than the corresponding oxygen of an alcohol which makes it more available to act as a base As a specific example methylamine reacts with water to form the methylammonium ion and the OH ion Example Ammonia All of the have similarities to ammonia and so well start by looking at the reason for its basic properties For the purposes of this topic we are going to take the definition of a base as a substance which combines with hydrogen ions protons We are going to get a measure of this by looking at how easily the bases take hydrogen ions from water molecules when they are in solution in water Ammonia in solution sets up this equilibrium An ammonium ion is formed together with hydroxide ions Because the ammonia is only a weak base it doesnt hang on to the extra hydrogen ion very effectively and so the reaction is reversible At any one time about of the ammonia is present as unreacted molecules The position of equilibrium lies well to the left The ammonia reacts as a base because of the active lone pair on the nitrogen Nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen and so attracts the bonding electrons in the ammonia molecule towards itself That means that in addition to the lone pair there is a buildup of negative charge around the nitrogen atom That combination of extra negativity and active lone pair attracts the new hydrogen from the water When looking at the table below it is clear that the basicity of nitrogen containing compounds is greatly influenced by their structures The variance in the basicity of these compounds can mostly be explained by the effects of electron delocalization discussed above Table pKa of conjugate acids of a series of amines Compound NH CHCN pKa Inductive Effects in Nitrogen Basicity Alkylamines are more basic than ammonia since alkyl groups donate electrons to the more electronegative nitrogen This inductive effect makes the electron density on the alkylamine nitrogen greater than the nitrogen of ammonium That means that there will be a small amount of extra negative charge built up on the nitrogen atom That extra negativity around the nitrogen makes the lone pair even more attractive towards hydrogen ions Correspondingly primary secondary and tertiary alkyl amines are more basic than ammonia Making the nitrogen more negative helps the lone pair to pick up a hydrogen ion What about the effect on the positive methylammonium ion formed Is this more stable than a simple ammonium ion Compare the methylammonium ion with an ammonium ion In the methylammonium ion the positive charge is spread around the ion by the electronpushing effect of the methyl group The more you can spread charge around the more stable an ion becomes In the ammonium ion there is not any way of spreading the charge To summarize The nitrogen is more negative in methylamine than in ammonia and so it picks up a hydrogen ion more readily The ion formed from methylamine is more stable than the one formed from ammonia and so is less likely to shed the hydrogen ion again Taken together these mean that methylamine is a stronger base than ammonia Compound pKa NH CHNH CHNH CHN Resonance Effects in Nitrogen Basicity The resonance effect also explains why a nitrogen atom is basic when it is in an amine but not significantly basic when it is part of an amide group While the lone pair of electrons in an amine nitrogen is localized in one place the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is delocalized by resonance The lone pair is stabilized by resonance delocalization Heres another way to think about it the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is not available for bonding with a proton these two electrons are too stable being part of the delocalized pibonding system The electrostatic potential map show the effect of resonance on the basicity of an amide The map shows that the electron density shown in red is almost completely shifted towards the oxygen This greatly decreases the basicity of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen in an amide Aniline the amine analog of phenol is substantially less basic than an amine as evidenced by the pKa of the conjugate acids We can use the same reasoning that we used when comparing the acidity of a phenol to that of an alcohol In aniline the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic pi system making it less available for bonding and thus less basic In these cases you seem to be breaking the same oxygenhydrogen bond each time and so you might expect the strengths to be similar The most important factor in determining the relative acid strengths of these molecules is the nature of the ions formed You always get a hydronium ion so thats constant but the nature of the anion the negative ion varies markedly from case to case Exercises Exercise Select the more basic from each of the following pairs of compounds a b Answer a The lone pair of electrons on the amide nitrogen are less available to react with a proton b NaOH The hydroxide has a negative charge with three lone pairs of electrons that can react with a proton Exercise The methylbenzylammonium

between organic compounds that are Hbond donors versus Hbond acceptors Hbond donors vs Hbond acceptors Compounds with Hbonding as their dominant intermolecular force IMF are BOTH Hbond donors and Hbond acceptors They are Hbond donors because they have a highly polar hydrogen atom bonded to a strongly electronegative atom primarily nitrogen oxygen or fluorine NOF Because there is an equivalent partial negative charge on the atom bonded to hydrogen mostly NOF this atom can accept Hbonds from another atoms Since Hbond donors are ALWAYS Hbond acceptors we simplify communication to Hbond donor There are two Hbonding interactions for Hbond donors The strongly electronegative elements primarily nitrogen oxygen and fluorine will always form a relatively large partial negative charge when bonded with carbon These elements can accept Hbonds when they are part of the organic molecule In this situation there is only one Hbonding interaction The diagram below illustrates the similarities and differences between Hbond donors and Hbond acceptors Water and alcohols may serve as both donors and acceptors whereas ethers aldehydes ketones and esters can function only as acceptors Similarly primary and secondary amines are both donors and acceptors but tertiary amines function only as acceptors Exercise Classify the compounds below as Hbond donors Hbond acceptors or neither Answer Comparing Physical Properties of Hbond Donors vs Hbond Acceptors Once we are able to recognize compounds that can exhibit intermolecular hydrogen bonding the relatively high boiling points they exhibit become understandable The data in the following table serve to illustrate this point Compound Formula Mol Wt Boiling Point Melting Point dimethyl ether CHOCH ºC ºC ethanol CHCHOH ºC ºC propanol CHCHOH ºC ºC diethyl ether CHCHO ºC ºC propyl amine CHCHNH ºC ºC methylaminoethane CHCHNHCH ºC trimethylamine CHN ºC ºC ethylene glycol HOCHCHOH ºC ºC acetic acid CHCOH ºC ºC ethylene diamine HNCHCHNH ºC ºC Alcohols boil cosiderably higher than comparably sized ethers first two entries and isomeric º º ºamines respectively show decreasing boiling points with the two hydrogen bonding isomers being substantially higher boiling than the ºamine entries to Also OHO hydrogen bonds are clearly stronger than NHN hydrogen bonds as we see by comparing propanol with the amines As expected the presence of two hydrogen bonding functions in a compound raises the boiling point even further Acetic acid the ninth entry is an interesting case A dimeric species shown on the right held together by two hydrogen bonds is a major component of the liquid state If this is an accurate representation of the composition of this compound then we would expect its boiling point to be equivalent to that of a CHO compound formula weight A suitable approximation of such a compound is found in tetramethoxymethane CHOC which is actually a bit larger formula weight and has a boiling point of ºC Thus the dimeric hydrogen bonded structure appears to be a good representation of acetic acid in the condensed state A related principle is worth noting at this point Although the hydrogen bond is relatively weak ca to kcal per mole when several such bonds exist the resulting structure can be quite robust The hydrogen bonds between cellulose fibers confer great strength to wood and related materials For

certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below Markovnikovs rule regioselective regiospecific Study Notes Recall the definitions of primary secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms given in Section It follows that a primary carbocation is a carbocation in which the carbon atom carrying the positive charge is bonded to only one other carbon atom a secondary carbocation is one in which the carbon atom carrying the positive charge is bonded to two other carbon atoms and so on Addition to unsymmetrical alkenes In terms of reaction conditions and the factors affecting the rates of the reaction there is no difference whatsoever between these alkenes and the symmetrical ones described above The problem comes with the orientation of the addition in other words which way around the hydrogen and the halogen add across the double bond Orientation of addition If HCl adds to an unsymmetrical alkene like propene there are two possible ways it could add However in practice there is only one major product This is in line with Markovnikovs Rule which says When a compound HX is added to an unsymmetrical alkene the hydrogen becomes attached to the carbon with the most hydrogens attached to it already In this case the hydrogen becomes attached to the CH group because the CH group has more hydrogens than the CH group Notice that only the hydrogens directly attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond count The ones in the CH group are totally irrelevant Regioselective If more than one reaction could occur between a set of reactants under the same conditions giving products that are constitutional isomers and if one product forms in greater amounts than the others the overall reaction is said to be regioselective Say three reactions could occur between the hypothetical reactants A and B under the same conditions giving the constitutionally isomeric products C D and E There are two possibilities The three products form in equal amounts ie of the total product is C another D the remaining E These percentages are called relative yields of the products If this is what is observed the overall reaction between A and B is not regioselective One product forms in greater amounts than the others Say for example the relative yields of C D and E are and respectively If this is what is observed the overall reaction between A and B is regioselective eg Experimentally is the major product is the minor product Thus the overall reaction between and HBr is regioselective toward If more than one reaction could occur between a set of reactants under the same conditions giving products that are constitutional isomers and if only one product is observed the overall reaction is said to be regioselective or regiospecific eg The only observed product is Relative yields of and are and respectively Thus the overall reaction between and HBr is regiospecific toward Regiospecificity is merely the limiting case of regioselectivity All regiospecific reactions are regioselective but not all regioselective reactions are regiospecific see also chemoselective stereoselective Regioselective Exercises Questions Q Predict the products for

ozonide ozonolysis Study Notes Ozonolysis or ozonolysisreduction refers to the treatment of an alkene with ozone followed by a suitable reducing agent to break down complex doublebondcontaining compounds into smaller more easily identified products From the identity of the products formed it may be possible to deduce the structure of the original doublebondcontaining substance Ozonolysis will feature prominently in many of the roadmap problems that you will encounter in this course A molozonide is an unstable cyclic intermediate that is initially formed when an alkene reacts with ozone Alkenes can also be cleaved by other oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate However KMnO will carry the oxidation further than ozonolysis so products can be slightly different Note within the summary of the following reactions that ozonolysis produces aldehydes and ketones while KMnO can oxidize all the way to to carbon dioxide and carboxylic acid Diol cleavage is another example of a redox reaction periodic acid HIO is reduced to iodic acid HIO Ozonolysis is a method of oxidatively cleaving alkenes or alkynes using ozone a reactive allotrope of oxygen The process allows for carboncarbon double or triple bonds to be replaced by double bonds with oxygen This reaction is often used to identify the structure of unknown alkenes by breaking them down into smaller more easily identifiable pieces Ozonolysis also occurs naturally and would break down repeated units used in rubber and other polymers On an industrial scale azelaic acid and pelargonic acids are produced from ozonolysis Introduction The gaseous ozone is first passed through the desired alkene solution in either methanol or dichloromethane The first intermediate product is an ozonide molecule which is then further reduced to carbonyl products This results in the breaking of the CarbonCarbon double bond and is replaced by a CarbonOxygen double bond instead Reaction Mechanism Step The first step in the mechanism of ozonolysis is the initial electrophilic addition of ozone to the CarbonCarbon double bond which then form the molozonide intermediate Due to the unstable molozonide molecule it continues further with the reaction and breaks apart to form a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide molecule Step The carbonyl and the carbonyl oxide rearranges itself and reforms to create the stable ozonide intermediate A reductive workup could then be performed to convert convert the ozonide molecule into the desired carbonyl products References Vollhardt K Schore N Organic Chemistry Structure

can react with alkenes These reagents oxidize the alkene to different degrees and have different synthetic applications It can be helpful to describe the relative oxidative strength of the reagents Some reagents are so strong that the carbon chain will be cleaved at the alkene This reactivity can also be a useful distinction Before we explore the specific details of these different reaction pathways lets look at the overall patterns of functional group reactivity The are four levels of oxidation for alkenes The gentlest and least oxidative is epoxide oxacyclopropane formation in which the vinyl carbons share a single oxygen atom as a three membered ring Moderate oxidation will convert the alkene into a vicinal diol in which each vinyl carbon is bonded to an independent oxygen atom

acid as well as an appropriate solvent The peroxycarboxylic acid has the unique property of having an electropositive oxygen atom on the COOH group The reaction is initiated by the electrophilic oxygen atom reacting with the nucleophilic carboncarbon double bond The mechanism involves a concerted reaction with a fourpart circular transition state The result is that the originally electropositive oxygen atom ends up in the oxacyclopropane ring and the COOH group becomes COH Mechanism The mechanism is a concerted reaction between the alkene and peroxyacid As seen with other concerted reactions it is stereospecific a cisalkene will produce a cisepoxide and a trans alkene will produce a transepoxide Peroxycarboxylic acids are generally unstable An exception is MCPBA shown in the mechanism above Often abbreviated MCPBA it is a stable crystalline solid Consequently MCPBA is popular for laboratory use However MCPBA can be explosive under some conditions Peroxycarboxylic acids are sometimes replaced in industrial applications by monoperphthalic acid or the monoperoxyphthalate ion bound to magnesium which gives magnesium monoperoxyphthalate MMPP In either case a nonaqueous solvent such as chloroform ether acetone or dioxane is used This is because in an aqueous medium with any acid or base catalyst present the epoxide ring is hydrolyzed to form a vicinal diol a molecule with two OH groups on neighboring carbons For more explanation of how this reaction leads to vicinal diols see below However in a nonaqueous solvent the hydrolysis is prevented and the epoxide ring can be isolated as the product Reaction yields from this reaction are usually about The reaction rate is affected by the nature of the alkene with more nucleophilic double bonds resulting in faster reactions Example Since the transfer of oxygen is to the same side of the double bond the resulting oxacyclopropane ring will have the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene A good way to think of this is that the alkene is rotated so that some constituents are coming forward and some are behind Then the oxygen is inserted on top See the product of the above reaction One way the epoxide ring can be opened is by an acid catalyzed oxidationhydrolysis Oxidationhydrolysis gives a vicinal diol a molecule with OH groups on neighboring carbons For this reaction the dihydroxylation is anti since due to steric hindrance the ring is attacked from the side opposite the existing oxygen atom Thus if the starting alkene is trans the resulting vicinal diol will have one S and one R stereocenter But if the starting alkene is cis the resulting vicinal diol will have a racemic mixture of S S and R R enantiomers Exercise Predict the product of the reaction of cishexene with MCPBA

aqueous acid to give glycols that are often diastereomeric with those prepared by the synhydroxylation reaction described above Proton transfer from the acid catalyst generates the conjugate acid of the epoxide which is attacked by nucleophiles such as water in the same way that the cyclic bromonium ion described above undergoes reaction The result is antihydroxylation of the double bond in contrast to the synstereoselectivity of the earlier method In the following equation this procedure is illustrated for a cisdisubstituted epoxide which of course could be prepared from the corresponding cisalkene This hydration of an epoxide does not change the oxidation state of any atoms or groups Syn Dihydroxylation Osmium tetroxide oxidizes alkenes to give glycols through syn addition A glycol also known as a vicinal diol is a compound with two OH groups on adjacent carbons Introduction The reaction with is a concerted process that has a cyclic intermediate and no rearrangements Vicinal syn dihydroxylation complements the epoxidehydrolysis sequence which constitutes an anti dihydroxylation of an alkene When an alkene reacts with osmium tetroxide stereocenters can form in the glycol product Cis alkenes give meso products and trans alkenes give racemic mixtures is formed slowly when osmium powder reacts with gasoues at ambient temperature Reaction of bulk solid requires heating to C Since Osmium tetroxide is expensive and highly toxic the reaction with alkenes has been modified Catalytic amounts of OsO and stoichiometric amounts of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide are now used to eliminate some hazards Also an older reagent that was used instead of OsO was potassium permanganate Although syn diols will result from the reaction of KMnO and an alkene potassium permanganate is less useful since it gives poor yields of the product because of overoxidation Mechanism Electrophilic attack on the alkene Pi bond of the alkene acts as the nucleophile and reacts with osmium VIII tetroxide OsO electrons from the double bond flows toward the osmium metal In the process electron pairs move simultaneously Cyclic ester with Os VI is produced Reduction HS reduces the cyclic ester NaHSO with HO may be used Forms the syndiol glycol Example Dihydroxylation of ethylcycloheptene Hydroxylation of alkenes Dihydroxylated products glycols are obtained by reaction with aqueous potassium permanganate pH or osmium tetroxide in pyridine solution Both reactions appear to proceed by the same mechanism shown below the metallocyclic intermediate may be isolated in the osmium reaction In basic solution the purple permanganate anion is reduced to the green manganate ion providing a nice color test for the double bond functional group From the mechanism shown here we would expect synstereoselectivity in the bonding to oxygen and regioselectivity is not an issue When viewed in context with the previously discussed addition reactions the hydroxylation reaction might seem implausible Permanganate and osmium tetroxide have similar configurations in which the metal atom occupies the center of a tetrahedral grouping of negatively charged oxygen atoms How then would such a species interact with the nucleophilic pielectrons of a double bond A possible explanation is that an empty dorbital of the electrophilic metal atom extends well beyond the surrounding oxygen atoms and initiates electron transfer from the double bond to the metal in much the same fashion noted above for platinum Backbonding of the nucleophilic oxygens to the antibonding πorbital completes this interaction The result is formation of a metallocyclic intermediate as shown above Chemical Highlight Antitumor drugs have been formed by using dihydroxylation This method has been applied to the enantioselective synthesis of ovalicin which is a class of fungalderived products called antiangiogenesis agents These antitumor products can cut off the blood supply to solid tumors A derivative of ovalicin TNP is chemically stable nontoxic and noninflammatory TNP has been used in research to determine its effectiveness in treating cancer of the breast brain cervix

depending on the reaction environment Since alkynes are less stable than alkenens the reactions conditions can be gentler For examples alkynes form vicinal dicarbonyls in neutral permanganate solution For the alkene reaction to vicinal dialcohols the permanganate reaction requires a lightly basic environment for the reaction to occur During strong oxidation with ozone or basic potassium permanganate the alkyne is cleaved into two products Because at least one of the reaction products is a carboxylic acid it is important to consider the acidbase chemistry of the product in the reaction solution Carboxylic acids are deprotonated in basic solutions to carboxylates A second reaction step is required to protonate the carboxylate to the neutral form of the carboxylic acid The

Oxidative ReactionsReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective predict the productsspecify the reagents for oxidative cleavage of alkenes Overview Oxidative cleavage can occur by several different reaction pathways The cleavage can be strong or gentle depending on the reaction conditions andor the workup of the initial reaction product Both alkenes and alkynes can undergo cleavage reactions This section will focus on alkenes Gentle cleavage of alkenes occurs by two primary reaction pathways ozolysis with a reductive workup or syndihydroxylation followed by oxidation with perioidc acid Gentle cleavage will leave terminal carbons partially oxidized to aldehydes Strong cleavage of alkenes will fully oxidize terminal carbons to carboxylic acids Internal carbons become ketones by either reaction pathway Why so many reactions At first glance it may seem silly to have more than more reaction pathway for the same functional group conversion As this course proceeds it will become necessary to target reactions to a single functional group of an organic compound with multiple functional groups A particular reaction pathway can be advantageous when the reactivity of the entire molecule is considered not just a single functional group Gentle Cleavage SynDihydroxylation followed by Periodic Acid Alkenes can also be gently cleavage in a twostep reaction sequence in which the alkene first undergoes syndihydroxylation using cold slightly basic KMnO or OsOHO followed by oxidation with periodic acid HIO Both reaction sequences are shown below using methylcyclohexene as an example Gentle Cleavage Ozonolysis with a Reduction Workup Ozonolysis is a method of oxidatively cleaving alkenes or alkynes using ozone a reactive allotrope of oxygen The process allows for carboncarbon double or triple bonds to be replaced by double bonds with oxygen This reaction is often used to identify the structure of unknown alkenes by breaking them down into smaller more easily identifiable pieces Ozonolysis also occurs naturally and would break down repeated units used in rubber and other polymers On an industrial scale azelaic acid and pelargonic acids are produced from ozonolysis Ozonolysis Reaction Mechanism The gaseous ozone is first passed through the desired alkene solution in either methanol or dichloromethane The first intermediate product is an ozonide molecule which is then further reduced to carbonyl products This results in the breaking of the carboncarbon double bond and is replaced by a carbonoxygen double bond instead Step The first step in the mechanism of ozonolysis is the initial electrophilic addition of ozone to the carboncarbon double bond to form the molozonide intermediate Due to low stablility of molozonide it continues reacting and breaks apart to form a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide molecule Step The electrons of the carbonyl and the carbonyl oxide form the stable ozonide intermediate which can then undergo an oxidative or reductive workup to form the products of interest A reductive workup converts the ozonide molecule into the desired carbonyl products with aldehyde on terminal carbons An oxidative workup converts the ozonide molecule into the desired carbonyl products with carboxylic acids on terminal carbons The two reaction workup conditions are summarized below Exercises Answers Strong Cleavage from Strong Oxidative Reactions When the reaction conditions for potassium permanganate are warm then the oxidation reaction is stronger and cleavage occurs at the alkene with any terminal carbons fully oxidizing to carboxylic acids When the ozonolysis reaction is followed by an oxidative workup then any terminal carbons will oxidize fully to the carboxylic acid as shown in the example below The example for methylcycohexene is shown below Exercise What would you expect the products to be from the reaction of cispentene with mchloroperoxybenzoic acid Show the stereochemistry

Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Contributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to discuss how the results of work carried out by Biot and Pasteur contributed to the development of the concept of the tetrahedral carbon atom Because enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in achiral environments separation of the stereoisomeric components of a racemic mixture or racemate is normally not possible by the conventional techniques of distillation and crystallization In some cases however the crystal habits of solid enantiomers and racemates permit the chemist acting as a chiral resolving agent to discriminate enantiomeric components of a mixture As background for the following example it is recommended that the section on crystal properties be reviewed Tartaric acid its potassium salt known in antiquity as tartar has served as the locus of several landmark events in the history of stereochemistry In the French chemist Jean Baptiste Biot observed that tartaric acid obtained from tartar was optically active rotating the plane of polarized light clockwise dextrorotatory An optically inactive higher melting form of tartaric acid called racemic acid was also known A little more than a decade later young Louis Pasteur conducted a careful study of the crystalline forms assumed by various salts of these acids He noticed that under certain conditions the sodium ammonium mixed salt of the racemic acid formed a mixture of enantiomorphic hemihedral crystals a drawing of such a pair is shown on the right Pasteur reasoned that the dissymmetry of the crystals might reflect the optical activity and dissymmetry of its component molecules After picking the different crystals apart with a tweezer he found that one group yielded the known dextrorotatory tartaric acid measured by Biot the second led to a previously unknown levorotatory tartaric acid having the same melting point as the dextrorotatory acid Today we recognize that Pasteur had achieved the first resolution of a racemic mixture and laid the foundation of what we now call stereochemistry Optical activity was first observed by the French physicist JeanBaptiste Biot He concluded that the change in direction of planepolarized light when it passed through certain substances was actually a rotation of light and that it had a molecular basis His work was supported by the experimentation of Louis Pasteur Pasteur observed the existence of two crystals that were mirror images in tartaric acid an acid found in wine Through meticulous experimentation he found that one set of molecules rotated polarized light clockwise while the other rotated light counterclockwise to the same extent He also observed that a mixture of both a racemic mixture or racemic modification did not rotate light because the optical activity of one molecule canceled the effects of the other molecule Pasteur was the first to show the existence of chiral molecules Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University

organic functional groups see chapter for nomenclature b apply bonding theories to the structure of functional groups c visual functional groups in three dimensions d determine the polarity intermolecular forces of organic compounds Ultimately all of the information above will be integrated at the end of this chapter to predict solubilities and relative boiling points of organic compounds In future chapters these skills will help elucidate reaction mechanisms and pathways Sterics Electrostatics all roads lead to one or other Sterics and electrostatics are primary considerations when learning the reactions of organic chemistry Sterics is the spatial arrangement dimensional structure of atoms in a molecule or ion Electrostatics is the the charge distribution within a molecule or ion Depending on the reaction mechanism either sterics or electrostatics charge stabilization will play a dominant role in the rate determining step For concerted onestep reactions sterics will strongly influence the orientation of reactants in the transition state For twostep reactions there is typically a charged intermediate that requires stabilization for the reaction to proceed The intermediate with the lowest charge distribution is the most stable and reacts preferentially Sterics can be predicted using bonding theories Molecular orbital MO theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire molecule In valence bond theory VB theory atomic orbitals can be hybridized VB theory assumes that all bonds are localized bonds formed between two atoms by the donation of an electron from each atom As discussed in chapter this assumption is invalid because some atoms can bond using delocalized electrons through resonance VB theory does a good job of qualitatively describing the shapes of covalent compounds which is important in determining the sterics of the reactions While Molecular Orbital MO theory is good for understanding bonding in general and the electrostatics of a reactant intermediate or product Electrostatics are determined by applying the same concepts used to determine the relative acidity of compounds by evaluating the electron density of their conjugate bases The less charge the more stable an ion is The stability of ions is determined by the identity of the element being ionized charge delocalization via resonance inductive effects and orbital hybridization Inductive effects can be electron withdrawing aka electronegative or electron donating such

Alkenes float on top of water Solubility Alkenes are virtually insoluble in water but dissolve in organic solvents The reasons for this are exactly the same as for the alkanes Boiling Points The boiling point of each alkene is very similar to that of the alkane with the same number of carbon atoms Boiling points of alkenes depend on more molecular mass chain length The more intermolecular mass is added the higher the boiling point Intermolecular forces of alkenes gets stronger with increase in the size of the molecules In each case the alkene has a boiling point which is a small number of degrees lower than the corresponding alkane The only attractions involved are Van der Waals dispersion forces and these depend on the shape of the molecule and the number of electrons it contains

alkenes depends on the packaging of the molecules so the stereochemistry of the carboncarbon double bond has a strong influence on the relative melting points Alkenes have similar melting points to that of alkanes however in cis isomers molecules are package in a Ubending shape therefore will display a lower melting points to that of the trans isomers This effect is notable when comparing the melting points of fats and oils The differences in the melting points is strongly influenced by the long hydrocarbon tails Oils have a greater number of cis double bonds and exist as liquids at room

Attributions Learning Objective explain predict the physical properties of alkanes including relative bp and solubility in a mixture Overview Alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity all alkanes are colorless and odorless nonpolar compounds The relative weak London dispersion forces of alkanes result in gaseous substances for short carbon chains volatile liquids with densities around gmL for moderate carbon chains and solids for long carbon chains The differences in the physical states occurs because there is a direct relationship between the size and shape of molecules and the strength of the intermolecular forces IMFs Because alkanes have relatively predictable physical properties and undergo relatively few chemical reactions other than combustion they serve as a basis of comparison for the properties of many other organic compound families Lets consider their physical properties first Boiling Points Table describes some of the properties of some of the first straightchain alkanes Because alkane molecules are nonpolar they are insoluble in water which is a polar solvent but are soluble in nonpolar and slightly polar solvents Consequently alkanes themselves are commonly used as solvents for organic substances of low polarity such as fats oils and waxes Nearly all alkanes have densities less than gmL and are therefore less dense than water the density of HO is gmL at C These properties explain why oil and grease do not mix with water but rather float on its surface Table Physical Properties of Some Alkanes Molecular Name Formula Melting Point C Boiling Point C Density C Physical State at C methane CH gL gas ethane CH gL gas propane CH gL gas butane CH gL gas pentane CH gmL liquid hexane CH gmL liquid octane CH gmL liquid decane CH g mL liquid Note the change in units going from gases grams per liter to liquids grams per milliliter Gas densities are at atm pressure The boiling points for the straight chain isomers and isoalkanes isomers are shown to demonstrate that branching decreases the surfaces area weakens the IMFs and lowers the boiling point This next diagrams summarizes the physical states of the first six alkanes The first four alkanes are gases at room temperature and solids do not begin to appear until about but this is imprecise because different isomers typically have different melting and boiling points By the time you get carbons into an alkane there are unbelievable numbers of isomers Cycloalkanes have boiling points that are approximately K higher than the corresponding straight chain alkane There is not a significant electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen thus there is not any significant bond polarity The molecules themselves also have very little polarity A totally symmetrical molecule like methane is completely nonpolar meaning that the only attractions between one molecule and its neighbors will be Van der Waals dispersion forces These forces will be very small for a molecule like methane but will increase as the molecules get bigger Therefore the boiling points of the alkanes increase with molecular size Where you have isomers the more branched the chain the lower the boiling point tends to be Van der Waals dispersion forces are smaller for shorter molecules and only operate over very short distances between one molecule and its neighbors It is more difficult for short fat molecules with lots of branching to lie as close together as long thin molecules Example Structure dependent Boiling Points For example the boiling points of the three isomers of are pentane K methylbutane K dimethylpropane K The slightly higher boiling points for the cycloalkanes are presumably because the molecules can get closer together because the ring structure makes them tidier and less wriggly Solubility Alkanes both alkanes and cycloalkanes are virtually insoluble in water but dissolve in organic solvents However liquid alkanes are good solvents for many other nonionic organic compounds Solubility in Water When a molecular substance dissolves in water the following must occur break the intermolecular forces within the substance In the case of the alkanes these are the Van der Waals dispersion forces break the intermolecular forces in the water so that the substance can fit between the water molecules In water the primary intermolecular attractions are hydrogen bonds Breaking either of these attractions requires energy although the amount of energy to break the Van der Waals dispersion forces in something like methane is relatively negligible this is not true of the hydrogen bonds in water As something of a simplification a substance will dissolve if there is enough energy released when new bonds are made between the substance and the water to compensate for what is used in breaking the original attractions The only new attractions between the alkane and the water molecules are Van der Waals forces These forces do not release a sufficient amount of energy to compensate for the energy required to break the hydrogen bonds in water the alkane does not dissolve The energy only description of solvation is an oversimplification because entropic effects are also important when things dissolve The lack of water solubility can lead to environmental concerns when oils are spilled into natural bodies of water as shown below Oil Spills Crude oil coats the waters surface in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig sank following an explosion The leak was a mile below the surface making it difficult to estimate the size of the spill One liter of oil can create a slick hectares acres in size This and similar spills provide a reminder that hydrocarbons and water dont mix Source Photo courtesy of NASA Goddard MODIS Rapid Response Team httpwwwnasagovtopicsearthfeaturesoilspilloilahtml Solubility in organic solvents In most organic solvents the primary forces of attraction between the solvent molecules are Van der Waals either dispersion forces or dipoledipole attractions Therefore when an alkane dissolves in an organic solvent the Van der Waals forces are broken and are replaced by new Van der Waals forces The two processes more or less cancel each other out energetically thus there is no barrier to solubility Looking Closer Gas Densities and Fire Hazards Table indicates that the first four members of the alkane series are gases at ordinary temperatures Natural gas is composed chiefly of methane which has a density of about gL The density of air is about gL Because natural gas is less dense than air it rises When a naturalgas leak is detected and shut off in a room the gas can be removed by opening an upper window On the other hand bottled gas can be either propane density gL or butanes a mixture of butane and isobutane density about gL Both are much heavier than air density gL If bottled gas escapes into a building it collects near the floor This presents a much more serious fire hazard than a naturalgas leak because it is more difficult to rid the room of the heavier gas Also shown in Table are the boiling points of the straightchain alkanes increase with increasing molar mass This general rule holds true for the straightchain homologs of all organic compound families Larger molecules have greater surface areas and consequently interact more strongly more energy is therefore required to separate them For a given molar mass the boiling points of alkanes are relatively low because these nonpolar molecules have only weak dispersion forces to hold them together in the liquid state Looking Closer An Alkane Basis for Properties of Other Compounds An understanding of the physical properties of the alkanes is important in that petroleum and natural gas and the many products derived from themgasoline bottled gas solvents plastics and moreare composed primarily of alkanes This understanding is also vital because it is the basis for describing the properties of other organic and biological compound families For example large portions of the structures of lipids consist of nonpolar alkyl groups Lipids include the dietary fats and fatlike compounds called phospholipids and sphingolipids that serve as structural components of living tissues These compounds have both polar and nonpolar groups enabling them to bridge the gap between watersoluble and waterinsoluble phases This characteristic is essential for the selective permeability of cell membranes Tripalmitin a a typical fat molecule has long hydrocarbon chains typical of most lipids Compare these chains to hexadecane b an alkane with carbon atoms Exercise Without referring to a table predict which has a higher boiling pointhexane or octane Explain If mL of hexane were added to mL of water in a beaker

density and to a lesser extent to the melting point This makes it possible to estimate the properties of an unknown member of the series from those of its neighbors For example the boiling points of hexane and heptane are and respectively Thus a difference in structure of one group for these compounds makes a difference in boiling point of we would predict the boiling point of the next higher member octane to be which is close to the actual boiling point of Figure Dependence on of melting points boiling points and densities of continuouschain alkanes Members of a group of compounds such as the alkanes that have similar chemical structures and graded physical properties and which differ from one another by the number of atoms in the structural backbone are said to constitute a homologous series When used to forecast the properties of unknown members of the series the concept of homology works most satisfactorily for the highermolecularweight members because the introduction of additional groups makes a smaller relative change in the overall composition of such molecules This is better seen from Figure which shows Figure Dependence of difference in boiling and melting points between consecutive members of the series of continuouschain alkanes on number of carbon atoms how the differences in boiling points and melting points between consecutive members of the homologous series of continuouschain alkanes changes with the number of carbons Branchedchain alkanes do not exhibit the same smooth gradation of physical properties as do the continuouschain alkanes Usually there is too great a variation in molecular structure for regularities to be apparent Nevertheless in any one set of isomeric hydrocarbons volatility increases with increased branching This can be seen from the data in Table which lists the physical properties of the five hexane isomers The most striking feature of the data is the difference between the boiling points of hexane and dimethylbutane Homology hardly can be overestimated as a practical aid for the organic chemist to cope with the large numbers of compounds with which he works In the simplest approximation the members of a homologous series are assumed to have essentially the same properties except for the increases in boiling point and melting point as shown in Figure for alkanes This generally will be true except when the number of carbons is small and when the hydrocarbon chain has polar substituents To explain briefly consider compounds such as alcohols which have polar groups As we indicated in Section polarity causes molecules to associate with one another which decreases their volatility raises melting points increases solubility in polar liquids and decreases solubility in nonpolar liquids This explains why methanol is much less volatile and much more watersoluble than methane But we find that the watersolubility of alcohols falls off rapidly with the length of the carbon chain certainly faster than expected for a simple homologous series effect Whereas methanol and ethanol are completely soluble in water butanol is only slightly soluble This illustrates the conflicting properties conferred on molecules by polar groups compare to nonpolar hydrocarbon groups and points up that large changes in physical properties can be expected in the early part of a homologous series until the hydrocarbon chain is sufficiently long usually six or more carbons so that the hydrocarbon parts dominate over the polar parts of the molecules Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie

ExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to explain how dipole moments depend on both molecular shape and bond polarity predict whether a molecule will possess a dipole moment from the molecular formula or structure use the presence or absence of a dipole moment as an aid to deducing the structure of a given compound Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below dipole moment Study Notes You must be able to combine your knowledge of molecular shapes and bond polarities to determine whether or not a given compound will have a dipole moment Conversely the presence or absence of a dipole moment may also give an important clue to a compounds structure BCl for example has no dipole moment while NH does This suggests that in BCl the chlorines around boron are in a trigonal planar arrangement while the hydrogens around nitrogen in NH have a less symmetrical arrangement trigonal pyramidal Remember that the CH bond is assumed to be nonpolar Molecular Dipole Moments In molecules containing more than one polar bond the molecular dipole moment is just the vector combination of what can be regarded as individual bond dipole moments Mathematically dipole moments are vectors they possess both a magnitude and a direction The dipole moment of a molecule is therefore the vector sum of the dipole moments of the individual bonds in the molecule If the individual bond dipole moments cancel one another there is no net dipole moment Such is the case for CO a linear molecule Figure Each CO bond in CO is polar yet experiments show that the CO molecule has no dipole moment Because the two CO bond dipoles in CO are equal in magnitude and oriented at to each other they cancel As a result the CO molecule has no net dipole moment even though it has a substantial separation of charge In contrast the HO molecule is not linear Figure it is bent in threedimensional space so the dipole moments do not cancel each other Thus a molecule such as HO has a net dipole moment We expect the concentration of negative charge to be on the oxygen the more electronegative atom and positive charge on the two hydrogens This charge polarization allows HO to hydrogenbond to other polarized or charged species including other water molecules Figure How Individual Bond Dipole Moments Are Added Together to Give an Overall Molecular Dipole Moment for Two Triatomic Molecules with Different Structures a In CO the CO bond dipoles are equal in magnitude but oriented in opposite directions at Their vector sum is zero so CO therefore has no net dipole b In HO the OH bond dipoles are also equal in magnitude but they are oriented at to each other Hence the vector sum is not zero and HO has a net dipole moment The following is a simplified equation for a simple separated twocharge system that is present in diatomic molecules or when considering a bond dipole within a molecule This bond dipole µ Greek mu is interpreted as the dipole from a charge separation over a distance between the partial charges and or the more commonly used terms the orientation of the dipole is along the axis of the bond The units on dipole moments are typically debyes D where one debye is equal to x coulomb meters C m in SI units Consider a simple system of a single electron and proton separated by a fix distance The unit charge on an electron is X C and the proton electron are pm apart about the length of a typical covalent bond the dipole moment is calculated as is a key reference value and represents a pure charge of and separated by pm However if the charge separation were increased then the dipole moment increases linearly If the proton and electron were separated by pm If the proton and electron were separated by pm If the proton and electron were separated by pm Example Water The water molecule in Figure can be used to determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment From the electronegativities of oxygen and hydrogen the difference is e for each of the hydrogenoxygen bonds Next because the oxygen is the more electronegative atom it exerts a greater pull on the shared electrons it also has two lone pairs of electrons From this it can be concluded that the dipole moment points from between the two hydrogen atoms toward the oxygen atom Using the equation above the dipole moment is calculated to be D by multiplying the distance between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms by the charge difference between them and then finding the components of each that point in the direction of the net dipole moment the angle of the molecule is The bond moment of OH bond D so the net dipole moment is Dipoles with Differing Atoms In more complex molecules with more than one polar covalent bonds the threedimensional geometry and the compounds symmetry determine whether the molecule has a net dipole moment The manner in which the individual bonds contribute to the dipole moment of the molecule is nicely illustrated by the series of chloromethanes shown below The electronegative chlorine draws electrons towards itself Consider left panel in figure below which as a molecule is not polar in the sense that it doesnt have an end or a side which is slightly negative and one which is slightly positive The whole of the outside of the molecule is somewhat negative but there is no overall separation of charge from top to bottom or from left to right In contrast is a polar molecule right panel in figure above However although a molecule like CHCl has a tetrahedral geometry the atoms bonded to carbon are not identical Consequently the bond dipole moments do not cancel one another and the result is a molecule which has a dipole moment The hydrogen at the top of the molecule is less electronegative than carbon and so is slightly positive This means that the molecule now has a slightly positive top and a slightly negative bottom and so is overall a polar molecule Figure Bond polarities for CCl left and CHClright Electron densities in a molecule and the dipole moments that unbalanced electron distributions can produce are easily visualized with electrostatic potential maps In this example the blue area centered on carbon represents a electrondeficient positive area of the molecule the red area centered on the chlorine represents a electronabundant negative area This charge separation creates a net dipole moment of D which points in the direction of the chlorine In the evenly spaced red areas represent that there is no separation of charge in the molecule has a net dipole moment of zero which makes it a nonpolar molecule Figure Electrostatic potential maps and dipole moments for chloromethane and tetrachloromethane carbon tetrachloride Molecules with asymmetrical charge distributions have a net dipole moment Other examples of molecules with polar bonds are shown in Figure In molecules like BCl and CCl that have only one type of bond and a molecular geometries that are highly symmetrical trigonal planar and tetrahedral the individual bond dipole moments completely cancel and there is no net dipole moment However although a molecule like CHCl has a tetrahedral geometry the atoms bonded to carbon are not identical Consequently the bond dipole moments do not cancel one another and the result is a molecule which has a dipole moment Figure Molecules with Polar Bonds Individual bond dipole moments are indicated in red Due to their different threedimensional structures some molecules with polar bonds have a net dipole moment HCl CHO NH and CHCl indicated in purple whereas others do not because the bond dipole moments cancel BCl CCl PF and SF Table Dipole Moments of Some Compounds Compound Dipole Moment Debyes NaCl measured in the gas phase CHO CHCl HO CHOH NH CHNH CO CCl CH CHCH The table above give the dipole moment of some common substances Sodium chloride has the largest dipole listed D because it is an ionic compounds Even small organic compounds such as formaldehyde CHO D and methanol CHOH D have significant dipole moments Both of these molecules contain the strongly electronegative oxygen atom lone pair electrons which gives rise to considerable dipole moments In contrast many organic molecule have a zero dipole moment despite the fact that they are made up of polar covalent bonds In structures with highly symmetrical molecular geometries the polar bonds and the lone pair electrons can can exactly cancel leaving no overall charge separation

texts here Exercise Draw out the line structure of the molecule with a molecular formula of CCl Indicate all of the individual bond polarities and predict if the molecule is polar or nonpolar Answer Although the CCl bonds are rather polar the individual bond dipoles cancel one another in this symmetrical structure and does not have a net dipole momentClCCCl Exercise The following molecule has no net dipole moment explain Answer The hydroxyl groups are oriented opposite of one another and therefore the dipole moments would cancel one another out Therefore having a zero netdipole Exercise Within reactions with carbonyls such as a hydride reduction reaction the carbonyl is attacked from the carbon side and not the oxygen side Using knowledge of electronegativity explain why this happens Answer The oxygen is more electronegative than the carbon and therefore creates a dipole along the bond This leads to having a partial positive charge on the carbon and the reduction can take place Exercise Which molecules has a net dipole moment HS NHF BF Answer Strategy For each threedimensional molecular geometry predict whether the bond dipoles cancel If they do not then the molecule has a net dipole moment Solution The total number of electrons around the central atom S is eight which gives four electron pairs Two of these electron pairs are bonding pairs and two are lone pairs so the molecular geometry of HS is bent The bond dipoles cannot cancel one another so the molecule has a net dipole moment Difluoroamine has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry Because there is one hydrogen and two fluorines and because of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen the molecule is not symmetrical and the bond dipoles of NHF cannot cancel one another This means that NHF has a net dipole moment We expect polarization from the two fluorine atoms the most electronegative atoms in the periodic table to have a greater affect on the net dipole moment than polarization from the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen The molecular geometry of BF is trigonal planar Because all the BF bonds are equal and the molecule is highly symmetrical the dipoles cancel one another in threedimensional space Thus BF has a net dipole moment of zero Additional Exercises Determine whether each of the compounds listed below possesses a dipole moment For the polar compounds indicate the

groups are oriented opposite of one another and therefore the dipole moments would cancel one another out Therefore having a zero netdipole S and have a net dipoles S The oxygen is more electronegative than the carbon and therefore creates a dipole along the bond This leads to having a partial positive charge on the carbon and the reduction can take place Contributors and

completing this section you should be able to describe how differences in electronegativity give rise to bond polarity arrange a given series of the elements most often encountered in organic chemistry C H O N S P and the halogens in order of increasing or decreasing electronegativity without referring to a table of electronegativities predict the partial positive and partial negative ends of a given bond formed between any two of the elements listed in Objective above without the use of a table of electronegativities or a periodic table predict the partial positive and partial negative ends of a given bond formed between any two elements not listed in Objective above using a periodic table Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below electronegativity inductive effect polar covalent bond Study Notes Students often wonder why it is important to be able to tell whether a given bond is polar or not and why they need to know which atoms carry a partial positive charge and which a partial negative charge Consider the chloromethane CHCl molecule The carbon atom is shown as carrying a partial positive charge Now recall that opposite charges attract Thus it seems reasonable that the slightly positive carbon atom in chloromethane should be susceptible to attack by a negatively charged species such as the hydroxide ion OH This theory is borne out in practice hydroxide ions react with chloromethane by attacking the slightly positive carbon atom in the latter It is often possible to rationalize chemical reactions in this manner and you will find the knowledge of bond polarity indispensible when you start to write reaction mechanisms Note Because of the small difference in electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen the CH bond is normally assumed to be nonpolar Electronegativity Because the tendency of an element to gain or lose electrons is so important in determining its chemistry various methods have been developed to quantitatively describe this tendency The most important method uses a measurement called electronegativity represented by the Greek letter chi χ pronounced ky as in sky which is defined as the relative ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself in a chemical compound Elements with high electronegativities tend to acquire electrons in chemical reactions and are found in the upper right corner of the periodic table Elements with low electronegativities tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions and are found in the lower left corner of the periodic table Electronegativity of an atom is not a simple fixed property that can be directly measured in a single experiment In fact an atoms electronegativity should depend to some extent on its chemical environment because the properties of an atom are influenced by the neighboring atoms in a chemical compound Nevertheless when different methods for measuring the electronegativity of an atom are compared they all tend to assign similar relative values to a given element Figure shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century Linus Pauling In this scale a value of is arbitrarily given to the most electronegative element fluorine and the other electronegativities are scaled relative to this value In general electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group Thus the nonmetals which lie in the upper right tend to have the highest electronegativities with fluorine the most electronegative element of all EN as previously noted It is important to notice that the elements most important to organic chemistry carbon nitrogen and oxygen have some of the highest electronegativites in the periodic table EN respectively Metals on the left tend to be less electronegative elements with cesium having the lowest EN Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell Electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom in a particular molecule to attract electrons to itself The larger the electronegativity value the greater the attraction Figure Pauling scale electronegativities of elements Figure Visual representation of electronegativities Electronegativity and Bond Type The two idealized extremes of chemical bonding ionic bondingin which one or more electrons are transferred completely from one atom to another and the resulting ions are held together by purely electrostatic forcesand covalent bonding in which electrons are shared equally between two atoms Most compounds however have polar covalent bonds which means that electrons are shared unequally between the bonded atoms Electronegativity determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a polar covalent bond The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds the larger its electronegativity Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom thus the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge The greater the difference in electronegativity the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms Recall that a lowercase Greek delta δ is used to indicate that a bonded atom possesses a partial positive charge indicated by δ or a partial negative charge indicated by δ and a bond between two atoms that possess partial charges is a polar bond Figure The Electron Distribution in a Nonpolar Covalent Bond a Polar Covalent Bond and an Ionic Bond Using Lewis Electron Structures Electronrich negatively charged regions are shown in blue electronpoor positively charged regions are shown in red Whether a bond is ionic nonpolar covalent or polar covalent can be estimated by by calculating the absolute value of the difference in electronegativity ΔEN of two bonded atoms When the difference is very small or zero the bond is covalent and nonpolar When it is large the bond is polar covalent or ionic The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds HH HCl and NaCl are nonpolar polar covalent and ionic respectively The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies from completely equal pure covalent bonding to not at all ionic bonding Figure shows the relationship between electronegativity difference and bond type This table is just a general guide however with many exceptions The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent bonding between a metal and a nonmetal is often ionic Figure As the electronegativity difference increases between two atoms the bond becomes more ionic Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds The atoms in polyatomic ions such as OH NO and NH are held together by polar covalent bonds However these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds by combining with ions of opposite charge For example potassium nitrate KNO contains the K cation and the polyatomic NO anion Thus bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic resulting from the electrostatic attraction between the ions K and NO as well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in NO Example Electronegativity and Bond Polarity Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of proteins Using the electronegativity values in Table A arrange the following covalent bondsall commonly found in amino acidsin order of increasing polarity Then designate the positive and negative atoms using the symbols δ and δ CH CN CO NH OH SH Solution The polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the electronegativity difference increases The atom with the δ designation is the more electronegative of the two Table shows these bonds in order of increasing polarity Table Bond Polarity and Electronegativity Difference Bond ΔEN Polarity CH SH CN NH CO OH Visualizing Bonding Calculated charge distributions in molecules can easily be visualized by using electrostatic potential maps The color red is used to indicate electronrich regions of a molecule while the color blue is used to indicated electronpoor regions An easier method for visually representing electron displacement in a molecule uses a crossed arrow By convention the arrow point in the direction of the electronrich region of a molecule and away from the electronpoor An example is shown in the molecule fluoromethane The CF bond is polarized drawing the bonding electrons toward the more electronegative fluorine giving it a partial negative charge Consequently the bonding electrons are drawn away from the less electronegative carbon giving it a partial positive charge The the electronrich fluorine is shown as red in the electrostatic potential map and while the electronpoor carbon is shown as blue The crossed arrow points in the direction of the electronrich fluorine Chemists often use the term inductive effect to describe the shifting of electrons in a sigma by the electronegativity of atoms Relatively electronegative atoms such as fluorine tend to inductively draw electrons towards themselves and away from nearby atoms The inductive effect will be used to explain chemical reactivity in many situations in organic chemistry An excellent example of the inductive effect is seen when comparing the OH bond polarities of water HO and hypochlorous acid ClOH Replacing the less electronegative hydrogen EN in water with the more electronegative chlorine EN in hypochlorous acid creates a greater bond polarity The chlorine draws electrons away giving the hydrogen a greater partial positive charge This is shown in the electrostatic potential map as an increase in the blue color around hydrogen A spectrum of bonds There is no clearcut division between covalent and ionic bonds In a pure nonpolar covalent bond the electrons are held on average exactly half way between the atoms In a polar bond the electrons have been dragged slightly towards one end How far does this dragging have to go before the bond counts as ionic There is no real answer to that Sodium chloride is typically considered an ionic solid but even here the sodium has not completely lost control of its electron Because of the properties of sodium chloride however we tend to count it as if it were purely ionic Lithium iodide on the other hand would be described as being ionic with some covalent character In this case the pair of electrons has not moved entirely over to the iodine end of the bond Lithium iodide for example dissolves in organic solvents like ethanol not something which ionic substances normally do A general rule in organic chemistry is if the bond is between metal and a nonmetal atoms then the bond should be considered ionic Examples of this are the lithium carbon bond in methyl lithium and the potassium oxygen bond in potassium tertbutoxide Methyl Lithium potassium tertbutoxide Summary Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of both atoms In pure covalent bonds the electrons are shared equally In polar covalent bonds the electrons are shared unequally as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other The ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms there is no difference in electronegativity so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent When the electronegativity difference is very large as is the case between metals and nonmetals the bonding is characterized as ionic No electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a nonpolar covalent bond A small electronegativity difference leads to a polar covalent bond A large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond HClHOHOC Exercises Identify the positive and negative ends of each of the bonds shown below Which of the following elements is the more

Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below electrophile nucleophile polar reaction polarizability Study Notes You may wish to review Section before you begin this section The relative electronegativities of the elements shown in the periodic table should already be familiar Remember that it is the relative electronegativities that are important not the actual numerical values Make sure that you understand the polarity patterns of the common functional groups Do not try to memorize these polarities rather concentrate on why they arise You will encounter these group polarities so frequently that they will soon become second nature to you Halogens and the Character of the CarbonHalogen Bond With respect to electronegativity most halogens are more electronegative than carbon This results in a carbonhalogen bond that is polarized As shown in the image below the carbon atom has a partial positive charge while the halogen has a partial negative charge The following image shows the relationship between the halogens and electronegativity Notice as we move up the periodic table from iodine to fluorine electronegativity increases The following image shows the relationships between bond length bond strength and molecular size As we progress down the periodic table from fluorine to iodine molecular size increases As a result we also see an increase in bond length Conversely as molecular size increases and we get longer bonds the strength of those bonds decreases The influence of bond polarity Of the four halogens fluorine is the most electronegative and iodine the least That means that the electron pair in the carbonfluorine bond will be dragged most towards the halogen end Looking at the methyl halides as simple examples The electronegativities of carbon and iodine are equal and so there will be no separation of charge on the bond One of the important set of reactions of alkyl halides involves replacing the halogen by something else substitution reactions These reactions can involve the carbonhalogen bond breaking to give positive and negative ions The ion with the positively charged carbon atom then reacts with something either fully or slightly negatively charged Alternatively something either fully or negatively charged is attracted to the slightly positive carbon atom and pushes off the halogen atom You might have thought that either of these would be more effective in the case of the carbonfluorine bond with the quite large amounts of positive and negative charge already present But thats not so quite the opposite is true The thing that governs the reactivity is the strength of the bonds which have to be broken If is difficult to break a carbonfluorine bond but easy to break a carboniodine one The Carbonyl Group CO is prone to additions and nucleophillic attack because or carbons positive charge and oxygens negative charge The resonance of the carbon partial positive charge allows the negative charge on the nucleophile to attack the Carbonyl group and become a part of the structure and a positive charge usually a proton hydrogen attacks the oxygen Just a reminder the nucleophile is a good acid therefore likes protons so it will attack the side with a positive charge Before we consider in detail the reactivity of aldehydes and ketones we need to look back and remind ourselves of what the bonding picture looks like in a carbonyl Carbonyl carbons are sp hybridized with the three sp orbitals forming overlaps with orbitals on the oxygen and on the two carbon or hydrogen atoms These three bonds adopt trigonal planar geometry The remaining unhybridized p orbital on the central carbonyl carbon is perpendicular to this plane and forms a sidebyside pi bond with a p orbital on the oxygen The carbonoxygen double bond is polar oxygen is more electronegative than carbon so electron density is higher on the oxygen side of the bond and lower on the carbon side Recall that bond polarity can be depicted with a dipole arrow or by showing the oxygen as holding a partial negative charge and the carbonyl carbon a partial positive charge A third way to illustrate the carbonoxygen dipole is to consider the two main resonance contributors of a carbonyl group the major form which is what you typically see drawn in Lewis structures and a minor but very important contributor in which both electrons in the pbond are localized on the oxygen giving it a full negative charge The latter depiction shows the carbon with an empty p orbital and a full positive charge Some Carbonyl Compounds Nucleophilic Addition to Aldehydes and Ketones The result of carbonyl bond polarization however it is depicted is straightforward to predict The carbon because it is electronpoor is an electrophile it is a great target for attack by an electronrich nucleophilic group Because the oxygen end of the carbonyl double bond bears a partial negative charge anything that can help to stabilize this charge by accepting some of the electron density will increase the bonds polarity and make the carbon more electrophilic Very often a general acid group serves this purpose donating a proton to the carbonyl oxygen The same effect can also be achieved if a Lewis acid such as a magnesium ion is located near the carbonyl oxygen Unlike the situation in a nucleophilic substitution reaction when a nucleophile attacks an aldehyde or ketone carbon there is no leaving group the incoming nucleophile simply pushes the electrons in the pi bond up to the oxygen Alternatively if you start with the minor resonance contributor you can picture this as an attack by a nucleophile on a carbocation After the carbonyl is attacked by the nucleophile the negatively charged oxygen has the capacity to act as a nucleophile However most commonly the oxygen acts instead as a base abstracting a proton from a nearby acid group in the solvent or enzyme active site This very common type of reaction is called a nucleophilic addition In many biologically relevant examples of nucleophilic addition to carbonyls the nucleophile is an alcohol oxygen or an amine nitrogen or occasionally a thiol sulfur In one very important reaction type known as an aldol reaction the nucleophile attacking the carbonyl is a resonancestabilized carbanion In this chapter we will concentrate on reactions where the nucleophile is an oxygen or nitrogen Nucleophilic Addition to Aldehydes and Ketones Nucleophilic Substitution of RCOZ Z Leaving Group General reaction General mechanism Polarity Patterns in Other Common Functional Groups Nucleophile Nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond In both laboratory and biological organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates More specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide N anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles Of course carbons can also be nucleophiles otherwise how could new carboncarbon bonds be formed in the synthesis of large organic molecules like DNA or fatty acids Enolate ions section are the most common carbon nucleophiles in biochemical reactions while the cyanide ion CN is just one example of a carbon nucleophile commonly used in the laboratory Reactions with carbon nucleophiles will be dealt with in chapters and however in this chapter and the next we will concentrate on noncarbon nucleophiles When thinking about nucleophiles the first thing to recognize is that for the most part the same quality of electronrichness that makes a something nucleophilic also makes it basic nucleophiles can be bases and bases can be nucleophiles It should not be surprising then that most of the trends in basicity that we have already discussed also apply to nucleophilicity Electrophiles In the vast majority of the nucleophilic substitution reactions you will see in this and other organic chemistry texts the electrophilic atom is a carbon which is bonded to an electronegative atom usually oxygen nitrogen sulfur or a halogen The concept of electrophilicity is relatively simple an electronpoor atom is an attractive target for something that is electronrich ie a nucleophile However we must also consider the effect of steric hindrance on electrophilicity In addition we must discuss how the nature of the electrophilic carbon and more specifically the stability of a potential carbocationic intermediate influences the SN vs SN character of a nucleophilic substitution reaction Consider two hypothetical SN reactions one in which the electrophile is a methyl carbon and another in which it is tertiary carbon Because the three substituents on the methyl carbon electrophile are tiny hydrogens the nucleophile has a relatively clear path for backside attack However backside attack on the tertiary carbon is blocked by the bulkier methyl groups Once again steric hindrance this time caused by bulky groups attached to the electrophile rather than to the nucleophile hinders the progress of an associative nucleophilic SN displacement The factors discussed in the above paragraph however do not prevent a stericallyhindered carbon from being a good electrophile they only make it less likely to be attacked in a concerted SN reaction Nucleophilic substitution reactions in which the electrophilic carbon is sterically hindered are more likely to occur by a twostep dissociative SN mechanism This makes perfect sense from a geometric point of view the limitations imposed by sterics are significant mainly in an SN displacement when the electrophile being attacked is a sphybridized tetrahedral carbon with its relatively tight angles of o Remember that in an SN mechanism the nucleophile attacks an sphybridized carbocation intermediate which has trigonal planar geometry with open angles With this open geometry the empty p orbital of the electrophilic carbocation is no longer significantly shielded from the approaching nucleophile by the bulky alkyl groups A carbocation is a very potent electrophile and the nucleophilic step occurs very rapidly compared to the first ionization step Exercises Questions Q

reaction will proceed at a suitable rate a host of practical considerations are necessary for satisfactory operation These considerations include interference by possible side reactions that give products other than those desired the ease of separation of the desired product from the reaction mixture and costs of materials apparatus and labor We shall consider these problems in connection with the important synthetic reactions discussed in this book The chlorination of saturated hydrocarbons can be induced by light but also can be carried out at temperatures of about in the dark Under such circumstances the mechanism is similar to that of lightinduced chlorination except that the chlorine atoms are formed by thermal dissociation of chlorine molecules Solid carbon surfaces catalyze thermal chlorination possibly by aiding in the cleavage of the chlorine molecules Direct monohalogenation of saturated hydrocarbons works satisfactorily only with chlorine and bromine For the general reaction the calculated value is negative and very large for fluorine negative and moderate for chlorine and bromine and positive for iodine see Table With fluorine the reaction evolves so much heat that it may be difficult to control and products from cleavage of carboncarbon as well as of carbonhydrogen bonds may be obtained The only successful direct fluorination procedure for hydrocarbons involves diffusion of minute amounts of fluorine mixed with helium into liquid or solid hydrocarbons at low temperatures typically Dry Ice temperature As fluorination proceeds the concentration of fluorine can be increased The process is best suited for preparation of completely fluorinated compounds and it has been possible to obtain in this way amounts of and from dimethylpropane and tetramethylbutane corresponding to yields based on the fluorine used Bromine generally is much less reactive toward hydrocarbons than chlorine is both at high temperatures and with activation by light

I aCalculated from the bond energies of Table The chlorination of methane does not have to stop with the formation of chloromethane methyl chloride It is usual when chlorinating methane to obtain some of the higher chlorination products dichloromethane methylene chloride trichloromethane chloroform and tetrachloromethane carbon tetrachloride In practice one can control the degree of substitution to a considerable extent by controlling the methanechlorine ratio For example for monochlorination to predominate a high methanechlorine ratio is necessary such that the chlorine atoms react with and not with A Selectivity in Alkane Halogenation For propane and higher hydrocarbons for which more than one monosubstitution product is generally possible difficult separation problems bay arise when a particular product is desired For example the chlorination of methylbutane at gives all four possible monosubstitution products and On a purely statistical basis we may expect the ratio of products from to correlate with the number of available hydrogens at the various positions of substitution That is and would be formed in the ratio However as can be seen from Table the strengths of hydrogen bonds to primary secondary and tertiary carbons are not the same and from the argument given in Section E we would expect the weaker bonds to be preferentially attacked by The proportion of formed is about three times that expected on a statistical basis which is in accord with our expectation that the tertiary bond of methylbutane should be the weakest of the bonds See Table The factors governing selectivity in halogenation of alkanes follow The rates at which the various bonds of methylbutane are broken by attack of chlorine atoms approach as the temperature is raised above At higher temperatures both chlorine atoms and hydrocarbons become more reactive because of increases in their thermal energies Ultimately temperatures are attained where a chlorine atom essentially removes the first hydrogen with which it collides regardless of position on the hydrocarbon chain In such circumstances the composition of monochlorination products will correspond to that expected from simple statistics Bromine atoms are far more selective than chlorine atoms This is not unexpected because is endothermic whereas corresponding reactions with a chlorine atoms usually are exothermic data from Table Bromine removes only those hydrogens that are relatively weakly bonded to a carbon atom As predicted attack of on methylbutane leads mostly to bromomethylbutane some secondary bromide and essentially no primary bromides The selectivity of chlorination reactions carried on in solution is increased markedly in the presence of benzene or alkylsubstituted benzenes because benzene and other arenes form loose complexes with chlorine atoms This substantially cuts down chlorineatom reactivity thereby making the chlorine atoms behave more like bromine atoms B Chemical Initiation of RadicalChain Substitution It is possible to achieve chlorination of alkanes using sulfuryl chloride bp in place of chlorine The reaction has a radicalchain mechanism and the chains can be initiated by light or by chemicals usually peroxides Chemical initiation requires an initiator with a weak bond that dissociates at temperatures between Peroxides are good examples The bond is very weak and on heating dissociates to alkoxyl radicals which are reactive enough to generate the chainpropagating radicals from the reactants The exact sequence of chemical initiation is not always known but a plausible route in the present case would have abstract hydrogen from the alkane The propagation steps that would follow are Chlorination with sulfuryl chloride of alkanes with more than one kind of hydrogen gives a mixture of alkyl chlorides resembling that obtained with chlorine itself However in some circumstances the mixture of chlorides is not the same mixture obtained with chlorine itself and when this is true the hydrogenabstraction step probably involves rather than The alternative propagation steps then are Different product ratios are expected from and for the same reason that and lead to different product ratios Section A Other reagents that sometimes are useful halogenating agents in radicalchain reactions include Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C

EquilibriaExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to use pKa values to calculate Keq use pKa values to predict the equilibrium direction of an acidbase reaction Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below pKa Using pKa values to predict reaction Equilibria By definition the pKa value tells us the extent to which an acid will react with water as the base but by extension we can also calculate the equilibrium constant for a reaction between any acidbase pair Mathematically it can be shown that Keq for the acid base reaction in question ΔpKa where is the of product acid minus of reactant acid Consider a reaction between methylamine and acetic acid First we need to identify the acid species on either side of the equation On the left side the acid is of course acetic acid while on the right side the acid is methyl ammonium The specific pKa values for these acids are not on our very generalized pKa table but are given in the figure above Without performing any calculations you should be able to see that this equilibrium lies far to the righthand side acetic acid has a lower pKa is a stronger acid and thus it wants to give up its proton more than methyl ammonium does Doing the math we see that So is a very large number much greater than and the equilibrium lies far to the righthand side of the equation just as we had predicted If you had just wanted to approximate an answer without bothering to look for a calculator you could have noted that the difference in pKa values is approximately so the equilibrium constant should be somewhere in the order of or one million Using the pKa table in this way and making functional groupbased pKa approximations for molecules for which we dont have exact values we can easily estimate the extent to which a given acidbase reaction will proceed Example Show the products of the following acidbase reactions and

Attributions Learning Objective Predict relative strengths of acids and bases from their structure bonding and resonance Since compounds are neutral it can be difficult to evaluate and compare their overall stability without going through the tedious process of performing bond energy calculations When acidic compounds donate hydrogen ions or accepts electrons they become ionized It is much easier to compare ions because we can evaluate the charge density The lower the charge density the more stable the ion Conversely the higher the charge density the less stable the ion Charge density is analogous to density of matter We place charge in the numerator instead of mass and volume can still be found in the denominator The six strong acids HCl HBr HI HNO HSO HClO fully ionize to form the highly stable anions Cl Br I NO SO ClO respectively For the remaining weak acids HA we can determine their relative acidity by comparing the relative electron densities of their conjugate bases A the lower the electron density the more stable the conjugate base Structural Effects on Electron Density Four Considerations There are four main considerations for evaluating electron density Identity of the element or atoms holding the charge Can the charge be delocalized by resonance Are there any inductive effects Hybridization of orbital holding the charge These considerations are listed in order of importance and are explained individually but must be looked at collectively Identity of the Element When comparing the identity of the elements it depends on the positional relationship of the elements on the periodic table Within a Group aka down a column As we move down the periodic table the electrons are occupying higher energy subshells creating a larger atomic size and volume As the volume increases the electron density decreases Figure shows spheres representing the atoms of the s and p blocks from the periodic table to scale showing the two trends for the atomic radius Figure Atomic Radii Trends on the Periodic Table Although there are some reversals in the trend eg see Po in the bottom row atoms generally get smaller as you go across the periodic table and larger as you go down any one column Numbers are the radii in pm This relationship of atomic size and electron density is illustrated when we compare the relative acidities of methanol CHOH with methanethiol CHSH The lower pKa value of for methanethiol indicates that it is a stronger acid than methanol with a pKa value of It is important to remember that neither compound is considered an acid These relationships become useful when trying to deprotonate compounds to increase their chemical reactivity in nonaqueous reaction conditions Across a Period aka across a row As we move across a period of the main group elements the valence electrons all occupy orbitals in the same shell These electrons have comparable energy so this factor does not help us discern differences relative stability Differences in electronegativity are now the dominant factor This trend is shown when comparing the pKa values of methane ammonia water and hydrofluoric acid reflects the relative electonegativities of the C N O F Periodic trends First we will focus on individual atoms and think about trends associated with the position of an element on the periodic table Well use as our first models the simple organic compounds ethane methylamine and methanol but the concepts apply equally to more complex biomolecules such as the side chains of alanine lysine and serine We can see a clear trend in acidity as we move from left to right along the second row of the periodic table from carbon to nitrogen to oxygen The key to understanding this trend is to consider the hypothetical conjugate base in each case the more stable weaker the conjugate base the stronger the acid Look at where the negative charge ends up in each conjugate base In the ethyl anion the negative charge is borne by carbon while in the methylamine anion and methoxide anion the charges are located on a nitrogen and an oxygen respectively Remember the periodic trend in electronegativity section A it also increases as we move from left to right along a row meaning that oxygen is the most electronegative of the three and carbon the least The more electronegative an atom the better it is able to bear a negative charge Thus the methoxide anion is the most stable lowest energy least basic of the three conjugate bases and the ethyl anion is the least stable highest energy most basic We can use the same set of ideas to explain the difference in basicity between water and ammonia By looking at the pKavalues for the appropriate conjugate acids we know that ammonia is more basic than water Oxygen as the more electronegative element holds more tightly to its lone pair than the nitrogen The nitrogen lone pair therefore is more likely to break away and form a new bond to a proton it is in other words more basic Once again a more reactive stronger conjugate base means a less reactive weaker conjugate acid When moving vertically within a given column of the periodic table we again observe a clear periodic trend in acidity This is best illustrated with the halides basicity like electronegativity increases as we move up the column Conversely acidity in the haloacids increases as we move down the column In order to make sense of this trend we will once again consider the stability of the conjugate bases Because fluorine is the most electronegative halogen element we might expect fluoride to also be the least basic halogen ion But in fact it is the least stable and the most basic It turns out that when moving vertically in the periodic table the size of the atom trumps its electronegativity with regard to basicity The atomic radius of iodine is approximately twice that of fluorine so in an iodine ion the negative charge is spread out over a significantly larger volume This illustrates a fundamental concept in organic chemistry that is important enough to put in red Electrostatic charges whether positive or negative are more stable when they are spread out than when they are confined to one atom We will see this idea expressed again and again throughout our study of organic reactivity in many different contexts For now the concept is applied only to the influence of atomic radius on anion stability Because fluoride is the least stable most basic of the halide conjugate bases HF is the least acidic of the haloacids only slightly stronger than acetic acid HI with a pKa of about is one the strongest acids known More importantly to the study of biological organic chemistry this trend tells us that thiols are more acidic than alcohols The pKa of the thiol group on the cysteine side chain for example is approximately while the pKa for the hydroxl on the serine side chain is on the order of To reiterate acid strength increases as we move to the right along a row of the periodic table and as we move down a column Example Draw the structure of the conjugate base that would form if the compound below were to react with molar equivalent of sodium hydroxide Solution Is resonance possible to localize the charge In the previous section we focused our attention on periodic trends the differences in acidity and basicity between groups where the exchangeable proton was bound to different elements Now it is time to think about how the structure of different organic groups contributes to their relative acidity or basicity even when we are talking about the same element acting as the proton donoracceptor When evaluating conjugate bases for the presence of the resonance contributors remember to look for movable electrons as described in section of this chapter Delocalizing electrons over two or more atoms lowers the electron density The first model pair we will consider is ethanol and acetic acid but the conclusions we reach will be equally valid for all alcohol and carboxylic acid groups Despite the fact that they are both oxygen acids the pKa values of ethanol and acetic acid are very different What makes a carboxylic acid so much more acidic than an alcohol As before we begin by considering the conjugate bases In both species the negative charge on the conjugate base is held by an oxygen so periodic trends cannot be invoked For acetic acid however there is a key difference a resonance contributor can be drawn in which the negative charge is localized on the second oxygen of the group The two resonance forms for the conjugate base are equal in energy according to our rules of resonance section C What this means you may recall is that the negative charge on the acetate ion is not located on one oxygen or the other rather it is shared between the two Chemists use the term delocalization of charge to describe this situation In the ethoxide ion by contrast the negative charge is locked on the single oxygen it has nowhere else to go Now is the time to think back to that statement from the previous section that was so important that it got printed in bold font in its own paragraph in fact it is so important that well just say it again Electrostatic charges whether positive or negative are more stable when they are spread out than when they are confined to one atom Now we are seeing this concept in another context where a charge is being spread out in other words delocalized by resonance rather than simply by the size of the atom involved The delocalization of charge by resonance has a very powerful effect on the reactivity of organic molecules enough to account for the difference of over pKa units between ethanol and acetic acid and remember pKa is a log expression so we are talking about a difference of over between the acidity constants for the two molecules The acetate ion is that much more stable than the ethoxide ion all due to the effects of resonance delocalization The resonance effect also nicely explains why a nitrogen atom is basic when it is in an amine but not basic when it is part of an amide group Recall that in an amide there is significant doublebond character to the carbonnitrogen bond due to a second resonance contributor in which the nitrogen lone pair is part of a p bond While the electron lone pair of an amine nitrogen is stuck in one place the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is delocalized by resonance Notice that in this case we are extending our central statement to say that electron density in the form of a lone pair is stabilized by resonance delocalization even though there is not a negative charge involved Heres another way to think about it the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is not available for bonding with a proton these two electrons are too comfortable being part of the delocalized pibonding system The lone pair on an amine nitrogen by contrast is not part of a delocalized p system and is very ready to form a bond with any acidic proton that might be nearby Often it requires some careful thought to predict the most acidic proton on a molecule Ascorbic acid also known as Vitamin C has a pKa of There are four hydroxyl groups on this molecule which one is the most acidic If we consider all four possible conjugate bases we find that there is only one for which we can delocalized the negative charge over two oxygen atoms Example Rank the compounds below from most acidic to least acidic and explain your reasoning Inductive Effects The inductive effect is an experimentally observed effect of the transmission of charge through a chain of atoms in a molecule resulting in a permanent dipole in a bond Inductive effects decrease quickly with distance The inductive effect can be electron donating which helps stabilize positive charge Alkyl groups hydrocarbons are inductive electron donators The inductive effect can also be electron withdrawing Electronegativity indicates the strength of electron withdrawing induction Halogens are inductive electron withdrawing groups The effects of induction on relative acidity can also be seen when comparing acetic acid with trifluoroacetic acid The difference in acidity does not have to do with resonance delocalization because no additional resonance structures can be drawn for the fluorinated molecule The fluorine atoms inductively pull some of the electron density away from the carboxylate ion to further delocalize the negative charge of the conjugate base Compare the pKa values of acetic acid and its mono di and trichlorinated derivatives The presence of the chlorines clearly increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid group A chlorine atom is more electronegative than a hydrogen and thus is able to induce or pull electron density towards itself away from the carboxylate group In helping to further spread out the electron density of the conjugate base which as we know has a stabilizing effect In this context the chlorine substituent is called an electronwithdrawing group Notice that the pKalowering effect of each chlorine atom while significant is not as dramatic as the delocalizing resonance effect illustrated by the difference in pKa values between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid In general resonance effects are more powerful than inductive effects The inductive electronwithdrawing effect of the chlorines takes place through covalent bonds and its influence decreases markedly with distance thus a chlorine two carbons away from a carboxylic acid group has a decreased effect compared to a chlorine just one carbon away Exercise Rank the compounds below from most acidic to least acidic and explain your reasoning Solution Orbital Hybridization The hybridization of an orbital affects its electronegativity Within a shell the s orbitals occupy the region closer to the nucleus than the p orbitals Therfore the spherical s orbitals are more electronegative than the lobed p orbitals The relative electronegativity of hybridized orbitals is sp sp sp This trend indicates the sp hybridized orbitals are more stable with a charge than sp hybridized orbitals The table below shows how orbital hybridization compares with the identity of the atom when predicting relative acidity Guided Practice Lets practice by comparing the relative acidity of phenol with acetic acid Which compound is the stronger acid phenol or acetic acid To answer this question we draw all the relevant resonance contributors for each conjugate base phenoxide and acetate respectively Phenoxide has four resonance contributors but three of the contributors have a negative charge on a carbon atom while both resonance contributors for acetate have a negative charge on the more electronegative element oxygen There are no inductive effects or orbital hybridization differences to consider in this example so we would predict acetic acid to be the stronger acid The acetate ion is more stable than the phenoxide ion so we would expect acetic acid to be the stronger acid The pKa table below supports our prediction Acetic acid has a pKa of while phenol has a pKa of A word of caution when using the pKa table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair If you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia NH compared to that of ethoxide ion CHCHO for example the relevant pKa values to consider are the pKa of ammonium ion and the pKa of ethanol From these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base Do not make the mistake of using the pKa value of this is the pKa of ammonia acting as an acid and tells you how basic the NH ion is very basic Contributors and Attributions Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Layne A Morsch University of Illinois Springfield Contributors and Attributions Although this chapter is concerned with the chemistry of only one class of compounds saturated hydrocarbons or alkanes several fundamental principles are developed that we shall use extensively in later chapters The study of some of these principles has been associated traditionally more with physical chemistry than with organic chemistry We include them here at the beginning of out discussion of organic reactions because they provide a sound basis for understanding the key questions concerning the practical use of organic reactions Is the equilibrium point of a given reaction far enough toward the desired products to be useful Can conditions be found in which the reaction will take place at a practical rate How can unwanted side reactions be suppressed Initially we will be concerned with the physical properties of alkanes and how these properties can be correlated by the important concept of homology This will be followed by a brief survey of the occurrence and uses of hydrocarbons with special reference to the petroleum industry Chemical reactions of alkanes then will be discussed with special emphasis on combustion and substitution reactions These reactions are employed to illustrate how we can predict and use energy changes particularly the heat evolved or absorbed by a reacting system which often can be estimated from bond energies Then we consider some of the problems involved in predicting reaction rates in the context of a specific reaction the chlorination of methane The example is complex but it has the virtue that we are able to break the overall reaction into quite simple steps Before proceeding further it will be well to reiterate what an alkane is lest you be confused as to the difference between alkanes and alkenes Alkanes are compounds of carbon and hydrogen only without double bonds triple bonds or rings They all conform to the general formula and sometimes are called paraffin hydrocarbons openchain saturated hydrocarbons or acyclic hydrocarbons The nomenclature of alkanes has been discussed in Chapter and you may find it well to review Section before proceeding Contributors and

chapters we have shown how you can use ballandstick models to predict the general arrangements in space of organic molecules The sticks correspond to chemical bonds which we represent in structural formulas as lines or in Lewis structures as pairs of dots denoting shared pairs of electrons Remembering that electrons and nuclei are charged particles and that it is electrical forces of attraction and repulsion between the electrons and nuclei that determine the bonding perhaps we should be surprised that such simple mechanical models provide so much useful information What we will try to do in this chapter is to show you how the modern electronic theory of chemical bonding provides strong support for the use of ballandstick models for many organic molecules and also where it indicates that the models need to be modified or cannot properly represent the structural arrangements There are several qualitative approaches to bonding in polyatomic molecules but we shall discuss here the most widely used and currently popular approach This approach involves setting up appropriate atomic orbitals for the atoms and considering that each bond arises from the attractive electrical forces of two or more nuclei for a pair of electrons in overlapping atomic orbitals with each orbital on a different atom The geometry of the bonds is assumed to be determined by the geometry of the orbitals and by the repulsive forces between the electrons In the course of showing how this approach can be applied we shall discuss ways of formulating bonding and geometries for several important kinds of organic compounds Finally we will show you some of the results currently being obtained by sophisticated quantummechanical calculations which provide strong support for our qualitative formulations

Attributions Substitution reactions involve the replacement of one atom or group by another We already have described one very important type of substitution reaction the halogenation of alkanes Section in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen atom halogen The chlorination of dimethylpropane is an example Reactions of this type proceed by radicalchain mechanisms in which the bonds are broken and formed by atoms or radicals as reactive intermediates This mode of bondbreaking in which one electron goes with and the other with is called homolytic bond cleavage There are a large number of reactions usually occurring in solution that do not involve atoms or radicals but rather involve ions They occur by heterolytic cleavage as opposed to homolytic cleavage of electronpair bonds In heterolytic bond cleavage the electron pair can be considered to go with one or the other of the groups and when the bond is broken As one example is a group such that it has an unshared electron pair and also is a negative ion A heterolytic substitution reaction in which the bonding pair goes with would lead to and A specific substitution reaction of this type is that of chloromethane with hydroxide ion to form methanol In this chapter we shall discuss substitution reactions that proceed by ionic or polar mechanisms in which the bonds cleave heterolytically We also will discuss the mechanistically related elimination reactions that result in the formation of carboncarbon multiple bonds These reactions often are influenced profoundly by seemingly minor variations in the structure of the reactants in the solvent or in the temperature It is our purpose to show how these reactions can be understood and how they can be used to prepare other useful organic compounds But first it will be helpful to introduce the concepts of nucleophilic and electrophilic reagents and to consider the values for heterolytic bond breaking Contributors and Attributions John

permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions You now are starting the study of organic chemistry which is the chemistry of compounds of carbon In this introductory chapter we will tell you something of the background and history of organic chemistry something of the problems and the rewards involved and something of our philosophy of what is important for you to learn so that you will have a reasonable working knowledge of the subject whether you are just interested in chemistry or plan for a career as a chemist an engineer a physician a biologist and so on The subject is very large more than two million organic compounds have been isolated or prepared and characterized yet the number of guiding principles is relatively small You certainly will not learn everything about organic chemistry from this book but with a good knowledge of the guiding principles you will be able later to find out what you need to know either from the chemical literature or directly by experiment in the laboratory Unfortunately learning about and learning how to use organic chemistry is not a straightforward process wherein one step leads to another in a simple logical way like Euclidean geometry A more realistic analogy would be to consider yourself thrust into and required to deal successfully with a sizable group of strangers speaking a new and complex language In such a situation one has to make many decisions how much of the language to learn at the outset Which people are the best to interact with first Which will be the most important to know in the long run How well does one have to know each person How much does one have to know about the history of the group to understand their interactions These are difficult questions and a period of confusion if not anxiety is expected in any attempt to complete a task of this kind in a set brief period of time Clearly it would be difficult to learn all at once the language the people and the interactions between them Nonetheless this is pretty much what is expected of you in learning organic chemistry A number of approaches have been devised to help you become familiar with and use organic chemistry In terms of our analogy one way is to learn the language then the relationships between the people and finally well prepared to proceed to interact with the people singly and then in groups Such an approach may be logical in concept but is not to everyones taste as a way to learn Many of us do better with an interactive approach where language relationships and people are worked out more or less in concert with attendant misunderstandings and ambiguities What we will try to do is to introduce some of the important basic concepts and the elements of the language of organic chemistry then show how these are used in connection with various classes of compounds The initial round will be a fairly extensive one and you should not expect to be able to master everything at once This will take practice and we will provide opportunity for practice One of the appealing yet bothersome features of modern organic chemistry is its extraordinary vitality Unlike Euclidean geometry or classical mechanics it is evolving rapidly and many of the concepts introduced in this book are either new or have been drastically modified in the past ten years Every issue of the current chemical journals has material of such basic interest that one would like to include it in an introductory course Truly those who write organic textbooks write on water with no hope of producing the definitive book Things just change too fast Despite this one of the great ideas of modern civilization namely that organic compounds can be described in terms of more or less simple threedimensional molecular structures with atoms held together by chemical bonds has persisted for more than one hundred years and seems unlikely to be superseded no matter how much it is refined and modified Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions Organic chemists regardless of what languages they speak can communicate with one another about their chemical work simply by writing equations and structural formulas But this is a slow process if the molecules are complicated and is not well suited for conversation try describing a structural formula of a complex molecule to someone For more rapid and efficient communication we need to have names for compounds and we should have every reason to hope that after years the names now in use would be clear unambiguous easy to pronounce easy to spell and to remember as well as being amenable to arrangement in alphabetical order But even more we should hope that the names of organic compounds would contain enough information so we could generate the proper structures from them and conversely if we know the structures then the system would have simple enough rules that we could construct universally recognized and accepted names Unfortunately these splendid ideals have not yet been realized A good part of the problem is that people are resistant to change and especially resistant to changes in names To give an example the carboxylic acid commonly is known as acetic acid The name arises from the Latin word acetum for sour wine or vinegar and acetic acid is the principal constituent besides water of vinegar A similarly common compound is called acetone and in the ideal world acetone should be structurally related to acetic acid But acetone is and the name arises only because acetone is formed by strong heating of the calcium salt of acetic acid a reaction that is of no current importance whatsoever Better nomenclature systems use names based on the name of the hydrocarbon with the same number of carbons in the longest continuous chain in the molecule On this basis is related to ethane and is called ethanoic acid whereas with three carbons is related to propane and called propanone As far as possible we shall use these names as our first choices because organic chemistry is growing too fast to sustain the present chaos of nonsystematic nomenclatures in current use You might well ask why nonsystematic names persist for so long The reasons are complex and variable Alchemists intentionally used abstruse names and symbolism to disguise what they really were working with Chemical industry especially in the drug area has practiced much the same thing in using unintelligible trade names and codes for proprietary products Obviously everyone who handles or sells chemicals is not a chemist and to the nonchemist a short nonsystematic name will make more sense than a longer systematic name A salesman who markets tons of acrolein has little reason to adopt the systematic name propenal People probably persist in using nicknames for chemicals for much the same reason that they use nicknames for people Nicknames are less formal usually shorter and imply familiarity with the subject Another cogent reason to resist dramatic changes in chemical nomenclature is that it would make the current and earlier literature archaic or even unintelligible Universal adoption tomorrow of a nomenclature system different from the one we use here would render this book instantly obsolete As a result changes usually are made in small steps and may not be really effective until a generation or more passes Consider in this context the efforts to convert monetary systems and weights and measures to the decimal system Ideally every organic substance should have a completely descriptive systematic name to permit only one structural formula to be written for it This ideal has been approached closely in some of the current nomenclature systems but unfortunately truly systematic nomenclature for very complicated compounds is often hopeless for conversational or routine scriptorial purposes As a result we will at times resort to using common trivial names especially if it is impractical to do otherwise Clearly the description trimethylcyclohexenyldimethylnonatetraenol has phonetic disadvantages as a handy name for vitamin A A very important consideration for becoming more familiar with the systematic names is their increasing use in indexing systems When organic chemists dealt with relatively few compounds it was possible to accommodate a wide variety of special nomenclature customs However the rapid growth of knowledge in the past twenty years which probably has doubled the number of organic compounds has also enormously increased the burden on those who dedicate themselves to making this knowledge easily available to others by indexing the current literature A natural reaction is to discard common names in favor of more systematic ones and to develop numerical designations suitable for computer processing The difference in sizes of the Chemical Abstracts indexes for the years and for the current year should be convincing as to the need for having systematic names become more widely used and important But the fact remains that the naming systems used in indexing are not always the same as those used in practice and we are left with the necessity of having to know both Learning the nomenclature of organic compounds has many of the elements of learning a language be it Latin or Fortran Fortunately like a language it does not have to be learned all at once One can become familiar with naming of simple hydrocarbons then study their chemistry avoiding that part which involves compounds with as yet unlearned names proceed to the naming of alkenes study their chemistry and so on This is a very simple and natural way but can be inconvenient in a textbook if one wants to review the nomenclature of more than one class of compounds at a time In this chapter we consolidate the nomenclature of a number of classes of compounds an undertaking that may not seem very logical to someone who will soon be troubled enough with the chemistry of these compounds let alone their names We recommend however a thorough study now of alkane and haloalkane nomenclature Section followed by a more cursory examination of the rest of the chapter Then as unfamiliar names arise you can quickly review the basic rules for alkanes and proceed to the new class you have encountered The idea is to have many of the important rules in one place Nomenclature rules for other types of compounds are given in Chapter Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic

reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions The separation of mixtures of compounds to give the pure components is of great practical importance in chemistry Many synthetic reactions give mixtures of products and it is necessary for you to have a reasonably clear idea of how mixtures of compounds can be separated Almost all compounds of biochemical interest occur naturally as components of very complex mixtures from which they can be separated only with considerable difficulty Separations can be achieved by differences in physical properties such as differences in boiling point or by chemical means wherein differences in physical properties are enhanced by chemical reactions In this chapter we will consider some separations of compounds based on differences in physical properties Chemical procedures will be discussed elsewhere in connection with the appropriate classes of compounds Identification and structure determination are often closely allied to the problem of separation Once a compound is separated how do we determine whether it is identical to some previously known compound identification or if that cant be done how do we determine its chemical structure The spectroscopic properties of molecules have proven to be extremely informative for both identification and structure determination and this chapter is mainly concerned with the application of spectroscopy for such purposes We will give you now an overview of the spectroscopic properties of the major classes of organic compounds

the same names by all of the nomenclature rules we have given you so far Such isomers are different because their molecules have different arrangements of the atoms in space These are stereoisomers and this type of isomerism called stereoisomerism is of enormous importance to all areas of organic chemistry and biochemistry To understand stereoisomerism of carbon compounds we must understand the ways in which the bonds to carbon atoms are arranged in space As shown in Section A this depends on whether the carbon atoms form single double or triple bonds to another atom Thus four single bonds to a carbon form a tetrahedral arrangement two single bonds and one double bond to a carbon give a planar array with bond angles near while one single bond and one triple bond or two double bonds to a carbon are arranged linearly Finally if you have not studied the material already you may wish to return to the last part of Chapter and become acquainted with the nomenclature of cycloalkanes alkenes

the key terms below dehydration dehydrohalogenation elimination reaction Study Notes An elimination reaction is a reaction in which two or more atoms one of which is usually hydrogen are removed from adjacent atoms in the reactant resulting in the formation of a multiple bond The relationship between addition reactions and elimination reactions is shown in Figure below Figure Relationship of addition and elimination reactions Electrophilic Addition Alkenes are found throughout nature They form the basis of many natural products such as terpenes which play a variety of roles in the lives of plants and insects The CC bonds of alkenes are very different from the CO bonds that are also common in nature The CC bonds of alkenes are electronrich and nucleophilic in contrast to the electronpoor CO bonds of carbohydrates fatty acids and proteins That difference plays a role in how terpenes form in nature Alkenes or olefins are also a major product of the petroleum industry Reactions of alkenes form the basis for a significant porion of our manufacturing economy Commonly used plastics such as polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene are all formed through the reactions of alkenes These materials continue to find use in our society because of their valuable properties such as high strength flexibility and low weight Alkenes undergo addition reactions like carbonyls do Often they add a proton to one end of the double bond and another group to the other end These reactions happen in slightly different ways however Alkenes are reactive because they have a highlying pair of πbonding electrons These electrons are loosely held being high in energy compared to σbonds The fact that they are not located between the carbon nuclei but are found above and below the plane of the double bond also makes these electrons more accessible Alkenes can donate their electrons to strong electrophiles other than protons too Sometimes their reactivity pattern is a little different than the simple addition across the double bond but that straightforward pattern is what we will focus on in this chapter Elimination reactions Elimination reactions are possible by abstraction of a proton at positions that are next to a potential leaving group This type of elimination can be described by two model mechanisms it can occur in a single concerted step proton abstraction at Cα occurring at the same time as CβX bond cleavage or in two steps CβX bond cleavage occurring first to form a carbocation intermediate which is then quenched by proton abstraction at the alphacarbon These mechanisms termed E and E respectively are important in laboratory organic chemistry but are less common in biological chemistry As explained below which mechanism actually occurs in a laboratory reaction will depend on the identity of the R groups ie whether the alkyl halide is primary secondary tertiary etc as well as on the characteristics of the base Exercises Questions Q In

UsesExercisesReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective specify the reagents for the most efficient synthesis of alkyl halides using freeradical halogenation of alkanes Chapter or allylic halogenation of alkenes with NBS Free radical halogenation of alkanes Free radical halogenation of alkanes is the substitution of a single hydrogen on the alkane for a single halogen to form a haloalkane Light is required to initiate the radical formation and is a good example of a photochemical reaction The simplest example is shown below for methane reacting with chlorine in the presence of light to form chloromethane and hydrogen chloride gas Free radical halogenation of alkanes has been thoroughly explained in chapter The structure of the alkane is evaluated to choose between the high reactivity of chlorine Cl and the high selectivity of bromine Br Allylic Bromination When halogens are in the presence of unsaturated molecules such as alkenes the expected reaction is addition to the double bond carbons resulting in a vicinal dihalide halogens on adjacent carbons The reaction is studied in a later chapter To avoid halogen reactions at the alkene the halogen concentration is kept low enough that a substitution reaction occurs at the allylic position rather than addition at the double bond The product is an allylic halide halogen on carbon next to double bond carbons which is acquired through a radical chain mechanism Why Substitution of Allylic Hydrogens As the table below shows the dissociation energy for the allylic CH bond is lower than the dissociation energies for the CH bonds at the vinylic and alkylic positions This is because the radical formed when the allylic hydrogen is removed is resonancestabilized Hence given that the halogen concentration is low substitution at the allylic position is favored over competing reactions However when the halogen concentration is high addition at the double bond is favored because a polar reaction out competes the radical chain reaction Radical Allylic Bromination using NBS and light Preparation of Bromine low concentration NBS Nbromosuccinimide is the most commonly used reagent to produce low concentrations of bromine When suspended in tetrachloride CCl NBS reacts with trace amounts of HBr to produce a low enough concentration of bromine to facilitate the allylic bromination reaction Allylic Bromination Mechanism Step Initiation Once the preinitiation step involving NBS produces small quantities of Br the bromine molecules are homolytically cleaved by light to produce bromine radicals Step Propagation One bromine radical produced by homolytic cleavage in the initiation step removes an allylic hydrogen of the alkene molecule A radical intermediate is generated which is stabilized by resonance The stability provided by delocalization of the radical in the alkene intermediate is the reason that substitution at the allylic position is favored over competing reactions such as addition at the double bond The intermediate radical then reacts with a Br molecule to generate the allylic bromide product and regenerate the bromine radical which continues the radical chain mechanism If the alkene reactant is asymmetric two distinct product isomers are formed Step Termination The radical chain mechanism of allylic bromination can be terminated by any of the possible steps shown below Radical Allylic Chlorination Like bromination chlorination at the allylic position of an alkene is achieved when low concentrations of Cl are present The reaction is run at high temperatures to achieve the desired results Industrial Uses Allylic chlorination has important practical applications in industry Since chlorine is inexpensive allylic chlorinations of alkenes have been used in the industrial production of valuable products For example chloropropene which is necessary for the synthesis of products such as epoxy resin is acquired through radical allylic chlorination shown below Exercises Exercises Predict the two products of the allylic chlorination reaction of heptene What conditions are required for allylic halogenation to occur Why does this

AlkenesTerminal AlkynesQuestionsAnswersReferencesExercisesAnswersContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to write an equation to describe the preparation of an alkyne by the dehydrohalogenation of a vicinal dihalide or vinylic halide identify the alkyne produced from the dehydrohalogenation of a given vicinal dihalide or vinylic halide write a reaction sequence to show how the double bond of an alkene can be transformed into a triple bond identify the vicinal dihalide or vinylic halide needed to synthesize a given alkyne by dehydrohalogenation Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below vicinal dihalide vinylic halide Alkynes can be a useful functional group to synthesize due to some of their antibacterial antiparasitic and antifungal properties One simple method for alkyne synthesis is by double elimination from a dihaloalkane Introduction One case in which elimination can occur is when a haloalkane is put in contact with a nucleophile The table below is used to determine which situations will result in elimination and the formation of a π bond Table Elimination HaloalkaneNucleophile Reaction Type of Haloalkane Weak Base Poor Nucleophile Weak Base Good Nucleophile Strong Unhindered Base Strong Hindered Base Primary Unhindered E Branched E E Secondary E E E Tertiary E E E E Empty Box means no elimination or pi bond forms To synthesize alkynes from dihaloalkanes we use dehydrohalogenation The majority of these reactions take place using alkoxide bases other strong bases can also be used with high temperatures This combination results in the majority of the product being from the E mechanism E Mechanism Recall that the E mechanism is a concerted reaction occurs in step However in this step there are different changes in the molecule This is the reaction between Bromomethylpropane and Sodium Hydroxide This is a brief review of the E reaction For further information on why the reaction proceeds as it does visit the E reaction page Now if we apply this concept using halides that are vicinal meaning on adjacent carbons or geminal meaning on the same carbon the E reaction will take place twice resulting in the formation of bonds and thus an Alkyne Dihaloalkane Elimination This is a general picture of the reaction taking place without any of the mechanisms shown or With a terminal haloalkane the equation above is modified in that equivalents of base will be used instead of Lets look at the mechanism of a reaction between Dibromopentane with sodium amide in liquid ammonia Liquid ammonia is not part of the reaction but is used as a solvent Notice the intermediate of the alkyne synthesis It is stereospecifically in its anti form Because the second proton and halogen are pulled off the molecule this is unimportant to the synthesis of alkynes For more information on this see the page on preparation of alkenes from haloalkanes Preparation of Alkynes from Alkenes Lastly we will briefly look at how to prepare alkynes from alkenes This is a simple process using first halogenation of the alkene bond to form the dihaloalkane and next using the double elimination process to protonate the alkane and from the bonds This first process is gone over in much greater detail in the page on halogenation of an alkene In general chlorine or bromine is used with an inert halogenated solvent like chloromethane to create a vicinal dihalide from an alkene The vicinal dihalide formed is the reactant needed to produce the alkyene using double elimination as covered previously on this page Terminal Alkynes The acidity of terminal alkynes also plays a role in product determination when vicinal or geminal dihalides undergo base induced biselimination reactions The following example illustrates eliminations of this kind starting from dibromopentane prepared from pentene by addition of bromine The initial elimination presumably forms bromopentene since base attack at the more acidic and less hindered ºcarbon should be favored The second elimination then produces pentyne If the very strong base sodium amide is used the terminal alkyne is trapped as its sodium salt from which it may be released by mild acid treatment NB One cannot stop the reaction at the terminal alkyne with equivalents of strong base However if the weaker base KOH with heat is used for the elimination the terminal alkyne salt is not formed or is formed reversibly and the initially generated pentyne rearranges to the more stable pentyne via an allene intermediate Questions Question Why would we need bases for every terminal dihaloalkane instead of in order to form an alkyne Question What are the major products of the following reactions a

the base molecules will pull off the terminal hydrogen instead of one of the halides like we want Answer a Pentyne b Pentyne Answer Answer Bromine or chlorine can be used with different inert solvents for the halogenation This can be done using many different bases Liquid ammonia is used as a solvent and needs to be followed by an aqueous workup References Vollhardt Peter and Neil Shore Organic

Learning Objective Use and apply the language of Atomic Structure atomic number mass number isotopes The precise physical nature of atoms finally emerged from a series of elegant experiments carried out between and The most notable of these achievements was Ernest Rutherfords famous alpharay scattering experiment which established that Almost all of the mass of an atom is contained within a tiny and therefore extremely dense nucleus which carries a positive electric charge whose value identifies each element and is known as the atomic number of the element Almost all of the volume of an atom consists of empty space in which electrons the fundamental carriers of negative electric charge reside The extremely small mass of the electron the mass of the hydrogen nucleus causes it to behave as a quantum particle which means that its location at any moment cannot be specified the best we can do is describe its behavior in terms of the probability of its manifesting itself at any point in space It is common but somewhat misleading to describe the volume of space in which the electrons of an atom have a significant probability of being found as the electron cloud The latter has no definite outer boundary so neither does the atom The radius of an atom must be defined arbitrarily such as the boundary in which the electron can be found with probability Atomic radii are typically pm Figure The structure of the nuclear atom with a central nucleus and surrounding electrons The nucleus is itself composed of two kinds of particles Protons are the carriers of positive electric charge in the nucleus the proton charge is exactly the same as the electron charge but of opposite sign This means that in any electrically neutral atom the number of protons in the nucleus often referred to as the nuclear charge is balanced by the same number of electrons outside the nucleus The other nuclear particle is the neutron As its name implies this particle carries no electrical charge Its mass is almost the same as that of the proton Most nuclei contain roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons so we can say that these two particles together account for almost all the mass of the atom Because the electrons of an atom are in contact with the outside world it is possible for one or more electrons to be lost or some new ones to be added The resulting electricallycharged atom is called an ion Elements To date about different elements have been discovered by definition each is chemically unique To understand why they are unique you need to understand the structure of the atom the fundamental individual particle of an element and the characteristics of its components Atoms consist of electrons protons and neutrons Although this is an oversimplification that ignores the other subatomic particles that have been discovered it is sufficient for discussion of chemical principles Some properties of these subatomic particles are summarized in Table which illustrates three important points Electrons and protons have electrical charges that are identical in magnitude but opposite in sign Relative charges of and are assigned to the electron and proton respectively Neutrons have approximately the same mass as protons but no charge They are electrically neutral The mass of a proton or a neutron is about times greater than the mass of an electron Protons and neutrons constitute the bulk of the mass of atoms The discovery of the electron and the proton was crucial to the development of the modern model of the atom and provides an excellent case study in the application of the scientific method In fact the elucidation of the atoms structure is one of the greatest detective stories in the history of science Table Properties of Subatomic Particles Particle Mass g Atomic Mass amu Electrical Charge coulombs Relative Charge electron proton neutron In most cases the symbols for the elements are derived directly from each elements name such as C for carbon U for uranium Ca for calcium and Po for polonium Elements have also been named for their properties such as radium Ra for its radioactivity for the native country of the scientists who discovered them polonium Po for Poland for eminent scientists curium Cm for the Curies for gods and goddesses selenium Se for the Greek goddess of the moon Selene and for other poetic or historical reasons Some of the symbols used for elements that have been known since antiquity are derived from historical names that are no longer in use only the symbols remain to indicate their origin Examples are Fe for iron from the Latin ferrum Na for sodium from the Latin natrium and W for tungsten from the German wolfram Examples are in Table Table Element Symbols Based on Names No Longer in Use Element Symbol Derivation Meaning antimony Sb stibium Latin for mark copper Cu cuprum from Cyprium Latin name for the island of Cyprus the major source of copper ore in the

silver Ag argentum Latin for silver sodium Na natrium Latin for sodium tin Sn stannum Latin for tin tungsten W wolfram German for wolf stone because it interfered with the smelting of tin and was thought to devour the tin Recall that the nuclei of most atoms contain neutrons as well as protons Unlike protons the number of neutrons is not absolutely fixed for most elements Atoms that have the same number of protons and hence the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes All isotopes of an element have the same number of protons and electrons which means they exhibit the same chemistry The isotopes of an element differ only in their atomic mass which is given by the mass number A the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons The element carbon C has an atomic number of which means that all neutral carbon atoms contain protons and electrons In a typical sample of carboncontaining material of the carbon atoms also contain neutrons so each has a mass number of An isotope of any element can be uniquely represented as where X is the atomic symbol of the element The isotope of carbon that has neutrons is therefore The subscript indicating the atomic number is actually redundant because the atomic symbol already uniquely specifies Z Consequently is more often written as C which is read as carbon Nevertheless the value of Z is commonly included in the notation for nuclear reactions because these reactions involve changes in Z Figure Formalism used for identifying specific nuclide any particular kind of nucleus In addition to a typical sample of carbon contains C with neutrons and protons and a trace of C with neutrons and protons The nucleus of C is not stable however but undergoes a slow radioactive decay that is the basis of the carbon

symbols for its isotopes with and neutrons Answer and or more commonly and Summary The atom consists of discrete particles that govern its chemical and physical behavior Each atom of an element contains the same number of protons which is the atomic number Z Neutral atoms have the same number of electrons and protons Atoms of an element that contain different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes Each isotope of a given element has the same atomic number but a different mass number A which is the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons The relative masses of atoms are reported using the atomic mass unit amu which is defined as onetwelfth of the mass of one atom of carbon with protons neutrons and electrons Prochiral substituents on tetrahedral carbonsCarbonyl and imine carbons as prochiral centersExercises Objectives After completing this section you should be able to identify a compound as being prochiral identify the Re and Si faces of prochiral sp centre identify atoms or groups of atoms as proR or proS on a prochiral sp centre Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below prochiral proR proS Re Si Prochiral substituents on tetrahedral carbons When a tetrahedral carbon can be converted to a chiral center by changing only one of its attached groups it is referred to as a prochiral center The actual example shown below is the reduced form of a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH an important participant in many biochemical oxidationreduction reactions section A Note that if in a thought experiment we changed either one of the indicated hydrogens on NADH to a deuterium the H isotope of hydrogen the carbon would become a chiral center Prochirality is an important concept in biological chemistry because enzymes can distinguish between the two identical groups bound to a prochiral carbon center due to the fact that they occupy different regions in threedimensional space For example in the following reaction which is a key step in the oxidation of fatty acids it is specifically HA and HD that are lost while HB and HC remain in the resulting conjugated alkene The prochiral hydrogens on Cand C of the fatty acid can be designated according to a variation on the RS system For the sake of clarity well look at a much simpler molecule ethanol to explain this system To name the two prochiral hydrogens on ethanol we again need to engage in a thought experiment If we in our imagination were to arbitrarily change HB to a deuterium the molecule would now be chiral and the stereocenter would have the S configuration D has a higher priority than H For this reason we can refer to HB as the proS hydrogen of ethanol and label it HS Conversely if we change HA to D and leave HB as a hydrogen the configuration of the molecule becomes R so we can refer to HA as the proR hydrogen of ethanol and label it HR Looking back at our fatty acid example we see that it is specifically the proR hydrogens on carbons and that are lost in the reaction Prochiral hydrogens can be designated either enantiotopic or diastereotopic If either HR or HS on ethanol were replaced by a deuterium the two resulting molecules would be enantiomers because there are no other stereocenters Thus these two hydrogens are referred to as enantiotopic In glyceraldehydephosphate GAP however we see something different If either HR or HS is replaced by a deuterium the two resulting molecules will be diastereomers thus in this molecule HR and HS are referred to as diastereotopic hydrogens The importance of the distinction between enantiotopic and diastereotopic groups will become apparent when we learn about the analytical technique called nuclear magnetic resonance Two hydrogens on the same carbon of a substituted ring structure can be diastereotopic we determine this by carrying out the same thought experiment as discussed above In the example below the diastereotopic hydrogens indicated are either on the same side or on the opposite side of the ring relative to the hydroxyl group Finally hydrogens that are completely identical and can be designated neither enantiotopic nor diastereotopic are called homotopic If a homotopic hydrogen is replaced by deuterium a chiral center is not created The three hydrogen atoms on the methyl CH group of ethanol and on any methyl group are homotopic Even to an enzyme all three of these hydrogens will look the same Example Identifying Prochiral hydrogens Identify in the molecules below all pairsgroups of hydrogens that are homotopic enantiotopic or diastereotopic When appropriate label prochiral hydrogens as HR or HS Answer Groups other than hydrogens can be considered prochiral The alcohol below has two prochiral methyl groups methyl A is the proR methyl and methyl B is proS How do we make these designations Simple just arbitrarily make methyl A higher priority than methyl B and the compound now has the R configuration Citrate provides a more complex example The central carbon is a prochiral center with two arms that are identical except that one can be designated proR and the other proS In a reaction of the citric acid cycle Krebs cycle a water molecule is specifically lost on the proR arm we will study this reaction in section B Notice also that it is specifically the proR hydrogen on the proR arm of citrate that is lost one more layer of stereoselectivity Example Leucine Assign proR andproS designations to all prochiral groups in the amino acid leucine Hint there are two pairs of prochiral groups Are these prochiral groups diastereotopic or enantiotopic Answer Although an alkene carbon bonded to two identical groups is not considered a prochiral center these two groups can be diastereotopic Ha and Hb on the alkene below for example are diastereotopic if we change one and then the other of these hydrogens to deuterium the resulting compounds are E and Z diastereomers Carbonyl and imine carbons as prochiral centers Trigonal planar sphybridized carbons are not as we well know chiral centers but they are referred to as prochiral centers if they are bonded to three different substitutuents As you might expect we and the enzymes that catalyze their reactions can distinguish between the two planar faces of a prochiral sp hybridized group These faces are designated by the terms re and si To determine which is the re and which is the si face of a planar organic group we simply use the same priority rankings that we are familiar with from the RS system and trace a circle re is clockwise and si is counterclockwise Below for example we are looking down on the re face of the ketone group in pyruvate If we flipped the molecule over we would be looking at the si face of the ketone group Note that the carboxylate group does not have re and si faces because two of the three substituents on that carbon are identical when the two resonance forms of carboxylate are taken into account As we will see beginning in chapter enzymes which catalyze reactions at carbonyl carbons act specifically from one side or the other Notice that the hydrogenation reaction above is specific not only in terms of which face of the carbonyl group is affected but also in terms of which of the two diastereotopic hydrogens on NADH is transferred we will study this type of reaction in more detail in section Example Uracil For each of the carbonyl groups in uracil state whether we are looking at the re or the si face in the structural drawing below Answer Exercises Q State which of the following

section you should be able to arrange a number of given straightchain alkanes in order of increasing or decreasing boiling point or melting point arrange a series of isomeric alkanes in order of increasing or decreasing boiling point explain the difference in boiling points between a given number of alkanes Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below van der Waals force also known as London Dispersion force Alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity all alkanes are colorless and odorless nonpolar compounds The relative weak London dispersion forces of alkanes result in gaseous substances for short carbon chains volatile liquids with densities around gmL for moderate carbon chains and solids for long carbon chains For molecules with the same functional groups there is a direct relationship between the size and shape of molecules and the strength of the intermolecular forces IMFs causing the differences in the physical states Boiling Points Table describes some of the properties of some straightchain alkanes There is not a significant electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen thus there is not any significant bond polarity The molecules themselves also have very little polarity A totally symmetrical molecule like methane is completely nonpolar meaning that the only attractions between one molecule and its neighbors will be Van der Waals dispersion forces These forces will be very small for a molecule like methane but will increase as the molecules get bigger Therefore the boiling points of the alkanes increase with molecular size For isomers the more branched the chain the lower the boiling point tends to be Van der Waals dispersion forces are smaller for shorter molecules and only operate over very short distances between one molecule and its neighbors It is more difficult for short fat molecules with lots of branching to lie as close together as long thin molecules The boiling points shown are for the straight chain isomers of which there is more than one The first four alkanes are gases at room temperature and solids do not begin to appear until about but this is imprecise because different isomers typically have different melting and boiling points Table Physical Properties of Some Alkanes Molecular Name Formula Melting Point C Boiling Point C Density C

going from gases grams per liter to liquids grams per milliliter Gas densities are at atm pressure The boiling points for the straight chain isomers and isoalkanes isomers are shown to demonstrate that branching decreases the surfaces area weakens the IMFs and lowers the boiling point Example Boiling Points of Alkanes For example the boiling points of the three isomers of are pentane K methylbutane K dimethylpropane K The slightly higher boiling points for the cycloalkanes are presumably because the molecules can get closer together because the ring structure makes them better able Exercise For each of the following pairs of compounds select the substance which you expect to have the higher boiling point octane and nonane octane and tetramethylbutane Solution a nonane since it has more atoms it will have greater IMF b octane since it is not branched the molecules can pack closer together increasing IMF Solubility Alkanes are virtually insoluble in water but dissolve in organic solvents However liquid alkanes are good solvents for many other nonionic organic compounds Solubility in Water When a molecular substance dissolves in water the following must occur break the intermolecular forces within the substance In the case of the alkanes these are the Van der Waals dispersion forces break the intermolecular forces in the water so that the substance can fit between the water molecules In water the primary intermolecular attractions are hydrogen bonds Breaking either of these attractions requires energy although the amount of energy to break the Van der Waals dispersion forces in something like methane is relatively negligible this is not true of the hydrogen bonds in water As something of a simplification a substance will dissolve if there is enough energy released when new bonds are made between the substance and the water to compensate for what is used in breaking the original attractions The only new attractions between the alkane and the water molecules are Van der Waals forces These forces do not release a sufficient amount of energy to compensate for the energy required to break the hydrogen bonds in water The alkane does not dissolve Note This is a simplification because entropic effects are important when things dissolve Solubility in organic solvents In most organic solvents the primary forces of attraction between the solvent molecules are Van der Waals Therefore when an alkane dissolves in an organic solvent the Van der Waals forces are broken and are replaced by new Van der Waals forces The two processes more or less cancel each other out energetically thus there is no barrier to solubility Exercise For each of the following pairs of compounds select the substance you expect to have the higher boiling point octane and nonane octane and tetramethylbutane Answer Nonane will have a higher boiling point than octane because it has a longer carbon chain than octane Octane will have a higher boiling point than tetramethylbutane because it branches less than tetramethylbutane and therefore has a larger surface area and more van der Waals forces Note The actual boiling points are nonane C octane C tetramethylbutane C Reactions of Alkanes Alkanes undergo very few reactions There are two important reactions that are still possible combustion and halogenation The halogenation reaction is very important in organic chemistry because it opens a gateway to further chemical reactions Combustion Complete combustion given sufficient oxygen of any hydrocarbon produces carbon dioxide water and a significant amount of heat Due to the exothermic nature of these combustion reactions alkanes are commonly used as a fuel source for example propane for outdoor grills butane for lighters The hydrocarbons become harder to ignite as the molecules get bigger This is because the larger molecules dont vaporize as easily If the liquid is not very volatile only those molecules on the surface can react with the oxygen Larger molecules have greater Van der Waals attractions which makes it more difficult for them to break away from their neighbors and become a gas An example combustion reaction is shown for propane Kjmol Halogenation of Alkanes Halogenation is the replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms in an organic compound by a halogen fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine Unlike the complex transformations of combustion the halogenation of an alkane appears to be a simple substitution reaction in which a CH bond is broken and a new CX bond is formed Since only two covalent bonds are broken CH ClCl and two covalent bonds are formed CCl HCl this reaction seems to be an ideal case for mechanistic investigation and speculation However one complication is that all the hydrogen atoms of an alkane may undergo substitution resulting in a mixture of products as shown in the following unbalanced equation The relative amounts of the various products depend on the proportion of the two reactants used In the case of methane a large excess of the hydrocarbon favors formation of methyl chloride as the chief product whereas an excess of chlorine favors formation of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride Looking Closer An Alkane Basis for Properties of Other Compounds An understanding of the physical properties of alkanes is important since petroleum and natural gas and the many products derived from themgasoline bottled gas solvents plastics and moreare composed primarily of alkanes This understanding is also vital because it is the basis for describing the properties of other organic and biological compound families For example large portions of the structures of lipids consist of nonpolar alkyl groups Lipids include the dietary fats and fat like compounds called phospholipids and sphingolipids that serve as structural components of living tissues These compounds have both polar and nonpolar groups enabling them to bridge the gap between watersoluble and waterinsoluble phases This characteristic is essential for the selective permeability of cell membranes Tripalmitin a a typical fat molecule has long hydrocarbon chains typical of most lipids Compare

mixtures do not rotate planepolarized light Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below racemic mixture or racemate resolve Study Notes A racemic mixture is a mixture of two enantiomers Because they are mirror images each enantiomer rotates planepolarized light in an equal but opposite direction and is optically inactive If the enantiomers are separated the mixture is said to have been resolved A common experiment in the laboratory component of introductory organic chemistry involves the resolution of a racemic mixture The dramatic biochemical consequences of chirality are illustrated by the use in the s of the drug Thalidomide a sedative given to pregnant women to relieve morning sickness It was later realized that while the form of the molecule was a safe and effective sedative the form was an active teratogen The drug caused numerous birth abnormalities when taken in the early stages of pregnancy because it contained a mixture of the two forms As noted earlier chiral compounds synthesized from achiral starting materials and reagents are generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers Separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called resolution Since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution is extremely difficult Diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates Reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated For example if a racemic mixture of a chiral alcohol is reacted with a enantiomerically pure carboxylic acid the result is a mixture of diastereomers in this case because the pure R entantiomer of the acid was used the product is a mixture of RR and RS diastereomeric esters which can in theory be separated by their different physical properties Subsequent hydrolysis of each separated ester will yield the resolved enantiomerically pure alcohols The used in this technique are known as Moschers esters after Harry Stone Moscher a chemist who pioneered the method at Stanford University As noted earlier chiral compounds synthesized from achiral starting materials and reagents are generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers Separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called resolution Since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution is extremely difficult Diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates Reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated Reversing the first reaction then leads to the separated enantiomers plus the recovered reagent Figure Many kinds of chemical and physical reactions including salt formation may be used to achieve the diastereomeric intermediates needed for separation Figure illustrates this general principle by showing how a nut having a righthanded thread R could serve as a reagent to discriminate and separate a mixture of right and lefthanded bolts of identical size and weight Only the two righthanded partners can interact to give a fullythreaded intermediate so separation is fairly simple The resolving moiety ie the nut is then removed leaving the bolts separated into their right and lefthanded forms Chemical reactions of enantiomers are normally not so dramatically different but a practical distinction is nevertheless possible Because the physical properties of enantiomers are identical they seldom can be separated by simple physical methods such as fractional crystallization or distillation It is only under the influence of another chiral substance that enantiomers behave differently and almost all methods of resolution of enantiomers are based upon this fact We include here a discussion of the primary methods of resolution Chiral Amines as Resolving Agents and Resolution of Racemic Acids The most commonly used procedure for separating enantiomers is to convert them to a mixture of diastereomers that will have different physical properties melting point boiling point solubility and so on Section For example if you have a racemic or DL mixture of enantiomers of an acid and convert this to a salt with a chiral base having the D configuration the salt will be a mixture of two diastereomers D acid D base and L acid D base These diastereomeric salts are not identical and they are not mirror images Therefore they will differ to some degree in their physical properties and a separation by physical methods such as crystallization may be possible If the diastereomeric salts can be completely separated the acid regenerated from each salt will be either exclusively the D or the L enantiomer Resolution of chiral acids through the formation of diastereomeric salts requires adequate supplies of suitable chiral bases Brucine strychnine and quinine frequently are used for this purpose because they are readily available naturally occurring chiral bases Simpler amines of synthetic origin such as amino butanol amphetamine and phenylethanamine also can be used but first they must be resolved themselves Resolution of Racemic Bases Chiral acids such as tartaric acid malic acid mandelic acid and camphor sulfonic acid are used for the resolution of a racemic base The principle is the same as for the resolution of a racemic acid with a chiral base and the choice of acid will depend both on the ease of separation of the diastereomeric salts and of course on the availability of the acid for the scale of the resolution involved Resolution methods of this kind can be tedious because numerous recrystallizations in different solvents may be necessary to progressively enrich the crystals in the lesssoluble diastereomer To determine when the resolution is complete the mixture of diastereomers is recrystallized until there is no further change in the measured optical rotation of the crystals At this stage it is hoped that the crystalline salt is a pure diastereomer from which one pure enantiomer can be recovered The optical rotation of this enantiomer will be a maximum value if it is optically pure because any amount of the other enantiomer could only reduce the magnitude of the measured rotation Resolution of Racemic Alcohols To resolve a racemic alcohol a chiral acid can be used to convert the alcohol to a mixture of diastereomeric esters This is not as generally useful as might be thought because esters tend to be liquids unless they are very highmolecularweight compounds If the diastereomeric esters are not crystalline they must be separated by some other method than fractional crystallization for instance by chromatography methods Section Two chiral acids that are useful resolving agents for alcohols are The most common method of resolving an alcohol is to convert it to a halfester of a dicarboxylic acid such as butanedioic succinic or benzenedicarboxylic phthalic acid with the corresponding anhydride The resulting halfester has a free carboxyl function and may then be resolvable with a chiral base usually brucine Other Methods of Resolution Qne of the major goals in the field of organic chemistry is the development of reagents with the property of chiral recognition such that they can effect a clean separation of enantiomers in one operation without destroying either of the enantiomers We have not achieved that ideal yet but it may not be far in the future Chromatographic methods Section whereby the stationary phase is a chiral reagent that adsorbs one enantiomer more strongly than the other have been used to resolve racemic compounds but such resolutions seldom have led to both pure enantiomers on a preparative scale Other methods called kinetic resolutions are excellent when applicable The procedure takes advantage of differences in reaction rates of enantiomers with chiral reagents One enantiomer may react more rapidly thereby leaving an excess of the other enantiomer behind For example racemic tartaric acid can be resolved with the aid of certain penicillin molds that consume the dextrorotatory enantiomer faster than the levorotatory enantiomer As a result almost pure tartaric acid can be recovered from the mixture tartaric acid mold tartaric acid more mold A disadvantage of resolutions of this type is that the more reactive enantiomer usually is not recoverable from the reaction mixture The crystallization procedure employed by Pasteur for his classical resolution of tartaric acid Section C has been successful only in a very few cases This procedure depends on the formation of individual crystals of each enantiomer Thus if the crystallization of sodium ammonium tartrate is carried out below the usual racemate salt does not form a mixture of crystals of the and salts forms instead The two different kinds of crystals which are related as an object to its mirror image can be separated manually with the aid of a microscope and subsequently may be converted to the tartaric acid enantiomers by strong acid A variation on this method of resolution is the seeding of a saturated solution of a racemic mixture with crystals of one pure enantiomer in the hope of causing crystallization of just that one enantiomer thereby leaving the other in solution Unfortunately very few practical resolutions have been achieved in this way Even when a successful resolution is achieved some significant problems remain For instance the resolution itself does not provide information on the actual configuration of the or enantiomer This must be determined by other means see Section Also it is not possible to tell the enantiomeric purity optical purity of the resolved enantiomers without additional information This point is discussed further in the next section Exercise Indicate the reagents you would use to resolve the following compounds Show the reactions involved and specify the physical method you believe would be the best to

chlorination of methane explain why the halogenation of an alkane is not a particularly useful method of preparing specific alkyl halides Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below chain reaction initiation step propagation step radical substitution termination step Study Notes A radical substitution reaction is a reaction which occurs by a free radical mechanism and results in the substitution of one or more of the atoms or groups present in the substrate by different atoms or groups The initiation step in a radical chain reaction is the step in which a free radical is first produced A termination step of a radical chain reaction is one in which two radicals react together in some way so that the chain can no longer be propagated While radical halogenation of very simple alkanes can be an effective synthetic strategy it cannot be employed for larger more complex alkanes to yield specific alkyl halides since the reactive nature of radicals always leads to mixtures of single and multiplehalogenated products The Three Phases of Radical Chain Reactions Because of their high reactivity free radicals have the potential to be both extremely powerful chemical tools and extremely harmful contaminants Much of the power of free radical species stems from the natural tendency of radical processes to occur in a chain reaction fashion Radical chain reactions have three distinct phases initiation propagation and termination The initiation phase describes the step that initially creates a radical species In most cases this is a homolytic cleavage event and takes place very rarely due to the high energy barriers involved Often the influence of heat UV radiation or a metalcontaining catalyst is necessary to overcome the energy barrier Molecular chlorine and bromine will both undergo homolytic cleavage to form radicals when subjected to heat or light Other functional groups which also tend to form radicals when exposed to heat or light are chlorofluorocarbons peroxides and the halogenated amide Nbromosuccinimide NBS The propagation phase describes the chain part of chain reactions Once a reactive free radical is generated it can react with stable molecules to form new free radicals These new free radicals go on to generate yet more free radicals and so on Propagation steps often involve hydrogen abstraction or addition of the radical to double bonds Chain termination occurs when two free radical species react with each other to form a stable nonradical adduct Although this is a very thermodynamically downhill event it is also very rare due to the low concentration of radical species and the small likelihood of two radicals colliding with one another In other words the Gibbs free energy barrier is very high for this reaction mostly due to entropic rather than enthalpic considerations The active sites of enzymes of course can evolve to overcome this entropic barrier by positioning two radical intermediates adjacent to one another Exercises Questions Q Radical chlorination of alkanes are not useful due to uncontrolled substitution Draw the monosubstituted products of Cl reacting with

Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris References Raman spectroscopy often is a highly useful adjunct to infrared spectroscopy The experimental arrangement for Raman spectra is quite simple in principle Monochromatic light such as from an argongas laser is passed through a sample and the light scattered at right angles to the incident beam is analyzed by an optical spectrometer Raman spectra arise as a result of light photons being captured momentarily by molecules in the sample and giving up or gaining small increments of energy through changes in the molecular vibrational and rotational energies before being emitted as scattered light The changes in the vibrational and rotational energies result in changes in wavelength of the incident light These changes are detected as lines falling both above and below the wavelength of the incident light The line positions in Raman spectra always are reported in wave numbers Highly efficient laser Raman spectrometers are commercially available Although changes in wavelength in Raman scattering correspond to absorption or emission of infrared radiation infrared and Raman spectra are not always identical Indeed valuable information about molecular symmetry may be obtained by comparison of infrared and Raman spectra When a bond is electrically symmetrical it does not absorb infrared radiation and for this reason symmetrical diatomic molecules such as and which are always electrically symmetrical do not give infrared absorption spectra However excitation of symmetrical vibrations does occur in Raman scattering In a molecule such as ethene the doublebond stretching vibration is symmetrical because both ends of the molecule are the same As a result the doublebond stretching absorption is not observable in the infrared spectrum of ethene and is weak in all nearly symmetrically substituted ethenes Nonetheless this vibration appears strongly in the Raman spectrum of ethene and provides evidence for a symmetrical structure for ethene As a general conclusion a molecule has no important symmetry if all its infrared bands have counterparts in Raman scattering To illustrate these effects the Raman and infrared spectra of tetrachloroethene and cyclohexene are shown in Figures and Figure Infrared top and Raman spectra bottom of tetrachloroethene notice that the spacings and alignment of the horizontal scales are not the same The Raman spectrum was supplied courtesy of the Applied Physics Corporation Absorption due to the stretching vibration of the double bond in tetrachloroethene is strong in the Raman and absent in the infrared whereas that arising from the less symmetrical double bond of cyclohexene is weak in the infrared and slightly stronger in the Raman Figure Infrared top and Raman spectra bottom of cyclohexene notice that the spacings and alignment of the horizontal scales are not the same The Raman spectrum was supplied courtesy of the Applied Physics Corporation This is in accord with the spectroscopic selection rules derived from theoretical arguments that predict which transitions between rotational and vibrational energy levels are allowed and which are forbidden References John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W

Energy Diagram to discuss transition states Ea intermediates rate determining step draw the transition state of a reaction You may recall from general chemistry that it is often convenient to describe chemical reactions with energy diagrams In an energy diagram the vertical axis represents the overall energy of the reactants while the horizontal axis is the reaction coordinate tracing from left to right the progress of the reaction from starting compounds to final products The energy diagram for a typical onestep reaction might look like this Despite its apparent simplicity this energy diagram conveys some very important ideas about the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction Recall that when we talk about the thermodynamics of a reaction we are concerned with the difference in energy between reactants and products and whether a reaction is downhill exergonic energy releasing or uphill endergonic energy absorbing When we talk about kinetics on the other hand we are concerned with the rate of the reaction regardless of whether it is uphill or downhill thermodynamically First lets review what this energy diagram tells us about the thermodynamics of the reaction illustrated by the energy diagram above The energy level of the products is lower than that of the reactants This tells us that the change in standard Gibbs Free Energy for the reaction ΔGrnx is negative In other words the reaction is exergonic or downhill Recall that the ΔGrnx term encapsulates both ΔHrnx the change in enthalpy heat and ΔSrnx the change in entropy disorder where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin For chemical processes where the entropy change is small the enthalpy change is essentially the same as the change in Gibbs Free Energy Energy diagrams for these processes will often plot the enthalpy H instead of Free Energy for simplicity The standard Gibbs Free Energy change for a reaction can be related to the reactions equilibrium constant K_eq_ by a simple equation where Keq product reactant at equilibrium R JKmol or cal Kmol T temperature in Kelvin K If you do the math you see that a negative value for ΔGrnx an exergonic reaction corresponds as it should by intuition to Keq being greater than an equilibrium constant which favors product formation In a hypothetical endergonic energyabsorbing reaction the products would have a higher energy than reactants and thus ΔGrnx would be positive and Keq would be less than favoring reactants Now lets move to kinetics Look again at the energy diagram for exergonic reaction although it is downhill overall it isnt a straight downhill run First an energy barrier must be overcome to get to the product side The height of this energy barrier you may recall is called the activation energy ΔG You may have been taught to use the term activated complex rather than transition state as the two are often used interchangeably Similarly the activation energy of a reaction is often represented by the symbol Eact or Ea The activation energy is what determines the kinetics of a reaction the higher the energy hill the slower the reaction At the very top of the energy barrier the reaction is at its transition state TS which is the point at which the bonds are in the process of breaking and forming The transition state is an activated complex a transient and dynamic state that unlike more stable species does not have any definable lifetime It may help to imagine a transition state as being analogous to the exact moment that a baseball is struck by a bat Transition states are drawn with dotted lines representing bonds that are in the process of breaking or forming and the drawing is often enclosed by brackets Here is a picture of a likely transition state for a substitution reaction between hydroxide and chloromethane This reaction involves a collision between two molecules for this reason we say that it has second order kinetics The rate expression for this type of reaction is rate kreactant reactant which tells us that the rate of the reaction depends on the rate constant k as well as on the concentration of both reactants The rate constant can be determined experimentally by measuring the rate of the reaction with different starting reactant concentrations The rate constant depends on the activation energy of course but also on temperature a higher temperature means a higher k and a faster reaction all else being equal This should make intuitive sense when there is more heat energy in the system more of the reactant molecules are able to get over the energy barrier Here is one more interesting and useful expression Consider a simple reaction where the reactants are A and B and the product is AB this is referred to as a condensation reaction because two molecules are coming together or condensing If we know the rate constant k for the forward reaction and the rate constant kreverse for the reverse reaction where AB splits apart into A and B we can simply take the quotient to find our equilibrium constant This too should make some intuitive sense if the forward rate constant is higher than the reverse rate constant equilibrium should lie towards products

chlorineCycloalkanesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective recognize and distinguish between the two major reactions of alkanes combustion and halogenation Combustion Complete combustion given sufficient oxygen of any hydrocarbon produces carbon dioxide and water It is quite important that you can write properly balanced equations for these reactions because they often come up as a part of thermochemistry calculations Some are easier than others For example with alkanes the ones with an even number of carbon atoms are marginally harder than those with an odd number Example Propane Combustion For example with propane CH you can balance the carbons and hydrogens as you write the equation down Your first draft would be Counting the oxygens leads directly to the final version Example Butane Combustion With butane CH you can again balance the carbons and hydrogens as you write the equation down Counting the oxygens leads to a slight problem with on the righthand side The simple trick is to allow yourself to have sixandahalf O molecules on the left If that offends you double everything The hydrocarbons become harder to ignite as the molecules get bigger This is because the bigger molecules dont vaporize so easily the reaction is much better if the oxygen and the hydrocarbon are well mixed as gases If the liquid is not very volatile only those molecules on the surface can react with the oxygen Bigger molecules have greater Van der Waals attractions which makes it more difficult for them to break away from their neighbors and turn to a gas Provided the combustion is complete all the hydrocarbons will burn with a blue flame However combustion tends to be less complete as the number of carbon atoms in the molecules rises That means that the bigger the hydrocarbon the more likely you are to get a yellow smoky flame Incomplete combustion where there is not enough oxygen present can lead to the formation of carbon or carbon monoxide As a simple way of thinking about it the hydrogen in the hydrocarbon gets the first chance at the oxygen and the carbon gets whatever is left over The presence of glowing carbon particles in a flame turns it yellow and black carbon is often visible in the smoke Carbon monoxide is produced as a colorless poisonous gas Note Why carbon monoxide is poisonous Oxygen is carried around the blood by hemoglobin which unfortunately binds to exactly the same site on the hemoglobin that oxygen does The difference is that carbon monoxide binds irreversibly or very strongly making that particular molecule of hemoglobin useless for carrying oxygen If you breath in enough carbon monoxide you will die from a sort of internal suffocation Halogenation of Alkanes Halogenation is the replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms in an organic compound by a halogen fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine Unlike the complex transformations of combustion the halogenation of an alkane appears to be a simple substitution reaction in which a CH bond is broken and a new CX bond is formed The chlorination of methane shown below provides a simple example of this reaction CH Cl energy CHCl HCl Since only two covalent bonds are broken CH ClCl and two covalent bonds are formed CCl HCl this reaction seems to be an ideal case for mechanistic investigation and speculation However one complication is that all the hydrogen atoms of an alkane may undergo substitution resulting in a mixture of products as shown in the following unbalanced equation The relative amounts of the various products depend on the proportion of the two reactants used In the case of methane a large excess of the hydrocarbon favors formation of methyl chloride as the chief product whereas an excess of chlorine favors formation of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride CH Cl energy CHCl CHCl CHCl CCl HCl In the presence of a flame the reactions are rather like the fluorine one producing a mixture of carbon and the hydrogen halide The violence of the reaction drops considerably as you go from fluorine to chlorine to bromine The interesting reactions happen in the presence of ultraviolet light sunlight will do These are photochemical reactions that happen at room temperature Well look at the reactions with chlorine although the reactions with bromine are similar but evolve more slowly Substitution reactions happen in which hydrogen atoms in the methane are replaced one at a time by chlorine atoms You end up with a mixture of chloromethane dichloromethane trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane The original mixture of a colorless and a green gas would produce steamy fumes of hydrogen chloride and a mist of organic liquids All of the organic products are liquid at room temperature with the exception of the chloromethane which is a gas If you were using bromine you could either mix methane with bromine vapor or bubble the methane through liquid bromine in either case exposed to UV light The original mixture of gases would of course be redbrown rather than green One would not choose to use these reactions as a means of preparing these organic compounds in the lab because the mixture of products would be too tedious to separate The mechanisms for the reactions are explained on separate pages Larger alkanes and chlorine You would again get a mixture of substitution products but it is worth just looking briefly at what happens if only one of the hydrogen atoms gets substituted monosubstitution just to show that things arent always as straightforward as they seem For example with propane you could get one of two isomers If chance was the only factor you would expect to get three times as much of the isomer with the chlorine on the end There are hydrogens that could get replaced on the end carbon atoms compared with only in the middle In fact you get about the same amount of each of the two isomers If you use bromine instead of chlorine the great majority of the product is where the bromine is attached to the center carbon atom Cycloalkanes The reactions of the cycloalkanes are generally just the same as the alkanes with the exception of the very small ones particularly cyclopropane In the presence of UV light cyclopropane will undergo substitution reactions with chlorine or bromine just like a noncyclic alkane However it also has the ability to react in the dark In the absence of UV light cyclopropane can undergo addition reactions in which the ring is broken For example with bromine cyclopropane gives dibromopropane This can still happen in the presence of light but you will get substitution reactions as well The ring is broken because cyclopropane suffers badly from ring strain The bond angles in the ring are rather than the normal value of about when the carbon makes four single bonds The overlap between the atomic orbitals in forming the carboncarbon bonds is less good than it is normally and there is considerable repulsion between the bonding pairs The system becomes more stable if the ring is broken Exercise Classify the following reactions as combustion or halogenation Answer a halogentation b combustion Contributors and Attributions Jim

reactions refer to section Alkyl Halide Structure and Reaction Language The carbon bonded to a halide is called the alphacarbon The carbons bonded to the alphacarbon are called betacarbons Carbon atoms further removed from the alpha carbon are named by continuing the Greek alphabet alpha beta gamma delta etc In discussing the reactions of alkyl halides it can be effective to use the alpha and beta labels The structure for bromopropane is used below to illustrate the application of these terms The Reactions Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination Alkyl halides can undergo two major types of reactions substitution andor elimination The substitution reaction is called a Nucleophilic Substitution reaction because the electrophilic alkyl halide forms a new bond with the nucleophile which substitutes for replaces the halogen at the alphacarbon Because carbon can only form four bonds the halogen must leave and is called the Leaving Group Alkyl halides are excellent electrophiles because halogens share a polar bond with carbon are polarizable and form relatively stable leaving groups as halide anions In the example below bromopropane is converted into propanol in a substitution reaction Allkyl halides can also undergo elimination reactions in the presence of strong bases The elimination of a betahydrogen hydrogen on a carbon vicinal to the alkyl halide carbon and the halide produces a carboncarbon double bond to form an alkene In the example below bromopropane has undergone an elimination reaction to give an alkene propene What decides whether you get substitution or elimination In the examples above the reagents were the same for both substitution and elimination the halogenoalkane and either sodium or potassium hydroxide solution In all cases you will get a mixture of both reactions happening some substitution and some elimination The product distribution depends on a number of factors These factors will be explored in the remaining sections of this chapter Depending on the structure of the alkyl halide reagent type reaction conditions some reactions will only undergo only one pathway substitution or elimination While other alkyl halides will always produce a mixture of substitution and elimination products like the example above The goal of efficient multiplestep synthetic pathways is to maximize the formation of a single product during each step The reaction conditions explored in this chapter will be useful for future reactions we will study and learn Exercise Classify the following reactions as Substitutions or Eliminations Answer

to describe the bonding and geometry of the carboncarbon triple bond in terms of the sphybridization of the carbon atoms involved explain the reactivity of alkynes based on the known strengths of carboncarbon single double and triple bonds write equations for the reaction of an alkyne with one or two equivalents of halogen chlorine or bromine or halogen acid HCl HBr or HI draw the structure of the product formed when an alkyne reacts with one equivalent of the halogens and halogen acids listed in Objective identify the alkyne which must have been used in an addition reaction with a halogen or halogen acid given the product of such a reaction Study Notes You might find it useful to review Section before you begin work on this chapter If necessary construct a molecular model of a simple alkyne Notice the similarity between the behaviour of alkenes and that of alkynes In the laboratory you will observe that alkynes readily decolourize a solution of bromine in dichloromethane Section describes a test that allows you to distinguish between a terminal alkyne ie one in which the triple bond occurs between the last two carbons in the chain and nonterminal alkynes and alkenes Addition by Electrophilic Reagents A carboncarbon triple bond may be located at any unbranched site within a carbon chain or at the end of a chain in which case it is called terminal Because of its linear configuration the bond angle of a sphybridized carbon is º a tenmembered carbon ring is the smallest that can accommodate this function without excessive strain Since the most common chemical transformation of a carboncarbon double bond is an addition reaction we might expect the same to be true for carboncarbon triple bonds Indeed most of the alkene addition reactions also take place with alkynes and with similar regio and stereoselectivity When the addition reactions of electrophilic reagents such as strong Brønsted acids and halogens to alkynes are studied we find a curious paradox The reactions are even more exothermic than the additions to alkenes and yet the rate of addition to alkynes is slower by a factor of to than addition to equivalently substituted alkenes The reaction of one equivalent of bromine with pentenyne for example gave dibromopentyne as the chief product HCCCHCHCH Br HCCCHCHBrCHBr Although these electrophilic additions to alkynes are sluggish they do take place and generally display Markovnikov Rule regioselectivity and antistereoselectivity One problem of course is that the products of these additions are themselves substituted alkenes and can therefore undergo further addition Because of their high electronegativity halogen substituents on a double bond act to reduce its nucleophilicity and thereby decrease the rate of electrophilic addition reactions Consequently there is a delicate balance as to whether the product of an initial addition to an alkyne will suffer further addition to a saturated product Although the initial alkene products can often be isolated and identified they are commonly present in mixtures of products and may not be obtained in high yield The following reactions illustrate many of these features In the last example diodoethene does not suffer further addition inasmuch as vicinaldiiodoalkanes are relatively unstable As a rule electrophilic addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes proceed by initial formation of a picomplex in which the electrophile accepts electrons from and becomes weakly bonded to the multiple bond Such complexes are formed reversibly and may then reorganize to a reactive intermediate in a slower ratedetermining step Reactions with alkynes are more sensitive to solvent changes and catalytic influences than are equivalent alkenes For examples and a discussion of mechanisms click here Why are the reactions of alkynes with electrophilic reagents more sluggish than the corresponding reactions of alkenes After all addition reactions to alkynes are generally more exothermic than additions to alkenes and there would seem to be a higher πelectron density about the triple bond two πbonds versus one Two factors are significant in explaining this apparent paradox First although there are more πelectrons associated with the triple bond the sphybridized carbons exert a strong attraction for these πelectrons which are consequently bound more tightly to the functional group than are the πelectrons of a double bond This is seen in the ionization potentials of ethylene and acetylene Acetylene HCCH Energy HCCH e ΔH kcalmole Ethylene HCCH Energy HCCH e ΔH kcalmole Ethane HCCH Energy HCCH e ΔH kcalmole As defined by the preceding equations an ionization potential is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a molecule of a compound Since pielectrons are less tightly held than sigmaelectrons we expect the ionization potentials of ethylene and acetylene to be lower than that of ethane as is the case Gasphase proton affinities show the same order with ethylene being more basic than acetylene and ethane being less basic than either Since the initial interaction between an electrophile and an alkene or alkyne is the formation of a picomplex in which the electrophile accepts electrons from and becomes weakly bonded to the multiple bond the relatively slower reactions of alkynes becomes understandable A second factor is presumed to be the stability of the carbocation intermediate generated by sigmabonding of a proton or other electrophile to one of the triple bond carbon atoms This intermediate has its positive charge localized on an unsaturated carbon and such vinyl cations are less stable than their saturated analogs Indeed we can modify our earlier ordering of carbocation stability to include these vinyl cations in the manner shown below It is possible that vinyl cations stabilized by conjugation with an aryl substituent are intermediates in HX addition to alkynes of the type ArCCR but such intermediates are not formed in all alkyne addition reactions Carbocation Stability CH RCHCH RCH RCHCR RCH CHCHCH CHCH RC Methyl Vinyl Vinyl Allyl Benzyl Application of the Hammond postulate indicates that the activation energy for the generation of a vinyl cation intermediate would be higher than that for a lower energy intermediate This is illustrated for alkenes versus alkynes by the following energy diagrams Despite these differences electrophilic additions to alkynes have emerged as exceptionally useful synthetic transforms Addition of Hydrogen Halide to an Alkyne Summary Reactivity order of hydrogen halides HI HB r HCl HF Follows Markovnikovs rule Hydrogen adds to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogens the halogen adds to the carbon with fewest hydrogens Protination occurs on the more stable carbocation With the addition of HX haloalkenes form With the addition of excess HX you get anti addition forming a geminal dihaloalkane Addition of a HX to an Internal Alkyne As described in Figure the electrons will attack the hydrogen of the HBr and because this is a symmetric molecule it does not matter which carbon it adds to but in an asymmetric molecule the hydrogen will covalently bond to the carbon with the most hydrogens Once the hydrogen is covalently bonded to one of the carbons you will get a carbocation intermediate not shown but will look the same as depicted in Figure on the other carbon Again this is a symmetric molecule and if it were asymmetric which carbon would have the positive charge The final step is the addition of the Bromine which is a good nucleophile because it has electrons to donate or share Bromine therefore attacks the carbocation intermediate placing it on the highly substituted carbon As a result you get bromobutene from your butyne reactant as shown below Now what if you have excess HBr Addition due to excess HX yields a geminal dihaloalkane Here the electrophilic addition proceeds with the same steps used to achieve the product in Addition of a HX to an Internal Alkyne The electrons attacked the hydrogen adding it to the carbon on the left shown in blue Why was hydrogen added to the carbon on left and the one on the right bonded to the Bromine Now you will have your carbocation intermediate which is followed by the attack of the Bromine to the carbon on the right resulting in a haloalkane product Addition of HX to Terminal Alkyne Here is an addition of HBr to an asymmetric molecule First try to make sense of how the reactant went to product and then take a look at the mechanism The electrons are attacking the hydrogen depicted by the electron pushing arrows and the Bromine gains a negative charge The carbocation intermediate forms a positive charge on the left carbon after the hydrogen was added to the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents The Bromine which has a negative charge attacks the positively charged carbocation forming the final product with the nucleophile on the more substituted carbon Addition due to excess HBr present Most Hydrogen halide reactions with alkynes occur in a Markovnikovmanner in which the halide attaches to the most substituted carbon since it is the most positively polarized A more substituted carbon has more bonds attached to carbons or electrondonating groups such as Fluorine and other halides However there are two specific reactions among alkynes where antiMarkovnikov reactions take place the radical addition of HBr and Hydroboration Oxidation reactions For alkynes an antiMarkovnikov addition takes place on a terminal alkyne an alkyne on the end of a chain HBr Addition With Radical Yields bromoalkene The Br of the Hydrogen Bromide HBr attaches to the less substituted carbon of the terminal alkyne shown below in an antiMarkovnikov manner while the Hydrogen proton attaches to the second carbon As mentioned above the first carbon is the less substituted carbon since it has fewer bonds attached to carbons and other substituents The HBr reagent must also be reacted with heat or some other radicial initiator such as a peroxide in order for this reaction to proceed in this manner This presence of the radical or heat leads to the antiMarkovnikov addition since it produces the most stable reaction The product of a terminal alkyne that is reacted with a peroxide or light and HBr is a bromoalkene Regioselectivity The Bromine can attach in a syn or anti manner which means the resulting alkene can be both cis and trans Syn addition is when both Hydrogens attach to the same face or side of the double bond ie cis while the anti addition is when they attach on opposite sides of the bond trans Reaction Halogenation of Alkynes Summary Stereoslectivity anti addition Reaction proceeds via cyclic halonium ion Addition of Br The addition of Br to an alkyne is analogous to adding Br to an alkene Once Br approaches the nucleophilic alkyne it becomes polarized The electrons from the triple bond can now attack the polarized bromine forming a CBr bond and displacing the bromine ion Now you will get an intermediate electrophilic carbocation which will immediately react with the bromine ion giving you the dibromo product First you see the polarized Br being attacked by the electrons Once you form the CBr bond the other bromine is released as a bromine ion The intermediate here is a bromonium ion which is electrophilic and reacts with the bromine ion giving you the dibromo product Exercise Draw the structure and give the IUPAC name of the product formed in each of the reactions listed below Answer Contributors and

acidsChiral carbanionsExternal linksReferences Carbanions A carbanion is an anion in which carbon has an unshared pair of electrons and bears a negative charge usually with three substituents for a total of eight valence electrons The carbanion exists in a trigonal pyramidal geometry Formally a carbanion is the conjugate base of a carbon acid ceR_CH B rightarrow R_C HB where B stands for the base A carbanion is one of several reactive intermediates in organic chemistry A carbanion is a nucleophile which stability and reactivity determined by several factors The inductive effect Electronegative atoms adjacent to the charge will stabilize the charge Hybridization of the chargebearing atom The greater the scharacter of the chargebearing atom the more stable the anion The extent of conjugation of the anion Resonance effects can stabilize the anion This is especially true when the anion is stabilized as a result of aromaticity A carbanion is a reactive intermediate and is encountered in organic chemistry for instance in the EcB elimination reaction and in organometallic chemistry in for instance a Grignard reaction or in alkyl lithium chemistry Stable carbanions do however exist In Olmstead presented the lithium crown ether salt of the triphenylmethyl carbanion from triphenylmethane nbutyllithium and crown at low temperatures Adding nbutyllithium to triphenylmethane in THF at low temperatures followed by crown results in a red solution and the salt complex precipitates at C The central CC bond lengths are pm with the phenyl ring propelled at an average angle of This propeller shape is less pronounced with a tetramethylammonium counterion One tool for the detection of carbanions in solution is proton NMR A spectrum of cyclopentadiene in DMSO shows four vinylic protons at ppm and two methylene bridge protons at ppm whereas the cyclopentadienyl anion has a single resonance at ppm Carbon acids Any molecule containing a CH can lose a proton forming the carbanion Hence any hydrocarbon containing CH bonds can be considered an acid with a corresponding pKa value Methane is certainly not an acid in its classical meaning yet its estimated pKa is Compare this to acetic acid with pKa The same factors that determine the stability of the carbanion also determine the order in pKa in carbon acids These values are determined for the compounds either in water in order to compare them to ordinary acids indimethyl sulfoxide in which the majority of carbon acids and their anions are soluble or in the gas phase With DMSO the acidity window for

Fulminic acid HCNO Carborane superacid HCHBCl Note that the anions formed by ionization of acetic acid ethanol or aniline are not carbanions Starting from methane in Table the acidity increases when the anion is aromatic either because the added electron causes the anion to become aromatic as in indene and cyclopentadiene or because the negative charge on carbon can be delocalized over several alreadyaromatic rings as in triphenylmethane or the carborane superacid when the carbanion is surrounded by strongly electronegative groups through the partial neutralisation of the negative charge as in malononitrile when the carbanion is immediately next to a carbonyl group The αprotons of carbonyl groups are acidic because the negative charge in the enolate can be partially distributed in the oxygen atom Meldrums acid and barbituric acid historically named acids are in fact a lactone and a lactam respectively but their acidic carbon protons make them acidic The acidity of carbonyl compounds is an important driving force in many organic reactions such as the aldol reaction Chiral carbanions With the molecular geometry for a carbanion described as a trigonal pyramid the question is whether or not carbanions can display chirality because if the activation barrier for inversion of this geometry is too low any attempt at introducing chirality will end inracemization similar to the nitrogen inversion However solid evidence exists that carbanions can indeed be chiral for example in research carried out with certain organolithium compounds The first ever evidence for the existence of chiral organolithium compounds was obtained in Reaction of chiral iodooctane with secbutyllithium in petroleum ether at C followed by reaction with dry ice yielded mostly racemic methylbutyric acid but also an amount of optically active methyloctanoic acid which could only have formed from likewise optical active methylheptyllithium with the carbon atom linked to lithium the carbanion On heating the reaction to C the optical activity is lost More evidence followed in the s A reaction of the cis isomer of methylcyclopropyl bromide with secbutyllithium again followed by carboxylation with dry ice yielded cismethylcyclopropylcarboxylic acid The formation of the trans isomer would have indicated that the intermediate carbanion was unstable In the same manner the reaction of Slbromolmethyldiphenylcyclopropane with nbutyllithium followed by quench with methanol resulted in product with retention of configuration Of recent date are chiral methyllithium compounds The phosphate contains a chiral group with a hydrogen and a deuterium substituent The stannyl group is replaced by lithium to intermediate which undergoes a phosphatephosphorane rearrangement to phosphorane which on reaction with acetic acid givesalcohol Once again in the range of C to C the chirality is preserved in this reaction sequence History A carbanionic structure first made an appearance in the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation as correctly proposed by Clarke and Lapworth in In Schlenk prepared PhCNMe in a quest for pentavalent nitrogen fromTetramethylammonium chloride and PhCNa and in he demonstrated how triarylmethyl radicals could be reduced to carbonions by alkali metals The phrase carbanion was introduced by Wallis and Adams in as the negatively

Applied Chemistry doipac edi Comparing ReactivitySelectivity in Alkane HalogenationExercisesContributors and Attributions Comparing Reactivity Given the knowledge that a particular reaction will proceed at a suitable rate a host of practical considerations are necessary for satisfactory operation These considerations include interference by possible side reactions that give products other than those desired the ease of separation of the desired product from the reaction mixture and costs of materials apparatus and labor We shall consider these problems in connection with the important synthetic reactions discussed in this book The chlorination of saturated hydrocarbons can be induced by light but also can be carried out at temperatures of about in the dark Under such circumstances the mechanism is similar to that of lightinduced chlorination except that the chlorine atoms are formed by thermal dissociation of chlorine molecules Solid carbon surfaces catalyze thermal chlorination possibly by aiding in the cleavage of the chlorine molecules Direct monohalogenation of saturated hydrocarbons works satisfactorily only with chlorine and bromine For the general reaction the calculated value is negative and very large for fluorine negative and moderate for chlorine and bromine and positive for iodine see Table With fluorine the reaction evolves so much heat that it may be difficult to control and products from cleavage of carboncarbon as well as of carbonhydrogen bonds may be obtained The only successful direct fluorination procedure for hydrocarbons involves diffusion of minute amounts of fluorine mixed with helium into liquid or solid hydrocarbons at low temperatures typically Dry Ice temperature As fluorination proceeds the concentration of fluorine can be increased The process is best suited for preparation of completely fluorinated compounds and it has been possible to obtain in this way amounts of and from dimethylpropane and tetramethylbutane corresponding to yields based on the fluorine used Bromine generally is much less reactive toward hydrocarbons than chlorine is both at high temperatures and with activation by light Nonetheless it usually is possible to brominate saturated hydrocarbons successfully Iodine is unreactive Table Calculated Heat of Reaction for Halogenation fo Hydrocarbons Halogen X kcalmolea F Cl Br I aCalculated from the bond energies of Table The chlorination of methane does not have to stop with the formation of chloromethane methyl chloride It is usual when chlorinating methane to obtain some of the higher chlorination products dichloromethane methylene chloride trichloromethane chloroform and tetrachloromethane carbon tetrachloride In practice one can control the degree of substitution to a considerable extent by controlling the methanechlorine ratio For example for monochlorination to predominate a high methanechlorine ratio is necessary such that the chlorine atoms react with and not with Selectivity in Alkane Halogenation For propane and higher hydrocarbons for which more than one monosubstitution product is generally possible difficult separation problems bay arise when a particular product is desired For example the chlorination of methylbutane at gives all four possible monosubstitution products On a purely statistical basis we may expect the ratio of products from methylbutane to correlate with the number of available hydrogens at the various positions of substitution in the ratio However as can be seen from the strengths of bonds between hydrogen and primary secondary and tertiary carbons are not the same and we would expect the weaker bonds to preferentially react with As such the proportion of the tertiary halide is about three times that expected on a statistical basis which is in accord with our expectation that the tertiary bond of methylbutane should be the weakest of the bonds Bromine atoms are far more selective than chlorine atoms This is not unexpected because is endothermic whereas corresponding reactions with a chlorine atoms usually are exothermic data from Table Bromine removes only those hydrogens that are relatively weakly bonded to a carbon atom As predicted attack of on methylbutane leads mostly to bromomethylbutane some secondary bromide and essentially no primary bromides When the structure of the alkane is symmetrical then the fast reactivity of chlorination can be used for efficiency When the structure of the alkane can produce a range of monohalogenated products then the selectivity of bromination can be used to produce the most stable product in the greatest percentage Exercises Specify the optimum halogenation conditions Clheat or Brheat to produce the indicated major product Solution Contributors and

Greater ShiftsAnalogyReferencesOutside linksContributors and Attributions Learning Objective predict carbocation rearrangements in st order reactions Whenever reactants like alkyl halides form carbocations the carbocations are subject to a phenomenon known as carbocation rearrangement A carbocation is highly reactive and holds the positive charge on carbon with a sextet rather than an octet There are two types of rearrangements hydride shift and alkyl shift Rearrangements occur to create more stable carbocations Reviewing carbocation stability from chapter is helpful in identifying carbocations that can undergo rearrangement Once rearranged the molecules can also undergo further unimolecular substitution SN or unimolecular elimination E Nucleophilic reactions often produce two products a major product and a minor product The major product is typically the rearranged product that is more substituted aka more stable The minor product in contract is typically the normal product that is less substituted aka less stable Similarly we will see in subsequent sections of this chapter that for the unimolecular elimination reaction a more substituted alkene can form through carbocation rearrangements stay tuned for coming attractions Hydride Shift The hydride shift can also be called the Hydride Shift because rearrangements primarily occur between adjacent carbon atoms The are communicating that the carbons are vicinal adjacent These numbers have nothing to do with the nomenclature of the reactant We can see the phenomenon of hydride shift in solvolysis SN reactions like the example below As shown in the following mechanism the polarized carbonchlorine bonds is heterolytically broken to produce a chloride ion and carbocation The secondary carbocation undergoes a hydride shift to produce the more stable tertiary carbocation The oxygen of a water molecule acts as the nucleophile and reacts with the carbocation to form a protonated alcohol The intermediate is deprotonated to form the final product an alcohol The mechanism for hydride shift occurs in multiple steps that includes various intermediates and transition states Exercise Draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction Answer Alkyl Shift Not all carbocations have suitable hydrogen atoms either secondary or tertiary that are on adjacent carbon atoms available for rearrangement In this case the reaction can undergo a different mode of rearrangement known as alkyl shift or alkyl group migration Alkyl Shift acts very similarily to that of hydride shift Instead of the proton H that shifts with the nucleophile we see an alkyl group that shifts with the nucleophile instead The shifting group carries its electron pair with it to furnish a bond to the neighboring or adjacent carbocation The shifted alkyl group and the positive charge of the carbocation switch positions on the molecule Exercise Draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction Answer Alkyl Halide Classification and Carbocation Rearrangements Reactions of tertiary carbocations react much faster than that of secondary carbocations and will form the major product almost exclusively Alkyl shifts from a secondary carbocation to tertiary carbocation in SN reactions occur by independent steps When the alkyl halide is primary then slight variations and differences between the two reaction mechanisms In reaction we see that we have a secondary substrate This undergoes alkyl shift because it does not have a suitable hydrogen on the adjacent carbon Once again the reaction is similar to hydride shift The only difference is that we shift an alkyl group rather than shift a proton while still undergoing various intermediate steps to furnish its final product With reaction on the other hand we can say that it undergoes a concerted mechanism In short this means that everything happens in one step This is because primary carbocations cannot be an intermediate and they are relatively difficult processes since they require higher temperatures and longer reaction times After protonating the alcohol substrate to form the alkyloxonium ion the water must leave at the same time as the alkyl group shifts from the adjacent carbon to skip the formation of the unstable primary carbocation Exercise Draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction Answer Hydride and Greater Shifts Typically hydride shifts can occur at low temperatures However by heating the solutionf of a cation it can easily and readily speed the process of rearrangement One way to account for a slight barrier is to propose a hydride shift interchanging the functionality of two different kinds of methyls Another possibility is hydride shift in which you could yield a secondary carbocation intermediate Then a further hydride shift would give the more stable rearranged tertiary cation More distant hydride shifts have been observed such as and hydride shifts but these arrangements are too fast to undergo secondary cation intermediates Analogy Carbocation rearrangements happen very readily and often occur in many organic chemistry reactions Yet we typically neglect this step Dr Sarah Lievens a Chemistry professor at the University of California Davis once said carbocation rearrangements can be observed with various analogies to help her students remember this phenomenon For hydride shifts The new friend nucleophile just joined a group the organic molecule Because he is new he only made two new friends However the popular kid the hydrogen glady gave up his friends to the new friend so that he could have even more friends Therefore everyone wont be as lonely and we can all be friends This analogy works for alkyl shifts in conjunction with hydride shift as well References Vogel Pierre Carbocation Chemistry Amsterdam Elsevier Science Publishers BV Olah George A and Prakash GK Surya

ReductionThe CatalystAlkene Stability and Catalytic HydrogenationStereochemistry of Catalytic HydrogenationContributors and Attributions Learning Objective recognize organic oxidation and reduction reactions predict the productsspecify the reagents for hydrogenation reduction of alkenes Introduction Addition of hydrogen to a carboncarbon double bond to form an alkane is a reduction reaction that is also called catalytic hydrogenation Hydrogenation of a double bond is a thermodynamically favorable reaction because it forms a more stable lower energy product In other words the energy of the product is lower than the energy of the reactant thus it is exothermic heat is released The heat released is called the heat of hydrogenation which is an indicator of a molecules stability Regioselectivity is not an issue because the same group a hydrogen atom is bonded to each of the vinyl carbons The simplest source of two hydrogen atoms is molecular hydrogen H but mixing alkenes with hydrogen does not result in any discernible reaction Although the overall hydrogenation reaction is exothermic a high activation energy prevents it from taking place under normal conditions This restriction may be circumvented by the use of a catalyst as shown in the reactions below The Ochem View of Oxidation and Reduction For inorganic chemistry the flow of electrons is easily counted with the change in oxidation numbers of the metals and nonmetals The expressions LEO says GER for Loss of Electrons is Oxidation and Gain of Electrons is Reduction or OIL RIG for Oxidation Is Loss and Reduction Is Gain can be useful guides to recognizing oxidation and reduction reactions for inorganic chemistry However for organic chemistry most of the reactants and products are neutral so the electron flow is more difficult to track For organic compounds oxidation and reduction reactions can be recognized at least three different ways Oxidation is an increase in the number of carbon to oxygen bonds or a decrease in the number of carbon to hydrogen bonds Reduction is the opposite of oxidation so it is a decrease in the number of carbon to oxygen bonds or an increase in the number of carbon to hydrogen bonds For reactions that do not involve a change in the bonding of carbon with oxygen and hydrogen then we need to look at the differences in electronegativity The shared electrons are assigned to the more electronegative element to determine the oxidation numbers The Catalyst The reaction between hydrogen H gas and an alkene a carboncarbon double bond requires an active metal catalyst A catalyst increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy of the reaction Although the catalyst is not consumed in the reaction it is required to accelerate the reaction sufficiently to be observed in a reasonable amount of time Catalysts commonly used in alkene hydrogenation are platinum palladium and nickel The metal catalyst acts as a surface on which the reaction takes place This increases the rate by putting the reactants in close proximity to each other facilitating interactions between them With this catalyst present the sigma bond of H breaks and the two hydrogen atoms instead bind to the metal see in the figure below The bond of the alkene weakens as it also interacts with the metal as shown in step of the diagram below Since both the reactants are bound to the metal catalyst the hydrogen atoms can easily add one at a time to the previously doublebonded carbons as shown in steps and above The position of both of the reactants bound to the catalyst makes it so the hydrogen atoms are only exposed to one side of the alkene This explains why the hydrogen atoms add to same side of the molecule called synaddition Alkene Stability and Catalytic Hydrogenation As shown in the reaction energy diagram below the hydrogenation of alkenes is exothermic and heat is released corresponding to the ΔE colored green This heat of reaction can be used to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of alkenes having different numbers of alkyl substituents on the double bond For example the following table lists the heats of hydrogenation for three CH alkenes which give the same alkane product methylbutane Since a large heat of reaction indicates a high energy reactant these heats are inversely proportional to the stabilities of the alkene isomers

given alkane by catalytic hydrogenation describe the mechanism of the catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes explain the difference between a heterogeneous reaction and a homogeneous reaction recognize that other types of compounds containing multiple bonds such as ketones esters nitriles and aromatic compounds do not react with hydrogen under the conditions used to hydrogenate alkenes Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below Adams catalyst hydrogenation Study Notes Chemical reactions that are heterogeneous have reactants that are in at least two different phases eg gas with a solid whereas homogeneous reactions occur in a single phase eg gas with another gas Some confusion may arise from the description of the catalyst used in the reaction between alkenes and hydrogen Three metalsnickel platinum and palladiumare commonly used but a chemist cannot simply place a piece of one of these metals in a mixture of the alkene and hydrogen and get a reaction Each metal catalyst must be prepared in a special way nickel is usually used in a finely divided form called Raney nickel It is prepared by reacting a NiAl alloy with NaOH palladium is obtained commercially supported on an inert substance such as charcoal PdC The alkene is usually dissolved in ethanol when PdC is used as the catalyst platinum is used as PtO Adams catalyst although it is actually platinum metal that is the catalyst The hydrogen used to add to the carboncarbon double bond also reduces the platinumIV oxide to finely divided platinum metal Ethanol or acetic acid is used as the solvent for the alkene Other types of compounds containing multiple bonds such as ketones esters and nitriles do not react with hydrogen under the conditions used to hydrogenate alkenes The examples below show reduction of an alkene but the ketone and nitrile groups present remain intact and are not reduced Aromatic rings are also not reduced under the conditions used to reduce alkenes although these rings appear to contain three carboncarbon double bonds As you will see later aromatic rings do not really contain any double bonds and many chemists prefer to represent the benzene ring as a hexagon with a circle inside it rather than as a hexagon with three alternating double bonds The representation of the benzene ring will be discussed further in Section The reaction between carboncarbon double bonds and hydrogen provides a method of determining the number of double bonds present in a compound For example one mole of cyclohexene reacts with one mole of hydrogen to produce one mole of cyclohexane but one mole of cyclohexadiene reacts with two moles of hydrogen to form one mole of cyclohexane A chemist would say that cyclohexene reacts with one equivalent of hydrogen and cyclohexadiene reacts with two equivalents of hydrogen If you take a known amount of an unknown unsaturated hydrocarbon and determine how much hydrogen it will absorb you can readily determine the number of double bonds present in the hydrocarbon see question below Addition of hydrogen to a carboncarbon double bond is called hydrogenation The overall effect of such an addition is the reductive removal of the double bond functional group Regioselectivity is not an issue since the same group a hydrogen atom is bonded to each of the double bond carbons The simplest source of two hydrogen atoms is molecular hydrogen H but mixing alkenes with hydrogen does not result in any discernible reaction Although the overall hydrogenation reaction is exothermic a high activation energy prevents it from taking place under normal conditions This restriction may be circumvented by the use of a catalyst as shown in the reaction coordinate diagram below An example of an alkene addition reaction is a process called hydrogenation In a hydrogenation reaction two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond of an alkene resulting in a saturated alkane Hydrogenation of a double bond is a thermodynamically favorable reaction because it forms a more stable lower energy product In other words the energy of the product is lower than the energy of the reactant thus it is exothermic heat is released The heat released is called the heat of hydrogenation which is an indicator of a molecules stability Catalysts are substances that changes the rate velocity of a chemical reaction without being consumed or appearing as part of the product Catalysts act by lowering the activation energy of reactions but they do not change the relative potential energy of the reactants and products Finely divided metals such as platinum palladium and nickel are among the most widely used hydrogenation catalysts Catalytic hydrogenation takes place in at least two stages as depicted in the diagram First the alkene must be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst along with some of the hydrogen Next two hydrogens shift from the metal surface to the carbons of the double bond and the resulting saturated hydrocarbon which is more weakly adsorbed leaves the catalyst surface The exact nature and timing of the last events is not well understood As shown in the energy diagram the hydrogenation of alkenes is exothermic and heat is released corresponding to the ΔH in the diagram This heat of reaction can be used to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of alkenes having different numbers of alkyl substituents on the double bond For example the following table lists the heats of hydrogenation for three CH alkenes which give the same alkane product methylbutane Since a larger heat of reaction indicates a higher energy reactant these heats are inversely proportional to the stabilities of the alkene isomers To a rough approximation we see that each alkyl substituent on a double bond stabilizes this functional group by a bit more than kcalmole Alkene Isomer CHCHCHCH methylbutene CHCCHCHCH methylbutene CHCCHCH methylbutene Heat of Reaction ΔHº kcalmole kcalmole kcalmole From the mechanism shown here we would expect the addition of hydrogen to occur with synstereoselectivity This is often true but the hydrogenation catalysts may also cause isomerization of the double bond prior to hydrogen addition in which case stereoselectivity may be uncertain Exercise In the reaction mol of ethene reacts with _______ mol of hydrogen Thus a chemist might say that ethene reacts with one _______ of hydrogen ethene is being _______ while _______ is being oxidized the oxidation number of carbon in ethene is _______ in ethane it is _______ Answer mol of ethene reacts with mol of hydrogen Thus a chemist might say that ethene reacts with one equivalent of hydrogen ethene is being reduced while hydrogen is being oxidized the oxidation number of carbon in ethene is in ethane it

terms below anion radical Lindlar catalyst Study Notes The Lindlar catalyst allows a chemist to reduce a triple bond in the presence of a double bond Thus but Reactions between alkynes and catalysts are a common source of alkene formation Because alkynes differ from alkenes on account of their two procurable π bonds alkynes are more susceptible to additions Aside from turning them into alkenes these catalysts affect the arrangement of substituents on the newly formed alkene molecule Depending on which catalyst is used the catalysts cause anti or synaddition of hydrogens Alkynes can readily undergo additions because of their availability of two π bonds Hydrogenation of Alkynes Alkynes can be fully hydrogenated into alkanes with the help of a platinum catalyst However the use of two other catalysts can be used to hydrogenate alkynes to alkanes These catalysts are Palladium dispersed on carbon PdC and finely dispersed nickel RaneyNi Hydrogenation of an Alkyne to a ZAlkene cisalkene Because hydrogenation is an interruptible process involving a series of steps hydrogenation can be stopped using modified catalysts eg Lindlars Catalyst at the transitional alkene stage Lindars catalyst has three components PalladiumCalcium Carbonate lead acetate and quinoline The quinoline serves to prevent complete hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane Lindlars Catalyst transforms an alkyne to a cisalkene Lindlars Catalyst Like alkenes alkynes readily undergo catalytic hydrogenation either to cis or trans alkenes or to alkanes depending on the reaction employed The catalytic addition of hydrogen to butyne provides heat of reaction data that reflect the relative thermodynamic stabilities of these hydrocarbons as shown above From the heats of hydrogenation shown in blue in units of kcalmole it would appear that alkynes are thermodynamically less stable than alkenes to a greater degree than alkenes are less stable than alkanes The standard bond energies for carboncarbon bonds confirm this conclusion Thus a double bond is stronger than a single bond but not twice as strong The difference kcalmole may be regarded as the strength of the πbond component Similarly a triple bond is stronger than a double bond but not stronger Here the difference kcalmole may be taken as the strength of the second πbond The kcalmole weakening of this second πbond is reflected in the heat of hydrogenation numbers Since alkynes are thermodynamically less stable than alkenes we might expect addition reactions of the former to be more exothermic and relatively faster than equivalent reactions of the latter In the case of catalytic hydrogenation the usual Pt and Pd hydrogenation catalysts are so effective in promoting addition of hydrogen to both double and triple carboncarbon bonds that the alkene intermediate formed by hydrogen addition to an alkyne cannot be isolated A less efficient catalyst Lindlars catalyst prepared by deactivating or poisoning a conventional palladium catalyst by treating it with lead acetate and quinoline permits alkynes to be converted to alkenes without further reduction to an alkane Hydrogenation of an Alkyne to a EAlkene transalkene Alkynes can be reduced to transalkenes with the use of sodium dissolved in an ammonia solvent An Na radical donates an electron to one of the P bonds in a carboncarbon triple bond This forms an anion which can be protonated by a hydrogen in an ammonia solvent This prompts another Na radical to donate an electron to the second P orbital Soon after this anion is also protonated by a hydrogen from the ammonia solvent resulting in a transalkene RCCR Na in NH liq trans RCHCHR NaNH Mechanism Exercises Questions Q Usng any alkyne how would you prepare the following compounds pentane

University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Layne A Morsch University of Illinois Springfield A Conformational DrawingsB Planar StructuresC Projection FormulasContributors and Attributions Many problems in organic chemistry require consideration of structures in three dimensions and it is very helpful to use molecular models to visualize the relative positions of the atoms in space Unfortunately we are forced to communicate threedimensional concepts by means of drawings in two dimensions and not all of us are equally gifted in making or visualizing such drawings Obviously communication by means of drawings such as those in Figure and would be impractically difficult and time consuming thus some form of abbreviation is necessary A Conformational Drawings Two styles of abbreviating the eclipsed and staggered conformations of ethane are shown in Figure in each the junction of lines representing bonds is assumed to be a carbon atom Using the sawhorse convention we always consider that we are viewing the molecule slightly from above and from the right and it is understood that the central bond is perpendicular to the plane of the paper With the Newman convention we view the molecule directly down the bond axis so the carbon in front hides the carbon behind The circle is only a visual aid to help distinguish the bonds of the back carbon from those of the front carbon The rear atoms in the eclipsed conformation are drawn slightly offset from a truly eclipsed view so the bonds to them can be seen Figure Conventions for showing the staggered and eclipsed conformations of ethane The staggered conformations of butane are shown in Figure in both the sawhorse and Newman conventions There is little to choose between the two conventions for simple ethane derivatives but the sawhorse convention is strongly favored for representing the conformations of ring compounds such as cyclohexane The resemblance between the gauche forms of butane and the most stable conformation of cyclohexane is strikingly apparent in the sawhorse representations of both as shown in Figure Notice that the ring carbons of cyclohexane do not lie in one plane and that all the bond angles are tetrahedral The conformations of this interesting and important molecule are discussed in detail in Chapter Figure Sawhorse and Newman conventions for showing the staggered conformations of butane Only one gauche form is shown Cyclohexane is shown to emphasize the resemblance of its stable conformation to the gauche conformation of butane Despite the usefulness of the sawhorsetype drawing cyclic molecules often are drawn with planar rings and distorted bond angles even though the rings actually may not be planar The reason for this is partly that planar rings are easier to draw and partly to emphasize the configuration of attached groups irrespective of the conformation Typical examples follow Generally we shall avoid such drawings and suggest that it is much better to learn to draw molecules in as nearly correct perspective as possible Once the sawhorse representation of cyclohexane is mastered it is almost as easy to drawn as and is much more informative about the shape of the molecule We have indicated how the enantiomers of butanol differ by drawing their strutures and Section D in perspective to show the tetrahedral configuration of substituents at the chiral carbon This configuration also can be represented by the sawhorse or Newman formulas using any one of the several possible staggered conformations such as and or and These drawings are clear but can be cumbersome particularly for more complex molecules and we shortly shall describe other means of representing the configurations of chiral molecules B Planar Structures Planar molecules such as benzene ethene and methanal are best drawn in the plane of the paper with bond angles of about When it is desired to draw them as viewed on edge out of plane care must be taken to provide proper perspective The forward bonds can be drawn with slightly heavier lines a tapered bond indicates direction the wide end pointing toward the viewer and the narrow end away from the viewer Figure Barred lines are used here to indicate a rear or receding bond many writers use dashed lines but these may be confused with other uses of dashed lines as for partial bonds However you will find other representations of planar carbons with rather grossly distorted bond angles For example methanoic acid is planar with nearly bond angles but often is drawn with angles of and The distorted structures commonly are used to save space and regretfully we have to use them very frequently for this reason C Projection Formulas The sawhorse or Newman representations of butanol and and and are excellent for showing the arrangements of the atoms in conformations but are needlessly complex for representing the stereochemical configuration Fischer projection formulas are widely used to show configurations and are quite straightforward once one gets the idea of what they represent Figure Front and side views of planar molecules showing some conventions used to indicate perspective The projection formulas of butanol are and As shown by the formulas next to and we are to understand that the horizontal bonds to the chiral center extend out of the plane of the paper toward you while the vertical bonds extend behind the plane of the paper away from you The overall translation of the projection formulas into the mirrorimage perspective drawings and may give you more trouble The easiest way to facilitate this translation is with a ballandstick model as shown in Figure Figure Procedure for relating a projection formula to a configurational drawing with the aid of a ballandstick model Assemble the ballandstick model over the projection formula here so that the groups are arranged by the convention of the formula horizontal bonds out vertical bonds back then turn the model so the appropriate groups here and are parallel to the plane of the paper and make the perspective drawing agree with the model The reverse procedure translates the perspective

resonance forms for molecules and ions Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below resonance form delocalization Resonance Delocalization Sometimes even when formal charges are considered the bonding in some molecules or ions cannot be described by a single Lewis structure Resonance is a way of describing delocalized electrons within certain molecules or polyatomic ions where the bonding cannot be expressed by a single Lewis formula A molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures also called resonance contributors or canonical forms Resonance contributors involve the imaginary movement of pibonded electrons or of lonepair electrons that are adjacent to pi bonds Note sigma bonds cannot be broken during resonance if you show a sigma bond forming or breaking you are showing a chemical reaction taking place Likewise the positions of atoms in the molecule cannot change between resonance contributors When looking at the structure of the molecule formate we see that there are two equivalent structures possible Which one is correct There are two simple answers to this question both and neither one Both ways of drawing the molecule are equally acceptable approximations of the bonding picture for the molecule but neither one by itself is an accurate picture of the delocalized pi bonds The two alternative drawings however when considered together give a much more accurate picture than either one on its own This is because they imply together that the carboncarbon bonds are not double bonds not single bonds but about halfway in between When it is possible to draw more than one valid structure for a compound or ion we have identified resonance contributors two or more different Lewis structures depicting the same molecule or ion that when considered together do a better job of approximating delocalized pibonding than any single structure By convention resonance contributors are linked by a doubleheaded arrow and are sometimes enclosed by brackets The depiction of formate using the two resonance contributors A and B in the figure above does not imply that the molecule at one moment looks like structure A then at the next moment shifts to look like structure B Rather at all moments the molecule is a combination or resonance hybrid of both A and B Each individual resonance contributor of the formate ion is drawn with one carbonoxygen double bond pm and one carbonoxygen single bond pm with a negative formal charge located on the singlebonded oxygen However the two carbonoxygen bonds in formate are actually the same length pm which implies that neither resonance contributor is correct Although there is an overall negative formal charge on the formate ion it is shared equally between the two oxygens Therefore the formate ion can be more accurately depicted by a pair of resonance contributors Alternatively a single structure can be used with a dashed line depicting the resonancedelocalized pi bond and the negative charge located in between the two oxygens The electrostatic potential map of formate shows that there is an equal amount of electron density shown in red around each oxygen Valence bond theory can be used to develop a picture of the bonding in a carboxylate group We know that the carbon must be sphybridized the bond angles are close to and the molecule is planar and we will treat both oxygens as being sphybridized as well Both carbonoxygen sigma bonds then are formed from the overlap of carbon sp orbitals and oxygen sp orbitals In addition the carbon and both oxygens each have an unhybridized pz orbital situated perpendicular to the plane of the sigma bonds These three pz orbitals are parallel to each other and can overlap in a sidebyside fashion to form a delocalized pi bond Overall the situation is one of three parallel overlapping pz orbitals sharing four delocalized pi electrons Because there is one more electron than there are pz orbitals the system has an overall charge of Resonance contributors are used to approximate overlapping pz orbitals and delocalized pi electrons Molecules with resonance are usually drawn showing only one resonance contributor for the sake of simplicity However identifying molecules with resonance is an important skill in organic chemistry This example shows an important exception to the general rules for determining the hybridization of an atom The oxygen with the negative charge appears to be sp hybridized because it is surrounded by four electron groups However this representation of the oxygen atom is not correct because it is actually part of a resonance hybrid A pair of lone pair of electrons on the negatively charged oxygen are not localized in an sp orbital rather they are delocalized as part of a conjugated pi system The stability gained though resonance is enough to cause the expected sp to become sp The sp hybridization gives the oxygen a p orbital allowing it to participate in conjugation As a general rule sp hybridized atoms with lone pair electrons tend to become sp hybridized when adjacent to a conjugated system Example Carbonate CO Like formate the electronic structure of the carbonate ion cannot be described by a single Lewis electron structure Unlike O though the Lewis structures describing CO has three equivalent representations Because carbon is the least electronegative element we place it in the central position Carbon has valence electrons each oxygen has valence electrons and there are more for the charge This gives valence electrons Six electrons are used to form three bonding pairs between the oxygen atoms and the carbon We divide the remaining electrons equally among the three oxygen atoms by placing three lone pairs on each and indicating the charge There are no electrons left for the central atom At this point the carbon atom has only valence electrons so we must take one lone pair from an oxygen and use it to form a carbonoxygen double bond In this case however there are three possible choices As with formate none of these structures describes the bonding exactly Each predicts one carbonoxygen double bond and two carbonoxygen single bonds but experimentally all CO bond lengths are identical We can write resonance structures in this case three of them for the carbonate ion As the case for formate the actual structure involves the formation of a molecular orbital from pz orbitals centered on each atom and sitting above and below the plane of the CO ion Example Benzene is a common organic solvent that was previously used in gasoline it is no longer used for this purpose however because it is now known to be a carcinogen The benzene molecule CH consists of a regular hexagon of carbon atoms each of which is also bonded to a hydrogen atom Use resonance structures to describe the bonding in benzene Given molecular formula and molecular geometry Asked for resonance structures Strategy A Draw a structure for benzene illustrating the bonded atoms Then calculate the number of valence electrons used in this drawing B Subtract this number from the total number of valence electrons in benzene and then locate the remaining electrons such that each atom in the structure reaches an octet C Draw the resonance structures for benzene Solution A Each hydrogen atom contributes valence electron and each carbon atom contributes valence electrons for a total of valence electrons If we place a single bonding electron pair between each pair of carbon atoms and between each carbon and a hydrogen atom we obtain the following Each carbon atom in this structure has only electrons and has a formal charge of but we have used only of the valence electrons B If the remaining electrons are uniformly distributed pairwise on alternate carbon atoms we obtain the following Three carbon atoms now have an octet configuration and a formal charge of while three carbon atoms have only electrons and a formal charge of We can convert each lone pair to a bonding electron pair which gives each atom an octet of electrons and a formal charge of by making three CC double bonds C There are however two ways to do this Each structure has alternating double and single bonds but experimentation shows that each carboncarbon bond in benzene is identical with bond lengths pm intermediate between those typically found for a CC single bond pm and a CC double bond pm We can describe the bonding in benzene using the two resonance structures but the actual electronic structure is an average of the two The existence of multiple resonance structures for aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene is often indicated by drawing either a circle or dashed lines inside the hexagon This combination of p orbitals for benzene can be visualized as a ring with a node in the plane of the carbon atoms As can be seen in an electrostatic potential map of benzene the electrons are distributed symmetrically around the ring Exercise The sodium salt of nitrite is used to relieve muscle spasms Draw two resonance structures for the nitrite ion NO Answer Exercises Questions Q Draw the resonance

Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Layne Morsch University of Illinois Springfield Extra example A molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures also called resonance structures or canonical forms Such is the case for ozone O an allotrope of oxygen with a Vshaped structure and an OOO angle of O We know that ozone has a Vshaped structure so one O atom is central Each O atom has valence electrons for a total of valence electrons Assigning one bonding pair of electrons to each oxygenoxygen bond gives with electrons left over If we place three lone pairs of electrons on each terminal oxygen we obtain and have electrons left over At this point both terminal oxygen atoms have octets of electrons We therefore place the last electrons on the central atom The central oxygen has only electrons We must convert one lone pair on a terminal oxygen atom to a bonding pair of electronsbut which one Depending on which one we choose we obtain either Which is correct In fact neither is correct Both predict one OO single bond and one OO double bond If the bonds were of different types one single and one double for example they would have different lengths It turns out however that both OO bond distances are identical pm which is shorter than a typical OO single bond pm and longer than the OO double bond in O pm Equivalent Lewis dot structures such as those of ozone are called resonance structures The position of the atoms is the same in the various resonance structures of a compound but the position of the electrons is different Doubleheaded arrows link the different resonance structures of a compound Before the development of quantum chemistry it was thought that the doubleheaded arrow indicates that the actual electronic structure is an average of those shown or that the molecule oscillates between the two structures Today we know that the electrons involved in the double bonds occupy an orbital that extends over all three oxygen molecules combining p orbitals on all three Figure Figure The resonance structure of ozone involves a molecular orbital extending all three oxygen atomsIn ozone a molecular orbital extending over all three oxygen atoms is formed from three atom centered pz orbitals Similar molecular orbitals are found in every resonance

contributorsCarboxylate exampleExample with resonance structuresExercisesSolutionsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and AttributionsAdditional resonance topicsRecognizing Resonance Objectives After completing this section you should be able to use the concept of resonance to explain structural features of molecules and ions understand the relationship between resonance and relative stability of molecules and ions Rules for Drawing and Working with Resonance Contributors Recognizing drawing and evaluating the relative stability of resonance contributors is essential to understanding organic reaction mechanisms When learning to draw and interpret resonance structures there are a few basic guidelines to help There is ONLY ONE REAL STRUCTURE for each molecule or ion This real structure the resonance hybrid takes its character from the average of all the individual resonance contributors When looking at a resonance contributors we are seeing the exact same molecule or ion depicted in different ways Resonance hybrids are really a single unchanging structure Major resonance contributors of the formate ion Representations of the formate resonance hybrid The resonance hybrid is more stable than any individual resonance structures Often resonance structures represent the movement of a charge between two or more atoms The charge is spread out amongst these atoms and therefore more stabilized When looking at the picture above the resonance contributors represent the negative charge as being on one oxygen or the other The resonance hybrid shows the negative charge being shared equally between two oxygens In the resonance hybrid the negative charge is spread out over a larger part of the molecule and is therefore more stable Resonance contributors do not have to be equivalent Because of this resonance structures do necessarily contribute equally to the resonance hybrid The two resonance structures shown below are not equivalent because one show the negative charge on an oxygen while the other shows it on a carbon Later we will show that the contributor with the negative charge on the oxygen is the more stable of the two Also this means that the resonance hybrid will not be an exact mixture of the two structures All resonance contributors must be correct Lewis structures Each atom should have a complete valence shell and be shown with correct formal charges A carbocation carbon with only valence electrons is the only allowed exception to the valence shell rules The structure below is an invalid resonance structure even though it only shows the movement of a pi bond The resulting structure contains a carbon with ten electrons which violates the octet rule making it invalid All resonance contributors must have the same molecular formula the same number of electrons and same net charge The molecules in the figure below are not resonance structures of the same molecule because then have different molecular formulas CHNO Vs CHNO Also the two structures have different net charges neutral Vs positive Resonance contributors only differ by the positions of pi bond and lone pair electrons Sigma bonds are never broken or made because of this atoms must maintain their same position The molecules in the figure below are not resonance structures of the same molecule even though they have the same molecular formula CHO These molecules are considered structural isomers because their difference involves the breaking of a sigma bond and moving a hydrogen atom Major and Minor Resonance Contributors As previously state the true structure of a resonance hybrid is the combination of all the possible resonance structures If the resonance structures are equal in stability they the contribute equally to the structure of the hybrid However if the resonance structures have different stabilities they contribute to the hybrids structure in proportions related to their relative stabilities It can be said the the resonance hybrids structure resembles the most stable resonance structure Because of this it is important to be able to compare the stabilities of resonance structures In the example below structure II is much less important in terms of its contribution to the hybrid because it contains the violated octet of a carbocation The relative stabilities of the two structures are so vastly different that molecules which contain a CO bond are almost exclusively written in a form like structure I However as will learn in chapter the positively charged carbon created by structure II will explain how the CO bond will react with electron rich species Rules for Estimating Stability of Resonance Structures The resonance structures in which all atoms have complete valence shells is more stable This means most atoms have a full octet In the example below structure I has a carbon atom with a positive charge and therefore an incomplete octet Based on this criterionstructure I is less stable and is a more minor contributor to the resonance hybrid than structure II The structures with the least number of formal charges is more stable Based on this structure II is less stable because is has two atoms with formal charges while structure I has none Structure I would be the major resonance contributor The structures with a negative charge on the more electronegative atom will be more stable The difference between the two resonance structures is the placement of a negative charge Structure II is the more stable and the major resonance contributor because it places the negative charge on the more electronegative oxygen The structures with a positive charges on the least electronegative atom most electropositive is more stable The structures with the least separation of formal charges is more stable The only difference between the two structures below are the relative positions of the positive and negative charges In structure I the charges are closer together making it more stable Resonance forms that are equivalent have no difference in stability When looking at the two structures below no difference can be made using the rules listed above This means the two structures are equivalent in stability and would make equal structural contributions to the resonance hybrid Examples of major and minor contributors Carboxylate example In the case of carboxylates contributors A and B below are equivalent in terms of their relative contribution to the hybrid structure However there is also a third resonance contributor C in which the carbon bears a positive formal charge a carbocation and both oxygens are singlebonded and bear negative charges Structure C makes a less important contribution to the overall bonding picture of the group relative to A and B How do we know that structure C is the minor contributor Apply the rules below The carbon in contributor C does not have an octect In general resonance contributors in which a carbon does not fulfill the octet rule are relatively less important rule In structure C there are only three bonds compared to four in A and B In general a resonance structure with a lower number of total bonds is relatively less important rule Structure C also has more formal charges than are present in A or B In general resonance contributors in which there is moregreater separation of charge are relatively less important rule Structures A and B are equivalent and will be equal contributors to the resonance hybrid rule The resonance contributor in which a negative formal charge is located on a more electronegative atom usually oxygen or nitrogen is more stable than one in which the negative charge is located on a less electronegative atom such as carbon An example is in the upper left expression in the next figure rule Example with resonance structures Molecules with more than resonance structures can also be considered using the rules listed above Of the resonance structures listed below structure I would be the most stable because all the nonhydrogen atoms have a full octet and the negative charge is on the more electronegative atom oxygen Structure III would be next in stability because all of the nonhydrogen atoms have full octets though now the negative charge is on carbon rather than oxygen Structure II would be the least stable of the three because it has the carbocation does not have an octet Of the three structure I would be the major resonance structure and would most resemble the structure of the true resonance hybrid Structure II is considered a minor resonance contributor and would have very little effect on the structure of the resonance hybrid Example Draw the major resonance contributor of the structure below Include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how you got from the given structure to your structure Explain why your contributor is the major one In what kind of orbitals are the two lone pairs on the oxygen Solution In the structure above the carbon with the positive formal charge does not have a complete octet of valence electrons Using the curved arrow convention a lone pair on the oxygen can be moved to the adjacent bond to the left and the electrons in the double bond shifted over to the left see the rules for drawing resonance contributors to convince yourself that these are legal moves The resulting resonance contributor in which the oxygen bears the formal charge is the major one because all atoms have a complete octet and there is one additional bond drawn resonance rules and both apply This system can be thought of as four parallel p orbitals one each on C C and C plus one on oxygen sharing four pi electrons One lone pair on the oxygen is in an unhybridized p orbital and is part of the conjugated pi system and the other is located in an sp orbital Also note that one additional contributor can be drawn but it is also minor because it has a carbon with an incomplete octet Exercises For the following resonance structures please rank them in order of stability Indicate which would be the major contributor to the resonance hybrid Draw four additional resonance contributors for the molecule

formation of enamines Section reactions of enamines Draw the major resonance contributor for the enamine and explain why your contributor is the major one Draw the major resonance contributor for each of the anions below Solutions Structure I would be the most stable because all the nonhydrogen atoms have a full octet and the negative charge is on the more electronegative nitrogen Structure III would be the next in stability because all of the nonhydrogen atoms have full octets Structrure II would be the least stable because it has the violated octet of a carbocation The contributor on the left is the most stable there are no formal charges The contributor on the right is least stable there are formal charges and a carbon has an incomplete octet The contributor in the middle is

Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Layne Morsch University of Illinois Springfield Additional resonance topics Recognizing Resonance Resonance contributors involve the imaginary movement of pibonded electrons or of lonepair electrons that are adjacent to ie conjugated to pi bonds You can never shift the location of electrons in sigma bonds if you show a sigma bond forming or breaking you are showing a chemical reaction taking place Likewise the positions of atoms in the molecule cannot change between two resonance contributors Because benzene will appear throughout this course it is important to recognize the stability gained through the resonance delocalization of the six pi electrons throughout the six carbon atoms Benzene also illustrates one way to recognize resonance when it is possible to draw two or more equivalent Lewis structures If we were to draw the structure of an aromatic molecule such as dimethylbenzene there are two ways that we could draw the double bonds Which way is correct There are two simple answers to this question both and neither one Both ways of drawing the molecule are equally acceptable approximations of the bonding picture for the molecule but neither one by itself is an accurate picture of the delocalized pi bonds The two alternative drawings however when considered together give a much more accurate picture than either one on its own This is because they imply together that the carboncarbon bonds are not double bonds not single bonds but about halfway in between When it is possible to draw more than one valid structure for a compound or ion we have identified resonance contributors two or more different Lewis structures depicting the same molecule or ion that when considered together do a better job of approximating delocalized pibonding than any single structure By convention resonance contributors are linked by a doubleheaded arrow and are sometimes enclosed by brackets In order to make it easier to visualize the difference between two resonance contributors small curved arrows are often used Each of these arrows depicts the movement of two pi electrons In the drawing of resonance contributors however this electron movement occurs only in our minds as we try to visualize delocalized pi bonds Nevertheless use of the curved arrow notation is an essential skill that you will need to develop in drawing resonance contributors The depiction of benzene using the two resonance contributors A and B in the figure above does not imply that the molecule at one moment looks like structure A then at the next moment shifts to look like structure B Rather at all moments the molecule is a combination or resonance hybrid of both A and B Caution It is very important to be clear that in drawing two or more resonance contributors we are not drawing two different molecules they are simply different depictions of the exact same molecule Furthermore the doubleheaded resonance arrow does NOT mean that a chemical reaction has taken place Benzene is often drawn as only one of the two possible resonance contributors it is assumed that the reader understands that resonance hybridization is implied However sometimes benzene will be drawn with a circle inside the hexagon either solid or dashed as a way of drawing a resonance hybrid The above resonance structures show that the electrons are delocalized within the molecule and through this process the molecule gains extra stability Ozone with both of its opposite formal charges creates a neutral molecule and through resonance it is a stable molecule The extra electron that created the negative charge one terminal oxygen can be delocalized by resonance through the other terminal oxygen Benzene is an extremely stable molecule due to its geometry and molecular orbital interactions but most importantly due to its resonance structures The delocalized electrons in the benzene ring make the molecule very stable and with its characteristics of a nucleophile it will react with a strong electrophile only and after the first reactivity the substituted benzene will depend on its resonance to direct the next position for the reaction to add a second substituent Example Multiple Resonance of other Molecules Molecules and ions with more than one resonance form Some structural resonance conformations are the major contributor or the dominant forms that the molecule exists For example if we look at the above rules for estimating the stability of a molecule we see that for the third molecule the first and second forms are the major contributors for the overall stability of the molecule The nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon so it can handle the negative charge more than carbon A carbon with a negative charge is the least favorable conformation for the molecule to exist so the last resonance form contributes very little for the stability of the Ion The Hybrid Resonance forms show the different Lewis structures with the electron been delocalized This is very important for the reactivity of chlorobenzene because in the presence of an electrophile it will react and the formation of another bond will be directed and determine by resonance The lone pair of electrons delocalized in the aromatic substituted ring is where it can potentially form a new bond with an electrophile as it is shown there are three possible places that reactivity can take place the first to react will take place at the para position with respect to the chloro substituent and then to either ortho position IntroductionStereocenters are labeled R or SSequence rules to assign priorities to substituentsRule Rule Rule ProblemsSolutionsOutside linksReferencesExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to assign CahnIngoldPrelog priorities to a given set of substituents determine whether a given wedgeandbrokenline structure corresponds to an R or an S configuration with or without the aid of molecular models draw the wedgeandbrokenline structure for a compound given its IUPAC name complete with R or S designation construct a stereochemically accurate model of a given enantiomer from either a wedgeandbrokenline structure or the IUPAC name of the compound complete with R or S designation Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below absolute configuration R configuration S configuration Study Notes When designating a structure as R or S you must ensure that the atom or group with the lowest priority is pointing away from you the observer The easiest way to show this is to use the wedgeandbrokenline representation You can then immediately determine whether you are observing an R configuration or an S configuration To name the enantiomers of a compound unambiguously their names must include the handedness of the molecule The method for this is formally known as RS nomenclature Introduction The method of unambiguously assigning the handedness of molecules was originated by three chemists RS Cahn C Ingold and V Prelog and as such is also often called the CahnIngoldPrelog rules In addition to the CahnIngold system there are two ways of experimentally determining the absolute configuration of an enantiomer Xray diffraction analysis Note that there is no correlation between the sign of rotation and the structure of a particular enantiomer Chemical correlation with a molecule whose structure has already been determined via Xray diffraction However for nonlaboratory purposes it is beneficial to focus on the RS system The sign of optical rotation although different for the two enantiomers of a chiral moleculeat the same temperature cannot be used to establish the absolute configuration of an enantiomer this is because the sign of optical rotation for a particular enantiomer may change when the temperature changes Stereocenters are labeled R or S The right hand and left hand nomenclature is used to name the enantiomers of a chiral compound The stereocenters are labeled as R or S Consider the first picture a curved arrow is drawn from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent If the arrow points in a counterclockwise direction left when leaving the o clock position the configuration at stereocenter is considered S Sinister Latin left If however the arrow points clockwiseRight when leaving the o clock position then the stereocenter is labeled R Rectus Latin right The R or S is then added as a prefix in parenthesis to the name of the enantiomer of interest Example RBromobutane S Dihydroxypropanal Sequence rules to assign priorities to substituents Before applying the R and S nomenclature to a stereocenter the substituents must be prioritized according to the following rules Rule First examine at the atoms directly attached to the stereocenter of the compound A substituent with a higher atomic number takes precedence over a substituent with a lower atomic number Hydrogen is the lowest possible priority substituent because it has the lowest atomic number When dealing with isotopes the atom with the higher atomic mass receives higher priority When visualizing the molecule the lowest priority substituent should always point away from the viewer a dashed line indicates this To understand how this works or looks imagine that a clock and a pole Attach the pole to the back of the clock so that when when looking at the face of the clock the pole points away from the viewer in the same way the lowest priority substituent should point away Then draw an arrow from the highest priority atom to the nd highest priority atom to the rd highest priority atom Because the th highest priority atom is placed in the back the arrow should appear like it is going across the face of a clock If it is going clockwise then it is an Renantiomer If it is going counterclockwise it is an Senantiomer When looking at a problem with wedges and dashes if the lowest priority atom is not on the dashed line pointing away the molecule must be rotated Remember that Wedges indicate coming towards the viewer Dashes indicate pointing away from the viewer Rule If there are two substituents with equal rank proceed along the two substituent chains until there is a point of difference First determine which of the chains has the first connection to an atom with the highest priority the highest atomic number That chain has the higher priority If the chains are similar proceed down the chain until a point of difference For example an ethyl substituent takes priority over a methyl substituent At the connectivity of the stereocenter both have a carbon atom which are equal in rank Going down the chains a methyl has only has hydrogen atoms attached to it whereas the ethyl has another carbon atom The carbon atom on the ethyl is the first point of difference and has a higher atomic number than hydrogen therefore the ethyl takes priority over the methyl Rule If a chain is connected to the same kind of atom twice or three times check to see if the atom it is connected to has a greater atomic number than any of the atoms that the competing chain is connected to If none of the atoms connected to the competing chains at the same point has a greater atomic number the chain bonded to the same atom multiple times has the greater priority If however one of the atoms connected to the competing chain has a higher atomic number that chain has the higher priority Example A methylethyl substituent takes precedence over an ethyl substituent Connected to the first carbon atom ethyl only has one other carbon whereas the methylethyl has two carbon atoms attached to the first this is the first point of difference Therefore methylethyl ranks higher in priority than ethyl as shown below However Remember that being double or triple bonded to an atom means that the atom is connected to the same atom twice In such a case follow the same method as above Caution Keep in mind that priority is determined by the first point of difference along the two similar substituent chains After the first point of difference the rest of the chain is irrelevant When looking for the first point of difference on similar substituent chains one may encounter branching If there is branching choose the branch that is higher in priority If the two substituents have similar branches rank the elements within the branches until a point of difference After all your substituents have been prioritized in the correct manner you can now namelabel the molecule R or S Put the lowest priority substituent in the back dashed line Proceed from to to it is helpful to draw or imagine an arcing arrow that goes from Determine if the direction from to to clockwise or counterclockwise i If it is clockwise it is R ii if it is counterclockwise it is S USE YOUR MODELING KIT Models assist in visualizing the structure When using a model make sure the lowest priority is pointing away from you Then determine the direction from the highest priority substituent to the lowest clockwise R or counterclockwise S IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MODELING KIT remember that the dashes mean the bond is going into the screen and the wedges means that bond is coming out of the screen If the lowest priority bond is not pointing to the back mentally rotate it so that it is However it is very useful when learning organic chemistry to use models Problems Are the following R or S Solutions S I Br F H The lowest priority substituent H is already going towards the back It turns left going from I to Br to F so its a S R Br Cl CH H You have to switch the H and Br in order to place the H the lowest priority in the back Then going from Br to Cl CH is turning to the right giving you a R Neither R or S This molecule is achiral Only chiral molecules can be named R or S R OH CN CHNH H The H the lowest priority has to be switched to the back Then going from OH to CN to CHNH you are turning right giving you a R S Then going from to to you are turning left giving you a S

Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to illustrate by means of a suitable example the limitations of the terms cis and trans in naming isomeric alkenes use the EZ designation to describe the geometry of a given alkene structure incorporate the EZ designation into the IUPAC name of a given alkene draw the correct Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure of an alkene given its EZ designation plus other necessary information eg molecular formula IUPAC name Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below sequence rules CahnIngoldPrelog rules Study Notes The limitations of the cistrans system are illustrated in the examples given below From your study of the IUPAC system you should be able to identify this compound as ethylmethylheptene but is it cis or trans At first you might say cis because it appears that two ethyl groups appear on the same side of the double bond However the correct answer is trans The rule is that the designation cis or trans must correspond to the configuration of the longest carbon chain Tracing out the sevencarbon chain in the compound shown above you change sides as you pass through the double bond So the full name for this compound is ethylmethyltransheptene The cistrans system breaks down completely in a compound such as that shown below The EZ system which is the subject of this section is designed to accommodate such situations In cases where two or more double bonds are present you must be prepared to assign an E or Z designation to each of the double bonds For example Another use for these sequence rules will be part of the discussion of optical isomerism in Section EZ nomenclature The traditional system for naming the geometric isomers of an alkene in which the same groups are arranged differently is to name them as cis or trans However it is easy to find examples where the cistrans system is not easily applied IUPAC has a more complete system for naming alkene isomers The RS system is based on a set of priority rules which allow you to rank any groups The rigorous IUPAC system for naming alkene isomers called the EZ system is based on the same priority rules Note The priority rules are often called the CahnIngoldPrelog CIP rules after the chemists who developed the system The general strategy of the EZ system is to analyze the two groups at each end of the double bond At each end rank the two groups using the CIP priority rules discussed in Ch Then see whether the higher priority group at one end of the double bond and the higher priority group at the other end of the double bond are on the same side Z from German zusammen together or on opposite sides E from German entgegen opposite of the double bond Example Butene The Figure above shows the two isomers of butene You should recognize them as cis and trans Lets analyze them to see whether they are E or Z Start with the left hand structure the cis isomer On C the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are C and H By the CIP priority rules C is higher priority than H higher atomic number Now look at C the right end of the double bond Similarly the atoms are C and H with C being higher priority We see that the higher priority group is down at C and down at C Since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together Therefore this is Zbutene Now look at the right hand structure the trans isomer In this case the priority group is down on the left end of the double bond and up on the right end of the double bond Since the two priority groups are on opposite sides of the double bond they are entgegen opposite Therefore this is Ebutene EZ will work even when cistrans fails In simple cases such as butene Z corresponds to cis and E to trans However that is not a rule This section and the following one illustrate some idiosyncrasies that happen when you try to compare the two systems The real advantage of the EZ system is that it will always work In contrast the cistrans system breaks down with many ambiguous cases Example The following figure shows two isomers of an alkene with four different groups on the double bond bromochlorofluoroiodoethene It should be apparent that the two structures shown are distinct chemicals However it is impossible to name them as cis or trans On the other hand the EZ system works fine Consider the left hand structure On C the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are Br and I By the CIP priority rules I is higher priority than Br higher atomic number Now look at C The atoms are Cl and F with Cl being higher priority We see that the higher priority group is down at C and down at C Since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together Therefore this is the Z isomer Similarly the right hand structure is E EZ will work but may not agree with cistrans Consider the molecule shown at the left This is bromobutene ignoring the geometric isomerism for now Cis or trans This molecule is clearly cis The two methyl groups are on the same side More rigorously the parent chain is cis E or Z There is a methyl at each end of the double bond On the left the methyl is the high priority group because the other group is H On the right the methyl is the low priority group because the other group is Br That is the high priority groups are CH left and Br right Thus the two priority groups are on opposite sides entgegen E Note This example should convince you that cis and Z are not synonyms Cistrans and EZ are determined by distinct criteria There may seem to be a simple correspondence but it is not a rule Be sure to determine cistrans or EZ separately as needed Multiple double bonds If the compound contains more than one double bond then each one is analyzed and declared to be E or Z Example The configuration at the left hand double bond is E at the right hand double bond it is Z Thus this compound is EZdichlorohexadiene The doublebond rule in determining priorities Example Consider the compound below This is chloroethylbutadiene ignoring for the moment the geometric isomerism There is no geometric isomerism at the second double bond at because it has H at its far end What about the first double bond at On the left hand end there is H and Cl Cl is higher priority by atomic number On the right hand end there is CHCH an ethyl group and CHCH a vinyl or ethenyl group Both of these groups have C as the first atom so we have a tie so far and must look further What is attached to this first C For the ethyl group the first C is attached to C H and H For the ethenyl group the first C is attached to a C twice so we count it twice therefore that C is attached to C C H CCH is higher than CHH therefore the ethenyl group is higher priority Since the priority groups Cl and ethenyl are on the same side of the double bond this is the Zisomer the compound is Zchloroethylbutadiene The first point of difference rule Which is higher priority by the CIP rules a C with an O and H attached to it or a C with three C The first C has one atom of high priority but also two atoms of low priority How do these balance out Answering this requires a clear understanding of how the ranking is done The simple answer is that the first point of difference is what matters the O wins To illustrate this consider the molecule at the left Is the double bond here E or Z At the left end of the double bond Br C But the right end of the double bond requires a careful analysis At the right hand end the first atom attached to the double bond is a C at each position A tie so we look at what is attached to this first C For the upper C it is CCC since the triple bond counts three times For the lower C it is OHH listed in order from high priority atom to low OHH is higher priority than CCC because of the first atom in the list That is the O of the lower group beats the C of the upper group In other words the O is the highest priority atom of any in this comparison thus the O wins Therefore the high priority groups are up on the left end the Br and down on the right end the CHOCH This means that the isomer shown is opposite entgegen E And what is the name The name feature of ChemSketch says it is Ebromoethylidenepentynyl methyl ether Example The configuration about double bonds is undoubtedly best specified by the cistrans notation when there is no ambiguity involved Unfortunately many compounds cannot be described adequately by the cistrans system Consider for example configurational isomers of fluoro chloro bromoiodoethene and There is no obvious way in which the cistrans system can be used A system that is easy to use and which is based on the sequence rules already described for the RS system works as follows An order of precedence is established for the two atoms or groups attached to each end of the double bond according to the sequence rules of Section When these rules are applied to fluoro chlorobromo iodoethene the priority sequence is at carbon atom C F at carbon atom I Br Examination of the two configurations shows that the two priority groups one on each end are either on the same side of the double bond or on opposite sides The Z isomer is designated as the isomer in which the top priority groups are on the same side Z is taken from the German word zusammen together The E isomer has these groups on opposite sides E German for entgegen across Two further examples show how the nomenclature is used Exercises Questions Q Order the following in increasing priority A H Cl OH B CH CHOH CHCH C CCH CHCH CHO Q Label the following as E or Z conformations

methylamine or as two or more words as methyl chloride To solve this problem you must determine whether the principle or parent function is an element or a compounds in its own right if it is either one then the name is written as a single word The following examples should help to clarify the system In each name the part of the name that denotes the parent compound is italicized However if the parent function cannot be constructed as being a real compound the name is correctly written as two or more words For example could be named as a chloride in which case we use two words methyl chloride to describe it A chloride or any halide is a class of compound not a specific compound To identify a specific halide the adjective that describes the halide is written as a separate word preceding the class name Examples follow in which the class name is italicized The parent compounds designated here as amine carbaldehyde and sulfonic acid are properly ammonia methanal and sulfurous

ordinary sock fits equally well on a right foot as on a left foot However asymmetric or chiral reagents can differentiate between enantiomers especially by having at least some difference in reactivity toward them A good analogy is the comparison between the ease of putting a left shoe on a left foot and a left shoe on a right foot The difference may not be very pronounced for simple compounds with only one or two chiral centers but generally the larger and more complex that chiral reagent becomes the greater is its selectivity or power to discriminate between enantiomers and diastereomers as well The property of being able to discriminate between diastereomers is called stereospecificity and this is an especially important characteristic of biological systems For example our ability to taste and smell is regulated by chiral molecules in our mouths and noses that act as receptors to sense foreign substances We can anticipate then that enantiomers may interact differently with the receptor molecules and induce different sensations This appears to be the case The two enantiomers of the amino acid leucine for example have different tastes one is bitter whereas the other is sweet Enantiomers also can smell different as is known from the odors of the two carvones One has the odor of caraway and the other of spearmint Some animals and especially insects rely on what amounts to a senseofsmell for communication with others of their species Substances synthesized by a particular species and used to send messages in this way are called pheromones Many of these substances have rather simple molecular structures because they must be reasonably volatile and yet they are remarkably specific in the response they induce When stereoisomerism is possible usually only one isomer is effective The sex attractant of the silkworm moth Bombyx mori has been identified as transcishexadecadenol familiarly known as bombykol and that of the gypsy moth is methylcisepoxyoctadecane or disparlure There is hope that insect sex lures can be used to disrupt the mating pattern of insects and thereby control insect population This approach to pest control has important advantages over conventional insecticides in that the chemical lures are specific for a particular species also they are effective in remarkably low concentrations and are relatively nontoxic There are problems however not the least of which is the isolation and identification of the sex attractant that is produced by the insects only in minute quantities Also synergistic effects are known to operate in several insect species such that not one but several pheromones act in concert to attract the opposite sex Two notable pests the European corn borer and the redbanded leaf roller both use cistetradecenyl ethanoate as the primary sex attractant but the pure cis isomer is ineffective unless a small amount of trans isomer also is present The optimum amount appears to be between and of the trans isomer We shall discuss many other examples of biological stereospecificity in later chapters Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions As you proceed with your study of organic chemistry you may well feel confused as to what it is you are actually dealing with On the one hand there will be exhortations to remember how organic chemistry pervades our everyday life And yet on the other hand you also will be exhorted to think about organic compounds in terms of abstract structural formulas representing molecules when there is absolutely no way at all to deal with molecules as single entities Especially if you are not studying organic compounds in the laboratory concurrently you may come to confuse the abstraction of formulas and ballandstick models of the molecules with the reality of organic compounds and this would be most undesirable At each stage of the way you should try to make or at least visualize a juncture between a structural formula and an actual substance in a bottle This will not be easy it takes time to reach the level of experience that a practicing organic chemist has so that he can tell you with some certainty that the structural formula represents in actuality a limpid colorless liquid with a pleasant odor slightly soluble in water boiling somewhere about A useful method for developing this sort of feeling for the relationship between structures and actual compounds is to check your perception of particular substances with their properties as given in a chemical handbook One perhaps comforting thought for you at this time is that differences between the chemical behaviors of relatively similar organic compounds usually are ascribed to just three important and different kinds of effects two of which have root in common experience One called steric hindrance is a manifestation of experience that two solid objects cannot occupy the same space at once Another is the electrical effect which boils down to a familiar catechism that like electrical charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other The remaining important effect the one that has no basis in common experience derives from quantum mechanics The quantum mechanical effect explains why benzene is unusually stable how and why many reactions occur in special ways and probably most important of all the ways that organic compounds interact with electromagnetic radiation of all kinds from radio waves to x rays We shall try to give as clear explanations as possible of the quantum mechanical effects but some of it will just have to be accepted as fact that we cannot ourselves experience directly nor understand intuitively For example when a grindstone rotates so far as our experience goes it can have an infinitely variable rate of rotation and consequently infinitely variable rotation angular momentum However molecules in the gas phase have only specific rotation rates and corresponding specific rotational momentum values No measurement technique can detect inbetween values of these quantities Molecules are quantized rotators About all you can do is try to accept this fact and if you try long enough you may be able to substitute familiarity for understanding and be happy with that All of us have some concepts we use continually even perhaps unconsciously about energy and work Thermodynamics makes these concepts quantitative and provides very useful information about what might be called the potential for any process to occur be it production of electricity from a battery water running uphill photosynthesis or formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion of gasoline In the past most organic chemists seldom tried to apply thermodynamics to the reactions in which they were interested Much of this was due to the paucity of thermodynamic data for more than a few organic compounds but some was because organic chemists often liked to think of themselves as artistic types with little use for quantitative data on their reactions which may have meant that they didnt really know about thermodynamics and were afraid to ask Times have changed Extensive thermochemical data are now available the procedures are well understood and the results both useful and interesting We shall make considerable use of thermodynamics in our exposition of organic chemistry We believe it will greatly improve your understanding of why some reactions go and others do not Finally you should recognize that you almost surely will have some problems with the following chapters in making decisions as to how much time and emphasis you should put on the various concepts principles facts and so on that we will present for you As best we can we try to help you by pointing out that this idea fact and so on is especially important or words to that effect Also we have tried to underscore important information by indicating the breadth of its application to other scientific disciplines as well as to technology In addition we have caused considerable material to be set in smaller type and indented Such material includes extensions of basic ideas and departments of fuller explanation In many places the exposition is more complete than it needs to be for you at the particular location in the book However you will have need for the extra material later and it will be easier to locate and easier to refresh your memory on what came before if it is one place We will try to indicate clearly what you should learn immediately and what you will want to come back for later The problem is no matter what we think is important you or your professor will have your own judgments about relevance And because it is quite impossible to write an individual text for your particular interests and needs we have tried to accommodate a range of interests and needs through providing a rather rich buffet of knowledge about modern organic chemistry Hopefully all you will need is here but there is surely much more too So to avoid intellectual indigestion we suggest you not try to learn everything as it comes but rather try hardest to understand the basic ideas and concepts to which we give the greatest emphasis As you proceed further the really important facts nomenclature and so on the kind of material that basically requires memorization will emerge as that which in your own course of study you will find you use over and over again In hope that you may wish either to learn more about particular topics or perhaps gain better understanding through exposure to a different perspective on how they can be presented we have provided supplementary reading lists at the end of each chapter Our text contains many exercises You will encounter some in the middle of the chapters arranged to be closely allied to the subject at hand Others will be in the form of supplementary exercises at the end of the chapters Many of the exercises will be drill many others will extend and enlarge upon the text The more difficult problems

of the four valence electrons on each carbon are distributed to the three sp hybrid orbitals while the remaining electron goes into the unhybridized pz orbital Each carbon in ethene is said to be a sphybridized carbon The electron configuration of the sp hybridized carbon shows that there are four unpaired electrons to form bonds However the unpaired electrons are contained in two different types of orbitals so it is to be expected that two different types of bonds will form The shape of the sphybridized orbital has be mathematically shown to to be roughly the same as that of the sphybridized orbital To minimize the repulsion between electrons the three sphybridized orbitals are arranged with a trigonal planar geometry Each orbital lobe is pointing to the three corners of an equilateral triangle with angles of between them Again geometry and hybrization can be tied together Atoms surrounded by three electron groups can be said to have a trigonal planar geometry and sp hybridization The unhybridized pz orbital is perpendicular to the plane of the trigonal planar sp hybrid orbtals In the ethylene molecule each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms Thus overlap two sphybridized orbitals with the s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms for the CH sigma bonds in ethylene spCsH Consequently consistent with the observations the four carbonhydrogen bonds in ethylene are identical The CC sigma bond in ethylene is formed by the overlap of an sp hybrid orbital from each carbon The overlap of hybrid orbitals or a hybrid orbital and a s orbtial from hydrogen creates the sigma bond framework of the ethylene molecule However the unhybridized pz orbital on each carbon remains The unhybridized pz orbitals on each carbon overlap to a π bond pi The orbital overlap is commonly written as pzCpzC In general multiple bonds in molecular compound are formed by the overlap of unhybridized p orbitals It should be noted that the carboncarbon double bond in ethlene is made up of two different types of bond a sigma and a pi Overall ethylene is said to contain five sigma bonds and one pi bond Pi bonds tend to be weaker than sigma bonds because the sidebyside overlap the p orbitals give a less effective orbital overlap when compared to the endtoend orbital overlap of a sigma bond This makes the pi much easier to break which is one of the most important ideas in organic chemistry reactions as we will see in Chapter and subsequent chapters An ethylene molecule is said to be made up of five sigma bonds and one pi bond The three sp hybrid orbitals on each carbon orient to create the basic trigonal planer geometry The HCC bond angle in ethylene is o which is very close to the o predicted by VSEPR The four CH sigma bonds in ethylene The carboncarbon double bond in ethylene is both shorter pm and almost twice as strong kJmol than the carbon carbon single bond in ethylene pm kJmol Each of the four carbonhydrogen bond in ethylene are equivalent has have a length of pm Rigidity in Ethene Because they are the result of sidebyside overlap rather then endtoend overlap like a sigma bond pi bonds are not free to rotate If rotation about this bond were to occur it would involve disrupting the sidebyside overlap between the two pz orbitals that make up the pi bond If free rotation were to occur the porbitals would have to go through a phase where they are from each other which would break the pi bond because there would be no overlap Since the pi bond is essential to the structure of ethene it must not break so there can be not free rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond The presence of the pi bond thus locks the six atoms of ethene into the same plane Exercise Consider the following molecule At each atom what is the hybridization and the bond

completing this section you should be able to describe the structure of ethane in terms of the sp hybridization of the two carbon atoms present in the molecule ethane Bonding in Ethane The simplest molecule with a carboncarbon bond is ethane CH In ethane CHCH both carbons are sphybridized meaning that both have four bonds with tetrahedral geometry An sp orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an sp orbital of the second carbon atom to form a carboncarbon σ bond This orbital overlap is often described using the notation spCspC Each of the remaining sp hybrid orbitals overlaps with the s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen σ bonds The σ carboncarbon bond has a bond length of pm and a bond strength of kJmol The carbonhydrogen σ bonds are slightly weaker kJmol than those of methane The CCH bond angles in ethane are o which is close to the what is expected for tetrahedral molecules The orientation of the two CH groups is not fixed relative to each other Because they are formed from the endonend overlap of two orbitals sigma bonds are free to rotate This means in the case of ethane molecule that the two methyl CH groups can be pictured as two wheels on a hub each one able to rotate freely with respect to the other In Section we will learn more about the implications of rotational freedom in sigma bonds when we discuss the conformation of organic molecules How did they know The tetrahedral geometry of carbon was predicted as far back as But how did they know A question came up when looking at ethane with a bromine substituent CHBr When looking at the possible structures of the compound CHBr there are several possible structural formulashere was a serious problem as to whether these formulas represent the same or different compounds All that was known in the early days was that every purified sample of CHBr no matter how prepared had a boiling point of oC and density of gml Furthermore all looked the same all smelled the same and all underwent the same chemical reactions There was no evidence that CHBr was a mixture or that more than one compound of this formula could be prepared One might conclude therefore that all of the structural formulas above represent a single substance but how A brilliant solution to the problem came when J H vant Hoff proposed that all four bonds of carbon are equivalent and directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron If we redraw the structures for CHBr with both carbons having tetrahedral geometry we see that there is only one possible arrangement This theory hints at the idea of free rotation around sigma bonds which will be discussed later There was a serious problem as to whether these formulas represent the same or different compounds All that was known in the early days

Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to describe the structure of methane in terms of the sp hybridization of the central carbon atom Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bond angle hybridization sp hybrid Study Notes The tetrahedral shape is a very important one in organic chemistry as it is the basic shape of all compounds in which a carbon atom is bonded to four other atoms Note that the tetrahedral bond angle of cesfHCH is Valence bond theorys use of overlapping atomic orbitals to explain how chemical bonds form works well in simple diatomic molecules such as H However when molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds we require a more detailed model A good example is methane CH According to valence bond theory the structure of a covalent species can be depicted using a Lewis structure Experimentally it has been shown that the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the methane molecule are identical meaning they have the same bond energy and the same bond length Also VSEPR theory suggests that the geometry at the carbon atom in the methane molecule is tetrahedral and there exists a large body of both theoretical and experimental evidence supporting this prediction According to valence bond theory to form a covalent bond forms when an unpaired electron in one atom overlaps with an unpaired electron in a different atom Now consider the the electron configuration of the four valence electrons in carbon There is a serious mismatch between the electron configuration of carbon ssp and the predicted structure of methane The modern structure shows that there are only unpaired electrons to share with hydrogens instead of the needed to create methane Also the px and py orbitals are at o to each other They would form perpendicular bonds instead of the tetrahedral o bond angle predicted by VSEPR and experimental data Lastly there are two different orbitals s and p which would create different types of CH bonds As noted earlier experimentally the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the methane molecule are identical Hybrid Orbitals An answer to the problems posed above was offered in by Linus Pauling He showed mathematically that an s orbital and three p orbitals on an atom can combine to form four equivalent hybrid atomic orbitals The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms Hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated atoms A set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set All orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom create the molecular geometry as predicted by the VSEPR theory Hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds Lone pair electrons are often contained in hybrid orbitals sp Hybridization in Methane In order to explain this observation valence bond theory relies on a concept called orbital hybridization In this picture the four valence orbitals of the carbon one s and three p orbitals combine mathematically remember orbitals are described by equations to form four equivalent hybrid orbitals which are named sp orbitals because they are formed from mixing one s and three p orbitals In the new electron configuration each of the four valence electrons on the carbon occupies a single sp orbital creating four unpaired electrons The shape of an sp hybridized orbital is a combination of s and p atomic orbitals Each sphybridized orbital bears an electron and electrons repel each other To minimize the repulsion between electrons the four sphybridized orbitals arrange themselves around the carbon nucleus so that they are as far away as possible from each other resulting in the tetrahedral arrangement predicted by VSPER The carbon atom in methane is called an sphybridized carbon atom The larger lobes of the sp hybrids are directed towards the four corners of a tetrahedron meaning that the angle between any two orbitals is o Bonding in Methane Each CH bond in methane then can be described as an overlap between a halffilled s orbital in four hydrogen atoms and the larger lobe of one of the four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals form a four equivalent sigma σ bond This orbital overlap is often described using the notation spCsH The formation of sp hybrid orbitals successfully explains the tetrahedral structure of methane and the equivalency of the the four CH bonds What remains is an explanation of why the sp hybrid orbitals form When the s and p orbitals in carbon hybridize the resulting sp hybrid orbital is unsymmetrical with one lobe larger than the other This means the larger lobe can overlap more effectively with orbitals from other bonds making them stronger Hybridizing allows for the carbon to form stronger bonds than it would with unhybridized s or p orbitals The four carbonhydrogen bonds in methane are equivalent and all have a bond length of pm x m bond strength of of kJmol All of the HCH bond angles are o Looking Closer Linus Pauling Arguably the most influential chemist of the th century Linus Pauling is the only person to have won two individual that is unshared Nobel Prizes In the s Pauling used new mathematical theories to enunciate some fundamental principles of the chemical bond His book The Nature of the Chemical Bond is one of the most significant books ever published in chemistry Paulings big contribution to chemistry was valence bond theory which combined his knowledge of quantum mechanical theory with his knowledge of basic chemical facts like bond lengths and and bond strengths and shapes of molecules Valence bond theory like Lewiss bonding theory provides a simple model that is useful for predicting and understanding the structures of molecules especially for organic chemistry By Paulings interest turned to biological molecules and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on protein structure He was very close to discovering the double helix structure of DNA when James Watson and James Crick announced their own discovery of its structure in He was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to ban the testing of nuclear weapons Linus Pauling was one of the most influential chemists of the th century

context the key term below sp hybrid orbital Study Notes The bond angles associated with sp sp and sphybridized carbon atoms are approximately and respectively Bonding in acetylene Finally the hybrid orbital concept applies well to triplebonded groups such as alkynes and nitriles Consider for example the structure of ethyne another common name is acetylene the simplest alkyne This molecule is linear all four atoms lie in a straight line The carboncarbon triple bond is only Å long In the hybrid orbital picture of acetylene both carbons are sphybridized In an sphybridized carbon the s orbital combines with the px orbital to form two sp hybrid orbitals that are oriented at an angle of with respect to each other eg along the x axis The py and pz orbitals remain nonhybridized and are oriented perpendicularly along the y and z axes respectively The CC sigma bond is formed by the overlap of one sp orbital from each of the carbons while the two CH sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of the second sp orbital on each carbon with a s orbital on a hydrogen Each carbon atom still has two halffilled py and pz orbitals which are perpendicular both to each other and to the line formed by the sigma bonds These two perpendicular pairs of p orbitals form two pi bonds between the carbons resulting in a triple bond overall one sigma bond plus two pi bonds Acetylene is said to

observation single bonds adjacent to double and triple bonds are progressively shorter and stronger than normal single bonds such as the one in a simple alkane The carboncarbon bond in ethane structure A below results from the overlap of two sp orbitals In propene B however the carboncarbon single bond is the result of overlap between an sp orbital and an sp orbital while in propyne C the carboncarbon single bond is the result of overlap between an sp orbital and an sp orbital These are all single bonds but the single bond in molecule C is shorter and stronger than the one in B which is in turn shorter and stronger than the one in A The explanation here is relatively straightforward An sp orbital is composed of one s orbital and one p orbital and thus it has s character and p character sp orbitals by comparison have s character and p character while sp orbitals have s character and p character Because of their spherical shape s orbitals are smaller and hold electrons closer and tighter to the nucleus compared to p orbitals Consequently bonds involving sp sp overlap as in alkyne C are shorter and stronger than bonds involving sp sp overlap as in alkene B Bonds involving spspoverlap as in alkane A are the longest and weakest of the group because of the p character of the hybrids Hybridization Summary A single bond is a sigma bond A double bond is made up of a sigma bond and a pi bond A triple bond is made up of a sigma bond and two pi bonds Sigma bonds are made by the overlap of two hybrid orbitals or the overlap of a hybrid orbital and a s orbital from hydrogen Pi bonds are made by the overlap of two unhybridized p orbitals Lone pair electrons are usually contained in hybrid orbitals The hybrid orbitals used and hence the hybridization depends on how many electron groups are around the atom in question An electron group can mean either a bonded atom or a lone pair Molecular geometry is also decided by the number of electron groups so it is

key terms below catalytic hydrogenation heat of hydrogenation ΔHhydrog hyperconjugation Study Notes The two alkenes cis cesfCHCHCHCH and cesfCHCCH have similar heats of hydrogenation kJmol and kJmol respectively and are therefore of similar stability However they are both less stable than trans cesfCHCHCHCH kJmol You may wonder why an sp sp bond is stronger than an spsp bond Bond strength depends on the efficiency with which orbitals can overlap In general s orbitals overlap more efficiently than do p orbitals therefore the ss bond in the hydrogen molecule is stronger than the pp bond in fluorine In hybrid orbitals the greater the s character of the orbital the more efficiently it can overlap an sp orbital which has a s character can overlap more effectively than an sp orbital with only s character Alkene hydrogenation is the synaddition of hydrogen to an alkene saturating the bond The alkene reacts with hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst which allows the reaction to occur quickly The energy released in this process called the heat of hydrogenation indicates the relative stability of the double bond in the molecule Introduction The reaction begins with H gas and an alkene a carboncarbon double bond The pi bond in the alkene acts as a nucleophile the two electrons in it form a sigma bond with one of the hydrogen atoms in H With the pi bond broken the other carbon the one that did not newly receive a hydrogen is left with a positive formal charge This is the carbocation intermediate The remaining unreacted hydrogen is now a hydride anion as it was left with two electrons previously in the HH sigma bond Next the electrons of the negatively charged hydride ion form a bond with the positively charged carbon This reaction is exothermic It will occur but it is very slow without a catalyst The Catalyst A catalyst increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy of the reaction Although the catalyst is not consumed in the reaction it is required to accelerate the reaction sufficiently to be observed in a reasonable amount of time Catalysts commonly used in alkene hydrogenation are platinum palladium and nickel The metal catalyst acts as a surface on which the reaction takes place This increases the rate by putting the reactants in close proximity to each other facilitating interactions between them With this catalyst present the sigma bond of H breaks and the two hydrogen atoms instead bind to the metal see in the figure below The bond of the alkene weakens as it also interacts with the metal see below Since both the reactants are bound to the metal catalyst the hydrogen atoms can easily add one at a time to the previously doublebonded carbons see and below The position of both of the reactants bound to the catalyst makes it so the hydrogen atoms are only exposed to one side of the alkene This explains why the hydrogen atoms add to same side of the molecule called synaddition Figure Hydrogenation takes place in the presence of a metal catalyst Note The catalyst remains intact and unchanged throughout the reaction Heats of Hydrogenation The stability of alkene can be determined by measuring the amount of energy associated with the hydrogenation of the molecule Since the double bond is breaking in this reaction the energy released in hydrogenation is proportional to the energy in the double bond of the molecule This is a useful tool because heats of hydrogenation can be measured very accurately The is usually around kcalmol for alkenes Stability is simply a measure of energy Lower energy molecules are more stable than higher energy molecules More substituted alkenes are more stable than less substituted ones due to hyperconjugation They have a lower heat of hydrogenation The following illustrates stability of alkenes with various substituents In disubstituted alkenes trans isomers are more stable than cis isomers due to steric hindrance Also internal alkenes are more stable than terminal ones See the following isomers of butene Figure Transbutene is the most stable because it has the lowest heat of hydrogenation Note In cycloalkenes smaller than cyclooctene the cis isomers are more stable than the trans as a result of ring strain References Fox Marye Anne and James K Whitesell Organic Chemistry rd ed Sudbury MA Janes and Bartlett Publishers Hanson James R Functional

Bond Strength The combustion of carbon compounds especially hydrocarbons has been the most important source of heat energy for human civilizations throughout recorded history The practical importance of this reaction cannot be denied but the massive and uncontrolled chemical changes that take place in combustion make it difficult to deduce mechanistic paths Using the combustion of propane as an example we see from the following equation that every covalent bond in the reactants has been broken and an entirely new set of covalent bonds have formed in the products No other common reaction involves such a profound and pervasive change and the mechanism of combustion is so complex that chemists are just beginning to explore and understand some of its elementary features Since all the covalent bonds in the reactant molecules are broken the quantity of heat evolved in this reaction and any other combustion reaction is related to the strength of these bonds and of course the strength of the bonds formed in the products Precise heat of combustion measurements can provide useful information about the structure of molecules and their relative stability For example heat of combustion is useful in determining the relative stability of isomers Pentane has a heat of combustion of kcalmol while that of its isomer dimethylpropane neopentane is kcalmol These values indicate that dimethylpentane is kcalmol more stable than pentane since it has a lower heat of combustion Ring Strain Table lists the heat of combustion data for some simple cycloalkanes These cycloalkanes do not have the same molecular formula so the heat of combustion per each CH unit present in each molecule is calculated the fourth column to provide a useful comparison From the data cyclopropane and cyclobutane have significantly higher heats of combustion per CH while cyclohexane has the lowest heat of combustion This indicates that cyclohexane is more stable than cyclopropane and cyclobutane and in fact that cyclohexane has a same relative stability as long chain alkanes that are not cyclic This difference in stability is seen in nature where six membered rings are by far the most common

German organic chemist A Baeyer suggested that cyclopropane and cyclobutane are less stable than cyclohexane because the the smaller rings are more strained There are many different types of strain that contribute to the overall ring strain in cycloalkanes including angle strain torsional strain and steric strain Torsional strain and steric strain were previously defined in the discussion of conformations of butane Angle Strain occurs when the sp hybridized carbons in cycloalkanes do not have the expected ideal bond angle of o causing an increase in the potential energy An example of angle strain can be seen in the diagram of cyclopropane below in which the bond angle is o between the carbons The compressed bond angles causes poor overlap of the hybrid orbitals forming the carboncarbon sigma bonds which in turn creates destabilization The CCC bond angles in cyclopropane diagram above o and cyclobutane o are much different than the ideal bond angle of o This bond angle causes cyclopropane and cyclobutane to be less stable than molecules such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane which have a much lower ring strain because the bond angle between the carbons is much closer to o Changes in chemical reactivity as a consequence of angle strain are dramatic in the case of cyclopropane and are also evident for cyclobutane In addition to angle strain there is also steric transannular strain and torsional strain in many cycloalkanes Transannular strain exists when there is steric repulsion between atoms Because cycloalkane lack the ability to freely rotate torsional eclipsing strain exists when a cycloalkane is unable to adopt a staggered conformation around a CC bond Torsional strain is especially prevalent in small cycloalkanes such as cyclopropane whose structures are nearly planar The Eclipsed CH Bonds in Cyclopropane Larger rings like cyclohexane deal with torsional strain by forming conformers in which the rings are not planar A conformer is a stereoisomer in which molecules of the same connectivity and formula exist as different isomers in this case to reduce ring strain The ring strain is reduced in conformers due to the rotations around the sigma bonds which decreases the angle and torsional strain in the ring The nonplanar structures of cyclohexane are very stable compared to cyclopropane and cyclobutane and will be discussed in more detail in the next section The Types of Strain Which Contribute to Ring Strain in Cycloalkanes Angle Strain The strain caused by the increase or reduction of bond angles Torsional Strain The strain caused by eclipsing bonds on adjacent atoms Steric Strain The strain caused by the repulsive interactions of atoms trying to occupy the same space Exercise transDimethylcyclobutane is more

with Structural Isomerism Learning Objective interpret the stereoisomerism of compounds with three or more chiral centers Possible Number of Stereoisomers In general a structure with n stereocenters will have n different stereoisomers We are not considering for the time being the stereochemistry of double bonds that will come later For example lets consider the glucose molecule in its openchain form recall that many sugar molecules can exist in either an openchain or a cyclic form There are two enantiomers of glucose called Dglucose and Lglucose The Denantiomer is the common sugar that our bodies use for energy It has n stereocenters so therefore there are n possible stereoisomers including Dglucose itself In Lglucose all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose That leaves diastereomers of Dglucose these are molecules in which at least one but not all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose One of these diastereomers a sugar called Dgalactose is shown above in Dgalactose one of four stereocenters is inverted relative to Dglucose Diastereomers which differ in only one stereocenter out of two or more are called epimers Dglucose and Dgalactose can therefore be refered to as epimers as well as diastereomers The epimer term is useful because in biochemical pathways compounds with multiple chiral centers are isomerized at one specific center by enzymes known as epimerases Two examples of epimerasecatalyzed reactions are below Now lets extend our analysis to a sugar molecule with three chiral centers Going through all the possible combinations we come up with eight total stereoisomers four pairs of enantiomers Lets draw the RRR stereoisomer Being careful to draw the wedge bonds correctly so that they match the RRR configurations we get Now using the above drawing as our model drawing any other stereoisomer is easy If we want to draw the enantiomer of RRR we dont need to try to visualize the mirror image we just start with the RRR structure and invert the configuration at every chiral center to get SSS Try making models of RRR and SSS and confirm that they are in fact nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other There are six diastereomers of RRR To draw one of them we just invert the configuration of at least one but not all three of the chiral centers Lets invert the configuration at chiral center and but leave chiral center unchanged This gives us the SSR configuration One more definition at this point diastereomers which differ at only a single chiral center are called epimers For example RRR and SRR are epimers The RRR and SSR stereoisomers shown earlier are diastereomers but not epimers because they differ at two of the three chiral centers Example Draw the structure of the enantiomer of the

Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Contributors and Attributions When an reaction is carried out starting with a single pure enantiomer such as chlorobutane the product usually is a mixture of the enantiomeric substitution products with a slight predominance of that isomer which corresponds to inversion Theoretically a carbocation is expected to be most stable in the planar configuration Section E and hence should lead to exactly equal amounts of the two enantiomers regardless of the chiral configuration of the starting material Figure However the extent of configuration change that actually results in an reaction depends upon the degree of shielding of the front side of the reacting carbon by the leaving group and its associated solvent molecules If the leaving group does not get away from the carbocation before the productdetermining step takes place there will be some preference for nucleophilic attack at the back side of the carbon which results in a predominance of the product of inverted configuration Figure Representation of a planar carbocation with no leaving group closeby with a ballandstick model having and as different alkyl groups to show why the cation should react equally probably with or to give the right and lefthanded substitution products Other things being equal the amount of inversion decreases as the stability of the carbocation intermediate increases because the more stable the ion the longer is its lifetime and the more chance it has of getting away from the leaving anion and becoming a relatively free ion The solvent usually has a large influence on the stereochemical results of reactions because the stability and lifetime of the carbocations depend upon the nature of the solvent Section F An orbital picture of ionization leading to a racemic product may be drawn as follows It should be clear that complete racemization is unlikely to be observed if stays in close proximity to the side of the positive carbon that it originally departed from We can say that shields the front side thereby favoring a predominance of inversion If gets far away before comes in then there should be no favoritism for one or the other of the possible substitutions If and the carbocation stay in close proximity as is likely to be the case in a solvent that does not promote ionic dissociation then a more or less tight ion pair is formed Such ion pairs often play an important role in ionic reactions in solvents of low dielectric constant Section F Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is

SN Reactions Are StereospecificContributors and Attributions Learning Objective predict the products and specify the reagents for SNreactions with stereochemistry propose mechanisms for SN reactions draw and interpret Reaction Energy Diagrams for SNreactions SN Reactions Are Stereospecific The SN reaction is stereospecific like other concerted reactions A stereospecific reaction is one in which different stereoisomers react to give different stereoisomers of the product The nuclephile and electrophile must be correctly oriented for orbital overlap to occur and trigger chemical reactivity Experimental observations show that all SN reactions proceed with inversion of configuration that is the nucleophile will always penetrate from the backside in SN reactions To think about why this might be true remember that the nucleophile has a lone pair of electrons to be shared with the electrophilic carbon center and the leaving group is going to take a lone pair of electrons with it upon leaving Because like charges repel each other the nucleophile will always proceed by a backside displacement mechanism Frontside Orientation In a frontside orientation the nucleophile approaches the electrophilic center on the same side as the leaving group With frontside orientation the stereochemistry of the product remains the same that is we have retention of configuration Backside Orientation In a backside orientation the nucleophile approachss the electrophilic center on the side that is opposite to the leaving group With backside orientation the stereochemistry of the product does not stay the same There is inversion of configuration For example if the substrate is an R enantiomer a frontside nucleophilic orientation results in retention of configuration and the formation of the R enantiomer A backside nucleophilic orientation results in inversion of configuration and the formation of the S enantiomer Conversely if the substrate is an S enantiomer a frontside nucleophilic orientation results in retention of configuration and the formation of the S enantiomer A backside nucleophilic orientation results in inversion of configuration and the formation of the R enantiomer Empirically SN reactions that begin with the R enantiomer as the substrate will form the S enantiomer as the product Those that begin with the S enantiomer as the substrate will form the R enantiomer as the product This concept of retention and inversion of configuration can also be applied to substrates that can exist as geometric isomers cis and trans If the cis configuration is the substrate the resulting product will be trans Conversely if the trans configuration is the substrate the resulting product will be cis Exercise Predict the product of a nucleophilic substitution of

The Leaving GroupD Enhancement of Leaving Group Abilities by Electrophilic CatalysisE The Nucleophilic ReagentF The Nature of the SolventContributors and Attributions We shall consider first the relationship between the structures of alkyl derivatives and their reaction rates toward a given nucleophile This will be followed by a discussion of the relative reactivities of various nucleophiles toward a given alkyl derivative Finally we shall comment in more detail on the role of the solvent in reactions A Structure of the Alkyl Group in Reactions The rates of displacement reactions of simple alkyl derivatives follow the order primary secondary tertiary In practical syntheses involving reactions the primary compounds generally work very well secondary isomers are fair and the tertiary isomers are almost completely impractical Steric hindrance appears to be particularly important in determining reaction rates and the slowness of tertiary halides seems best accounted for by steric hindrance to the backside approach of an attacking nucleophile by the alkyl groups on the reacting carbon Pertinent data which show how alkyl groups affect reactivity toward iodide ion are given in Table Not only do alkyl groups suppress reactivity when on the same carbon as the leaving group as in tertbutyl bromide but they also have retarding effects when located one carbon away from the leaving group This is evident in the data of Table for bromodimethylpropane neopentyl bromide which is very unreactive in reactions Scale models indicate the retardation to be the result of steric hindrance by the methyl groups located on the adjacent carbon to the approaching nucleophile In addition to steric effects other structural effects of influence the reactivity of A double bond to the halogen as in propenyl phenylmethyl benzyl and oxopropyl chlorides enhances the reactivity of the compounds toward nucleophiles Thus the relative reactivities toward in propanone are Possible reasons for these high reactivities will be discussed later Section B B Structure of the Alkyl Group in Reactions The rates of reactions of simple alkyl derivatives follow the order tertiary secondary primary which is exactly opposite that of reactions This is evident from the data in Table which lists the relative rates of hydrolysis of some alkyl bromides only the secondary and tertiary bromides react at measurable rates and the tertiary bromide reacts some times faster than the secondary bromide Why do tertiary alkyl compounds ionize so much more rapidly than either secondary or primary compounds The reason is that tertiary alkyl cations are more stable than either secondary or primary cations and therefore are formed more easily You will appreciate this better by looking at the energy diagram of Figure which shows the profile of energy changes for hydrolysis of an alkyl compound by the mechanism The rate of Figure Profile of energy changes for hydrolysis of by the mechanism in accord with the steps The last step is not part of the process itself but is included for completeness The water molecule shown in parentheses is necessary to balance the equations but it should not be considered to be different from the other water molecules in the solvent until it is specifically involved in the second transition state reaction is determined by the ionization step or by the energy of the transition state relative to that of the reactants Actually the energy of the transition state is only slightly higher than the energy of the ionic intermediates Thus to a first approximation we can say that the rate of ionization of will depend on the energies of the ions formed Now if we compare the rates for a series of compounds all having the same leaving group but differing only in the structure of their relative rates of ionization will correspond to the relative stabilities of The lower energy of the faster will be the rate of ionization Therefore the experimental results suggest that the sequence of carbocation stabilities is tertiary secondary primary Just why this sequence is observed is a more difficult question to answer Notice in the following stability sequence that alkyl cations are more stable the more alkyl groups there are on the positive carbon The simplest explanation for why this is so is that alkyl groups are more polarizable than hydrogens In this case more polarizable means the electrons of the alkyl groups tend to move more readily toward the positive carbon than do those of the hydrogens Such movements of electrons transfer part of the charge on the cationic carbon to the alkyl groups thereby spreading the charge over a greater volume This constitutes electron delocalization which results in enhanced stability see Section A An alternative way of explaining how the cationic charge is spread over the alkyl groups of a tertiary cation such as the tertbutyl cation is to write the cation as a hybrid of the following structures Other organohalogen compounds besides secondary and tertiary alkyl compounds can react by mechanisms provided they have the ability to form reasonably stabilized carbon cations Examples include propenyl allylic and phenylmethyl benzylic compounds which on ionization give cations that have delocalized electrons see Section In general the more stabilized the carbon cation from an alkyl halide the more reactive the compound will be in type reactions This is especially apparent in the reactivities of compounds with phenyl groups on the reacting carbon As the number of phenyl groups increases from zero to three the reactivity of the chlorides increases by more than because of increasing stabilization of the carbon cation by the phenyl groups In contrast compounds such as chlorobenzene and chloroethene in which the halogen is attached directly to a multiply bonded carbon atom do not exhibit type reactions Evidently then unsaturated carbon cations such as phenyl or ethenyl are appreciably less stable more difficult to form than tertalkyl cations Reasons for this will be considered in Section B Steric hindrance is relatively unimportant in reactions because the rate is independent of the nucleophile In fact steric acceleration is possible in the solvolysis of highly branched alkyl halides through relief of steric compression between the alkyl groups in the halide by formation of a planar cation Along with the effect has on the rate at which an alkyl compound reacts by an mechanism the group also affects the nature of the products obtained The intermediate alkyl cations may react in various ways to give products of substitution elimination and rearrangement Elimination pathways are discussed more fully starting in Section and rearrangement of carbon cations in Section B C The Leaving Group The reactivity of a given alkyl derivative in either or reactions is influenced strongly by the leaving group The choice of leaving group is therefore an important consideration in any synthesis involving reactions From the foregoing discussion of structural effects in the group on reactivity particularly in reactions we might expect the stability of as an ion or neutral molecule to play a major role in determining how good or poor is as a leaving group The stability of is indeed important the problem is that there are several factors that contribute to the stavility and hence the lability of the leaving group For the purpose of initially identifying good and poor leaving groups consider development of a practical synthesis of diethyl ether One route is by way of displacement using an ethyl compound and ethoxide ion Many compounds have groups that are quite unsatisfactory in this reaction They include compounds such as ethane propane ethanol ethyl methyl ether ethylamine and ethyl ethanoate the respective groups and all can be classified as very poor leaving groups The more reactive ethyl derivatives see Table include the halides particularly ethyl iodide and sulfonic acid derivatives the corresponding anions and therefore are moderate to good leaving groups Table includes pertinent data for the rates of ether formation from various alkyl compounds and illustrates that the relative abilities of groups to leave are about the same in reactions as they are in reactions Why are groups such as and good leaving groups whereas others such as and are poor The simplest correlation is with the strength of as an acid This is very reasonable because the ease of loss of as from in an reaction would be expected to be related to some degree at least to the ease of ionization of to and Therefore the stronger is as an acid the better will be as a leaving group Thus is a relatively weak acid and is not a very good leaving group is a very strong acid and is a good leaving group The usual order of reactivity of alkyl halides when is the same group throughout is in accord with the acid strengths of the halogen acids SImilarly is a much better leaving group than and we find that trifluoroethanoic acid is a several thousand times stronger acid than ethanoic acid For the same reason is a better leaving group than This correlation can be extended easily to groups that leave as neutral For example occurs far more readily than and we know that is a stronger acid or better proton donor than The relationship between as a leaving group and as an acid is very useful because much information is available on acid strengths However it is not a very fundamental explanation unless we can explain why some acids are strong acids and others are weak acids One factor is the strength of the bond but here we need to remember that the usual bond strengths are for dissociation to radicals or atoms not ions and for the gas not for solutions If we write the steps relating the bonddissociation energy to the energy of ionic dissociation in solution we see that for variations in in addition to the bond energy the electron affinity of the solvation energy of and the solvation energy of also will be contributing factors Pauling has shown for the halogen acids that the bond dissociation energy which is highest for and lowest for can be regarded as the most important factor in determining the energy of dissociation in solution The above energy equations can be written in the same way with in place of and we would expect to reach the same conclusion about the ease of leaving carbon because bond energies are reasonably closely proportional to bond energies see Figure and Table Figure Plot of bond energies against bond energies using the data of Table D Enhancement of Leaving Group Abilities by Electrophilic Catalysis In general a leaving group that leaves as a neutral molecule is a much better leaving group than one that leaves as an anion Alcohols are particularly unreactive in reactions because is a very poor leaving group However if a strong acid is present the reactivity of the alcohol is enhanced greatly The acid functions by donating a proton to the oxygen of the alcohol thereby transforming the hydroxyl function into which has a much better leaving group in place of The reactions of ethers and esters are acidcatalyzed for the same reason Heavymetal salts particularly those of silver mercury and copper catalyze reactions of alkyl halides in much the same way that acids catalyze the reactions of alcohols A heavymetal ion functions by complexing with the unshared electrons of the halide thereby making the leaving group a metal halide rather than a halide ion This acceleration of the rates of halide reactions is the basis for a qualitative test for alkyl halides with silver nitrate in ethanol solution Silver halide precipitates at a rate that depends upon the structure of the alkyl group tertiary secondary primary Tertiary halides usually react immediately at room temperature whereas primary halides require heating That complexes actually are formed between organic halides and silver ion is indicated by an increase in water solubility in the presence of silver ion for those halides that are slow in forming carboncations E The Nucleophilic Reagent The nucleophilicty of a particular reagent or can be defined as its ability to donate an electron pair to another atom see Section In fact the reactivity of a reagent toward a methyl derivative can be taken to measure its nucleophilicty toward carbon The relative reaction rates of some nucleophiles toward methyl bromide are listed in order of increasing nucleophilicity in Table together with their basicities as measured by Important generalizations can be made from these data provided that one recognizes that they may apply only to hydroxylic solvents For the atoms representing any one group column of the periodic table nucleophilicty increases with increasing atomic number Thus other things being equal larger atoms are better nucleophiles For nucleophiles having the same atomic number of the entering atom eg oxygen nucleophiles there is usually a good correlation between the basicity of the reagent and its nucleophilicity Thus a weak base such as is a poorer nucleophile than a strong base such as The poorer is as a leaving group the better it is as an entering group For nucleophiles of different atomic numbers nucleophilicity usually does not parallel basicity For example for the halogens the reactivity sequence is opposite to the sequence for basicity Similarly sulfur anions such as are better nucleophiles but weaker bases than corresponding oxyanions such as A number of nucleophilic agents which are very reactive in reactions are of the type where both atoms have unshared electron pairs Examples include and all of which are more reactive than the closely related nucleophiles and Why is the correlation between basicity and nucleophilcity so poor for atoms of different atomic number it is now clear from much research that the dominant effect is associated with differences in the solvation energies of the ions as defined for halide ions by the following equations The solvation energies of small ions with concentrated charge always are greater than those of large ions with diffuse charge When an ion participates in a nucleophilic attack on carbon it must slough off some of the solvent molecules that stabilize it in solution Otherwise the ion cannot get close enough to the carbon to which it will become attached to begin forming a bond Sloughing off solvent molecules will be less favorable for a small ion than a large ion Consequently we expect to be less reactive than Strong evidence for solvation effects on reactivity is provided by the fact that chloride ion is more reactive than iodide in solvents that have low solvation energies for anions see Section F Furthermore in the gas phase where solvation effects are absent is more reactive than any of the other halide ions toward chloromethane It should be recognized that reactions may be reversible when both the leaving group and the entering group are good entering and leaving groups respectively In such circumstances the position of the equilibrium often can be changed by suitably adjusting the reaction conditions Thus aqueous hydrogen bromide can convert alcohols to alkyl bromides Equation forward direction whereas the reverse reaction hydrolysis is achieved by high water concentration F The Nature of the Solvent The rates of reactions are sensitive to the nature and composition of the solvent This is easy to understand for reactions because the ionizing power of a solvent is crucial to the ease of formation of ions and from Actually two factors are relevant in regard to the ionizing ability of solvents First a high dielectric constant increases ionizing power by making it easier to separate ions This is because the force between charged particles varies inversely with the dielectric constant of the medium Thus water with a dielectric constant of is times more effective than a hydrocarbon with a dielectric constant of Second and usually more important is the ability of the solvent to solvate the separated ions Cations are solvated most effectively by compounds of elements in the first row of the periodic table that have unshared electron pairs Examples are ammonia water alcohols carboxylic acids sulfur dioxide and methylsulfinylmethane dimethyl sulfoxide Anoins are solvated most efficiently by solvents having hydrogen attached to a strongly elecronegative element so the bond is strongly polarized as Such solvents usually are called protic solvents Protic solvents form hydrogen bonds to the leaving group which assist ionization in much the same way that silver ion catalyzes ionization of alkyl halides Section D We can represent solvation by the following structural formulas but it must be recognized that the number of solvent molecules involved in close interacitons can be as large as four or six or as small as one The most effective ionizing solvents are those that effectively solvate both anions and cations Water strikes an excellent compromise with regard to the structural features that make up ionizing power that is dielectric constant and solvating ability From this we expect tertbutyl chloride to ionize much more readily in water than in ether because ethers can solvate only cations effectively whereas water can solvate both anions and cations The fact is that ionizations usually are so difficult that reactions seldom occur in solvents that cannot effectively solvate both anions and cations even if the dielectric constant of the solvent is high Solvation by hydrogen bonding is especially helpful in assisting ionization Solvents that cannot provide such hydrogen bonding eg generally are poor for reactions These solvents are called aprotic solvents An important exception is liquid sulfur dioxide which promotes ionization by having a high dielectric constant and being able to solvate both anions and cations A list of protic and aprotic solvents their dielectric constants boiling points and melting points is given in Table This table will be useful in selecting solvents for nucleophilic substitution reactions With regard to reactions the solvent can affect profoundly the reactivity of a given nucleophile Thus anions such as and which are weakly nucleophilic in hydroxylic solvents and in poor ionizing solvents such as propanone acetone become very significantly nucleophilic in polar aprotic sovlents such as The reason is that for salts such as and the aprotic solvent preferentially solvates the cation leaving the anion relatively bare This dissociation of the anion from the cation together with its poor solvation makes the anion abnormally reactive as a nucleophile The Greek letters are used here not as nomenclature but to designated the positions along a carbon chain from a functional group also see Section Specifically electrostatic force in which and are the charges is the distance between the charges and is the dielectric constant of the medium for a vacuum Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry

reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions The building block of structural organic chemistry is the tetravalent carbon atom With few exceptions carbon compounds can be formulated with four covalent bonds to each carbon regardless of whether the combination is with carbon or some other element The twoelectron bond which is illustrated by the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane or ethane and the carboncarbon bond in ethane is called a single bond In these and many related substances each carbon is attached to four other atoms There exist however compounds such as ethene ethylene in which two electrons from each of the carbon atoms are mutually shared thereby producing two twoelectron bonds an arrangement which is called a double bond Each carbon in ethene is attached to only three other atoms Similarly in ethyne acetylene three electrons from each carbon atom are mutually shared producing three twoelectron bonds called a triple bond in which each carbon is attached to only two other atoms Of course in all cases each carbon has a full octet of electrons Carbon also forms double and triple bonds with several other elements that can exhibit a covalence of two or three The carbonoxygen or carbonyl double bond appears in carbon dioxide and many important organic compounds such as methanal formaldehyde and ethanoic acid acetic acid Similarly a carbonnitrogen triple bond appears in methanenitrile hydrogen cyanide and ethanenitrile acetonitrile By convention a single straight line connecting the atomic symbols is used to represent a single twoelectron bond two such lines to represent a double fourelectron bond and three lines a triple sixelectron bond Representations of compounds by these symbols are called structural formulas some examples are A point worth noting is that structural formulas usually do not indicate the nonbonding electron pairs This is perhaps unfortunate because they play as much a part in the chemistry of organic molecules as do the bonding electrons and their omission may lead the unwary reader to overlook them However when it is important to represent them this can be done best with pairs of dots although a few authors use lines To save space and time in the representation of organic structures it is common practice to use condensed formulas in which the bonds are not shown explicitly In using condensed formulas normal atomic valences are understood throughout Examples of condensed formulas are Another type of abbreviation that often is used particularly for ring compounds dispenses with the symbols for carbon and hydrogen atoms and leaves only the lines in a structural formula For instance cyclopentane often is represented as a regular pentagon in which it is understood that each apex represents a carbon atom with the requisite number of hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of carbon Likewise cyclopropane cyclobutane and cyclohexane are drawn as regular polygons Although this type of line drawing is employed most commonly for cyclic structures its use for open chain acyclic structures is becoming increasingly widespread There is no special merit to this abbreviation for simple structures such as butane butene or butadiene but it is of value in representing more complex molecules such as carotene Line structures also can be modified to represent the threedimensional shapes of molecules and the way that this is done will be discussed in detail in Chapter At the onset of you study of organic chemistry you should write out the formulas rather completely until you are thoroughly familiar with what these abbreviations stand for Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie

AttributionsContributors and Attributions Learning Objective Draw interpret and convert between Lewis Kekule Condensed and Bondline Structures Note The review of general chemistry in sections is integrated into the above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and Shorthand notations to represent organic molecules rely on our knowledge of common neutral bonding patterns Knowing these patterns we can fill in the missing structural information Some of these shorthand ways of drawing molecules give us insight into the bond angles and relative positions of atoms in the molecule while some notations eliminate the carbon and hydrogen atoms and only indicate the heteroatoms the atoms that are NOT carbon or hydrogen There are three primary methods to communicate chemical structure of organic molecules Kekule Lewis structures using lines to represent covalent bonds and showing all atoms and lone pair electrons Bondline Skeletlline shows bonds between carbon atoms and heteroatoms with lone pair electrons when requested Condensed all atoms are written to communicate structure without drawing any chemical bonds based on the carbon backbone Introduction Observe the following drawings of the structure of Retinol the most common form of vitamin A The first drawing follows the straightline aka Kekulé structure which is helpful when you want to look at every single atom however showing all of the hydrogen atoms makes it difficult to compare the overall structure with other similar molecules and makes it difficult to focus in on the double bonds and OH group Retinol Kekulé straightline drawing The following is a bondline aka zigzag formula for retinol With this simiplified representation one can easily see the carboncarbon bonds double bonds OH group and CH groups sticking off of the the main ring and chain Also it is much quicker to draw this than the one above You will learn to appreciate this type of formula writing after drawing a countless number of organic molecules Retinol Bondline or zigzag formula Importance of Structure Learning and practicing the basics of Organic Chemistry will help you immensely in the long run as you learn new concepts and reactions Some people say that Organic Chemistry is like another language and in some aspects it is At first it may seem difficult or overwhelming but the more you practice looking at and drawing organic molecules the more familiar you will become with the structures and formulas Another good idea is to get a model kit and physically make the molecules that you have trouble picturing in your head Through general chemistry you may have already experienced looking at molecular structure The different ways to draw organic molecules include Kekulé straightline Condensed Formulas and BondLine Formulas zigzag It will be more helpful if you become comfortable going from one style of drawing to another and look at drawings and understanding what they mean than knowing which kind of drawing is named what An example of a drawing that incorporates all three ways to draw organic molecules would be the following additional drawing of Retinol The majority of the drawing is Bondline zigzag formula but the CH are written as condensed formulas and the OH group is written in Kekulé form A widely used way of showing the D structure of molecules is the use of dashes wedges and straight lines This drawing method is essential because the placement of different atoms could yield different molecules even if the molecular formulas were exactly the same Below are two drawings of a carbon molecule with two chlorines and two bromines attached carbon molecule with chlorines and bromines carbon molecule with chlorines and bromines Both drawings look like they represent the same molecule however if we add dashes and wedged we will see that two different molecules could be depicted The two molecules above are different prove this to yourself by building a model An easier way to compare the two molecules is to rotate one of the bonds here it is the bond on the right Notice how the molecule on the right has both bromines on the same side and chlorines on the same side whereas the first molecule is different Read about DashedWedged Line structures bottom of page to understand what has been introduced above You will learn more about the importance of atomic connectivity in molecules as you continue on to learn about Stereochemistry Drawing the Structure of Organic Molecules Although larger molecules may look complicated they can be easily understood by breaking them down and looking at their smaller components All atoms want to have their valence shell full a closed shell Hydrogen wants to have e whereas carbon oxygen and nitrogen want to have e When looking at the different representations of molecules keep in mind the Octet Rule Also remember that hydrogen can bond one time oxygen can bond up to two times nitrogen can bond up to three times and carbon can bond up to four times Kekulé aka Lewis Structures Kekulé structures are similar to Lewis Structures but instead of covalent bonds being represented by electron dots the two shared electrons are shown by a line A BC Lone pairs remain as two electron dots or are sometimes left out even though they are still there Notice how the three lone pairs of electrons were not draw in around chlorine in example B Condensed Formulas A condensed formula is made up of the elemental symbols The order of the atoms suggests the connectivity Condensed formulas can be read from either direction and HC is the same as CH although the latter is more common because Look at the examples below and match them with their identical molecule under Kekulé structures and bondline formulas A CHCHOH B ClCHCHCHOCHCH C HCNHCHCOOH Lets look closely at example B As you go through a condensed formula you want to focus on the carbons and other elements that arent hydrogen The hydrogens are important but are usually there to complete octets Also notice the OCH is in written in parentheses which tell you that it not part of the main chain of carbons As you read through a a condensed formula if you reach an atom that doesnt have a complete octet by the time you reach the next hydrogen then its possible that there are double or triple bonds In example C the carbon is double bonded to oxygen and single bonded to another oxygen Notice how COOH means COOH instead of CHCOOH because carbon does not have a complete octet and oxygens BondLine aka zigzag Formulas The name gives away how this formula works This formula is full of bonds and lines and because of the typical more stable bonds that atoms tend to make in molecules they often end up looking like zigzag lines If you work with a molecular model kit you will find it difficult to make stick straight molecules unless they contain sp triple bonds whereas zigzag molecules and bonds are much more feasible A B C These molecules correspond to the exact same molecules depicted for Kekulé structures and condensed formulas Notice how the carbons are no longer drawn in and are replaced by the ends and bends of a lines In addition the hydrogens have been omitted but could be easily drawn in see practice problems Although we do not usually draw in the Hs that are bonded to carbon we do draw them in if they are connected to other atoms besides carbon example is the OH group above in example A This is done because it is not always clear if the noncarbon atom is surrounded by lone pairs or hydrogens Also in example A notice how the OH is drawn with a bond to the second carbon but it does not mean that there is a third carbon at the end of that bond line DashedWedged Line Structure As you may have guessed the DashedWedged Line structure is all about lines dashes and wedges At first it may seem confusing but with practice understanding dashwedged line structures will become like second nature The following are examples of each and how they can be used together Above are carbon chains with attached OH groups or Cl and Br atoms Remember that each line represents a bond and that the carbons and hydrogens have been omitted When you look at or draw these structures the straight lines illustrate atoms and bonds that are in the same plane the plane of the paper in this case computer screen Dashed lines show atoms and bonds that go into the page behind the plane away from you In the above example the OH group is going into the plane while at the same time a hydrogen comes out wedged Blue bead OH group White beadH Wedged lines illustrate bonds and atoms that come out of the page in front of the plane toward you In the D diagram above the OH group is coming out of the plane of the paper while a hydrogen goes in dashed Blue bead OH group White beadH As stated before straight lines illustrate atoms and bonds that are in the same plane as the paper but in the D example the straight line bond for OH means that it it unsure or irrelevant whether OH is going away or toward you It is also assumed that hydrogen is also connected to the same carbon that OH is on Blue bead OH group H is not shown Try using your model kit to see that the OH group cannot lie in the same plane at the carbon chain dont forget your hydrogens In the final Dexample both dashed and wedged lines are used because the attached atoms are not hydrogens although dashed and wedged lines can be used for hydrogensThe chlorine is coming out the page while bromine is going into the page Blue beadCl Red beadBr Example Converting between Structural Formulas Throughout the course it will be helpful to convert compounds into different structural formulas Kekule Lewis Structures Bondline and Condensed depending on the type of question that is asked Standardized exams frequently include a high percentage of condensed formulas because it is easier and cheaper to type letters and numbers than to import figures Initially it can be tricky writing a bondline structure directly from a condensed formula First write the Kekule structure from the condensed formula and then draw the bondline structure from the Kekule Practice will quickly allow you to convert directly between condensed and bondline structures The condensed formula for propanal is CHCHCHO Can you visualize the bondline structure of propanal

can be formulated with four covalent bonds to each carbon regardless of whether the combination is with carbon or some other element The twoelectron bond which is illustrated by the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane or ethane and the carboncarbon bond in ethane is called a single bond In these and many related substances each carbon is attached to four other atoms There exist however compounds such as ethene ethylene in which two electrons from each of the carbon atoms are mutually shared thereby producing two twoelectron bonds an arrangement which is called a double bond Each carbon in ethene is attached to only three other atoms Similarly in ethyne acetylene three electrons from each carbon atom are mutually shared producing three twoelectron bonds called a triple bond in which each carbon is attached to only two other atoms Of course in all cases each carbon has a full octet of electrons Carbon also forms double and triple bonds with several other elements that can exhibit a covalence of two or three The carbonoxygen or carbonyl double bond appears in carbon dioxide and many important organic compounds such as methanal formaldehyde and ethanoic acid acetic acid Similarly a carbonnitrogen triple bond appears in methanenitrile hydrogen cyanide and ethanenitrile acetonitrile By convention a single straight line connecting the atomic symbols is used to represent a single twoelectron bond two such lines to represent a double fourelectron bond and three lines a triple sixelectron bond Representations of compounds by these symbols are called structural formulas some examples are A point worth noting is that structural formulas usually do not indicate the nonbonding electron pairs This is perhaps unfortunate because they play as much a part in the chemistry of organic molecules as do the bonding electrons and their omission may lead the unwary reader to overlook them However when it is important to represent them this can be done best with pairs of dots although a few authors use lines To save space and time in the representation of organic structures it is common practice to use condensed formulas in which the bonds are not shown explicitly In using condensed formulas normal atomic valences are understood throughout Examples of condensed formulas are Another type of abbreviation that often is used particularly for ring compounds dispenses with the symbols for carbon and hydrogen atoms and leaves only the lines in a structural formula For instance cyclopentane often is represented as a regular pentagon in which it is understood that each apex represents a carbon atom with the requisite number of hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of carbon Likewise cyclopropane cyclobutane and cyclohexane are drawn as regular polygons Although this type of line drawing is employed most commonly for cyclic structures its use for open chain acyclic structures is becoming increasingly widespread There is no special merit to this abbreviation for simple structures such as butane butene or butadiene but it is of value in representing more complex molecules such as carotene Line structures also can be modified to represent the threedimensional shapes of molecules and the way that this is done will be discussed in detail in Chapter At the onset of you study of organic chemistry you should write out the formulas rather completely until you

projections and sawhorse structures correlate energies of conformations with rotational energy diagrams Single Bond Rotation and Conformational Isomerism Conformational isomerism involves rotation about sigma bonds and does not involve any differences in the connectivity or geometry of bonding Two or more structures that are categorized as conformational isomers or conformers are really just two of the exact same molecule that differ only in terms of the angle about one or more sigma bonds The carboncarbon single bonds of alkanes rotate freely Conformers are the same molecule shown with different sigma bond rotations Newman projections are one way to communicate bond rotation Ethane Conformations Although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical Rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations In order to better visualize these different conformations it is convenient to use a drawing convention called the Newman projection In a Newman projection we look lengthwise down a specific bond of interest in this case the carboncarbon bond in ethane When there are multiple carbonsthen we specify the bond of interest using the carbon numbers from the IUPAC name We depict the front atom as a dot and the back atom as a larger circle The six carbonhydrogen bonds are shown as solid lines protruding from the two carbons at angles which is what the actual tetrahedral geometry looks like when viewed from this perspective and flattened into two dimensions The lowest energy conformation of ethane shown in the figure above is called the staggered or anti conformation in which all of the CH bonds on the front carbon are positioned at dihedral angles of relative to the CH bonds on the back carbon In this conformation the distance between the bonds and the electrons in them is maximized If we now rotate the front CH group clockwise the molecule is in the highest energy eclipsed conformation where the hydrogens on the front carbon are as close as possible to the hydrogens on the back carbon This is the highest energy conformation because of unfavorable interactions between the electrons in the front and back CH bonds The energy of the eclipsed conformation is approximately kcalmol higher than that of the staggered conformation Another rotation returns the molecule to a second eclipsed conformation This process can be continued all around the circle with three possible eclipsed conformations and three staggered conformations in addition to an infinite number of variations in between The carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate there is indeed a small kcalmol barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another This rotational barrier is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at extremely cold temperatures However at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other state Free Rotations Do Not Exist in Ethane The carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate there is indeed a small kcalmol barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another This rotational barrier is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at extremely cold temperatures However at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other state The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds as shown below The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds Although the conformers of ethane are in rapid equilibrium with each other the kcalmol energy difference leads to a substantial preponderance of staggered conformers at any given time The animation below illustrates the relationship between ethanes potential energy and its dihedral angle Figure X Animation of potential energy vs dihedral angle in ethane Exercise Draw the Newman projections for the staggered and eclipsed conformers of

the structure of alkynes and distinguish between internal and terminal triple bonds Alkynes Terminal vs Internal Alkynes are organic molecules with carboncarbon triple bonds They are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the empirical formula of CnHn The simplest alkyne is ethyne which has the common name acetylene Acetylene is a common name to memorize It is important to distinguish between terminal and internal alkynes because they can undergo different patterns of reactivity Electronic Structure The sp hybridization of the carboncarbon triple bond results in the perpendicular orientation of the sigma bond and two pi bonds The close proximity of the electrons in this geometry orientation creates molecules with less stability The structure of the carboncarbon triple bond strongly influences the chemical reactivity of alkynes and the acidity of terminal alkynes Because of its linear configuration the bond angle of a sphybridized carbon is º a tenmembered carbon ring is the smallest that can accommodate this function without excessive strain Physical Properties Alkynes are nonpolar unsaturated hydrocarbons with physical properties similar to alkanes and alkenes Alkynes dissolve in organic solvents have slight solubility in polar solvents and are insoluble in water Compared to alkanes and alkenes alkynes have slightly higher boiling points For example ethane has a boiling point of C while ethene is C and ethyne has a higher boiling point of C Exercise Arrange ethane ethene and acetylene in order of decreasing carboncarbon length How many pi bonds and sigma bonds are involved

Objective recognize and classify the stereochemistry of alkenes using the cistrans system Steroisomerism in Alkenes There is free rotation about the carbontocarbon single bonds CC in alkanes For example in dichloroethane there is free rotation about the CC bond The two models shown represent exactly the same molecule they are not isomers You can draw structural formulas that look different but if you bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bonds you should recognize that these two structures represent the same molecule In contrast the structure of alkenes requires that the carbon atoms of a double bond and the two atoms bonded to each carbon atom all lie in a single plane and that each doubly bonded carbon atom lies in the center of a triangle This part of the molecules structure is rigid rotation about doubly bonded carbon atoms is not possible without rupturing the bond In dichloroethene restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond become significant This leads to a special kind of isomerism The isomer in which the two chlorine Cl atoms lie on the same side of the molecule is called the cis isomer Latin cis meaning on this side and is named cisdichloroethene The isomer with the two Cl atoms on opposite sides of the molecule is the trans isomer Latin trans meaning across and is named transdichloroethene These two compounds are cistrans isomers or geometric isomers compounds that have different configurations groups permanently in different places in space because of the presence of a rigid structure in their molecule The diagram below summarizes the differences between alkanes and alkenes with respect to rotation where the carbons are red hydrogens are offwhite and the chlorines are green In dichloroethane a free rotation about the CC bond allows the two structures to be interconverted by a twist of one end relative to the other In dichloroethene b restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond are significant Geometric Isomers have Different Physical Properties Consider the alkene with the condensed structural formula CHCHCHCH We could name it butene but there are actually two such compounds the double bond results in cistrans isomerism Cisbutene has both methyl groups on the same side of the molecule Transbutene has the methyl groups on opposite sides of the molecule as shown in the diagram below Cisbutene and transbutene are unique compounds with slightly different physical properties as shown below For stereospecific reactions these compounds produce different stereoisomeric products under the same reaction conditions This phenonenom of reactivity will be explored more closely in the next chapter on alkene reactivity Example Which compounds can exist as cistrans geometric isomers Draw them CHClCHBr CHCBrCH CHCCHCHCH

one and H and Br on the other It exists as both cis and trans isomers This compound has two hydrogen atoms on one of its doubly bonded carbon atoms it fails rule and does not exist as cis and trans isomers This compound has two methyl CH groups on one of its doubly bonded carbon atoms It fails rule and does not exist as cis and trans isomers This compound meets rule it has two nonidentical

cannot freely rotate around the carboncarbon double bond Answer CHCH The carboncarbon double bond is not shown but can be recognized by knowing the neutral bonding patterns of carbon Note how easy it would be to misinterpret this small dash therefore the structure for ethene is typically shown with a condensed or Kekule structure The carbons cannot freely rotate about the carboncarbon double bond because rotating porbitals would have to pass through a point where there would no longer be any overlap so the bond would have to break for there to be free rotation References Vollhardt K PC Shore N

defined as the chemistry of those substances formed by living matter and for quite a while there was a firm belief that it would never be possible to prepare organic compounds in the laboratory outside of a living system However after the discovery by Wohler in that a supposedly typical organic compound urea could be prepared by heating an inorganic salt ammonium cyanate this definition gradually lost significance and organic chemistry now is broadly defined as the chemistry of carboncontaining compounds Nonetheless the designation organic is still very pertinent because the chemistry of organic compounds is also the chemistry of living organisms Each of us and every other living organism is comprised of and endlessly manufactures organic compounds Further all organisms consume organic compounds as raw materials except for those plants that use photosynthesis or related processes to synthesize their own from carbon dioxide To understand every important aspect of this chemistry be it the details of photosynthesis digestion reproduction muscle action memory or even the thought process itself is a primary goal of science and it should be recognized that only through application of organic chemistry will this goal be achieved Modern civilization consumes vast quantities of organic compounds Coal petroleum and natural gas are primary sources of carbon compounds for

and other surface coatings medicines and drugs perfumes and flavors antioxidants and other preservatives as well as asphalts lubricants and solvents that are derived from petroleum Much has been done and you soon may infer from the breadth of the material that we will cover that most everything worth doing already has been done However many unsolved scientific problems remain and others have not

Attributions Learning Objective identify nucleophiles and electrophiles in polar reactions relate bond polarity to chemical reactivity Nucleophiles and Electrophiles The reactants of polar reactions are often called the nucleophile and electrophile These terms are related to Lewis acidbase notation so it can be helpful to apply and transfer the knowledge and wisdom gained from this definiation of acidbase chemistry Electrophile Lewis Acid An electron deficient atom ion or molecule that has an affinity for an electron pair and will bond to a base or nucleophile Nucleophile Lewis Base An atom ion or molecule that has an electron pair that may be donated in bonding to an electrophile Nucleophile Nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond In both laboratory and biological organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates More specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide N anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles Enolate ions are the most common carbon nucleophiles in biochemical reactions while the cyanide ion CN is just one example of a carbon nucleophile commonly used in the laboratory Hydrocarbons carbons with pi bonds can also be nucleophiles Reactions with carbon nucleophiles will be dealt with in later chapters In this chapter we will concentrate on noncarbon nucleophiles When thinking about nucleophiles the first thing to recognize is that for the most part the same quality of electronrichness that makes a something nucleophilic also makes it basic nucleophiles can be bases and bases can be nucleophiles It should not be surprising then that most of the trends in basicity that we have already discussed also apply to nucleophilicity Electrophiles In the vast majority of polar reactions the electrophilic atom is a carbon atom bonded to an electronegative atom usually oxygen nitrogen sulfur or a halogen The concept of electrophilicity is relatively simple an electronpoor atom with partial positive charge is an attractive target an electronrich nucleophile Electrophiles can be challenging to recognize because their partial positive charge is hidden in polar bonds andor resonance Allkyl halides and carbonyl groups are useful electrophiles for synthetic organic chemistry Electrophilicity of Alkyl Halides With respect to electronegativity halogens are more electronegative than carbons This results in a carbonhalogen bond that is polarized As shown in the image below carbon atom has a partial positive charge while the halogen has a partial negative charge Allkyl halides are useful electrophiles for synthetic organic chemistry Of the four halogens fluorine is the most electronegative and iodine the least That means that the electron pair in the carbonfluorine bond will be dragged most towards the halogen end Looking at the methyl halides as simple examples The following image shows the relative electronegativity of the halogens Notice as we move up the periodic table from iodine to fluorine electronegativity increases The following image shows the relationships between bond length bond strength and molecular size As we progress down the periodic table from fluorine to iodine molecular size increases As a result we also see an increase in bond length Conversely as molecular size increases and we get longer bonds the strength of those bonds decreases You might have thought that either of these would be more effective in the case of the carbonfluorine bond with the quite large amounts of positive and negative charge already present But thats not so quite the opposite is true The thing that governs the reactivity is the strength of the bonds which have to be broken If is difficult to break a carbonfluorine bond but easy to break a carboniodine one The relative electrophilicity of alkyl halides is summarized below Electrophilicity of the Carbonyl Group The carbon atom of the carbonyl group CO is electrophilic because the carbonoxygen double bond is polar and one of the resonance contributors is ionized with a full positiv echarge on the carbonyl carbon Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon so electron density is higher on the oxygen side of the bond and lower on the carbon side Both of these factors combine to increase the electrophilicity of carbonyl groups Carbonyl chemistry is studied in greater detail in the second semester

Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Contributors and Attributions We pointed out in Chapter the importance of using systematic names for compounds such that the name uniquely describes the structure It is equally important to be able to unambiguously describe the configuration of a compound The convention that is used to designate the configurations of chiral carbons of naturally occurring compounds is called the system To use it we view the molecule of interest according to the following rules The main carbon chain is oriented vertically with the lowest numbered carbon at the top The numbering used for this purpose must follow the IUPAC rules Next the structure must be arranged at the particular chiral carbon whose configuration is to be assigned so the horizontal bonds to that carbon extend toward you and the vertical bonds extend away from you This arrangement will be seen to be precisely the same as the convention of projection formulas such as and Section C Now the relative positions of the substituents on the horizontal bonds at the chiral centers are examined If the main substituent is the left of the main chain the configuration is assigned if this substituent is on the right the configuration is assigned For example the two configurations of the amino acid alanine would be represented in perspective or projection as and The carboxyl carbon is and is placed at the top The substituents at the chiral carbon connected to the horizontal bonds are amino and hydrogen The amino substituent is taken to be the main substituent when this is on the left the acid has the configuration and when it is on the right the configuration All of the amino acids that occur in natural proteins have been shown to have the configuration Glyceraldehyde which has one chiral carbon bonded to an aldehyde function hydrogen hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl is of special interest as the simplest chiral prototype of sugars carbohydrates Perspective views and Fischer projections of the and forms correspond to and respectively where the carbon of the aldehyde function is The system of designating configuration only can be applied when there is a main chain and when we can make an unambiguous choice of the main substituent groups Try for instance to assign and configurations to enantiomers of bromochlorofluoromethane An excellent set of rules has been worked out for such cases that leads to unambiguous configurational assignments by what is called the convention We discuss the system in detail in Chapter and if you wish you can turn to it now However for the next several chapters assigning configurations is much less important to us than knowing what kinds of stereoisomers are

ReactionsContributors and Attributions A Kinetics and Mechanism The conditions used for substitution reactions by the mechanism very often lead to elimination The reaction of bromopropane with sodium ethoxide in ethanol provides a good example Elimination to give propene competes with substitution to give ethyl isopropyl ether Furthermore the rate of elimination like the rate of substitution is proportional to the concentrations of bromopropane and ethoxide ion Thus elimination here is a secondorder reaction it may be helpful to review Section at this point rate of substitution rate of elimination As to the mechanism of this kind of elimination the attacking base removes a proton from the carbon more or less simultaneously with the formation of the double bond and the loss of bromide ion from the neighboring carbon The abbreviation for this mechanism is for elimination and for bimolecular there being two reactants involved in the transition state B Structural Effects Structural influences on reactions have been studied in some detail Like the competing process a good leaving group is necessary and of these the most commonly used are the halides and sulfonate esters and onium ions such as ammonium and sulfonium Rather strong bases generally are required to bring about the reaction The effectiveness of a series of bases generally parallels their base strengths and the order is observed for reactions This fact is important in planning practical syntheses because the reaction tends to predominate with strongly basic slightly polarizable reagents such as amide ion or ethoxide ion In contrast reactions tend to be favored with weakly basic nucleophiles such as iodide ion or ethanoate ion unless dipolar aprotic solvents are used which may markedly change the reactivity of anionic nucleophiles As for the alkyl group there are two important structural effects to notice First at least one bond adjacent to the leaving group is required Second the ease of elimination follows the order tertiary secondary primary Unlike reactions which are not observed for tertiary alkyl compounds because of steric hindrance to the approach of the nucleophile to carbon the related reaction usually occurs readily with tertiary compounds The reason is that little or no steric hindrance is likely for the approach of a base to a hydrogen unless the base is exceptionally bulky The reactivity order also appears to correlate with the bond energy inasmuch as the tertiary alkyl halides both are more reactive and have weaker carbonhalogen bonds than either primary or secondary halides see Table In fact elimination of from haloalkenes or haloarenes with relatively strong bonds such as chloroethene or chlorobenzene is much less facile than for haloalkanes Nonetheless elimination does occur under the right conditions and constitutes one of the most useful general methods for the synthesis of alkynes For example The conditions and reagents used for and reactions are similar enough that it is difficult to have one occur without the other However elimination is favored over substitution by a strongly basic nucleophiles b bulky nucleophiles and c increasing alkyl substitution at the carbon It also is observed that increasing the reaction temperature generally leads to an increase in elimination at the expense of substitution In fact surprisingly good yields of alkene or alkyne can be obtained by adding a halogen compound directly to molten or very hot with no solvent present whereupon the product is formed rapidly and distills immediately from the hot reaction mixture C Orientation Effects in Elimination Reactions With halides having unsymmetrical groups such as chloromethylbutane it is possible to form two or more different alkenes the proportion depending on the relative rates at which the different hydrogens are removed Most eliminations of alkyl halides with common bases such as and tend to give mixtures of alkenes with a preference for the most stable alkene which usually is the one with the fewest hydrogens or most alkyl groups attached to the carbons of the double bond Thus However the precise distribution of alkenes formed is found to vary enough with the nature of the leaving group or the base used so either product will predominated with some combination of reagents or conditions For example a change in the base alone can be decisive D Stereochemistry of Reactions The reaction occurs most easily if the molecule undergoing reaction can assume a conformation in which the leaving groups and are trans to each other and the atoms lie in one plane Elimination then proceeds from opposite sides of the incipient double bond to give an alkene of structure We shall call this mode of elimination antarafacial to distinguish Figure Schematic representation of antarafacial literally oppositeface and suprafacial literally aboveface elimination or addition of a reagent to ethene it from another possible mode of elimination that is called suprafacial See Figure The transition state for conversion of to is particularly reasonable because it combines some of the geometry of both the reactants and the products and therefore gives the best overlap of the reacting orbitals necessary for the formation of the bond This is shown more explicitly below As an illustration of the stereospecificity of eliminations the meso compound gives the cisalkene whereas the isomers give the transalkene with ethoxide Both reactions clearly proceed by antarafacial elimination When antarafacial elimination is rendered difficult by the inability of the reacting groups to acquire the desired trans arrangement then suprafacial elimination can occur although less readily An example is chlorocyclopentane in which and cannot assume a trans configuration without very considerable strain but which does undergo suprafacial elimination at a reasonable rate Endless confusion is caused by the very prevalent use of the term cis elimination or cis addition and trans elimination or trans addition to denote the processes shown in Figure At the risk of annoying those who often rightly dislike complicated names for simple processes we have chosen to adopt the proposal of R B Woodward and R Hoffman that elimination or addition which involves a sameside cleavage or formation of bonds be called suprafacial and the oppositeside cleavage or formation of bonds be called antarafacial The alternative of using syn for suprafacial and anti for antarafacial would be simpler and easier to remember but the terms syn and anti already are used for configurations which is exactly what we want to avoid The problem with the terms cis elimination or addition and trans elimination or addition is that they do not necessarily lead to products that by other conventions are understood to be cis and trans products respectively For example to say that trans elimination leads to cis product is a needless confusion It is much clearer to say that antarafacial elimination gives the cis product and now there is no confusion of the mode of elimination with whatever stereochemical convention identifies the product Persuasive arguments have been made that many reactions proceed by the sequence If this is so antarafacial elimination still is predicted to be favored Contributors and

Contributors and Attributions Learning Objective explain how the kinetic isotope effect KIE can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms Kinetic Isotope Effects Kinetic Isotope Effects KIEs are used to determine reaction mechanisms by determining rate limiting steps and transition states and are commonly measured using NMR to detect isotope location or GCMS to detect mass changes In a KIE experiment an atom is replaced by its isotope and the change in rate of the reaction is observed A very common isotope substitution is when hydrogen is replaced by deuterium This is known as a deuterium effect and is expressed by the ratio kHkD as explained above Normal KIEs for the deuterium effect are around to or Large effects are seen because the percentage mass change between hydrogen and deuterium is great Heavy atom isotope effects involve the substitution of carbon oxygen nitrogen sulfur and bromine with effects that are much smaller and are usually between and The difference in KIE magnitude is directly related to the percentage change in mass Large effects are seen when hydrogen is replaced with deuterium because the percentage mass change is very large mass is being doubled while smaller percent mass changes are present when an atom like sulfur is replaced with its isotope increased by two mass units Primary KIEs Primary kinetic isotope effects are rate changes due to isotopic substitution at a site of bond breaking in the rate determining step of a reaction Example Consider the bromination of acetone kinetic studies have been performed that show the rate of this reaction is independent of the concentration of bromine To determine the rate determining step and mechanism of this reaction the substitution of a deuterium for a hydrogen can be made When hydrogen was replaced with deuterium in this reaction a of was found Therefore the rate determining step is the tautomerization of acetone and involves the breaking of a CH bond Since the breaking of

priority rules which allow you to rank any groups The rigorous IUPAC system for naming alkene isomers called the EZ system is based on the same priority rules The priority rules are often called the CahnIngoldPrelog CIP rules after the chemists who developed the system The general strategy of the EZ system is to analyze the two groups at each end of the double bond For each vinyl carbon rank the two groups using the CIP priority rules Determine whether the higher priority group at one end of the double bond and the higher priority group at the other end of the double bond are on the same side Z from German zusammen together or on Zee Zame Zide or on opposite sides E from German entgegen opposite of the double bond Example The figure below shows the two isomers of butene You should recognize them as cis and trans Lets analyze them to see whether they are E or Z Start with the left hand structure the cis isomer On C the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are C and H By the CIP priority rules C is higher priority than H higher atomic number Now look at C the right end of the double bond Similarly the atoms are C and H with C being higher priority We see that the higher priority group is down at C and down at C Since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together Therefore this is Zbutene Now look at the right hand structure the trans isomer In this case the priority group is down on the left end of the double bond and up on the right end of the double bond Since the two priority groups are on opposite sides of the double bond they are entgegen opposite Therefore this is Ebutene EZ will work even when cistrans fails In simple cases such as butene Z corresponds to cis and E to trans However that is not a rule This section and the following one illustrate some idiosyncrasies that happen when you try to compare the two systems The real advantage of the EZ system is that it will always work In contrast the cistrans system breaks down with many ambiguous cases Example The following figure shows two isomers of an alkene with four different groups on the double bond bromochlorofluoroiodoethene It should be apparent that the two structures shown are distinct chemicals However it is impossible to name them as cis or trans On the other hand the EZ system works fine Consider the left hand structure On C the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are Br and I By the CIP priority rules I is higher priority than Br higher atomic number Now look at C The atoms are Cl and F with Cl being higher priority We see that the higher priority group is down at C and down at C Since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together Therefore this is the Z isomer Similarly the right hand structure is E EZ will work but may not agree with cistrans There are also molecules for which the EZ system will not agree with the cistrans system Lets use bromobutene to explore this option Is this compound cis or trans This molecule is clearly cis The two methyl groups are on the same side More rigorously the parent chain is cis Is this compound E or Z There is a methyl at each end of the double bond On the left the methyl is the high priority group because the other group is H On the right the methyl is the low priority group because the other group is Br That is the high priority groups are CH left and Br right Thus the two priority groups are on opposite sides entgegen E This example should convince you that cis and Z are not synonyms Cistrans and EZ are determined by distinct criteria There may seem to be a simple correspondence but it is not a rule Be sure to determine cistrans or EZ separately as needed Multiple double bonds If the compound contains more than one double bond then each one is analyzed and declared to be E or Z Example The configuration at the left hand double bond is E at the right hand double bond it is Z Thus this compound is EZdichlorohexadiene The doublebond rule in determining priorities Example Consider the compound below This is chloroethylbutadiene ignoring for the moment the geometric isomerism There is no geometric isomerism at the second double bond at because it has H at its far end What about the first double bond at On the left hand end there is H and Cl Cl is higher priority by atomic number On the right hand end there is CHCH an ethyl group and CHCH a vinyl or ethenyl group Both of these groups have C as the first atom so we have a tie so far and must look further What is attached to this first C For the ethyl group the first C is attached to C H and H For the ethenyl group the first C is attached to a C twice so we count it twice therefore that C is attached to C C H CCH is higher than CHH therefore the ethenyl group is higher priority Since the priority groups Cl and ethenyl are on the same side of the double bond this is the Zisomer the compound is Zchloroethylbutadiene The first point of difference rule Which is higher priority by the CIP rules a C with an O and H attached to it or a C with three C The first C has one atom of high priority but also two atoms of low priority How do these balance out Answering this requires a clear understanding of how the ranking is done The simple answer is that the first point of difference is what matters the O wins To illustrate this consider the molecule at the left Is the double bond here E or Z At the left end of the double bond Br H But the right end of the double bond requires a careful analysis At the right hand end the first atom attached to the double bond is a C at each position A tie so we look at what is attached to this first C For the upper C it is CCC since the triple bond counts three times For the lower C it is OHH listed in order from high priority atom to low OHH is higher priority than CCC because of the first atom in the list That is the O of the lower group beats the C of the upper group In other words the O is the highest priority atom of any in this comparison thus the O wins Therefore the high priority groups are up on the left end the Br and down on the right end the CHOCH This means that the isomer shown is opposite entgegen E And what is the name The name feature of ChemSketch says it is Ebromoethylidenepentynyl methyl ether Example The configuration about double bonds is undoubtedly best specified by the cistrans notation when there is no ambiguity involved Unfortunately many compounds cannot be described adequately by the cistrans system Consider for example configurational isomers of fluoro chloro bromoiodoethene and There is no obvious way in which the cistrans system can be used A system that is easy to use and which is based on the sequence rules already described for the RS system works as follows An order of precedence is established for the two atoms or groups attached to each end of the double bond according to the sequence rules of Section When these rules are applied to fluoro chlorobromo iodoethene the priority sequence is at carbon atom C F at carbon atom I Br Examination of the two configurations shows that the two priority groups one on each end are either on the same side of the double bond or on opposite sides The Z isomer is designated as the isomer in which the top priority groups are on the same side Z is taken from the German word zusammen together The E isomer has these groups on opposite sides E German for entgegen across Two further examples show how the nomenclature is used Exercises Order the following in increasing priority A H Cl OH B CH CHOH CHCH C CCH CHCH CHO Label the following as E or Z conformations Answer A H OH Cl highest priority B CH CHCH CHOH highest priority C CHCH CCH CHO highest priority A Z B Z C E Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof

Attributions Alkanes the most basic of all organic compounds undergo very few reactions One of these reactions is halogenation or the substitution of a single hydrogen on the alkane for a single halogen to form a haloalkane This reaction is very important in organic chemistry because it opens a gateway to further chemical reactions Introduction While the reactions possible with alkanes are few there are many reactions that involve haloalkanes In order to better understand the mechanism a detailed look at the step by step process through which a reaction occurs we will closely examine the chlorination of methane When methane CH and chlorine Cl are mixed together in the absence of light at room temperature nothing happens However if the conditions are changed so that either the reaction is taking place at high temperatures denoted by Δ or there is ultra violet irradiation a product is formed chloromethane CHCl Energetics Why does this reaction occur Is the reaction favorable A way to answer these questions is to look at the change in enthalpy that occurs when the reaction takes place ΔH Energy put into reaction Energy given off from reaction If more energy is put into a reaction than is given off the ΔH is positive the reaction is endothermic and not energetically favorable If more energy is given off in the reaction than was put in the ΔH is negative the reaction is said to be exothermic and is considered favorable The figure below illustrates the difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions ΔH can also be calculated using bond dissociation energies ΔH Lets look at our specific example of the chlorination of methane to determine if it is endothermic or exothermic Since the ΔH for the chlorination of methane is negative the reaction is exothermic Energetically this reaction is favorable In order to better understand this reaction we need to look at the mechanism a detailed step by step look at the reaction showing how it occurs by which the reaction occurs Radical Chain Mechanism The reaction proceeds through the radical chain mechanism The radical chain mechanism is characterized by three steps initiation propagation and termination Initiation requires an input of energy but after that the reaction is selfsustaining The first propagation step uses up one of the products from initiation and the second propagation step makes another one thus the cycle can continue until indefinitely Step Initiation Initiation breaks the bond between the chlorine molecule Cl For this step to occur energy must be put in this step is not energetically favorable After this step the reaction can occur continuously as long as reactants provide without input of more energy It is important to note that this part of the mechanism cannot occur without some external energy input through light or heat Step Propagation The next two steps in the mechanism are called propagation steps In the first propagation step a chlorine radical combines with a hydrogen on the methane This gives hydrochloric acid HCl the inorganic product of this reaction and the methyl radical In the second propagation step more of the chlorine starting material Cl is used one of the chlorine atoms becomes a radical and the other combines with the methyl radical The first propagation step is endothermic meaning it takes in heat requires kcalmol and is not energetically favorable In contrast the second propagation step is exothermic releasing kcalmol Once the reaction is initiated the exothermic energy released from the second propagation step provides the activation energy for the first propagation step creating a cyclic chain reaction following Le Chateliers principle until termination Step Termination In the termination steps all the remaining radicals combine in all possible manners to form more product CHCl more reactant Cl and even combinations of the two methyl radicals to form a side product of ethane CHCH Limitations of the Chlorination The chlorination of methane or any other alkane does not necessarily stop after one chlorination It may actually be very hard to get a monosubstituted chloromethane Instead di tri and even tetrachloromethanes are formed One way to avoid this problem is to use a much higher concentration of methane or other alkane in comparison to chloride This reduces the chance of a chlorine radical running into a chloromethane and starting the mechanism over again to form a dichloromethane Through this method of controlling product ratios one is able to have a relative amount of control over the product Exercises Compounds other than chlorine and methane can react via freeradical halogenation Write out the complete mechanism for the monobromination of ethane Explain how the energetically unfavorable first propagation step can continue to occur without the input of energy from an external source Which step of the radical chain mechanism requires outside energy What can be used as this energy Use the table provided below to calculate the change in enthalpy for the monobromination of ethane Compound Bond Dissociation Energy kcalmol CHCHH CHCHBr HBr Br Solutions The exothermic energy released from the second propagation step provides the activation energy for the first propagation step creating a cyclic chain reaction following Le Chateliers principle until termination The initiation step requires energy from heat o lit For maximum photoefficiency the wavelength of light is correlated with bond being homolytically cleaved References Matyjaszewski

Chemists are often very interested in trying to learn about what the transition state for a given reaction looks like but addressing this question requires an indirect approach because the transition state itself cannot be observed In order to gain some insight into what a particular transition state looks like chemists often invoke the Hammond postulate which states that a transition state resembles the structure of the nearest stable species For an exergonic reaction therefore the transition state resembles the reactants more than it does the products If we consider a hypothetical exergonic reaction between compounds A and B to form AB the distance between A and B would be relatively large at the transition state resembling the starting state where A and B are two isolated species In the hypothetical endergonic reaction between C and D to form CD however the bond formation process would be much further along at the TS point resembling the product The Hammond Postulate is a very simplistic idea which relies on an assumption that potential energy surfaces are parabolic Although such an assumption is not rigorously true it is fairly reliable and allows chemists to make energetic arguments about transition states by employing arguments about the stability of a related species Since the formation of a reactive intermediate is very reliably endergonic arguments about the stability of reactive intermediates can serve as proxy arguments about transition state stability The Hammond Postulate and the SN Reaction the Hammond postulate suggests that the activation energy of the ratedetermining first step will be inversely proportional to the stability of the carbocation intermediate The stability of carbocations was discussed earlier and a qualitative

Theopold Richard Langley et alGeneral Chemistry at OpenStax CNX Contributors and Attributions Learning Objective discuss the origins of organic chemistry All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds The prevalence of carbon compounds in living things has led to the epithet carbonbased life The truth is we know of no other kind of life Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms plants and animals as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially and these substances were thus known as organic compounds The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms The German chemist Friedrich Wöhler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism when in he reported the synthesis of urea a component of many body fluids from nonliving materials Since then it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon Some carboncontaining compounds are not classified as organic for example carbonates and cyanides and simple oxides such as and Although a single precise definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms Figure All organic compounds contain carbon and most are formed by living things although they

given its Kelulé condensed or shorthand structure with or without the aid of molecular models label the chiral centres carbon atoms in a given Kelulé condensed or shorthand structure Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below achiral chiral chiral stereogenic centre plane of symmetry A consideration of the chirality of molecular configurations explains the curious stereoisomerism observed for lactic acid carvone and a multitude of other organic compounds Tetravalent carbons have a tetrahedral configuration If all four substituent groups are the same as in methane or tetrachloromethane the configuration is that of a highly symmetric regular tetrahedron A regular tetrahedron several planes of symmetry and is achiral A carbon atom that is bonded to four different atoms or groups loses all symmetry and is often referred to as an asymmetric carbon The configuration of such a molecular unit is chiral and the structure may exist in either a righthanded configuration or a lefthanded configuration one the mirror image of the other This type of configurational stereoisomerism is termed enantiomorphism and the nonidentical mirrorimage pair of stereoisomers that result are called enantiomers In the general figure below A and B are nonsuperposable mirror images of one another and thus are a pair of enantiomers The structural formulas of lactic acid and carvone are drawn on the right with the asymmetric carbon colored red Consequently we find that these compounds exist as pairs of enantiomers The presence of a single asymmetrically substituted carbon atom in a molecule is sufficient to render the whole configuration chiral and modern terminology refers to such groupings as chiral centers Most of the chiral centers we shall discuss are asymmetric carbon atoms but it should be recognized that other tetrahedral or pyramidal atoms may become chiral centers if appropriately substituted When more than one chiral center is present in a molecular structure care must be taken to analyze their relationship before concluding that a specific molecular configuration is chiral or achiral This aspect of stereoisomerism will be treated later A useful first step in examining structural formulas to determine whether stereoisomers may exist is to identify all stereogenic elements A stereogenic element is a center axis or plane that is a focus of stereoisomerism such that an interchange of two groups attached to this feature leads to a stereoisomer Stereogenic elements may be chiral or achiral An asymmetric carbon is often a chiral stereogenic center since interchanging any two substituent groups converts one enantiomer to the other Alkenes having two different groups on each double bond carbon constitute an achiral stereogenic element since interchanging substituents at one of the carbons changes the cistrans configuration of the double bond Some of the structures in the figure above are chiral and some are achiral First try to identify all chiral stereogenic centers Formulas having no chiral centers are necessarily achiral Formulas having one chiral center are always chiral and if two or more chiral centers are present in a given structure it is likely to be chiral but in special cases to be discussed later may be achiral Structures F and G are achiral The former has a plane of symmetry passing through the chlorine atom and bisecting the opposite carboncarbon bond The similar structure of compound E does not have such a symmetry plane and the carbon bonded to the chlorine is a chiral center the two ring segments connecting this carbon are not identical Structure G is essentially flat All the carbons except that of the methyl group are sp hybridized and therefore trigonalplanar in configuration Compounds C D H have more than one chiral center and are also chiral Remember all chiral structures may exist as a pair of enantiomers Other configurational stereoisomers are possible if more than one stereogenic center is present in a structure In the s a drug called thalidomide was widely prescribed in the Western Europe to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women Thalidomide had previously been used in other countries as an antidepressant and was believed to be safe and effective for both purposes The drug was not approved for use in the USA It was not long however before doctors realized that something had gone horribly wrong many babies born to women who had taken thalidomide during pregnancy suffered from severe birth defects Researchers later realized the that problem lay in the fact that thalidomide was being provided as a mixture of two different isomeric forms One of the isomers is an effective medication the other caused the side effects Both isomeric forms have the same molecular formula and the same atomtoatom connectivity so they are not constitutional isomers Where they differ is in the arrangement in threedimensional space about one tetrahedral sphybridized carbon These two forms of thalidomide are stereoisomers Note that the carbon in question has four different substituents two of these just happen to be connected by a ring structure Tetrahedral carbons with four different substituent groups are called stereocenters Example Locate all of the carbon stereocenters in the molecules below Answer Looking at the structures of what we are referring to as the two isomers of thalidomide you may not be entirely convinced that they are actually two different molecules In order to convince ourselves that they are indeed different lets create a generalized picture of a tetrahedral carbon stereocenter with the four substituents designated RR The two stereoisomers of our simplified model look like this If you look carefully at the figure above you will notice that molecule A and molecule B are mirror images of each other the line labeled s represents a mirror plane Furthermore they are not superimposable if we pick up molecule A flip it around and place it next to molecule B we see that the two structures cannot be superimposed on each other They are different molecules If you make models of the two stereoisomers of thalidomide and do the same thing you will see that they too are mirror images and cannot be superimposed it well help to look at a color version of the figure below Thalidomide is a chiral molecule Something is considered to be chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its own mirror image in other words if it is asymmetric lacking in symmetry The term chiral is derived from the Greek word for handedness ie righthandedness or lefthandedness Your hands are chiral your right hand is a mirror image of your left hand but if you place one hand on top of the other both palms down you see that they are not superimposable A pair of stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another are considered to have a specific type of stereoisomeric relationship they are a pair of enantiomers Thalidomide exists as a pair of enantiomers On the macro level your left and right hands are also a pair of enantiomers Here are some more examples of chiral molecules that exist as pairs of enantiomers In each of these examples there is a single stereocenter indicated with an arrow Many molecules have more than one stereocenter but we will get to that that a little later Here are some examples of molecules that are achiral not chiral Notice that none of these molecules has a stereocenter It is difficult to illustrate on the two dimensional page but you will see if you build models of these achiral molecules that in each case there is at least one plane of symmetry where one side of the plane is the mirror image of the other Chirality is tied conceptually to the idea of asymmetry and any molecule that has a plane of symmetry cannot be chiral When looking for a plane of symmetry however we must consider all possible conformations that a molecule could adopt Even a very simple molecule like ethane for example is asymmetric in many of its countless potential conformations but it has obvious symmetry in both the eclipsed and staggered conformations and for this reason it is achiral Looking for planes of symmetry in a molecule is useful but often difficult in practice In most cases the easiest way to decide whether a molecule is chiral or achiral is to look for one or more stereocenters with a few rare exceptions see section B the general rule is that molecules with at least one stereocenter are chiral and molecules with no stereocenters are achiral Carbon stereocenters are also referred to quite frequently as chiral carbons When evaluating a molecule for chirality it is important to recognize that the question of whether or not the dashedsolid wedge drawing convention is used is irrelevant Chiral molecules are sometimes drawn without using wedges although obviously this means that stereochemical information is being omitted Conversely wedges may be used on carbons that are not stereocenters look for example at the drawings of glycine and citrate in the figure above Just because you see dashed and solid wedges in a structure do not automatically assume that you are looking at a stereocenter Other elements in addition to carbon can be stereocenters The phosphorus center of phosphate ion and organic phosphate esters for example is tetrahedral and thus is potentially a stereocenter We will see in chapter how researchers in order to investigate the stereochemistry of reactions at the phosphate center incorporated sulfur andor O and O isotopes of oxygen the normal isotope is O to create chiral phosphate groups Phosphate triesters are chiral if the three substituent groups are different Asymmetric quaternary ammonium groups are also chiral Amines however are not chiral because they rapidly invert or turn inside out at room temperature Example Label the molecules below as chiral or achiral and locate all stereocenters

Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Jim Clark Chemguidecouk Contributors and Attributions Ionic or polar reactions of alkyl halides rarely are observed in the vapor phase because the energy required to dissociate a carbonhalogen bond heterolytically is almost prohibitively high For example while the heat of dissociation of chloromethane to a methyl radical and a chlorine atom is Table dissociation to a methyl cation and a chloride ion requires about However the heat of ionic dissociation of methyl chloride in aqueous solution is estimated to be and while this reaction is still substantially endothermic it requires about less energy than in the gas phase The reason is that ions are much more stable in water than in the gas phase for example the transfer of a chloride ion from the gas to water is exothermic by The value for the corresponding transfer of a methyl cation is not known with certainty but is about These ionic solvation energies are clearly large In contrast the for solution of methyl chloride in water is small about We can use these data to calculate the heat of ionic dissociation of chloromethane in water Thermochemical data for the solvation of ions as used in the preceding calculations are difficult to measure and even to estimate Therefore this kind of calculation of for ionic reactions involving organic molecules in solution usually cannot be made As a result we have considerably fewer possibilities to assess the thermodynamic feasibility of the individual steps of polar reactions in solution than we do of vaporphase radical processes Bond energies are not of much use in predicting or explaining reactivity in ionic reactions unless we have some information that can be used to translate gasphase values to solution values Calculated from the

Angles and BallandStick ModelsB Bond Lengths and SpaceFilling ModelsContributors and Attributions The size and shape of molecules are as much a part of molecular structure as is the order in which the component atoms are bonded Contrary to the impression you may get from structural formulas complex molecules are not flat and formless but have welldefined spatial arrangements that are determined by the lengths and directional character of their chemical bonds It is not easy to visualize the possible arrangements of the bonds in space and it is very helpful to have some kind of mechanical model that reflects the molecular geometry including at least an approximation to the relative lengths of the bonds Ballandstick models such as the ones used by Paterno Section D fill this purpose admirably A Bond Angles and BallandStick Models It is well established that the normal carbon atom forms its four single bonds in compounds of the type so that the four attached atoms lie at the corners of a regular tetrahedron The bond angles are and this value is the normal valence angle of carbon For many purposes ballandstick models of organic compounds give useful information about the spatial relationships of the atoms and for the angles between sticks are set at Figure Organic molecules strongly resist deformation forces that alter their valence angles from normal values Therefore ballandstick models correspond better to the behavior of actual molecules if the connectors representing single bonds are made to be rather stiff Figure Ballandstick model of Figure Ballandstick models of some simple organic molecules Whereas methane is tetrahedral ethene is not According to the best available physical measurements all six atoms of ethene lie in a single plane and the bond angles are Methanal formaldehyde also is a planar molecule with an bond angle of Models of ethene and methanal can be built with ballandstick models by using flexible couplings or bent sticks to form the double bonds Figure but the angles are inaccurate because they are rather than the observed to Ethyne has been established experimentally to be a linear molecule that is the bond angle is This geometry also results with ballandstick models if the triple bond is constructed of three flexible couplings or bent sticks as shown in Figure Structural units that have valence angles substantially less than the tetrahedral value include double and triple bonds and small rings such as cyclopropane Several bent bonds are required to construct models of compounds containing these units Interestingly such compounds are much less stable and more reactive than otherwise similar molecules for which models can be constructed with straight sticks at tetrahedral angles B Bond Lengths and SpaceFilling Models The length of a chemical bond is the average distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms regardless of where the bonding electrons happen to be The customary unit of length is the angstrom and measurements often can be made with an accuracy of by using the techniques of molecular spectroscopy xray diffraction for crystalline solids and electron diffraction for volatile compounds Bond lengths vary considerably with structure and depend on the identity of both atoms the type of bonding single double or triple and the nature of other atoms or groups bonded to the two atoms in question These effects are apparent in the data of Table which lists the bond lengths in several simple organic compounds Multiple bonds double or triple clearly are shorter than single bonds and it can be stated as a general observation that the more bonding electrons in a given bond the shorter and stronger the bond The lengths of single bonds also vary significantly depending on what other atoms or groups are attached to the carbons Thus Table shows that single bonds become progressively shorter as the number of multiple bonds or electronegative atoms attached to the carbons increases Although molecular models cannot represent the subtle variations in bond lengths and bond angles that actual molecules exhibit most kinds of commercially available molecular models do attempt to reproduce relative bond lengths with some degree of reality In the ballandstick type the sticks usually come in various lengths to simulate different kinds of bonds bonds typically are scaled to represent bonds to be and and to be correspondingly shorter In some model sets the bonds can be cut to any desired length While the ballandstick models of molecules are very useful for visualizing the relative positions of the atoms in space they are unsatisfactory whenever we also want to show how large the atoms are Actually atomic radii are so large relative to the lengths of chemical bonds that when a model of a molecule such as methyl chloride is constructed with atomic radii and bond lengths both to scale the bonds connecting the atoms are not clearly evident None theless such spacefilling models made with truncated balls held together with snap fasteners are used widely to determine the possible closeness of approach of groups to each other and the degree of crowding of atoms in various arrangements see Figure Especially excellent but expensive models used for this purpose are the CoreyPaulingKolton CPK models Figure shows how the CPK models can indicate intense molecular crowding as between the bromines in dibromonaphthalene a close relative of dibromobenzene mentioned in Section G As we shall see such crowding has many chemical consequences Ideally a model should reflect not only the size and shape of the molecule it represents but also the flexibility of the molecule By this we mean that Figure CPK spacefilling models of organic compounds it should simulate the type of motions available to the molecule particularly bond rotation For example it is known that rotation normally occurs about single bonds in openchain compounds but is restricted about double bonds Motions of this kind are demonstrated easily with ballandstick models but are not at all obvious with the spacefilling type For this reason ballandstick models or their equivalent are more generally useful than the spacefilling models for visualizing structures and the positions of the atoms relative to one another The angstrom unit likely will be replaced eventually

rather than a carbon In both reaction types we are looking at very similar players an electronrich species the nucleophilebase reacts with an electronpoor species the electrophileproton driving off the leaving groupconjugate base In the next few sections we are going to be discussing some general aspects of nucleophilic substitution reactions and in doing so it will simplify things greatly if we can use some abbreviations and generalizations before we dive into real examples What is a nucleophile Nu Instead of showing a specific nucleophile like hydroxide we will simply refer to the nucleophilic reactant as Nu Nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond Nucleophiles can be negatively charged and some that are neutral with lone pair electrons In both laboratory and biological organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates More specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide N anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles When thinking about nucleophiles the first thing to recognize is that for the most part the same quality of electronrichness that makes a something nucleophilic also makes it basic nucleophiles can be bases and bases can be nucleophiles It should not be surprising then that most of the trends in basicity that we have already discussed also apply to nucleophilicity Some confusion in distinguishing basicity base strength and nucleophilicity nucleophile strength is inevitable Since basicity is a less troublesome concept it is convenient to start with it Basicity refers to the ability of a base to accept a proton Basicity may be related to the pKa of the corresponding conjugate acid as shown below The strongest bases have the weakest conjugate acids and vice versa The range of basicities included in the following table is remarkable covering over fifty powers of ten In an acidbase equilibrium the weakest acid and the weakest base will predominate they will necessarily be on the same side of the equilibrium Learning the pKa values for common compounds provides a useful foundation on which to build an understanding of acidbase factors in reaction mechanisms Base I Cl HO CHCO RS CN RO NH CH Conj Acid HI HCl HO CHCOH RSH HCN ROH NH CH pKa Nucleophilicity is a more complex property It commonly refers to the rate of substitution reactions at the halogenbearing carbon atom of a reference alkyl halide such as CHBr Thus the nucleophilicity of the Nu reactant in the following substitution reaction varies as shown in the chart below Nucleophilicity CHCO Cl Br N CHO CN I CHS What is a Leaving Group X or LG In a similar fashion we will call the leaving group X for halogens as is customary For other reactions it will be more accurate to abbreviate the leaving group as LG The context of the reaction will dictate the abbreviation Leaving groups are sometimes negatively charged sometimes neutral and sometimes positively charged Therefore in this general picture we will not include a charge designation on the X or LG species In referring to the comparison between acidbase chemistry and substitution reactions the stability of the leaving group is evaluated the same way we evaluate the stability of conjugate bases When comparing the reactivity of electrophiles that vary only in their leaving groups then leaving group stability plays a dominant role The electrophile with the more stable leaving group will be favored The lower the electron density of the leaving group the more stable it is Neutral leaving groups are favoring over charged leaving groups When comparing charged leaving groups apply the concepts used to determine the relative stability of conjugate bases identity or identities of the atoms holding the charge delocalization of the charge via resonance inductive effects orbital hybridization What is an Electrophile E An electrophile accepts electrons analogous to a Lewis acid Electrophiles E are sometimes protonated and sometimes neutral Electrophiles can also be called Substrates Since nucleophiles leaving groups and electrons may be charged or neutral we will not include charges on Nu or X or LG or E We will generalize the three other groups bonded on the electrophilic alphacarbon as R R and R these symbols could represent hydrogens as well as alkyl groups Finally in order to keep figures from becoming too crowded we will use in most cases the line structure convention in which the central electrophilic carbon is not drawn out as a C Here then is the generalized picture of a concerted singlestep nucleophilic substitution reaction To recognize neutral electrophiles we will need to identify polarity andor resonance with compounds to create a partial positive charge to attract the nucleophile The electrophilicity of alkyl halides comes from the polar carbonhalogen bond The common halogens being fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine With the exception of iodine these halogens have electronegativities significantly greater than carbon Consequently this functional group is polarized so that the carbon is electrophilic and the halogen is nucleophilic as shown in the drawing on the right Two characteristics other than electronegativity also have an important influence on the chemical behavior of these compounds The first of these is covalent bond strength The strongest of the carbonhalogen covalent bonds is that to fluorine Remarkably this is the strongest common single bond to carbon being roughly kcalmole stronger than a carboncarbon bond and about kcalmole stronger than a carbonhydrogen bond Because of this alkyl fluorides and fluorocarbons in general are chemically and thermodynamically quite stable and do not share any of the reactivity patterns shown by the other alkyl halides The carbonchlorine covalent bond is slightly weaker than a carboncarbon bond and the bonds to the other halogens are weaker still the bond to iodine being about weaker The second factor to be considered is the relative stability of the corresponding halide anions which is likely the form in which these electronegative atoms will be replaced This stability may be estimated from the relative acidities of the HX acids assuming that the strongest acid releases the most stable conjugate base halide anion With the exception of HF pKa all the hydrohalic acids are very strong small differences being in the direction HCl HBr HI Exercise Since everything is relative in chemistry one reactions nucleophile can be another reactions leaving group Some functional groups can only react as a nuclephile or electrophile while other functional groups can react as either a nuclephile or electrophile depending on the reaction conditions Classify the following compounds as nucleophiles electrophiles or leaving groups More than one answer may be possible a bromoethane b hydroxide c water d chlorocyclohexane e ethanol f bromide Answer a electrophile Alkyl halides are always electrophiles one reason they are an ochem students best friend b strong nucleophile c weak nucleophile and good leaving group d electrophile Alkyl halides are always electrophiles one reason they are an ochem students best friend e weak nucleophile a poor electrophile without clever chemistry stay tuned for future chapters good leaving group f good nucleophile and a good leaving group The SN mechanism There are two mechanistic models for how an alkyl halide can undergo nucleophilic substitution SN and SN The SN reaction takes place in a single step with bondforming and bondbreaking occurring simultaneously In all figures in this section X indicates a halogen substituent This is called an SN mechanism In the term SN S stands for substitution the subscript N stands for nucleophilic and the number refers to the fact that it is a bimolecular reaction the overall rate depends on a step in which two separate molecules the nucleophile and the electrophile collide A potential energy diagram for this reaction shows the transition state TS as the highest point on the pathway from reactants to products If you look carefully at the progress of the SN reaction you will realize something very important about the outcome The nucleophile being an electronrich species must react with the electrophilic carbon from the back side relative to the location of the leaving group Approach from the front side simply doesnt work the electron rich leaving group blocks the way with electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance The result of this backside penetration is that the stereochemical configuration at the central carbon inverts as the reaction proceeds In a sense the molecule is turned inside out At the transition state the electrophilic carbon and the three R substituents all lie on the same plane What this means is that SN reactions whether enzyme catalyzed or not are inherently stereoselective when the substitution takes place at a stereocenter we can confidently predict the stereochemical configuration of the product Below is an animation illustrating the principles we have just learned showing the SN reaction between hydroxide ion and methyl iodide Notice how backside attack by the hydroxide nucleophile results in inversion at the tetrahedral carbon electrophile Exercise Predict the structure of the product in this SN reaction Be sure to specify stereochemistry Solution SN Reactions Occur at sp Carbons with a Leaving Group One more important point must be made before continuing nucleophilic substitutions as a rule occur at sphybridized carbons bonded to a leaving group SN reactions cannot occur where the leaving group is attached to an sphybridized carbon Bonds on sphybridized carbons are inherently shorter and stronger than bonds on sphybridized carbons meaning that it is harder to break the CX bond in these substrates SN reactions of this type are unlikely also because the hypothetical electrophilic carbon is protected from nucleophilic attack by electron density in the p bond SN reactions are highly unlikely because the resulting carbocation intermediate which would be sphybridized would be very unstable well discuss the relative stability of carbocation intermediates in a later section of this module For future reference when discerning between substitution and elimination reactions evaluating the structure of the electrophile can eliminate possible products If the electrophilic carbon has no betahydrogens then only substitution reactions can occur and elimination reactions are not possible of course carbocation rearrangements may need to be considered The first four halides shown on the left below do not give elimination reactions on treatment with base because they have no βhydrogens The two halides on the right do not normally undergo such reactions because the potential elimination products have highly strained double or triple bonds It is also worth noting that sp hybridized CX compounds such as the three on the right do not normally undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions unless other functional groups perturb the double bonds Exercise Predict which alkyl halides can undergo a SN reaction a CHBr b CHCHCHBr c CHCHBr d CHCHCHCHBrCH Solutions a No aryl halide b Yes primary alkyl halide c No vinyl halide d Yes secondary alkyl halide SN Reaction Kinetics In the term SN the S stands for substitution the N stands for nucleophilic and the number two stands for bimolecular meaning there are two molecules involved in the rate determining step The rate of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions depends on the concentration of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile To understand how the rate depends on the concentrations of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile let us look at the following example The hydroxide ion is the nucleophile and methyl iodide is the haloalkane If we were to double the concentration of either the haloalkane or the nucleophile we can see that the rate of the reaction would proceed twice as fast as the initial rate If we were to double the concentration of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile we can see that the rate of the reaction would proceed four times as fast as the initial rate The bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction follows secondorder kinetics that is the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of two firstorder reactants In the case of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution these two reactants are the haloalkane and the nucleophile For further clarification on reaction kinetics the following links may facilitate your understanding of rate laws rate constants and secondorder kinetics Exercise The reaction below follows the SN mechanism a Write the rate law for this reaction b Determine the value of the rate coefficient k if the initial concentrations are M CHCl M NaOH and the initial reaction rate is x Ms c Calculate the initial reaction rate if the initial reactant concentrations are changed to M CHCl and M NaOH Solutions a rate k CHCl OH b substitute the data into the rate expression above and apply algebra to solve for k k x Lmols c Using the rate law

recognize and distinguish between the four major types of organic reactions additions eliminations substitutions and rearrangements Introduction If you scan any organic textbook you will encounter what appears to be a very large often intimidating number of reactions These are the tools of a chemist and to use these tools effectively we must organize them in a sensible manner and look for patterns of reactivity that permit us make plausible predictions Most of these reactions occur at special sites of reactivity known as functional groups and these constitute one organizational scheme that helps us catalog and remember reactions Ultimately the best way to achieve proficiency in organic chemistry is to understand how reactions take place and to recognize the various factors that influence their course First we identify four broad classes of reactions based solely on the structural change occurring in the reactant molecules This classification does not require knowledge or speculation concerning reaction paths or mechanisms The four main reaction classes are additions eliminations substitutions and rearrangements Addition Reaction Elimination Reaction Substitution Reaction Rearrangement Reaction In an addition reaction the number of σbonds in the substrate molecule increases usually at the expense of one or more πbonds The reverse is true of elimination reactions iethe number of σbonds in the substrate decreases and new πbonds are often formed Substitution reactions as the name implies are characterized by replacement of an atom or group Y by another atom or group Z Aside from these groups the number of bonds does not change A rearrangement reaction generates an isomer and again the number of bonds normally does not change The examples illustrated above involve simple alkyl and alkene systems but these reaction types are general for most functional groups including those incorporating carbonoxygen double bonds and carbonnitrogen double and triple bonds Some common reactions may actually be a combination of reaction types Example substitution Reaction The reaction of an ester with ammonia to give an amide as shown below appears to be a substitution reaction Y CHO Z NH however it is actually two reactions an addition followed by an elimination Example Addition reaction The addition of water to a nitrile does not seem to fit any of the above reaction types but it is simply a slow addition reaction followed by a rapid rearrangement as shown in the following equation Rapid rearrangements of this kind are called tautomerizations

Cracking is the name given to breaking up large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller and more useful bits This is achieved by using high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst The source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum These fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking The hydrocarbons are mixed with a very fine catalyst powder These days the catalysts are zeolites complex aluminosilicates these are more efficient than the older mixtures of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide The whole mixture is then blown rather like a liquid through a reaction chamber at a temperature of about C Because the mixture behaves like a liquid this is known as fluid catalytic cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking Although the mixture of gas and fine solid behaves as a liquid this is nevertheless an example of heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants The catalyst is recovered afterwards and the cracked mixture is separated by cooling and further fractional distillation There isnot any single unique reaction happening in the cracker The hydrocarbon molecules are broken up in a fairly random way to produce mixtures of smaller hydrocarbons some of which have carboncarbon double bonds One possible reaction involving the hydrocarbon CH might be Or showing more clearly what happens to the various

Occurrence The most important sources for alkanes are oil and natural gas Oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons Higher alkanes which are solid occur as residues from oil distillation tar One of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in an asphalt lake known as the Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago Natural gas contains primarily methane with some ethane propane and butane some gas sources deliver up to CO Traces of methane about or ppm occur in the Earths atmosphere the content in the oceans is negligible due to the low solubility of methane in water Use of Alkanes Alkanes are important raw materials of the chemical industry and the principal constituent of gasoline and lubricating oils Natural gas mainly contains methane and ethane and is used for heating and cooking purposes and for power utilities gas turbines For transportation purposes natural gas may be liquefied by applying pressure and cooling it LNG liqid natural gas The Sultanate of Oman for example exports most of its natural gas as LNG see the LNG plant at Qalhat which has been designed to liquefy million tons natural gas per year Crude oil is separated into its components by fractional distillation at oil refineries The different fractions of crude oil have different boiling points and consist mostly of alkanes of similar chain lengths the higher the boiling point the more carbon atoms the components of a particular fraction contain see the list of alkanes for details about the boiling points The following table provides a short survey of the different fractions of crude oil CC Propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are used for example in the propane gas burner or as propellants in aerosol sprays Butane in used in cigarette lighters where the pressure at room temperature is about bar CC The alkanes from pentane to octane are highly volatile liquids and good solvents for nonpolar substances They are used as fuels in internal combustion engines CC Alkanes from nonane to hexadecane are liquids of higher viscosity being used in diesel and aviation fuel kerosene The higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too viscous CC Alkanes with to carbon atoms form the major components of lubricating oil They also act as anticorrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature protects the metal surface from contact with water Solid alkanes also find use as paraffin wax in candles C Alkanes with a chain length above carbon atoms are found in bitumen as it is used in road surfacing These higher alkanes have little chemical and commercial value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking Notes Methane can cocrystallize with water at high pressures and low temperatures forming a solid methane hydrate The energy content of the known submarine methane hydrate fields exceeds that of all known natural gas and oil deposits put together

principles that brought order out of the confusion that existed as to the nature of organic compounds Before moving on to other matters it may be well to give you some ideas of what kind of preparation will be helpful to you in learning about organic chemistry from this textbook The most important thing you can bring is a strong desire to master the subject We hope you already have some knowledge of general chemistry and that you already will have had experience with simple inorganic compounds That you will know for example that elemental bromine is and a noxious dark redbrown corrosive liquid that sulfuric acid is a syrupy colorless liquid that reacts with water with the evolution of considerable heat and is a strong acid that sodium hydroxide is a colorless solid that dissolves in water to give a strongly alkaline solution It is important to know the characteristics of acids and bases how to write simple balanced chemical reactions such as and what the concept of a mole of a chemical substance is and to be somewhat familiar with the periodic table of the elements as well as with the metric system at least insofar as grams liters and degrees centigrade are concerned Among other things you also should understand the basic ideas of the differences between salts and covalent compounds as well as between gases liquids and solids what a solution is the laws of conservation of mass and energy the elements of how to derive the Lewis electron structures of simple molecules such as water that and how to calculate molecular formulas from percentage compositions and molecular weights We shall use no mathematics more advanced than simple algebra but we do expect that you can use logarithms and are able to carry through the following conversions forward and backward The above is an incomplete list given to illustrate the level of preparation we are presuming in this text If you find very much of this list partly or wholly unfamiliar you dont have to give up but have a good general chemistry textbook available for study and reference and use it Some useful general chemistry books are listed at the end of the chapter A fourplace table of logarithms will be necessary a set of ballandstick models and a chemical handbook will be very helpful as would be a small electronic calculator or slide rule to carry out the simple arithmetic required for many of the exercises In the next section we review some general chemistry regarding saltlike and covalent compounds that will be of special relevance to our later discussions

straightforward way to determine the structures of molecules would be to see how the nuclei are arranged and how the electrons are distributed This is not possible with visible light because the wavelengths of visible light are very much longer than the usual molecular dimensions A beam of electrons can have the requisite short wavelengths but small organic molecules are destroyed rapidly by irradiation with electrons of the proper wavelengths Nonetheless electron microscopy is a valuable technique for the study of large molecules such as DNA which can be stained with heavymetal atoms

Ltd Virtually all parts of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from x rays lo radio waves have some practical application for the study of organic molecules The use of xray diffraction for determination of the structures of molecules in crystals is of particular value and in the past ten years this technique has become almost routine Figure shows the detailed arrangement of the carbons hydrogens and bromines in bisbromomethylnaphthalene as determined by xray diffraction The apparatus and techniques used are highly complex and are not available yet to very many organic laboratories Other diffraction methods include electron diffraction which may be used todetermine the structures of gases or of volatile liquid substances that cannot be obtained as crystals suitable for xray diffraction and neutron diffraction which has special application for crystals in which the exact location of hydrogens is desired Hydrogen does not have sufficient scattering power for x rays to be located precisely by xray diffraction Figure Bond lengths angles and arrangement of carbons and bromines in a crystal of bisbromomethylnaphthalene as determined by xray diffraction Notice that the preferred conformation in the crystal has the bromines on opposite sides of the naphthalene ring The diffraction methods can be used to determine complete structures of organic molecules but they are not sufficiently routine to be utilized generally in practical organic laboratory work For this reason in the remainder of this chapter we will emphasize those forms of spectroscopy that are generally available for routine laboratory use As will be seen these methods are used by organic chemists in more or less empirical ways In general spectroscopic methods depend on some form of excitation of molecules by absorption of electromagnetic radiation and as we have said virtually all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have utility in this regard The commonly used span of the electromagnetic spectrum is shown in Figure along with a comparison of the various units that are employed to express energy or wavelength The major kinds of spectroscopy used for structural analysis of organic compounds are listed in Table The range of frequencies of the absorbed radiation are shown as well as the effect produced by the radiation and specific kind of information that is utilized in structural analysis After a brief account of the principles of spectroscopy we will describe the methods that are of greatest utility to practical laboratory work Nonetheless it is very important to be aware of the other less routine methods that can be used to solve special problems and some of these are discussed in this chapter and in Chapters and You may have problems with the relationships among the variety of wavelength and frequency units commonly used in spectroscopy The relationship between wavelength frequency and velocity should become clear to you by considering yourself standing on a pier watching ocean waves going by Assuming the waves are uniformly spaced there will be a uniform distance between the crests which is the wavelength The wave crests will pass by at a certain number per minute which is the frequency The velocity at which the crests move by you is related to and by the relationship This is not really very complicated and it applies equally well to water waves or electromagnetic radiation What is almost needlessly complicated is the variety of units commonly used to express and for electromagnetic radiation One problem is tradition the other is the desire to avoid very large or very small numbers Thus as Figure shows we may be interested in electromagnetic wavelengths that differ by as much as a factor of Because the velocity of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum is constant at the frequencies will differ by the same factor Figure The span of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation used in spectroscopic investigations of organic compounds along with comparison of some of the various units commonly employed for wavelength and energy of the radiation on log scales Units commonly used for wavelength are meters centimeters nanometers and microns In the past angstroms and millimicrons also were used rather widely Frequency units are in cycles per second cps or hertz which are equivalent radians per second are used widely by physicists Table Principal Spectroscopic Techniques Currently in Use for Analysis of Molecular Structure Frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum can be seen from Figure generally to be large As a result it is common to use wave numbers instead of or megahertz The frequency in wave number is simply the frequency in divided by the velocity of light in Wavenumber units are and we can think of the wave number as being the number of wave crests per centimeter A useful description of how molecular structures can be determined by xray vision is given in Chapter XI of Organic Molecules in

This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format Contributors and Attributions Let us consider some of the factors that make so much of chemistry center on a single element carbon One very important feature is that carboncarbon bonds are strong so long chains or rings of carbon atoms bonded to one another are possible Diamond and graphite are two familiar examples the diamond lattice being a threedimensional network of carbon atoms whereas graphite actually more closely resembles a planar network The lubricating properties of graphite actually are related to its structure which permits the planes to slide one past the other But carbon is not unique in forming bonds to itself because other elements such as boron silicon and phosphorus form strong bonds in the elementary state The uniqueness of carbon stems more from the fact that it forms strong carboncarbon bonds that also are strong when in combination with other elements For example the combination of hydrogen with carbon affords a remarkable variety of carbon hydrides or hydrocarbons as they usually are called In contrast none of the other secondrow elements except boron gives a very extensive system of stable hydrides and most of the boron hydrides are much more reactive than hydrocarbons especially to water and air Carbon forms bonds not only with itself and with hydrogen but also with many other elements including strongly electronattracting elements such as fluorine and strongly electropositive metals such as lithium Why is carbon so versatile in its ability to bond to very different kinds of elements The special properties of carbon can be attributed to its being a relatively small atom with four valence electrons To form simple saltlike compounds such as sodium chloride carbon would have to either lose the four valence electrons to an element such as fluorine and be converted to a quadripositive ion or acquire four electrons from an element such as lithium and form a quadrinegative ion Gain of four electrons would be energetically very unfavorable because of mutual repulsion between the electrons Customarily carbon completes its valenceshell octet by sharing electrons with other atoms In compounds with shared electron bonds or covalent bonds such as methane ethane or tetrafluoromethane each of the bonded atoms including carbon has its valence shell filled as shown in the following electronpair or Lewis structures In this way repulsions between electrons associated with completion of the valence shell of carbon are compensated by the electronattracting powers of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms to which the carbon is bonded However the electrons of a covalent bond are not necessarily shared equally by the bonded atoms especially when the affinities of the atoms for electrons are very different Thus carbonfluorine and carbonlithium bonds although they are not ionic are polarized such that the electrons are associated more with the atom of higher electron affinity This is usually the atom with the higher effective nuclear charge We see then a gradation from purely ionic to purely covalent bonding in different molecules and this is manifest in their chemical and physical properties Consider for instance the hydrides of the elements in the second horizontal row of the periodic table Their melting and boiling points where known are given below Lithium hydride can be regarded as a saltlike ionic compound Electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in the crystal lattice are strong thereby causing lithium hydride to be a highmelting nonvolatile solid like sodium chloride lithium fluoride and so on Methane is at the other extreme It boils at which is about lower even than the melting point of lithium hydride Because carbon and hydrogen have about the same electronattracting power bonds have little ionic character and methane may be characterized as a nonpolar substance As a result there is relatively little electrostatic attraction between methane molecules and this allows them to escape more easily from each other as gaseous molecules hence the low boiling point Hydrogen fluoride has a boiling point some higher than that of methane The bonding electron pair of is drawn more toward fluorine than to hydrogen so the bond may be formulated as In liquid hydrogen fluoride the molecules tend to aggregate through what is called hydrogen bonding in chains and rings arranged so the positive hydrogen on one molecule attracts a negative fluorine on the next When liquid hydrogen fluoride is vaporized the temperature must be raised sufficiently to overcome these intermolecular electrostatic attractions hence the boiling point is high compared to liquid methane Hydrogen fluoride is best characterized as a polar but not ionic substance Although the and bonds of water and ammonia have somewhat less ionic character than the bonds of hydrogen fluoride these substances also are relatively polar in nature and also associate through hydrogen bonding in the same way as does hydrogen fluoride The chemical properties of lithium hydride methane and hydrogen fluoride are in accord with the above formulations Thus when the bond to the hydrogen is broken we might expect it to break in the sense for lithium hydride and for hydrogen fluoride so that the electron pair goes with the atom of highest electron affinity This is indeed the case as the following reaction indicates Methane with its relatively nonpolar bonds is inert to almost all reagents that could remove hydrogen as or except under anything but extreme conditions As would be expected methyl cations and methyl anions are very difficult to generate and are extremely reactive For this reason the following reactions are not observed From the foregoing you may anticipate that the chemistry of carbon compounds will be largely the chemistry of covalent compounds and will not at all resemble the chemistry of inorganic salts such as sodium chloride You also may anticipate that the major differences in chemical and physical properties of organic compounds will arise from the nature of the other elements bonded to carbon Thus methane is not expected to nor does it have the same chemistry as other onecarbon compounds such as methyllithium or methyl fluoride G N Lewis the renowned US chemist was the first to grasp the significance of the electronpair in molecular structure He laid the foundation for modern theory of structure and bonding in his treatise on Valence and the Structure of Atoms and Molecules Throughout this text all

regiochemistry of elimination reactions Zaitsevs or Saytzevs anglicized spelling rule is an empirical rule used to predict regioselectivity of betaelimination reactions occurring via the E or E mechanisms It states that in a regioselective E or E reaction the major product is the more stable alkene with the more highly substituted double bond as shown in the example below If two or more structurally distinct groups of betahydrogens are present in a given reactant then several constitutionally isomeric alkenes may be formed by an E elimination This situation is illustrated by the bromobutane and bromodimethylbutane elimination examples given below By using the strongly basic hydroxide nucleophile we direct these reactions toward elimination In both cases there are two different sets of betahydrogens available to the elimination reaction these are colored red and magenta and the alpha carbon is blue If the rate of each possible elimination was the same we might expect the amounts of the isomeric elimination products to reflect the number of hydrogens that could participate in that reaction For example since there are three ºhydrogens red and two ºhydrogens magenta on betacarbons in bromobutane statistics would suggest a ratio of butene and butene in the products This is not observed and the latter predominates by This departure from statistical expectation is even more pronounced in the second example where there are six ºbetahydrogens compared with one ºhydrogen These results point to a strong regioselectivity favoring the more highly substituted product double bond an empirical statement generally called the Zaitsev Rule Exercise Ignoring the alkene stereochemistry show the elimination products of the following compounds Answer
