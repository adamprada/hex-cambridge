Acidity of Terminal Alkynes and Acetylilde Ion FormationContributors and Attributions Learning Objectives explain why alkynes are more acidic than alkanes and alkenes predict the products and specify the reagents to generate nucleophilic acetylide ions and heavy metal acetylides Acidity of Terminal Alkynes and Acetylilde Ion Formation Terminal alkynes are much more acidic than most other hydrocarbons Removal of the proton leads to the formation of an acetylide anion RCC The origin of the enhanced acidity can be attributed to the stability of the acetylide anion which has the unpaired electrons in an sp hybridized orbital The stability results from occupying an orbital with a high degree of sorbital character There is a strong correlation between scharacter in the orbital containing the nonbonding electrons in the anion and the acidity of hydrocarbons The enhanced acidity with greater scharacter occurs despite the fact that the homolytic CH BDE is larger Table Akynes Compound Conjugate Base Hybridization s Character pKa CH BDE kJmol CHCH CHCH sp CHCH CHCH sp HCCH HCC sp Consequently acetylide anions can be readily formed by deprotonation using a sufficiently strong base Amide anion NH in the form of NaNH is commonly used for the formation of acetylide anions Exercise Given that the pKa of water is would you expect hydroxide ion to be capable of removing a proton from each of the substances listed below Justify your answers briefly ethanol pKa acetic acid pKa acetylene pKa Answer Answers No The pKa of ethanol is similar to the pKa of water so proton exchange is comparable for both protonation and deprotonation between alcohols and water Alcohols can be considered alkylated water and share many similarities in both physical properties and chemical reactivity Yes very well There is a difference of pKa units between the pKa of water and the pKa of acetic acid The equilibrium lies well to the right with acetate as the predominate form of the original acetic acid No hardly at all The hydroxide ion is too weak a base to remove a proton from acetylene The equilibrium lies so far to the left that it is considered a No Reaction Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Prof Paul G Wenthold Purdue University
