A Carboxylic Esters B Carboxylic Anhydrides C Acyl Halides D Amides Contributors and Attributions The function is called an acyl group and in specific cases in named by adding the suffix oyl to the appropriate hydrocarbon prefix That is alkane oyl becomes alkanoyl Acyl groups also may be called alkanecarbonyl or cycloalkanecarbonyl groups When an acyl group replaces the hydrogen of alcohols carboxylic acids hydrogen halides ammonia or amines we have the acyl compounds known as esters anhydrides halides and amides respectively Each of these types of compounds are named as follows A Carboxylic Esters The name of the parent carboxylic acid alkanoic is changed to alkanoate and is preceded as in a separate word by the name of the ester alkyl group When appropriate esters also are named as carboxylates When it is necessary to name the function as a substituent it becomes alkoxycarbonyl Notice that this is structurally different from Notice the use of parentheses to separate the numbering of of the cyclohexane ring from the numbering of the chain It also may be necessary at times to name the group as a substituent in which case it becomes acyloxy or carbonyloxy For example B Carboxylic Anhydrides Symmetrical anhydrides are named after the parent acid unsymmetrical or mixed anhydrides cite each of the parent acids C Acyl Halides The acyl group and the halogen as halide are cited separately D Amides The suffix amide is appended to the name of the hydrocarbon corresponding to the carbon chain that includes the carbonyl group That is alkane amide alkanamide A onecarbon chain is a carboxamide When the amide nitrogen is substituted with lowerranking groups than the acyl group the substituents are designated as prefixes The letter N is used to show that the substitution is on nitrogen Names for amides as substituents include the following Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
