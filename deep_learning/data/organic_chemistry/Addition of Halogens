IntroductionElectrophilic addition mechanism consists of two stepsReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective predict the productsspecify the reagents for halogenation of alkenes Introduction As the halogen molecule for example Br approaches the double bond of an alkene electrons in the double bond repel electrons in the bromine molecule causing polarization of the halogen bond This interaction induces a dipole moment in the halogen molecule bond allowing one of the halogens to gain a partial positive charge and take the role of electrophile The nucleophilic pi electrons form a bond to the electrophilic halogen while the halogen molecular bond heterolytically breaks to release bromide as a leaving group The halogen addition is not regioselective but stereoselective Stereochemistry of this addition is analogous to the oxymercuration mechanism In this reaction a bromonium halogenium ion froms as the intermediate The bromonium ion formation stabilizes the positive charge and prevents carbocation rearrangement In the second step the bromide released from the first step takes the role of thenucleophile and reacts with the cyclic bromonium ion with back side orientation Therefore the stereochemistry of the product is a vicinial dihalides through antiaddition Halogens that are commonly used in this type of the reaction are Br and Cl In thermodynamical terms I is too slow for this reaction because of the size of its atom and F is too vigorous and explosive Solvents that are used for this type of electrophilic halogenation are inert eg CCl can be used in this reaction Because halogen with negative charge can attack any carbon from the opposite side of the cycle it creates a mixture of steric productsOptically inactive starting material produce optically inactive achiral products meso or a racemic mixture Electrophilic addition mechanism consists of two steps Before constructing the mechanism let us summarize conditions for this reaction We will use Br in our example for halogenation of ethylene Halogens can act as electrophiles due to polarizability of their covalent bond Addition of halogens is stereospecific and produces vicinial dihalides with antiaddition Cis starting materials will give a mixture of enantiomers and trans starting materials produce a meso compound Nucleophile pi electrons of alkene double bond Electrophile halogen Cl or Br Regiochemistry none Stereochemistry antiadditon Step The addition the BrBr bond polarizes heterolytic cleavage occurs and Br with the positive charge forms a intermediate cycle with the double bond Step The bromide anion reacts with either carbon of the bridged bromonium ion from the back side of the ring The ring opens up and the two halogens are in the antiposition relative to each other Exercise What is the mechanism of adding Cl to the cyclohexene A reaction of Br molecule in an inert solvent with alkene follows a syn addition b anti addition c Morkovnikov rule Predict the product of the product of dimethylcyclopentene reacting with Br with proper stereochemistry Predict the products for dimethylcyclpentene reacting with HCl give the proper stereochemistry What is the relationship between the two products Answer b enantiomer These compounds are enantiomers References VollhardKPeter C and Neil ESchoreOrganic ChemistryStructure and FunctionNew Yourk WHFreeman and Company ChemestryA Europian Journal Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Jim Clark Chemguidecouk
