Introduction LEARNING objective recognize acids or bases Introduction In the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius proposed two specific classifications of compounds termed acids and bases When dissolved in an aqueous solution certain ions were released into the solution As defined by Arrhenius acidbase reactions are characterized by acids which dissociate in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions H and bases which form hydroxide OH ions Arrhenius received the lowest passing score for his doctoral thesis with these innovative ideas about acids and bases Ten years later he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his insights Acids are defined as a compound or element that releases hydrogen H ions into the solution mainly water In this reaction nitric acid HNO disassociates into hydrogen H and nitrate NO ions when dissolved in water Bases are defined as a compound or element that releases hydroxide OH ions into the solution In this reaction lithium hydroxide dissociates into lithium and hydroxide ions when dissolved in water One way to define a class of compounds is by describing the various characteristics its members have in common In the case of the compounds known as acids the common characteristics include a sour taste the ability to change the color of the vegetable dye litmus to red and the ability to dissolve certain metals and simultaneously produce hydrogen gas For the compounds called bases the common characteristics are a slippery texture a bitter taste and the ability to change the color of litmus to blue Acids and bases also react with each other to form compounds generally known as salts Although we include their tastes among the common characteristics of acids and bases we never advocate tasting an unknown chemical Chemists prefer however to have definitions for acids and bases in chemical terms The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius developed the first chemical definitions of acids and bases in the late s Arrhenius defined an acid as a compound that increases the concentration of hydrogen ion H in aqueous solution Many acids are simple compounds that release a hydrogen cation into solution when they dissolve Similarly Arrhenius defined a base as a compound that increases the concentration of hydroxide ion OH in aqueous solution Many bases are ionic compounds that have the hydroxide ion as their anion which is released when the base dissolves in water Table Formulas and Names for Some Acids and Bases Acids Bases Formula Name Formula Name HClaq hydrochloric acid NaOHaq sodium hydroxide HBraq hydrobromic acid KOHaq potassium hydroxide HIaq hydriodic acid MgOHaq magnesium hydroxide HSaq hydrosulfuric acid CaOHaq calcium hydroxide HCHOaq acetic acid NHaq ammonia HNOaq nitric acid HNOaq nitrous acid HSOaq sulfuric acid HSOaq sulfurous acid HClOaq chloric acid HClOaq perchloric acid HClOaq chlorous acid HPOaq phosphoric acid HPOaq phosphorous acid Many bases and their aqueous solutions are named using the normal rules of ionic compounds that were presented previously that is they are named as hydroxide compounds For example the base sodium hydroxide NaOH is both an ionic compound and an aqueous solution However aqueous solutions of acids have their own naming rules The names of binary acids compounds with hydrogen and one other element in their formula are based on the root of the name of the other element preceded by the prefix hydro and followed by the suffix ic acid Thus an aqueous solution of HCl designated HClaq is called hydrochloric acid HSaq is called hydrosulfuric acid and so forth Acids composed of more than two elements typically hydrogen and oxygen and some other element have names based on the name of the other element followed by the suffix ic acid or ous acid depending on the number of oxygen atoms in the acids formula Other prefixes like per and hypo also appear in the names for some acids Unfortunately there is no strict rule for the number of oxygen atoms that are associated with the ic acid suffix the names of these acids are best memorized Table lists some acids and bases and their names Note that acids have hydrogen written first as if it were the cation while most bases have the negative hydroxide ion if it appears in the formula written last The name oxygen comes from the Latin meaning acid producer because its discoverer Antoine Lavoisier thought it was the essential element in acids Lavoisier was wrong but it is too late to change the name now Example Name each substance HFaq SrOHaq Solution This acid has only two elements in its formula so its name includes the hydro prefix The stem of the other elements name fluorine is fluor and we must also include the ic acid ending Its name is hydrofluoric acid This base is named as an ionic compound between the strontium ion and the hydroxide ion strontium hydroxide Exercise Name each substance HSeaq BaOHaq Notice that one base listed in Table ammoniadoes not have hydroxide as part of its formula How does this compound increase the amount of hydroxide ion in aqueous solution Instead of dissociating into hydroxide ions ammonia molecules react with water molecules by taking a hydrogen ion from the water molecule to produce an ammonium ion and a hydroxide ion Because this reaction of ammonia with water causes an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions in solution ammonia satisfies the Arrhenius definition of a base Many other nitrogencontaining compounds are bases because they too react with water to produce hydroxide ions in aqueous solution
