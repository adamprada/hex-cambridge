the atom Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below atomic number atomic weight electron mass number neutron proton The Nuclear Atom The precise physical nature of atoms finally emerged from a series of elegant experiments carried out between and The most notable of these achievements was Ernest Rutherfords famous alpharay scattering experiment which established that Almost all of the mass of an atom is contained within a tiny and therefore extremely dense nucleus which carries a positive electric charge whose value identifies each element and is known as the atomic number of the element Almost all of the volume of an atom consists of empty space in which electrons the fundamental carriers of negative electric charge reside The extremely small mass of the electron th the mass of the hydrogen nucleus causes it to behave as a quantum particle which means that its location at any moment cannot be specified the best we can do is describe its behavior in terms of the probability of its manifesting itself at any point in space It is common but somewhat misleading to describe the volume of space in which the electrons of an atom have a significant probability of being found as the electron cloud The latter has no definite outer boundary so neither does the atom The radius of an atom must be defined arbitrarily such as the boundary in which the electron can be found with probability Atomic radii are typically pm The nucleus is itself composed of two kinds of particles Protons are the carriers of positive electric charge in the nucleus the proton charge is exactly the same as the electron charge but of opposite sign This means that in any electrically neutral atom the number of protons in the nucleus often referred to as the nuclear charge is balanced by the same number of electrons outside the nucleus The other nuclear particle is the neutron As its name implies this particle carries no electrical charge Its mass is almost the same as that of the proton Most nuclei contain roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons so we can say that these two particles together account for almost all the mass of the atom Because the electrons of an atom are in contact with the outside world it is possible for one or more electrons to be lost or some new ones to be added The resulting electricallycharged atom is called an ion Atomic Number Z What single parameter uniquely characterizes the atom of a given element It is not the atoms relative mass as we will see in the section on isotopes below It is rather the number of protons in the nucleus which we call the atomic number and denote by the symbol Z Each proton carries an electric charge of so the atomic number also specifies the electric charge of the nucleus In the neutral atom the Z protons within the nucleus are balanced by Z electrons outside it Atomic numbers were first worked out in by Henry Moseley a young member of Rutherfords research group in Manchester Moseley searched for a measurable property of each element that increases linearly with atomic number He found this in a class of Xrays emitted by an element when it is bombarded with electrons The frequencies of these Xrays are unique to each element and they increase uniformly in successive elements Moseley found that the square roots of these frequencies give a straight line when plotted against Z this enabled him to sort the elements in order of increasing atomic number You can think of the atomic number as a kind of serial number of an element commencing at for hydrogen and increasing by one for each successive element The chemical name of the element and its symbol are uniquely tied to the atomic number thus the symbol Sr stands for strontium whose atoms all have Z Mass Number A The mass number equals the sum of the numbers of protons and the number of neutrons in the nucleus It is sometimes represented by the symbol so AZN in which is the atomic number and is the neutron number Elements To date about different elements have been discovered by definition each is chemically unique To understand why they are unique you need to understand the structure of the atom the fundamental individual particle of an element and the characteristics of its components Atoms consist of electrons protons and neutrons Although this is an oversimplification that ignores the other subatomic particles that have been discovered it is sufficient for discussion of chemical principles Some properties of these subatomic particles are summarized in Table which illustrates three important points Electrons and protons have electrical charges that are identical in magnitude but opposite in sign Relative charges of and are assigned to the electron and proton respectively Neutrons have approximately the same mass as protons but no charge They are electrically neutral The mass of a proton or a neutron is about times greater than the mass of an electron Protons and neutrons constitute the bulk of the mass of atoms The discovery of the electron and the proton was crucial to the development of the modern model of the atom and provides an excellent case study in the application of the scientific method In fact the elucidation of the atoms structure is one of the greatest detective stories in the history of science Table Properties of Subatomic Particles Particle Mass g Atomic Mass amu Electrical Charge coulombs Relative Charge electron proton neutron In most cases the symbols for the elements are derived directly from each elements name such as C for carbon U for uranium Ca for calcium and Po for polonium Elements have also been named for their properties such as radium Ra for its radioactivity for the native country of the scientists who discovered them polonium Po for Poland for eminent scientists curium Cm for the Curies for gods and goddesses selenium Se for the Greek goddess of the moon Selene and for other poetic or historical reasons Some of the symbols used for elements that have been known since antiquity are derived from historical names that are no longer in use only the symbols remain to indicate their origin Examples are Fe for iron from the Latin ferrum Na for sodium from the Latin natrium and W for tungsten from the German wolfram Examples are in Table Table Element Symbols Based on Names No Longer in Use Element Symbol Derivation Meaning antimony Sb stibium Latin for mark copper Cu cuprum from Cyprium Latin name for the island of Cyprus the major source of copper ore in the Roman Empire gold Au aurum Latin for gold iron Fe ferrum Latin for iron lead Pb plumbum Latin for heavy mercury Hg hydrargyrum Latin for liquid silver potassium K kalium from the Arabic alqili alkali silver Ag argentum Latin for silver sodium Na natrium Latin for sodium tin Sn stannum Latin for tin tungsten W wolfram German for wolf stone because it interfered with the smelting of tin and was thought to devour the tin Recall that the nuclei of most atoms contain neutrons as well as protons Unlike protons the number of neutrons is not absolutely fixed for most elements Atoms that have the same number of protons and hence the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes All isotopes of an element have the same number of protons and electrons which means they exhibit the same chemistry The isotopes of an element differ only in their atomic mass which is given by the mass number A the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons Carbon Isotopes The element carbon C has an atomic number of which means that all neutral carbon atoms contain protons and electrons In a typical sample of carboncontaining material of the carbon atoms also contain neutrons so each has a mass number of An isotope of any element can be uniquely represented as where X is the atomic symbol of the element The isotope of carbon that has neutrons is therefore The subscript indicating the atomic number is actually redundant because the atomic symbol already uniquely specifies Z Consequently is more often written as C which is read as carbon Nevertheless the value of Z is commonly included in the notation for nuclear reactions because these reactions involve changes in Z Figure Formalism used for identifying specific nuclide any particular kind of nucleus In addition to a typical sample of carbon contains C with neutrons and protons and a trace of C with neutrons and protons The nucleus of C is not stable however but undergoes a slow radioactive decay that is the basis of the carbon dating technique used in archaeology Many elements other than carbon have more than one stable isotope tin for example has isotopes The properties of some common isotopes are in Table

element contains the same number of protons which is the atomic number Z Neutral atoms have the same number of electrons and protons Atoms of an element that contain different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes Each isotope of a given element has the same atomic number but a different mass number A which is the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons The relative masses of atoms are
