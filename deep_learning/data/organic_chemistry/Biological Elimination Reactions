Enzymatic E and E reactions Learning Objective discuss enzymatic elimination reactions of histidine Enzymatic E and E reactions While most biochemical belimination reactions are of the Ecb type some enzymatic E and E reactions are known Like the enzymatic SN and SN substitution mechanisms discussed in chapters and the E and E models represent two possible mechanistic extremes and actual enzymatic elimination reactions may fall somewhere in between In an EE hybrid elimination for example CβX bond cleavage may be quite advanced but not complete before proton abstraction takes place this would lead to the buildup of transient partial positive charge on Cβ but a discreet carbocation intermediate would not form The extent to which partial positive charge builds up determines whether we refer to the mechanism as Elike or Elike A reaction in the histidine biosynthetic pathway provides a good example of a biological Elike elimination step were looking specifically here at the first enolforming step in the reaction below the second step is simply a tautomerization from the enol to the ketone product Notice in this mechanism that an Ecb elimination is not possible there is no electronwithdrawing group like a carbonyl to stabilize the carbanion intermediate that would form if the proton were abstracted first There is however an electrondonating group the lone pair on a nitrogen that can stabilize a positivelycharged intermediate that forms when the water leaves Another good example of a biological Elike reaction is the elimination of phosphate in the formation of enolpyruvylshikimatephosphate EPSP an intermediate in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids Experimental evidence indicates that significant positive charge probably builds up on Cβ of the starting compound implying that CO bond cleavage is advanced before proton abstraction occurs notice the parallels to the Cope elimination in the previous section The very next step in the aromatic acid biosynthesis pathway is also an elimination this time a conjugated elimination rather than a simple betaelimination An Elike mechanism as illustrated above has been proposed for this step but other evidence suggests that a freeradical mechanism may be involved While most E and E reactions involve proton abstraction eliminations can also incorporate a decarboxylation step Isopentenyl diphosphate the building block for all isoprenoid compounds is formed from a decarboxylationelimination reaction Phenylpyruvate a precursor in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine results from a conjugated decarboxylationelimination Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
