The BrønstedLowry Theory of Acids and BasesConjugate AcidBase PairContributors and Attributions learning objective recognize acids and bases The BrønstedLowry Theory of Acids and Bases In Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted and English chemist Thomas Lowry independently proposed new definitions for acids and bases ones that focus on proton transfer A BrønstedLowry acid is any species that can donate a proton H to another molecule A BrønstedLowry base is any species that can accept a proton from another molecule In short a BrønstedLowry acid is a proton donor PD while a BrønstedLowry base is a proton acceptor PA A BrønstedLowry acid is a proton donor while a BrønstedLowry base is a proton acceptor Let us use the reaction of ammonia in water to demonstrate the BrønstedLowry definitions of an acid and a base Ammonia and water molecules are reactants while the ammonium ion and the hydroxide ion are products What has happened in this reaction is that the original water molecule has donated a hydrogen ion to the original ammonia molecule which in turn has accepted the hydrogen ion We can illustrate this as follows Because the water molecule donates a hydrogen ion to the ammonia it is the BrønstedLowry acid while the ammonia moleculewhich accepts the hydrogen ionis the BrønstedLowry base Thus ammonia acts as a base in both the Arrhenius sense and the BrønstedLowry sense Is an Arrhenius acid like hydrochloric acid still an acid in the BrønstedLowry sense Yes but it requires us to understand what really happens when HCl is dissolved in water Recall that the hydrogen atom is a single proton surrounded by a single electron To make the hydrogen ion we remove the electron leaving a bare proton Do we really have bare protons floating around in aqueous solution No we do not What really happens is that the H ion attaches itself to HO to make HO which is called the hydronium ion For most purposes H and HO represent the same species but writing HO instead of H shows that we understand that there are no bare protons floating around in solution Rather these protons are actually attached to solvent molecules The Hydronium IOn A proton in aqueous solution may be surrounded by more than one water molecule leading to formulas like or rather than It is simpler however to use to represent the hydronium ion With this in mind how do we define HCl as an acid in the BrønstedLowry sense Consider what happens when HCl is dissolved in HO We can depict this process using Lewis electron dot diagrams Now we see that a hydrogen ion is transferred from the HCl molecule to the HO molecule to make chloride ions and hydronium ions As the hydrogen ion donor HCl acts as a BrønstedLowry acid as a hydrogen ion acceptor HO is a BrønstedLowry base So HCl is an acid not just in the Arrhenius sense but also in the BrønstedLowry sense Moreover by the BrønstedLowry definitions HO is a base in the formation of aqueous HCl So the BrønstedLowry definitions of an acid and a base classify the dissolving of HCl in water as a reaction between an acid and a basealthough the Arrhenius definition would not have labeled HO a base in this circumstance A BrønstedLowry acid is a proton hydrogen ion donor A BrønstedLowry base is a proton hydrogen ion acceptor All Arrhenius acids and bases are BrønstedLowry acids and bases as well However not all BrønstedLowry acids and bases are Arrhenius acids and bases Example Aniline CHNH is slightly soluble in water It has a nitrogen atom that can accept a hydrogen ion from a water molecule just like the nitrogen atom in ammonia does Write the chemical equation for this reaction and identify the BrønstedLowry acid and base Solution CHNH and HO are the reactants When CHNH accepts a proton from HO it gains an extra H and a positive charge and leaves an OH ion behind The reaction is as follows Because CHNH accepts a proton it is the BrønstedLowry base The HO molecule because it donates a proton is the BrønstedLowry acid Exercise Identify the BrønstedLowry acid and the BrønstedLowry base in this chemical equation Answer BrønstedLowry acid HPO BrønstedLowry base HO Exercise Which of the following compounds is a BronstedLowry base HCl HPO HPO NH CHNH Answer A BrønstedLowry Base is a proton acceptor which means it will take in an H This eliminates and because they are BronstedLowry acids They all give away protons In the case of consider the following equation Here it is clear that HPO is the acid since it donates a proton to water to make HO and PO Now consider the following equation In this case HPO is the base since it accepts a proton from water to form HPO and OH Thus HPO is an acid and base together making it amphoteric Since HPO is the only compound from the options that can act as a base the answer is b HPO Conjugate AcidBase Pair In reality all acidbase reactions involve the transfer of protons between acids and bases For example consider the acidbase reaction that takes place when ammonia is dissolved in water A water molecule functioning as an acid transfers a proton to an ammonia molecule functioning as a base yielding the conjugate base of water and the conjugate acid of ammonia In the reaction of ammonia with water to give ammonium ions and hydroxide ions ammonia acts as a base by accepting a proton from a water molecule which in this case means that water is acting as an acid In the reverse reaction an ammonium ion acts as an acid by donating a proton to a hydroxide ion and the hydroxide ion acts as a base The conjugate acidbase pairs for this reaction are and Figure The strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at the top right The conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong base is a very weak acid Figure The Relative Strengths of Some Common Conjugate AcidBase Pairs The strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at the top right The conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong base is a very weak acid Example Identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium Solution Similarly in the reaction of acetic acid with water acetic acid donates a proton to water which acts as the base In the reverse reaction is the acid that donates a proton to the acetate ion which acts as the base Once again we have two conjugate acidbase pairs the parent acid and its conjugate base and the parent base and its conjugate acid Example Identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium Solution One pair is HO and OH where HO has one more H and is the conjugate acid while OH has one less H and is the conjugate base The other pair consists of CHN and CHNH where CHNH is the conjugate acid it has an additional proton and CHN is the conjugate base Exercise Identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium Answer HO acid and OH base NH base and NH acid Contributors and Attributions Marisa
