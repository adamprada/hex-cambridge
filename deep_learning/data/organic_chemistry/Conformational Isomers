Contributors and Attributions When using ballandstick models if one allows the sticks to rotate in the holes it will be found that for ethane an infinite number of different atomic orientations are possible depending on the angular relationship the socalled torsional angle between the hydrogens on each carbon Two extreme orientations or conformations are shown in Figure In endon views of the models the eclipsed conformation is seen to have the hydrogens on the forward carbon directly in front of those on the back carbon The staggered conformation has each of the hydrogens on the forward carbon set between each of the hydrogens on the back carbon It has not been possible to obtain separate samples of ethane that correspond to these or intermediate orientations because actual ethane molecules appear to have essentially free rotation about the single bond joining the carbons Free or at least rapid rotation is possible around all single bonds except when the carbons are part of a ring as in cyclopropane or cyclohexane Figure Two rotational conformations of ethane For ethane and its derivatives the staggered conformations are more stable than the eclipsed conformations The reason for this in ethane is not wholly clear but doubtless depends on the fact that in the staggered conformation the bonding electrons are as far away from one another as possible and give the least interelectronic repulsion With groups larger than hydrogen atoms substituted on ethane carbons spacefilling models usually show less interference steric hindrance for staggered conformations than for eclipsed conformations Figure Potentialenergy curve for rotation about the bond in ethane The energy difference between eclipsed and staggered ethane is approximately This is shown in Figure as the height of the peaks eclipsed forms separating the valleys staggered forms on a curve showing the potential energy of ethane as the methyl groups rotate with respect to each other through Rotation then is not strictly free because there is a energy barrier to overcome on eclipsing the hydrogens Even so the barrier is low enough that rotation is very rapid at room temperature occurring on the order of times per second Figure Six rotational conformations about the bond of butane The forward groups are shown here as rotating counterclockwise with respect to the rear groups In butane a rotation about the central bond allows the molecule to pass through three different eclipsed arrangements and three different staggered arrangements as shown in Figure Experiment shows that butane favors the staggered form in which the methyl groups are farthest apart This form is called the anti or trans conformation sometimes conformer and of the molecules of butane exist in this form at room temperature The other two staggered forms and are called gauche syn or skew conformations and have a torsional angle of between the two methyl groups Forms and actually are nonidentical mirror images but bond rotation is so rapid that the separate enantiomeric conformations cannot be isolated The populations of the two gauche forms are equal at room temperature of each so any optical rotation caused by one form is exactly canceled by an opposite rotation caused by the other Figure Conformational energies and rotational barriers in butane the difference in energy between the anti and gauche forms is The energies are relative to conformation as zero The populations of the eclipsed forms of butane like the eclipsed forms of ethane are small and represent energy maxima for the molecule as rotation occurs about the central bond The energy differences between the butane conformations are represented diagrammatically in Figure The valleys correspond to staggered forms and the energy difference between the anti and gauche forms is Pioneering work in the field of conformational analysis was contributed by O Hassel Norway and D R H Barton Britain for which they shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry in Hassels work involved the physical determination of preferred conformations of small molecules whereas Barton was the first to show the general importance of conformation to chemical reactivity Study of conformations and conformational equilibria has direct application to explaining the extraordinary specificity exhibited by compounds of biological importance The compounds of living systems are tailormade to perform highly specific or even unique functions by virtue of their particular configurations and conformations This is by no means a trivial amount of energy the difference in energy between the staggered and eclipsed forms of of ethane being enough to heat of water from to Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic
