Diastereomers are stereoisomers with two or more chiral centers that are not enantiomers Diastereomers have different physical properties melting points boiling points and densities Depending on the reaction mechanism diastereomers can produce different stereochemical products Introduction So far we have been analyzing compounds with a single chiral center Next we turn our attention to those which have multiple chiral centers Well start with some stereoisomeric fourcarbon sugars with two chiral centers To avoid confusion we will simply refer to the different stereoisomers by capital letters Look first at compound A below Both chiral centers in have the R configuration you should confirm this for yourself The mirror image of Compound A is compound B which has the S configuration at both chiral centers If we were to pick up compound A flip it over and put it next to compound B we would see that they are not superimposable again confirm this for yourself with your models A and B are nonsuperimposable mirror images in other words enantiomers Now look at compound C in which the configuration is S at chiral center and R at chiral center Compounds A and C are stereoisomers they have the same molecular formula and the same bond connectivity but a different arrangement of atoms in space recall that this is the definition of the term stereoisomer However they are not mirror images of each other confirm this with your models and so they are not enantiomers By definition they are diastereomers of each other Notice that compounds C and B also have a diastereomeric relationship by the same definition So compounds A and B are a pair of enantiomers and compound C is a diastereomer of both of them Does compound C have its own enantiomer Compound D is the mirror image of compound C and the two are not superimposable Therefore C and D are a pair of enantiomers Compound D is also a diastereomer of compounds A and B This can also seem very confusing at first but there some simple shortcuts to analyzing stereoisomers Stereoisomer shortcuts If all of the chiral centers are of opposite RS configuration between two stereoisomers they are enantiomers If at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite between two stereoisomers they are diastereomers Note these shortcuts to not take into account the possibility of additional stereoisomers due to alkene groups we will come to that later Heres another way of looking at the four stereoisomers where one chiral center is associated with red and the other blue Pairs of enantiomers are stacked together We know using the shortcut above that the enantiomer of RR must be SS both chiral centers are different We also know that RS and SR are diastereomers of RR because in each case one but not both chiral centers are different Diastereomers vs Enantiomers in Wine Chemistry Tartaric acid CHO is an organic compound that can be found in grape bananas and in wine The structures of tartaric acid itself is really interesting Naturally it is in the form of RR stereocenters Artificially it can be in the meso form RS which is achiral RR tartaric acid is enantiomer to is mirror image which is SS tartaric acid and diasteromers to mesotartaric acid Figure RR and SS tartaric acid have similar physical properties and reactivity However mesotartaric acid have different physical properties and reactivity For example melting point of RR SS tartaric is about degree Celsius and melting point of mesotartaric acid is about degree Celsius Diastereomers vs Enantiomers in Sugar Chemistry Derythrose is a common fourcarbon sugar A note on sugar nomenclature biochemists use a special system to refer to the stereochemistry of sugar molecules employing names of historical origin in addition to the designators D and L You will learn about this system if you take a biochemistry class We will use the DL designations here to refer to different sugars but we wont worry about learning the system As you can see Derythrose is a chiral molecule C and C are stereocenters both of which have the R configuration In addition you should make a model to convince yourself that it is impossible to find a plane of symmetry through the molecule regardless of the conformation Does Derythrose have an enantiomer Of course it does if it is a chiral molecule it must The enantiomer of erythrose is its mirror image and is named Lerythrose once again you should use models to convince yourself that these mirror images of erythrose are not superimposable Notice that both chiral centers in Lerythrose both have the S configuration Note In a pair of enantiomers all of the chiral centers are of the opposite configuration What happens if we draw a stereoisomer of erythrose in which the configuration is S at C and R at C This stereoisomer which is a sugar called Dthreose is not a mirror image of erythrose Dthreose is a diastereomer of both Derythrose and Lerythrose The definition of diastereomers is simple if two molecules are stereoisomers same molecular formula same connectivity different arrangement of atoms in space but are not enantiomers then they are diastereomers by default In practical terms this means that at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite in a pair of diastereomers By definition two molecules that are diastereomers are not mirror images of each other Lthreose the enantiomer of Dthreose has the R configuration at C and the S configuration at C Lthreose is a diastereomer of both erythrose enantiomers Erythronolide B a precursor to the macrocyclic antibiotic erythromycin has stereocenters Its enantiomer is that molecule in which all stereocenters are inverted In total there are stereoisomers in the erythronolide B family of these are diastereomers of the structure above one is the enantiomer of the structure above and the last is the structure above We know that enantiomers have identical physical properties and equal but opposite degrees of specific rotation Diastereomers in theory at least have different physical properties we stipulate in theory because sometimes the physical properties of two or more diastereomers are so similar that it is very difficult to separate them In addition the specific rotations of diastereomers are unrelated they could be the same sign or opposite signs and similar in magnitude or very dissimilar Exercises Draw the structures of Lgalactose the enantiomer of Dgalactose and two more diastereomers of Dglucose one should be an epimer Determine the stereochemistry of the following molecule Answer
