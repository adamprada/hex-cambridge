section you should be able to propose one or more acceptable Kekulé structures structural formulas for any given molecular formula write the molecular formula of a compound given its Kekulé structure draw the shorthand structure of a compound given its Kekulé structure interpret shorthand structures and convert them to Kekulé structures write the molecular formula of a compound given its shorthand structure Study Notes When drawing the structure of a neutral organic compound you will find it helpful to remember that each carbon atom has four bonds each nitrogen atom has three bonds each oxygen atom has two bonds each hydrogen atom has one bond Through general chemistry you may have already experienced looking at molecular structures using Lewis structures Because organic chemistry can involve large molecules it would be beneficial if Lewis structures could be abbreviated The three different ways to draw organic molecules include Kekulé Formulas Condensed Formulas and Skeletal structures also called linebond strutures or line formulas During this course you will view molecules written in all three forms It will be more helpful if you become comfortable going from one style of drawing to another and look at drawings and understanding what they represent Developing the ability to convert between different types of formulas requires practice and in most cases the aid of molecular models Many kinds of model kits are available to students and professional chemists and the beginning student is encouraged to obtain one Simplification of structural formulas may be achieved without any loss of the information they convey Kekule formulas is just organic chemistrys term for Lewis structures you have previously encountered In condensed structural formulas the bonds to each carbon are omitted but each distinct structural unit group is written with subscript numbers designating multiple substituents including the hydrogens Line formulas omit the symbols for carbon and hydrogen entirely unless the hydrogen is bonded to an atom other than carbon Each straight line segment represents a bond the ends and intersections of the lines are carbon atoms and the correct number of hydrogens is calculated from the tetravalency of carbon Nonbonding valence shell electrons are omitted in these formulas Kekulé aka Lewis Structures A Kekulé Formula or structural formula displays the atoms of the molecule in the order they are bonded It also depicts how the atoms are bonded to one another for example single double and triple covalent bond Covalent bonds are shown using lines The number of dashes indicate whether the bond is a single double or triple covalent bond All atom labels are shown and all lone pairs are shown A BC Condensed Formula A condensed formula is made up of the elemental symbols Condensed structural formulas show the order of atoms like a structural formula but are written in a single line to save space and make it more convenient and faster to write out The order of the atoms suggests the connectivity in the molecule Condensed structural formulas are also helpful when showing that a group of atoms is connected to a single atom in a compound When this happens parenthesis are used around the group of atoms to show they are together Also if more than one of the same substituent is attached to a given atom it is show with a subscript number An example is CH which represents four hydrogens attached to the same carbon Condensed formulas can be read from either direction and HC is the same as CH although the latter is more common Look at the examples below and match them with their identical molecule under the Kekulé structures and the line formulas A CHCHOH B ClCHCHCHOCHCH C HCNHCHCOOH Lets look closely at example B As you go through a condensed formula you want to focus on the carbons and other elements that arent hydrogen The hydrogens are important but are usually there to complete octets Also notice the OCH is in written in parentheses which tell you that it not part of the main chain of carbons As you read through a a condensed formula if you reach an atom that doesnt have a complete octet by the time you reach the next hydrogen then its possible that there are double or triple bonds In example C the carbon is double bonded to oxygen and single bonded to another oxygen Notice how COOH means COOH instead of CHCOOH because carbon does not have a complete octet and oxygens Line Formula Because organic compounds can be complex at times lineangle formulas are used to write carbon and hydrogen atoms more efficiently by replacing the letter C with lines A carbon atom is present wherever a line intersects another line Hydrogen atoms are omitted but are assumed to be present to complete each of carbons four bonds Hydrogens that are attached to elements other than carbon are shown Atom labels for all other elements are shown Lone pair electrons are usually omitted They are assumed to be present to complete the octet of noncarbon atoms Line formulas help show the structure and order of the atoms in a compound A B C These molecules correspond to the exact same molecules depicted for Kekulé structures and condensed formulas Notice how the carbons are no longer drawn in and are replaced by the ends and bends of a lines In addition the hydrogens have been omitted but could be easily drawn in see practice problems Although we do not usually draw in the Hs that are bonded to carbon we do draw them in if they are connected to other atoms besides carbon example is the OH group above in example A This is done because it is not always clear if the noncarbon atom is surrounded by lone pairs or hydrogens Also in example A notice how the OH is drawn with a bond to the second carbon but it does not mean that there is a third carbon at the end of that bond line Kekulé Formula Condensed Formula Line Formula Table Structural Formulas for CHO isomers Example Converting between Structural Formulas It is helpful to convert compounds into different structural formulas Kekule Line and Condensed depending on the type of question that is asked Standardized exams frequently include a high percentage of condensed formulas because it is easier and cheaper to type letters and numbers than to import figures Initially it can be difficult writing a Line structure directly from a condensed formula First write the Kekule structure from the condensed formula and then draw the Line structure from the Kekule a The condensed formula for propanal is CHCHCHO Draw the Kekule structure The Kekule structure for propanal is shown below Remember that every carbon will have four bonds and oxygens octet is filled with lone pairs The bondline structure for propanal is shown below First remove hydrogens The hydrogen attached to the aldehyde group remains because it is part of a functional group The remove the C lables from the structure and keep the lines in place Lastly remove any lone pairs All three structures represent the same compound propanal b The following is the line structure of the molecule trimethyl amine To convert it to a Kekule structure first identify the carbons in the molecule The will be at the corners and ends of line without an atom label Trimethyl amine has three carbons Next add hydrogens to the carbons until four bonds are present Each carbon in trimethyl amine is singly bonded to nitrogen This means each carbon will need three additional CH bonds to create its octet Lastly add lone pairs to other elements to fill their octets The nitrogen in trimethyl amine is bonded to three carbons This means it will require one of lone pair electrons to complete its octet Exercises How many carbons are in the following drawing How many
