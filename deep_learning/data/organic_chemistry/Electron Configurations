Kekule Condensed and Bondline Structures Note The review of general chemistry in sections is integrated into the above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and The electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells Commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Introduction Before assigning the electrons of an atom into orbitals one must become familiar with the basic concepts of electron configurations Every element on the Periodic Table consists of atoms which are composed of protons neutrons and electrons Electrons exhibit a negative charge and are found around the nucleus of the atom in electron orbitals defined as the volume of space in which the electron can be found within probability The four different types of orbitals spd and f have different shapes and one orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons The p d and f orbitals have different sublevels thus can hold more electrons As stated the electron configuration of each element is unique to its position on the periodic table The energy level is determined by the period and the number of electrons is given by the atomic number of the element Orbitals on different energy levels are similar to each other but they occupy different areas in space The s orbital and s orbital both have the characteristics of an s orbital radial nodes spherical volume probabilities can only hold two electrons etc but as they are found in different energy levels they occupy different spaces around the nucleus Each orbital can be represented by specific blocks on the periodic table The sblock is the region of the alkali metals including helium Groups the dblock are the transition metals Groups to the pblock are the main group elements from Groups to and the fblock are the lanthanides and actinides series Using the periodic table to determine the electron configurations of atoms is key but also keep in mind that there are certain rules to follow when assigning electrons to different orbitals The periodic table is an incredibly helpful tool in writing electron configurations For more information on how electron configurations and the periodic table are linked visit the Connecting Electrons to the Periodic Table module Rules for Assigning Electron Orbitals Occupation of Orbitals Electrons fill orbitals in a way to minimize the energy of the atom Therefore the electrons in an atom fill the principal energy levels in order of increasing energy the electrons are getting farther from the nucleus The order of levels filled looks like this s s p s p s d p s d p s f d p s f d and p One way to remember this pattern probably the easiest is to refer to the periodic table and remember where each orbital block falls to logically deduce this pattern Another way is to make a table like the one below and use vertical lines to determine which subshells correspond with each other Pauli Exclusion Principle The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers The first three n l and ml may be the same but the fourth quantum number must be different A single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons which must have opposing spins otherwise they would have the same four quantum numbers which is forbidden One electron is spin up ms and the other would spin down ms This tells us that each subshell has double the electrons per orbital The s subshell has orbital that can hold up to electrons the p subshell has orbitals that can hold up to electrons the d subshell has orbitals that hold up to electrons and the f subshell has orbitals with electrons Example Hydrogen and Helium The first three quantum numbers of an electron are n l ml Only two electrons can correspond to these which would be either ms or ms As we already know from our studies of quantum numbers and electron orbitals we can conclude that these four quantum numbers refer to the s subshell If only one of the ms values are given then we would have s denoting hydrogen if both are given we would have s denoting helium Visually this is be represented as As shown the s subshell can hold only two electrons and when filled the electrons have opposite spins Hunds Rule When assigning electrons in orbitals each electron will first fill all the orbitals with similar energy also referred to as degenerate before pairing with another electron in a halffilled orbital Atoms at ground states tend to have as many unpaired electrons as possible When visualizing this processes think about how electrons are exhibiting the same behavior as the same poles on a magnet would if they came into contact as the negatively charged electrons fill orbitals they first try to get as far as possible from each other before having to pair up Example Oxygen and Nitrogen If we look at the correct electron configuration of the Nitrogen Z atom a very important element in the biology of plants s s p We can clearly see that p orbitals are halffilled as there are three electrons and three p orbitals This is because Hunds Rule states that the three electrons in the p subshell will fill all the empty orbitals first before filling orbitals with electrons in them If we look at the element after Nitrogen in the same period Oxygen Z its electron configuration is s s p for an atom Oxygen has one more electron than Nitrogen and as the orbitals are all half filled the electron must pair up The Aufbau Process Aufbau comes from the German word aufbauen meaning to build When writing electron configurations orbitals are built up from atom to atom When writing the electron configuration for an atom orbitals are filled in order of increasing atomic number However there are some exceptions to this rule Example rd row elements Following the pattern across a period from B Z to Ne Z the number of electrons increases and the subshells are filled This example focuses on the p subshell which fills from boron to neon B Z configuration s s p C Z configurations s p N Z configurations s p O Z configurations s p F Z configurations s p Ne Z configurations s p Example The electron configuration for sulfur is s s p s p and can be represented using the orbital diagram below Exercises Write the electron configuration for phosphorus and draw the orbital diagram Solution The electron configuration for phosphorus is s s p s p and the orbital diagram is drawn below
