A General CharacteristicsB Effects of Conjugation on Electronic SpectraC Applications of Electronic SpectroscopyReferences A General Characteristics A year after Herschel discovered infrared radiation Johann Ritter discovered radiation beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum This radiation came to be known as ultraviolet and soon was recognized as being especially effective in causing chemical reactions Absorption of light in the ultraviolet and visible regions produces changes in the electronic energies of molecules associated with excitation of an electron from a stable to an unstable orbital Because the energy required to excite the valenceshell electrons of molecules is comparable to the strengths of chemical bonds absorption may lead to chemical reactions We discussed this briefly in Chapter in connection with photochemical halogenation of alkanes a more detailed account of photochemistry is given in Chapter Figure Schematic representation of electronic vibrational and rotational energy levels The vertical scale is greatly distorted rotational energy levels are normally apart vibrational energy levels are apart while electronic transitions involve The transition of an electron from the ground state to an excited electronic state is accompanied by vibrational and rotational changes in the molecule as shown in Figure In condense phase samples it usually is not possible to resolve the resulting absorption bands well enough to see the fine structure due to vibrationrotation transitions Consequently absorptions due to electronic excitation are relatively broad Figure The ultraviolet spectrum of propanone acetone in cyclohexane The ultraviolet spectrum of propanone acetone is shown in Figure The weak absorption which peaks ie has at is the result of excitation of one of the unshared electrons on oxygen to a higher energy level This is called an often transition in which denotes that the excited electron is one of the unshared electrons on oxygen and pi star denotes that the excited electron goes to a highenergy antibonding orbital of the carbonoxygen double bond cf Sections and C The same kind of n rightarrow pi transition occurs at about the same wavelength and intensity for many simple compounds of the type and in which is an alkyl group In a very schematic way we can write There also is an absorption of propanone with at the maximum is not shown in Figure which is a different kind of excitation This is ascribed to raising an electron in the bonding orbital Section C of the carbonoxygen double bond to the orbital Such transitions are called and occur generally for substances with double bonds Table lists the wavelengths of maximum absorption for some typical electronic absorption bands of simple molecules If we remember that absorptions at longer wavelengths correspond to less energetic transition it can be deduced from the values that less energy is required to excite unshared nonbonding electrons than electrons in double or triple bonds which in turn require less energy than electrons in single bonds Figure Figure Sequence of electronic orbital energies showing different kinds of transitions in approximate order of increasing energy left to right The and transitions usually have low transition probabilities meaning the bands have low or zero intensities B Effects of Conjugation on Electronic Spectra The transition for ethene has and It would be expected that an alkadiene would give an absorption spectrum similar to that of ethene but with a larger because there are more double bonds per mole to absorb radiation This expectation is more or less realized for compounds such as hexadiene and dimethylenecyclobutane which have isolated double bonds but not for butadiene or ethenylbenzene which have conjugated double bonds Section In general conjugated systems of double bonds absorb radiation of longer wavelengths and with greater intensity than corresponding systems of isolated double bonds This means that the difference in energy between the normal and excited states of conjugated systems is less than for isolated systems of double bonds For butadiene and hexadiene we can calculate from Equation that the transition energy is about less for the conjugated system The ground state of butadiene is stabilized by perhaps relative to a nonconjugated system of double bonds which means that the excited state must be much more stabilized than this if the transition energy is to be less than for hexadiene Why is the excited state of a conjugated system of double bonds stabilized more relative to the ground state than for a nonconjugated system Resonance theory provides an explanation see Section Of the several conventional valencebond structures that can be written for butadiene four of which are shown here only structure has a low enough energy to be dominant for the ground state of butadiene Now when the molecule is excited to the extent of by ultraviolet light its energy is so large that pairing schemes such as and which are too unfavorable to contribute very much to the ground state can be very important for the excited state Thus the stabilization energy of the excited state which has a multiplicity of nearly equalenergy pairing schemes is expected to be greater than that of the ground state with one dominant pairing scheme The more double bonds in the conjugated system the smaller the energy difference between the normal and excited states The diphenylpolyenes of formula absorb radiation at progressively longer wavelengths as is increased This is apparent from the colors of the compounds which range from colorless with to orange with to red with as goes from the ultraviolet into the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum Similar effects are found with conjugated and double bonds For example the electronic spectra of butanone and butenone are shown in Figure The absorption at for butanone is an transition and with butenone this absorption shifts to longer wavelengths There is also an intense absorption band for butenone at which is a transition With butanone a corresponding absorption occurs at which is out of the range of the spectrometer used to take the spectra of Figure Conjugation also can influence infrared spectra Transitions arising from and stretching vibrations generally are more intense and are shifted to slightly lower frequencies longer wavelengths for conjugated compounds relative to nonconjugated compounds Thus the stretching of butene occurs at whereas that of butadiene is observed at Alkanes and cycloalkanes have no lowenergy electronic transitions comparable to conjugated systems or molecules with nonbonding electrons Therefore alkanes and cycloalkanes show no absorption above and are good solvents to use for electronic spectroscopy Figure Electronic spectra of a butanone and b butenone in cyciohexane solution C Applications of Electronic Spectroscopy How do we use electronic spectroscopy in chemical analysis The two principal applications are structure determinations and quantitative analysis The position and intensity of an electronic absorption band provides information as to chemical structure Such absorptions normally are not as useful as infrared absorptions because they do not give as detailed information For our purposes here the main points to remember are A weak absorption suggests an transition of an isolated carbonyl group If this absorption is found in the region an aldehyde or ketone is probable Somewhat stronger absorptions between and may correspond to transitions Strong absorptions usually are characteristic of transitions If absorption occurs above a conjugated system of multiple bonds is indicated Each additional carboncarbon double bond shifts about to longer wavelengths and enhances the intensity of absorption Conjugation also shifts of transitions to longer wavelengths If we are dealing with compounds for which the wavelengths and the molar intensities of the absorption bands are known then we can use the degree of absorption for quantitative analysis with the aid of the BeerLambert law see Table for definitions By measuring the absorbance of a sample of known in a cell of known path length the concentration may be determined Because changes in absorbance reflect changes in concentration it is possible to use absorbance measurements to follow rates of chemical reactions to determine equilibrium constants such as the dissociation constants of acids and bases and to follow conformational changes in bioorganic molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids The capacity of electronic spectroscopy for performing qualitative and quantitative of the elements in chemical compounds has been done and applications have been made to elements of low atomic number such as carbon and oxygen Electronic spectra has been developed in the study of this elements and its compounds References John D Robert
