Contributors and Attributions Generally an alkyl derivative under appropriate conditions will eliminate where is commonly a halide ester or onium function provided that there is a hydrogen located on the carbon adjacent to that bearing the function An important feature of many elimination reactions is that they occur with the same combination of reagents that cause nucleophilic substitution In fact elimination and substitution often are competitive reactions Therefore it should be no surprise that substitution and elimination have closely related mechanisms Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
