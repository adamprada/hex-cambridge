Perspective Formulas and Fischer ProjectionsConverting between Perspective and Fischer FormulasContributors and Attributions Learning Objective draw interpret and convert between perspective formulae and Fischer projections for chiral compounds Perspective Formulas and Fischer Projections So far we have communicated the stereochemical orentation of compounds using the wedges and dashes of perspective formulas For example the perspective formula for RLactic acid is shown below A Fischer projection is a convention used to depict stereochemistry in two dimensions The horizontal bonds are seen as wedges and the vertical bonds are seen as dashed lines as shown below in the example below for glyceraldehyde Converting between Perspective and Fischer Formulas It can be useful to convert between perspective formulas and Fischer projections Below is one approach using Rlactic acid as an example Step Hold the molecule so that a the chiral center is on the plane of the paper b two bonds are coming out of the plane of the paper and are on a horizontal plane c the two remaining bonds are going into the plane of the paper and are on a vertical plane Step Push the two bonds coming out of the plane of the paper onto the plane of the paper Step Pull the two bonds going into the plane of the paper onto the plane of the paper Step Omit the chiral atom symbol for convenience This is the Fischer Projection of RLactic acid The stereochemical formula for Rlactic acid can be drawn using either method To build this skill we begin by drawing the structures and converting them step wise Models can also be helpful Eventually we will be able to mentally conversion between these two structures Exercise Convert each compound into the alternate sterochemical structure Perspective Fischer Answer See also DLconvention Contributors and Attributions Gamini Gunawardena from the OChemPal site Utah Valley University
