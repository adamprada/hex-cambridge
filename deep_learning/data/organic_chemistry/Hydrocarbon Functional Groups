Saturated vs Unsaturated MoleculesCalculating Degrees of Unsaturation DUReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective distinguish between the different hydrocarbon functional groups Saturated vs Unsaturated Molecules Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen The broadest distinction between hydrocarbons is whether they are saturated and unsaturated Saturated hydrocarbons only contain carboncarbon single bonds with the maximum number of hydrogens relative to the number of carbon atoms It can be said that the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen atoms in the same way a saturated solution has dissolved the maximum amount of solute Hydrocarbons that contain pi bonds as carboncarbon double or triple bonds are classified as unsaturated hydrocarbons Unsaturation indicates that some of the carbonhydrogen bonds were lost to from pi bonds between carbon atoms There are less than the maximum number os hydrogens relative to the number of carbon atoms Saturated hydrocarbons alkanes are the simplest of the hydrocarbon species They are composed entirely of single bonds and are saturated with hydrogen Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched speciesThe simplest alkanes have their C atoms bonded in a straight chain these are called normal alkanes They are named according to the number of C atoms in the chain The smallest alkane is methane Unsaturated hydrocarbons have one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms Those with double bond are called alkenes and those with one double bond have the formula assuming noncyclic structures Those containing triple bonds are called alkynes with general formula CnHn The smallest alkeneethenehas two C atoms and is also known by its common name ethylene The smallest alkyne is ethyne which is also known as acetylene For now we will focus on benzene as the representative aromatic hydrocarbon Aromatic compounds were first noted for their strong aromas and low chemical reactivity compared to other saturated hydrocarbons Aromatic compounds will be discussed in greater detail in the second semester to organic chemistry Hydrocarbon Functional Groups The four distinct hydrocarbon functional groups are alkanes alkenes alkynes and arenes Aromatic compounds derive their names from the fact that many of these compounds in the early days of discovery were grouped because they were oils with fragrant odors Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of singlebonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups Alkanes have the general formula CnHn Alkanes can be subdivided into the following three groups the linear straightchain alkanes branched alkanes and cycloalkanes Alkanes are also saturated hydrocarbons Alkanes are the simplest and least reactive hydrocarbon species containing only carbons and hydrogens The distinguishing feature of an alkane making it distinct from other compounds that also exclusively contain carbon and hydrogen is its lack of unsaturation That is to say it contains no double or triple bonds which are highly reactive in organic chemistry Though not totally devoid of reactivity their lack of reactivity under most laboratory conditions makes them a relatively uninteresting though very important component of organic chemistry As you will learn about later the energy confined within the carboncarbon bond and the carbonhydrogen bond is quite high and their rapid oxidation produces a large amount of heat typically in the form of fire The general formula for saturated hydrocarbons is CnHnassuming noncyclic structures as shown in hexane CH below Cycloalkanes are hydrocarbons containing one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached The general formula for a cyclic hydrocarbon containing one ring is CnHn as shown in cyclohexane CH below Akenes contain at least one carboncarbon double bond and alkynes contain at least one carboncarbon triple bond Alkenes have the general formula CnHn Alkynes have the general formula CnHn The ratio of carbon to hydrogen increased because hydrogen atoms are replaced with pi bonds as shown in transbutene CH and butyne CH below Since both double and triple bonds include pi bonds Alkenes and alkynes share similar chemical reactivity Aromatic hydrocarbons also known as arenes are hydrocarbons that have at least one aromatic ring Aromatic compounds contain the benzene unit Benzene itself is composed of six C atoms in a ring with alternating single and double CC bonds Calculating Degrees of Unsaturation DU There are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule Although nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and infrared radiation IR are the primary ways of determining molecular structures calculating the degrees of unsaturation DU is useful information Knowing the degrees of unsaturation tells us the combined number of pi bonds and rings within a compound which makes it easier to figure out the molecular structure Degree of Unsaturation DU can be calculated with the equation below and the molecular formula DU CNXH where C is the number of carbons N is the number of nitrogens X is the number of halogens F Cl Br I and H is the number of hydrogens from the molecular formula As stated before a saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings Another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane Thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by C which is the general molecular representation of an alkane As an example for the molecular formula CH the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is Cx The compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens Degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated Hence the DoB formula divides by The formula subtracts the number of Xs because a halogen X replaces a hydrogen in a compound For instance in chloroethane CHCl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane CH For a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present Therefore we add the number of nitrogens N This can be seen with CHN compared to CH Oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements As seen in alcohols the same number of hydrogens in ethanol CHOH matches the number of hydrogens in ethane CH The following chart illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for a given degree of unsaturation Each row corresponds to a different combination One degree of unsaturation is equivalent to ring or double bond bond Two degrees of unsaturation is equivalent to double bonds ring and double bond rings or triple bond bonds DU Possible combinations of rings bonds of rings of double bonds of triple bonds Remember the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor rings For instance a degree of unsaturation of can contain rings rings double bond ring double bonds ring triple bond double bond triple bond or double bonds Example What is the Degree of Unsaturation for benzene Solution Thinking it through The molecular formula for benzene is CH Thus DU where C NX and H DU can equal ring or double bond This corresponds to benzene containing ring and double bonds Even though there are other possible structures with a DU like the ones shown below We will learn the benzene rings have unusual stability and occur frequently in the world of organic chemistry When the DU for a compound is we can assume the presence of at least one benzene ring Exercise Are the following molecules saturated or unsaturated b c d CHN Using the molecules from give the degrees of unsaturation for each Calculate the degrees of unsaturation for the following molecular formulas a CH b CH c CHCl d CHNO Using the molecular formulas from are the molecules unsaturated or saturated Using the molecular formulas from if the molecules are unsaturated how many ringsdouble bondstriple bonds are predicted Answer a unsaturated Even though rings only contain single bonds rings are considered unsaturated b unsaturated c saturated d unsaturated If the molecular structure is given the easiest way to solve is to count the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings However you can also determine the molecular formula and solve for the degrees of unsaturation by using the formula a b one double bond and the double bond from the carbonyl c d Use the formula to solve a b c d a saturated b unsaturated c unsaturated d unsaturated a Remembera saturated molecule only contains single bonds b The molecule can contain any of these combinations i double bonds ii rings iii double

iv double bonds d i triple bonds ii triple bonds double bonds iii triple bonds double bond ring iv As you can see the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor ring
