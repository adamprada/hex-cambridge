Contributors and Attributions With the modern concept of a hydrogen atom we do not visualize the orbital electron traversing a simple planetary orbit Rather we speak of an atomic orbital in which there is only a probability of finding the electron in a particular volume a given distance and direction from the nucleus The boundaries of such an orbital are not distinct because there always remains a finite even if small probability of finding the electron relatively far from the nucleus There are several discrete atomic orbitals available to the electron of a hydrogen atom These orbitals differ in energy size and shape and exact mathematical descriptions for each are possible Following is a qualitative description of the nature of some of the hydrogen atomic orbitals The most stable or ground state of a hydrogen atom is designated In the state the electron is on the average closest to the nucleus ie it is the state with the smallest atomic orbital The orbital is spherically symmetrical This means that the probability of finding the electron at a given distance from the nucleus is independent of the direction from the nucleus We shall represent the orbital as a sphere centered on the nucleus with a radius such that the probability of finding the electron within the boundary surface is high to see Figure This may seem arbitrary but an orbital representation that would have a probability of for finding the electron within the boundary surface would have an infinite radius The reason is that there is a finite even if small probability of finding the electron at any given distance from the nucleus The boundary surfaces we choose turn out to have sizes consistent with the distances between the nuclei of bonded atoms The orbital is very much like the orbital except that it is larger and therefore more diffuse and it has a higher energy For principal quantum number there are also three orbitals of equal energies called orbitals which have different geometry than the orbitals These are shown in Figure Figure Representation of the hydrogen orbital in which we see that the respective axes passing through the tangent spheres of the three orbitals lie at right angles to one another The orbitals are not spherically symmetrical The and states are similar to the and states but are of higher energy The orbitals have still higher energies and quite different geometries they are not important for bonding in most organic substances at least for carbon compounds with hydrogen and elements in the first main row of the periodic table The sequence of orbital energies is shown in Figure Figure The shapes and orientations of the three orbitals of a hydrogen atom Notice that orbitals have two lobes one on each side of the nucleus Figure Schematic diagram of the relative energies of the hydrogenlike atomic orbitals The famous Pauli exclusion principle states that no more than two elections can occupy a given orbital and then only if they differ with respect to a property of electrons called electron spin An electron can have only one of two possible orientations of electron spin as may be symbolized by and Two electrons with paired spins often are represented as Such a pair of electrons can occupy a single orbital The symbols or represent two unpaired electrons which may not go into a single orbital If we assume that all atomic nuclei have orbitals like those of the hydrogen atom we can see how atoms more complex than hydrogen can be built up by adding electrons to the orbitals in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle The lowestenergy states will be those in which the electrons are added to the lowestenergy orbitals For example the electronic configuration of the lowestenergy state of a carbon atom is shown in Figure which also shows the relative energies of the through atomic orbitals The orbitals of lowest energy are populated with the proper number of electrons to balance the nuclear charge of for carbon and to preserve the Pauli condition of no more than two paired electrons per orbital However the two highestenergy electrons are put into different orbitals with unpaired spins in accordance with Hunds rule The rationale of Hunds rule depends on the fact that electrons come closer together Now suppose there are two electrons that can go into two different orbitals of the same energy socalled degenerate orbitals Hunds rule tells us that the repulsion energy between these electrons will be less if they have unpaired spins Why is this so Because if they have unpaired Figure Diagram showing the most stable electronic configuration of a carbon atom Addition of more electrons in accord with Hunds rule gives the electronic configuration of the other atoms indicated by the atomic symbols spins they cannot be in the same orbital at the same time Therefore they will not be able to approach each other as closely as they would if they could be in the same orbital at the same time For this reason the electronic configuration is expected to be more stable than the configuration if both orbitals have the same energy States such as the one shown in Figure for carbon are built up through the following steps Helium has two paired electrons in the orbital its configuration can be written as the superscript outside the parentheses denoting two paired electrons in the orbital For lithium we expect to be the ground state in which the electrons must be paired according to the exclusion principle Continuing in this way we can derive the electronic configurations for the elements in the first three rows of the periodic table as shown in Table These configurations conform to the principle that an orbital can accommodate a maximum ot two paired electrons and a set of three orbitals a maximum of six paired electrons The first electronic configuration should conform to Hunds rule as shown by the example of carbon in Figure The index number refers to the principal quantum number and corresponds to the shell designation often used for the electron of the normal hydrogen atom The principal quantum number corresponds to the shell to the shell and so on The notation also to come later has been carried over from the early days of atomic spectroscopy and was derived from descriptions of spectroscopic lines as sharp principal diffuse and fundamental which once were used to identify transitions from particular atomic states Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A
