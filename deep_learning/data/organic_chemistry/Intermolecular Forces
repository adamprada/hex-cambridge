Boiling points and melting pointsThe melting behavior of lipid structuresContributors Learning Objective predict the relative boil points of organic compounds Intermolecular forces IMFs can be used to predict relative boiling points The stronger the IMFs the lower the vapor pressure of the substance and the higher the boiling point Therefore we can compare the relative strengths of the IMFs of the compounds to predict their relative boiling points Hbonding dipoledipole London dispersion van der Waals When comparing compounds with the same IMFs we use size and shape as tie breakers since the London dispersion forces increase as the surface area increases Since all compounds exhibit some level of London dispersion forces and compounds capable of Hbonding also exhibit dipoledipole we will use the phrase dominant IMF to communicate the IMF most responsible for the physical properties of the compound In the table below we see examples of these relationships When comparing the structural isomers of pentane pentane isopentane and neopentane they all have the same molecular formula CH However as the carbon chain is shortened to create the carbon branches found in isopentane and neopentane the overall surface area of the molecules decreases The visual image of MO theory can be helpful in seeing each compound as a cloud of electrons in an all encompassing MO system Branching creates more spherical shapes noting that the sphere allows the maximum volume with the least surface area The structural isomers with the chemical formula CHO have different dominant IMFs The Hbonding of ethanol results in a liquid for cocktails at room temperature while the weaker dipoledipole of the dimethylether results in a gas a room temperature In the last example we see the three IMFs compared directly to illustrate the relative strength IMFs to boiling points Boiling points and melting points The observable melting and boiling points of different organic molecules provides an additional illustration of the effects of noncovalent interactions The overarching principle involved is simple the stronger the noncovalent interactions between molecules the more energy that is required in the form of heat to break them apart Higher melting and boiling points signify stronger noncovalent intermolecular forces Consider the boiling points of increasingly larger hydrocarbons More carbons means a greater surface area possible for hydrophobic interaction and thus higher boiling points As you would expect the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipoledipole interactions is reflected in higher boiling points Just look at the trend for hexane nonpolar London dispersion interactions only hexanone dipoledipole interactions and hexanol hydrogen bonding Of particular interest to biologists and pretty much anything else that is alive in the universe is the effect of hydrogen bonding in water Because it is able to form tight networks of intermolecular hydrogen bonds water remains in the liquid phase at temperatures up to OC slightly lower at high altitude The world would obviously be a very different place if water boiled at OC Exercise Based on their structures rank phenol benzene benzaldehyde and benzoic acid in terms of lowest to highest boiling point Solution By thinking about noncovalent intermolecular interactions we can also predict relative melting points All of the same principles apply stronger intermolecular interactions result in a higher melting point Ionic compounds as expected usually have very high melting points due to the strength of ionion interactions there are some ionic compounds however that are liquids at room temperature The presence of polar and especially hydrogenbonding groups on organic compounds generally leads to higher melting points Molecular shape and the ability of a molecule to pack tightly into a crystal lattice has a very large effect on melting points The flat shape of aromatic compounds such as napthalene and biphenyl allows them to stack together efficiently and thus aromatics tend to have higher melting points compared to alkanes or alkenes with similar molecular weights Comparing the melting points of benzene and toluene you can see that the extra methyl group on toluene disrupts the molecules ability to stack thus decreasing the cumulative strength of intermolecular London dispersion forces Note also that the boiling point for toluene is oC well above the boiling point of benzene oC The key factor for the boiling point trend in this case is size toluene has one more carbon whereas for the melting point trend shape plays a much more important role This makes sense when you consider that melting involves unpacking the molecules from their ordered array whereas boiling involves simply separating them from their already loose liquid association with each other If you are taking an organic lab course you may have already learned that impurities in a crystalline substance will cause the observed melting point to be lower compared to a pure sample of the same substance This is because impurities disrupt the ordered packing arrangement of the crystal and make the cumulative intermolecular interactions weaker The melting behavior of lipid structures An interesting biological example of the relationship between molecular structure and melting point is provided by the observable physical difference between animal fats like butter or lard which are solid at room temperature and vegetable oils which are liquid Both solid fats and liquid oils are based on a triacylglycerol structure where three hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains of varying length are attached to a glycerol backbone through an ester functional group compare this structure to that of the membrane lipids discussed in section B Interactive D image of a saturated triacylglycerol BioTopics Saturated vs monounsaturated fatty acid BioTopics In vegetable oils the hydrophobic chains are unsaturated meaning that they contain one or more double bonds Solid animal fat in contrast contains saturated hydrocarbon chains with no double bonds The double bonds in vegetable oils cause those hydrocarbon chains to be more rigid and bent at an angle remember that rotation is restricted around double bonds with the result that they dont pack together as closely and thus can be broken apart ie melted more readily Shown in the figure above is a polyunsaturated fatty acid chain two double bonds and you can click on the link to see interactive images of a saturated fatty acid compared to a monounsaturated fatty acid one double bond Exercise Arrange the following compounds in order of decreasing boiling point Answer Contributors William Reusch Professor Emeritus
