No headers Learning Objective recognize the relationships between constitutional structural isomers conformational isomers and geometric isomers Isomers Isomers always have the same chemical formula When the chemical formulae are different then the compounds are completely different Important information can be gained from the chemical formulas when comparing compounds Structural constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but a different bonding arrangement among the atoms Stereoisomers have identical molecular formulas and arrangements of atoms They differ from each other only in the spatial orientation of groups in the molecule For organic chemistry there are several types of stereoisomers enantiomers diasteriomers geometric isomers and conformers These stereoisomers will be introduced and explained throughout several chapters Structural Constitutional Isomers Because carbon forms four bonds there can be multiple ways to form molecules that follow the octet rule Even with only four carbon atoms there are two possible structures for the carbon backbone The carbon atoms can be bonded to make a four carbon chain butane or there can be a one carbon branch from a three carbon chain methylpropane Butane and methylpropane are structural isomers because they both have the chemical formula CH Identical vs Conformer The rotation about single bonds creates dynamic molecules When drawing and discussing molecules it is important to be aware that our drawing are static while the molecule themselves are rotating Although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical Rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations Conformers are the simplest example of stereoisomerism Identical compounds are the same compound shown with ALL atoms in the same spatial orientation Conformers are the same compound shown with different rotations about single bonds In the example below we can compare two identical structures for ethane with two conformers of ethane Geometric Isomers an example of stereoisomerism The rigidity of the pi bonds in double bonds can create geometric isomerism Without rotation there are two different orientations possible across the carboncarbon double bond CC The rigidity of the double bond creates a line of reference for spatial orientation The prefixes cis and trans are used to distinguish between geometric isomers The cisstereoisomer has both nonhydrogen atoms on the same side of the double bond Whereas the transstereoisomer has the nonhydrogen atoms across the double bond In the same way we cross the ocean an a transAtlantic journey This small difference may seem insignificant but geometric isomers are different chemical compounds with different physical properties as shown in the example below For now it is important to distinguish between structural differences and spatial differences when comparing compounds In the future we will look more closely at isomerism Example Lets look ate the bondline structures below and determine the relationships between the following pairs of compounds identical conformers structural isomers geometric isomers or completely different compounds The first important step that is often skipped is to determine the chemical formula of each compound If the chemical formulas are different then the compounds are completely different and there is NO isomeric relationship If the chemical formulas are the same then we identify the difference between to the compounds to determine their relatioship If there are structural differences in the bonding patterns then the compounds are constitutional structural isomers If the compounds have the same structural connections but the spatial orientations are different then the compounds are stereoisomers For now the possible stereoisomers are conformers showing the same compound with different carboncarbon single bond rotations or geometric isomers of compounds with different orientations at the carboncarbon double bonds Applying the logic above to our example we determine the following Exercise What is the relationship between the following pairs of compounds identical conformers structural isomers geometric isomers or completely different compounds Answer a geometric isomers b conformers c structural isomers d completely different compounds e identical
