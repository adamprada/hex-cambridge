IntroductionIdentificationOther Examples of meso compoundsOptical Activity AnalysisAchiral Diastereomers mesoCompoundsProblemsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to determine whether or not a compound containing two chiral carbon atoms will have a meso form given its Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure or its IUPAC name draw wedgeandbrokenline structures for the enantiomers and meso form of a compound such as tartaric acid given its IUPAC name or its Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure make a general comparison of the physical properties of the enantiomers meso form and racemic mixture of a compound such as tartaric acid Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below meso compound Study Notes You may be confused by the two sets of structures showing rotations Of course in each case the two structures shown are identical they represent the same molecule looked at from two different perspectives In the first case there is a rotation around the single carboncarbon bond In the second the whole molecule is rotated top to bottom Meso Compounds A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers It is superimposed on its mirror image and is optically inactive although it contains two or more stereocenters Introduction In general a meso compound should contain two or more identical substituted stereocenters Also it has an internal symmetry plane that divides the compound in half These two halves reflect each other by the internal mirror The stereochemistry of stereocenters should cancel out What it means here is that when we have an internal plane that splits the compound into two symmetrical sides the stereochemistry of both left and right side should be opposite to each other and therefore result in optically inactive Cyclic compounds may also be meso Identification If A is a meso compound it should have two or more stereocenters an internal plane and the stereochemistry should be R and S Look for an internal plane or internal mirror that lies in between the compound The stereochemistry eg R or S is very crucial in determining whether it is a meso compound or not As mentioned above a meso compound is optically inactive so their stereochemistry should cancel out For instance R cancels S out in a meso compound with two stereocenters transdichloroethanediol mesodibromobutane Tips An interesting thing about single bonds or sporbitals is that we can rotate the substituted groups that attached to a stereocenter around to recognize the internal plane As the molecule is rotated its stereochemistry does not change For example Another case is when we rotate the whole molecule by degree Both molecules below are still meso Remember the internal plane here is depicted on two dimensions However in reality it is three dimensions so be aware of it when we identify the internal mirror Example has a plane of symmetry the horizonatal plane going through the red broken line and therefore is achiral has chiral centers Thus is a meso compound Example This molecules has a plane of symmetry the vertical plane going through the red broken line perpendicular to the plane of the ring and therefore is achiral but has has two chiral centers Thus its is a meso compound Other Examples of meso compounds Meso compounds can exist in many different forms such as pentane butane heptane and even cyclobutane They do not necessarily have to be two stereocenters but can have more Optical Activity Analysis When the optical activity of a meso compound is attempted to be determined with a polarimeter the indicator will not show or It simply means there is no certain direction of rotation of the polarized light neither levorotatory and dexorotatory Achiral Diastereomers mesoCompounds The chiral centers in the preceding examples have all been different In the case of dihydroxybutanedioic acid known as tartaric acid the two chiral centers have the same four substituents and are equivalent As a result two of the four possible stereoisomers of this compound are identical due to a plane of symmetry so there are only three stereoisomeric tartaric acids Two of these stereoisomers are enantiomers and the third is an achiral diastereomer called a meso compound Meso compounds are achiral optically inactive diastereomers of chiral stereoisomers Investigations of isomeric tartaric acid salts carried out by Louis Pasteur in the mid th century were instrumental in elucidating some of the subtleties of stereochemistry Some physical properties of the isomers of tartaric acid are given in the following table tartaric acid αD º mp ºC tartaric acid αD º mp ºC mesotartaric acid αD º mp ºC Fischer projection formulas provide a helpful view of the configurational relationships within the structures of these isomers In the following illustration a mirror line is drawn between formulas that have a mirrorimage relationship In demonstrating the identity of the two mesocompound formulas remember that a Fischer projection formula may be rotated º in the plane Problems Beside meso there are also
