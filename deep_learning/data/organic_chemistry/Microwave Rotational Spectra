References Rotational energy levels normally are very closely spaced so lowenergy radiation such as is produced by radio transmitters operating in the microwave region suffices to change molecular rotational energies Because electronic and vibrational energy levels are spaced much more widely and because changes between them are induced only by higherenergy radiation microwave absorptions by gaseous substances can be characterized as essentially pure rotational spectra It is possible to obtain rotational moments of inertia from microwave spectra and from these moments to obtain bond angles and bond distances for simple molecules An example of the use of microwave spectra is provided by Figure which shows separate rotational absorptions observed for trans and gauche conformations of propyl iodide cf Section Although microwave spectroscopy being confined to gases is not a routine method in the organic laboratory it is important to us here in setting the stage for the consideration of more complex absorptions that occur with infrared radiation Figure A small part of the microwave spectrum of at a pressure of showing absorptions of the trans and gauche conformations Notice the regular spacings of the lines for each conformation That the spacings are different for the two conformations reflects their different moments of inertia The horizontal scale is gigahertz and corresponds to which from Equation can be calculated to mean a rotational energy change of Spectrum courtesy of Dr Howard Harrington HewlettPackard Corp References John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
