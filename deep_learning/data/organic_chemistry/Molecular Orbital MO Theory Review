OverviewMolecular Orbital Energy DiagramsBond OrderBonding in Diatomic MoleculesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective write and interpret molecular orbital MO diagrams Overview Molecular orbital MO theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wavefunctions The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by inphase combinations of atomic wavefunctions and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule Antibonding molecular orbitals result from outofphase combinations and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals Using quantum mechanics the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function Ψ analogous to the behavior in an atom Just like electrons around isolated atoms electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete quantized energies The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital Ψ Like an atomic orbital a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms H or Cl for example Such molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules In these diatomic molecules several types of molecular orbitals occur The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear combination of atomic orbitals LCAO The wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions Combining waves can lead to constructive interference in which peaks line up with peaks or destructive interference in which peaks line up with troughs Figure In orbitals the waves are three dimensional and they combine with inphase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and outofphase waves producing nodes or regions of no electron density Figure a When inphase waves combine constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude b When outofphase waves combine destructive interference produces a wave with less or no amplitude There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms The two types are illustrated in Figure The inphase combination produces a lower energy σs molecular orbital read as sigmas in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei The outofphase addition which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions produces a higher energy molecular orbital read as sigmasstar molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital Electrons in a σs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable of lower energy than they would be in the isolated atoms Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals Electrons in the orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart Hence these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals Electrons fill the lowerenergy bonding orbital before the higherenergy antibonding orbital just as they fill lowerenergy atomic orbitals before they fill higherenergy atomic orbitals Figure Sigma σ and sigmastar σ molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of two s atomic orbitals The plus signs indicate the locations of nuclei In p orbitals the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases analogous to how a twodimensional wave has both parts above and below the average We indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors When orbital lobes of the same phase overlap constructive wave interference increases the electron density When regions of opposite phase overlap the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes When p orbitals overlap end to end they create σ and σ orbitals Figure If two atoms are located along the xaxis in a Cartesian coordinate system the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx bonding and antibonding read as sigmapx and sigmapx star respectively Just as with sorbital overlap the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei which is a higherenergy antibonding orbital Figure Combining wave functions of two p atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis creates two molecular orbitals σp and The sidebyside overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi π bonding molecular orbital and a π antibonding molecular orbital as shown in Figure In valence bond theory we describe π bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals with electron density on either side of the node In molecular orbital theory we describe the π orbital by this same shape and a π bond exists when this orbital contains electrons Electrons in this orbital interact with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together making it a bonding orbital For the outofphase combination there are two nodal planes created one along the internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei Figure Sidebyside overlap of each two p orbitals results in the formation of two π molecular orbitals Combining the outofphase orbitals results in an antibonding molecular orbital with two nodes One contains the internuclear axis and one is perpendicular to the axis Combining the inphase orbitals results in a bonding orbital There is a node blue plane containing the internuclear axis with the two lobes of the orbital located above and below this node In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules each atom also has two sets of p orbitals oriented side by side py and pz so these four atomic orbitals combine pairwise to create two π orbitals and two π orbitals The πpy and orbitals are oriented at right angles to the πpz and orbitals Except for their orientation the πpy and πpz orbitals are identical and have the same energy they are degenerate orbitals The and antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and identical except for their orientation A total of six molecular orbitals results from the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms σpx and πpy and πpz and Example Molecular Orbitals Predict what type if any of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave functions so each pair of orbitals shown overlap The orbitals are all similar in energy Solution This is an inphase combination resulting in a σp orbital This will not result in a new orbital because the inphase component bottom and outofphase component top cancel out Only orbitals with the correct alignment can combine This is an outofphase combination resulting in a orbital Exercise Label the molecular orbital shown as σ or π bonding or antibonding and indicate where the node occurs Answer The orbital is located along the internuclear axis so it is a σ orbital There is a node bisecting the internuclear axis so it is an antibonding orbital Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram Figure For a diatomic molecule the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left and those of the other atom are shown on the right Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine one lowerenergy bonding molecular orbital and one higherenergy antibonding orbital result Thus we can see that combining the six p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals one σ and two π and three antibonding orbitals one σ and two π Figure This is the molecular orbital diagram for the homonuclear diatomic showing the molecular orbitals of the valence shell only The molecular orbitals are filled in the same manner as atomic orbitals using the Aufbau principle and Hunds rule We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals by the Aufbau principle Lowerenergy orbitals fill first electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins Figure Just as we write electron configurations for atoms we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present For clarity we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy In this case each orbital is at a different energy so parentheses separate each orbital Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons such as would have the molecular electron configuration It is common to omit the core electrons from molecular orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence electrons Bond Order The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms Thus a single bond has a bond order of a double bond has a bond order of and a triple bond has a bond order of We define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons but the resulting bond order is usually the same The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails but both methods describe the same phenomenon In the molecular orbital model an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital The bond order is calculated by subtracting the destabilizing antibonding electrons from the stabilizing bonding electrons Since a bond consists of two electrons we divide by two to get the bond order We can determine bond order with the following equation The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases If the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero a stable bond does not form We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders Bonding in Diatomic Molecules A dihydrogen molecule H forms from two hydrogen atoms When the atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine the electrons occupy the molecular orbital of lowest energy the σs bonding orbital A dihydrogen molecule H readily forms because the energy of a H molecule is lower than that of two H atoms The σs orbital that contains both electrons is lower in energy than either of the two s atomic orbitals A molecular orbital can hold two electrons so both electrons in the H molecule are in the σs bonding orbital the electron configuration is We represent this configuration by a molecular orbital energy diagram Figure in which a single upward arrow indicates one electron in an orbital and two upward and downward arrows indicate two electrons of opposite spin Figure The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that H will be a stable molecule with lower energy than the separated atoms A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons so we have Because the bond order for the HH bond is equal to the bond is a single bond A helium atom has two electrons both of which are in its s orbital Two helium atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule He with four electrons because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the lowerenergy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the two electrons in the higherenergy antibonding molecular orbital We would write the hypothetical electron configuration of He as as in Figure The net energy change would be zero so there is no driving force for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule In fact helium exists as discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules The bond order in a hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms Figure The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that He will not be a stable molecule since it has equal numbers of bonding and antibonding Contributors and Attributions Paul Flowers University of North Carolina Pembroke Klaus Theopold University of Delaware and Richard Langley Stephen F
