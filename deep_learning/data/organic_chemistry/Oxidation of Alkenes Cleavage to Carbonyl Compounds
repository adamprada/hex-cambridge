alkene write an equation to describe the cleavage of an alkene by potassium permanganate predict the products from the oxidative cleavage of a given alkene by potassium permanganate use the results of ozonolysisreduction or cleavage with permanganate to deduce the structure of an unknown alkene identify the reagents that should be used in the oxidative cleavage of an alkene to obtain a given product or products write the equation for the cleavage of a diol by periodic acid and draw the structure of the probable intermediate predict the product or products that will be formed from the treatment of a given diol with periodic acid use the results of hydroxylationdiol cleavage to deduce the structure of an unknown alkene Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below molozonide ozonide ozonolysis Study Notes Ozonolysis or ozonolysisreduction refers to the treatment of an alkene with ozone followed by a suitable reducing agent to break down complex doublebondcontaining compounds into smaller more easily identified products From the identity of the products formed it may be possible to deduce the structure of the original doublebondcontaining substance Ozonolysis will feature prominently in many of the roadmap problems that you will encounter in this course A molozonide is an unstable cyclic intermediate that is initially formed when an alkene reacts with ozone Alkenes can also be cleaved by other oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate However KMnO will carry the oxidation further than ozonolysis so products can be slightly different Note within the summary of the following reactions that ozonolysis produces aldehydes and ketones while KMnO can oxidize all the way to to carbon dioxide and carboxylic acid Diol cleavage is another example of a redox reaction periodic acid HIO is reduced to iodic acid HIO Ozonolysis is a method of oxidatively cleaving alkenes or alkynes using ozone a reactive allotrope of oxygen The process allows for carboncarbon double or triple bonds to be replaced by double bonds with oxygen This reaction is often used to identify the structure of unknown alkenes by breaking them down into smaller more easily identifiable pieces Ozonolysis also occurs naturally and would break down repeated units used in rubber and other polymers On an industrial scale azelaic acid and pelargonic acids are produced from ozonolysis Introduction The gaseous ozone is first passed through the desired alkene solution in either methanol or dichloromethane The first intermediate product is an ozonide molecule which is then further reduced to carbonyl products This results in the breaking of the CarbonCarbon double bond and is replaced by a CarbonOxygen double bond instead Reaction Mechanism Step The first step in the mechanism of ozonolysis is the initial electrophilic addition of ozone to the CarbonCarbon double bond which then form the molozonide intermediate Due to the unstable molozonide molecule it continues further with the reaction and breaks apart to form a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide molecule Step The carbonyl and the carbonyl oxide rearranges itself and reforms to create the stable ozonide intermediate A reductive workup could then be performed to convert convert the ozonide molecule into the desired carbonyl products References
