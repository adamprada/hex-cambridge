Contributors and Attributions Learning Objective predict the products and specify the reagents for the oxidation of alkynes Alkynes similar to alkenes can be oxidized gently or strongly depending on the reaction environment Since alkynes are less stable than alkenens the reactions conditions can be gentler For examples alkynes form vicinal dicarbonyls in neutral permanganate solution For the alkene reaction to vicinal dialcohols the permanganate reaction requires a lightly basic environment for the reaction to occur During strong oxidation with ozone or basic potassium permanganate the alkyne is cleaved into two products Because at least one of the reaction products is a carboxylic acid it is important to consider the acidbase chemistry of the product in the reaction solution Carboxylic acids are deprotonated in basic solutions to carboxylates A second reaction step is required to protonate the carboxylate to the neutral form of the carboxylic acid The generic reactions are summarized below for the different oxidative conditions gentle or strong Gentle Alkyne Oxidation Strong Alkyne Oxidation Oxidative Cleavage Exercise Draw the bondline structures for the products of the following reactions Answer Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University
