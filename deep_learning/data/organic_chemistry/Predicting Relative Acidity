Periodic trendsContributors and Attributions Learning Objective Predict relative strengths of acids and bases from their structure bonding and resonance Since compounds are neutral it can be difficult to evaluate and compare their overall stability without going through the tedious process of performing bond energy calculations When acidic compounds donate hydrogen ions or accepts electrons they become ionized It is much easier to compare ions because we can evaluate the charge density The lower the charge density the more stable the ion Conversely the higher the charge density the less stable the ion Charge density is analogous to density of matter We place charge in the numerator instead of mass and volume can still be found in the denominator The six strong acids HCl HBr HI HNO HSO HClO fully ionize to form the highly stable anions Cl Br I NO SO ClO respectively For the remaining weak acids HA we can determine their relative acidity by comparing the relative electron densities of their conjugate bases A the lower the electron density the more stable the conjugate base Structural Effects on Electron Density Four Considerations There are four main considerations for evaluating electron density Identity of the element or atoms holding the charge Can the charge be delocalized by resonance Are there any inductive effects Hybridization of orbital holding the charge These considerations are listed in order of importance and are explained individually but must be looked at collectively Identity of the Element When comparing the identity of the elements it depends on the positional relationship of the elements on the periodic table Within a Group aka down a column As we move down the periodic table the electrons are occupying higher energy subshells creating a larger atomic size and volume As the volume increases the electron density decreases Figure shows spheres representing the atoms of the s and p blocks from the periodic table to scale showing the two trends for the atomic radius Figure Atomic Radii Trends on the Periodic Table Although there are some reversals in the trend eg see Po in the bottom row atoms generally get smaller as you go across the periodic table and larger as you go down any one column Numbers are the radii in pm This relationship of atomic size and electron density is illustrated when we compare the relative acidities of methanol CHOH with methanethiol CHSH The lower pKa value of for methanethiol indicates that it is a stronger acid than methanol with a pKa value of It is important to remember that neither compound is considered an acid These relationships become useful when trying to deprotonate compounds to increase their chemical reactivity in nonaqueous reaction conditions Across a Period aka across a row As we move across a period of the main group elements the valence electrons all occupy orbitals in the same shell These electrons have comparable energy so this factor does not help us discern differences relative stability Differences in electronegativity are now the dominant factor This trend is shown when comparing the pKa values of methane ammonia water and hydrofluoric acid reflects the relative electonegativities of the C N O F Periodic trends First we will focus on individual atoms and think about trends associated with the position of an element on the periodic table Well use as our first models the simple organic compounds ethane methylamine and methanol but the concepts apply equally to more complex biomolecules such as the side chains of alanine lysine and serine We can see a clear trend in acidity as we move from left to right along the second row of the periodic table from carbon to nitrogen to oxygen The key to understanding this trend is to consider the hypothetical conjugate base in each case the more stable weaker the conjugate base the stronger the acid Look at where the negative charge ends up in each conjugate base In the ethyl anion the negative charge is borne by carbon while in the methylamine anion and methoxide anion the charges are located on a nitrogen and an oxygen respectively Remember the periodic trend in electronegativity section A it also increases as we move from left to right along a row meaning that oxygen is the most electronegative of the three and carbon the least The more electronegative an atom the better it is able to bear a negative charge Thus the methoxide anion is the most stable lowest energy least basic of the three conjugate bases and the ethyl anion is the least stable highest energy most basic We can use the same set of ideas to explain the difference in basicity between water and ammonia By looking at the pKavalues for the appropriate conjugate acids we know that ammonia is more basic than water Oxygen as the more electronegative element holds more tightly to its lone pair than the nitrogen The nitrogen lone pair therefore is more likely to break away and form a new bond to a proton it is in other words more basic Once again a more reactive stronger conjugate base means a less reactive weaker conjugate acid When moving vertically within a given column of the periodic table we again observe a clear periodic trend in acidity This is best illustrated with the halides basicity like electronegativity increases as we move up the column Conversely acidity in the haloacids increases as we move down the column In order to make sense of this trend we will once again consider the stability of the conjugate bases Because fluorine is the most electronegative halogen element we might expect fluoride to also be the least basic halogen ion But in fact it is the least stable and the most basic It turns out that when moving vertically in the periodic table the size of the atom trumps its electronegativity with regard to basicity The atomic radius of iodine is approximately twice that of fluorine so in an iodine ion the negative charge is spread out over a significantly larger volume This illustrates a fundamental concept in organic chemistry that is important enough to put in red Electrostatic charges whether positive or negative are more stable when they are spread out than when they are confined to one atom We will see this idea expressed again and again throughout our study of organic reactivity in many different contexts For now the concept is applied only to the influence of atomic radius on anion stability Because fluoride is the least stable most basic of the halide conjugate bases HF is the least acidic of the haloacids only slightly stronger than acetic acid HI with a pKa of about is one the strongest acids known More importantly to the study of biological organic chemistry this trend tells us that thiols are more acidic than alcohols The pKa of the thiol group on the cysteine side chain for example is approximately while the pKa for the hydroxl on the serine side chain is on the order of To reiterate acid strength increases as we move to the right along a row of the periodic table and as we move down a column Example Draw the structure of the conjugate base that would form if the compound below were to react with molar equivalent of sodium hydroxide Solution Is resonance possible to localize the charge In the previous section we focused our attention on periodic trends the differences in acidity and basicity between groups where the exchangeable proton was bound to different elements Now it is time to think about how the structure of different organic groups contributes to their relative acidity or basicity even when we are talking about the same element acting as the proton donoracceptor When evaluating conjugate bases for the presence of the resonance contributors remember to look for movable electrons as described in section of this chapter Delocalizing electrons over two or more atoms lowers the electron density The first model pair we will consider is ethanol and acetic acid but the conclusions we reach will be equally valid for all alcohol and carboxylic acid groups Despite the fact that they are both oxygen acids the pKa values of ethanol and acetic acid are very different What makes a carboxylic acid so much more acidic than an alcohol As before we begin by considering the conjugate bases In both species the negative charge on the conjugate base is held by an oxygen so periodic trends cannot be invoked For acetic acid however there is a key difference a resonance contributor can be drawn in which the negative charge is localized on the second oxygen of the group The two resonance forms for the conjugate base are equal in energy according to our rules of resonance section C What this means you may recall is that the negative charge on the acetate ion is not located on one oxygen or the other rather it is shared between the two Chemists use the term delocalization of charge to describe this situation In the ethoxide ion by contrast the negative charge is locked on the single oxygen it has nowhere else to go Now is the time to think back to that statement from the previous section that was so important that it got printed in bold font in its own paragraph in fact it is so important that well just say it again Electrostatic charges whether positive or negative are more stable when they are spread out than when they are confined to one atom Now we are seeing this concept in another context where a charge is being spread out in other words delocalized by resonance rather than simply by the size of the atom involved The delocalization of charge by resonance has a very powerful effect on the reactivity of organic molecules enough to account for the difference of over pKa units between ethanol and acetic acid and remember pKa is a log expression so we are talking about a difference of over between the acidity constants for the two molecules The acetate ion is that much more stable than the ethoxide ion all due to the effects of resonance delocalization The resonance effect also nicely explains why a nitrogen atom is basic when it is in an amine but not basic when it is part of an amide group Recall that in an amide there is significant doublebond character to the carbonnitrogen bond due to a second resonance contributor in which the nitrogen lone pair is part of a p bond While the electron lone pair of an amine nitrogen is stuck in one place the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is delocalized by resonance Notice that in this case we are extending our central statement to say that electron density in the form of a lone pair is stabilized by resonance delocalization even though there is not a negative charge involved Heres another way to think about it the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is not available for bonding with a proton these two electrons are too comfortable being part of the delocalized pibonding system The lone pair on an amine nitrogen by contrast is not part of a delocalized p system and is very ready to form a bond with any acidic proton that might be nearby Often it requires some careful thought to predict the most acidic proton on a molecule Ascorbic acid also known as Vitamin C has a pKa of There are four hydroxyl groups on this molecule which one is the most acidic If we consider all four possible conjugate bases we find that there is only one for which we can delocalized the negative charge over two oxygen atoms Example Rank the compounds below from most acidic to least acidic and explain your reasoning Inductive Effects The inductive effect is an experimentally observed effect of the transmission of charge through a chain of atoms in a molecule resulting in a permanent dipole in a bond Inductive effects decrease quickly with distance The inductive effect can be electron donating which helps stabilize positive charge Alkyl groups hydrocarbons are inductive electron donators The inductive effect can also be electron withdrawing Electronegativity indicates the strength of electron withdrawing induction Halogens are inductive electron withdrawing groups The effects of induction on relative acidity can also be seen when comparing acetic acid with trifluoroacetic acid The difference in acidity does not have to do with resonance delocalization because no additional resonance structures can be drawn for the fluorinated molecule The fluorine atoms inductively pull some of the electron density away from the carboxylate ion to further delocalize the negative charge of the conjugate base Compare the pKa values of acetic acid and its mono di and trichlorinated derivatives The presence of the chlorines clearly increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid group A chlorine atom is more electronegative than a hydrogen and thus is able to induce or pull electron density towards itself away from the carboxylate group In helping to further spread out the electron density of the conjugate base which as we know has a stabilizing effect In this context the chlorine substituent is called an electronwithdrawing group Notice that the pKalowering effect of each chlorine atom while significant is not as dramatic as the delocalizing resonance effect illustrated by the difference in pKa values between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid In general resonance effects are more powerful than inductive effects The inductive electronwithdrawing effect of the chlorines takes place through covalent bonds and its influence decreases markedly with distance thus a chlorine two carbons away from a carboxylic acid group has a decreased effect compared to a chlorine just one carbon away Exercise Rank the compounds below from most acidic to least acidic and explain your reasoning Solution Orbital Hybridization The hybridization of an orbital affects its electronegativity Within a shell the s orbitals occupy the region closer to the nucleus than the p orbitals Therfore the spherical s orbitals are more electronegative than the lobed p orbitals The relative electronegativity of hybridized orbitals is sp sp sp This trend indicates the sp hybridized orbitals are more stable with a charge than sp hybridized orbitals The table below shows how orbital hybridization compares with the identity of the atom when predicting relative acidity Guided Practice Lets practice by comparing the relative acidity of phenol with acetic acid Which compound is the stronger acid phenol or acetic acid To answer this question we draw all the relevant resonance contributors for each conjugate base phenoxide and acetate respectively Phenoxide has four resonance contributors but three of the contributors have a negative charge on a carbon atom while both resonance contributors for acetate have a negative charge on the more electronegative element oxygen There are no inductive effects or orbital hybridization differences to consider in this example so we would predict acetic acid to be the stronger acid The acetate ion is more stable than the phenoxide ion so we would expect acetic acid to be the stronger acid The pKa table below supports our prediction Acetic acid has a pKa of while phenol has a pKa of A word of caution when using the pKa table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair If you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia NH compared to that of ethoxide ion CHCHO for example the relevant pKa values to consider are the pKa of ammonium ion and the pKa of ethanol From these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base Do not make the mistake of using the pKa value of this is the pKa of ammonia acting as an acid and tells you how basic the NH ion is very basic Contributors and Attributions Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of
