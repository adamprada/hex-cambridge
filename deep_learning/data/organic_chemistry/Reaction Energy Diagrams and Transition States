intermediates rate determining step draw the transition state of a reaction You may recall from general chemistry that it is often convenient to describe chemical reactions with energy diagrams In an energy diagram the vertical axis represents the overall energy of the reactants while the horizontal axis is the reaction coordinate tracing from left to right the progress of the reaction from starting compounds to final products The energy diagram for a typical onestep reaction might look like this Despite its apparent simplicity this energy diagram conveys some very important ideas about the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction Recall that when we talk about the thermodynamics of a reaction we are concerned with the difference in energy between reactants and products and whether a reaction is downhill exergonic energy releasing or uphill endergonic energy absorbing When we talk about kinetics on the other hand we are concerned with the rate of the reaction regardless of whether it is uphill or downhill thermodynamically First lets review what this energy diagram tells us about the thermodynamics of the reaction illustrated by the energy diagram above The energy level of the products is lower than that of the reactants This tells us that the change in standard Gibbs Free Energy for the reaction ΔGrnx is negative In other words the reaction is exergonic or downhill Recall that the ΔGrnx term encapsulates both ΔHrnx the change in enthalpy heat and ΔSrnx the change in entropy disorder where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin For chemical processes where the entropy change is small the enthalpy change is essentially the same as the change in Gibbs Free Energy Energy diagrams for these processes will often plot the enthalpy H instead of Free Energy for simplicity The standard Gibbs Free Energy change for a reaction can be related to the reactions equilibrium constant K_eq_ by a simple equation where Keq product reactant at equilibrium R JKmol or cal Kmol T temperature in Kelvin K If you do the math you see that a negative value for ΔGrnx an exergonic reaction corresponds as it should by intuition to Keq being greater than an equilibrium constant which favors product formation In a hypothetical endergonic energyabsorbing reaction the products would have a higher energy than reactants and thus ΔGrnx would be positive and Keq would be less than favoring reactants Now lets move to kinetics Look again at the energy diagram for exergonic reaction although it is downhill overall it isnt a straight downhill run First an energy barrier must be overcome to get to the product side The height of this energy barrier you may recall is called the activation energy ΔG You may have been taught to use the term activated complex rather than transition state as the two are often used interchangeably Similarly the activation energy of a reaction is often represented by the symbol Eact or Ea The activation energy is what determines the kinetics of a reaction the higher the energy hill the slower the reaction At the very top of the energy barrier the reaction is at its transition state TS which is the point at which the bonds are in the process of breaking and forming The transition state is an activated complex a transient and dynamic state that unlike more stable species does not have any definable lifetime It may help to imagine a transition state as being analogous to the exact moment that a baseball is struck by a bat Transition states are drawn with dotted lines representing bonds that are in the process of breaking or forming and the drawing is often enclosed by brackets Here is a picture of a likely transition state for a substitution reaction between hydroxide and chloromethane This reaction involves a collision between two molecules for this reason we say that it has second order kinetics The rate expression for this type of reaction is rate kreactant reactant which tells us that the rate of the reaction depends on the rate constant k as well as on the concentration of both reactants The rate constant can be determined experimentally by measuring the rate of the reaction with different starting reactant concentrations The rate constant depends on the activation energy of course but also on temperature a higher temperature means a higher k and a faster reaction all else being equal This should make intuitive sense when there is more heat energy in the system more of the reactant molecules are able to get over the energy barrier Here is one more interesting and useful expression Consider a simple reaction where the reactants are A and B and the product is AB this is referred to as a condensation reaction because two molecules are coming together or condensing If we know the rate constant k for the forward reaction and the rate constant kreverse for the reverse reaction where AB splits apart into A and B we can simply take the quotient to find our equilibrium constant This too should make some intuitive sense if the forward rate constant is higher than the reverse rate constant equilibrium should lie towards products Exercise Which reaction is faster ΔG kJmol or ΔG kJmol Answer The kJmol reaction is the faster reaction Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer
