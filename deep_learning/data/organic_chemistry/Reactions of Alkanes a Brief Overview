CombustionHalogenation of AlkanesLarger alkanes and chlorineCycloalkanesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective recognize and distinguish between the two major reactions of alkanes combustion and halogenation Combustion Complete combustion given sufficient oxygen of any hydrocarbon produces carbon dioxide and water It is quite important that you can write properly balanced equations for these reactions because they often come up as a part of thermochemistry calculations Some are easier than others For example with alkanes the ones with an even number of carbon atoms are marginally harder than those with an odd number Example Propane Combustion For example with propane CH you can balance the carbons and hydrogens as you write the equation down Your first draft would be Counting the oxygens leads directly to the final version Example Butane Combustion With butane CH you can again balance the carbons and hydrogens as you write the equation down Counting the oxygens leads to a slight problem with on the righthand side The simple trick is to allow yourself to have sixandahalf O molecules on the left If that offends you double everything The hydrocarbons become harder to ignite as the molecules get bigger This is because the bigger molecules dont vaporize so easily the reaction is much better if the oxygen and the hydrocarbon are well mixed as gases If the liquid is not very volatile only those molecules on the surface can react with the oxygen Bigger molecules have greater Van der Waals attractions which makes it more difficult for them to break away from their neighbors and turn to a gas Provided the combustion is complete all the hydrocarbons will burn with a blue flame However combustion tends to be less complete as the number of carbon atoms in the molecules rises That means that the bigger the hydrocarbon the more likely you are to get a yellow smoky flame Incomplete combustion where there is not enough oxygen present can lead to the formation of carbon or carbon monoxide As a simple way of thinking about it the hydrogen in the hydrocarbon gets the first chance at the oxygen and the carbon gets whatever is left over The presence of glowing carbon particles in a flame turns it yellow and black carbon is often visible in the smoke Carbon monoxide is produced as a colorless poisonous gas Note Why carbon monoxide is poisonous Oxygen is carried around the blood by hemoglobin which unfortunately binds to exactly the same site on the hemoglobin that oxygen does The difference is that carbon monoxide binds irreversibly or very strongly making that particular molecule of hemoglobin useless for carrying oxygen If you breath in enough carbon monoxide you will die from a sort of internal suffocation Halogenation of Alkanes Halogenation is the replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms in an organic compound by a halogen fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine Unlike the complex transformations of combustion the halogenation of an alkane appears to be a simple substitution reaction in which a CH bond is broken and a new CX bond is formed The chlorination of methane shown below provides a simple example of this reaction CH Cl energy CHCl HCl Since only two covalent bonds are broken CH ClCl and two covalent bonds are formed CCl HCl this reaction seems to be an ideal case for mechanistic investigation and speculation However one complication is that all the hydrogen atoms of an alkane may undergo substitution resulting in a mixture of products as shown in the following unbalanced equation The relative amounts of the various products depend on the proportion of the two reactants used In the case of methane a large excess of the hydrocarbon favors formation of methyl chloride as the chief product whereas an excess of chlorine favors formation of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride CH Cl energy CHCl CHCl CHCl CCl HCl In the presence of a flame the reactions are rather like the fluorine one producing a mixture of carbon and the hydrogen halide The violence of the reaction drops considerably as you go from fluorine to chlorine to bromine The interesting reactions happen in the presence of ultraviolet light sunlight will do These are photochemical reactions that happen at room temperature Well look at the reactions with chlorine although the reactions with bromine are similar but evolve more slowly Substitution reactions happen in which hydrogen atoms in the methane are replaced one at a time by chlorine atoms You end up with a mixture of chloromethane dichloromethane trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane The original mixture of a colorless and a green gas would produce steamy fumes of hydrogen chloride and a mist of organic liquids All of the organic products are liquid at room temperature with the exception of the chloromethane which is a gas If you were using bromine you could either mix methane with bromine vapor or bubble the methane through liquid bromine in either case exposed to UV light The original mixture of gases would of course be redbrown rather than green One would not choose to use these reactions as a means of preparing these organic compounds in the lab because the mixture of products would be too tedious to separate The mechanisms for the reactions are explained on separate pages Larger alkanes and chlorine You would again get a mixture of substitution products but it is worth just looking briefly at what happens if only one of the hydrogen atoms gets substituted monosubstitution just to show that things arent always as straightforward as they seem For example with propane you could get one of two isomers If chance was the only factor you would expect to get three times as much of the isomer with the chlorine on the end There are hydrogens that could get replaced on the end carbon atoms compared with only in the middle In fact you get about the same amount of each of the two isomers If you use bromine instead of chlorine the great majority of the product is where the bromine is attached to the center carbon atom Cycloalkanes The reactions of the cycloalkanes are generally just the same as the alkanes with the exception of the very small ones particularly cyclopropane In the presence of UV light cyclopropane will undergo substitution reactions with chlorine or bromine just like a noncyclic alkane However it also has the ability to react in the dark In the absence of UV light cyclopropane can undergo addition reactions in which the ring is broken For example with bromine cyclopropane gives dibromopropane This can still happen in the presence of light but you will get substitution reactions as well The ring is broken because cyclopropane suffers badly from ring strain The bond angles in the ring are rather than the normal value of about when the carbon makes four single bonds The overlap between the atomic orbitals in forming the carboncarbon bonds is less good than it is normally and there is considerable repulsion between the bonding pairs The system becomes more stable if the ring is broken Exercise Classify the following reactions as combustion or halogenation Answer a halogentation b combustion
