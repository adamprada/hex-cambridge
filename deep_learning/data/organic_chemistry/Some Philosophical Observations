Contributors and Attributions As you proceed with your study of organic chemistry you may well feel confused as to what it is you are actually dealing with On the one hand there will be exhortations to remember how organic chemistry pervades our everyday life And yet on the other hand you also will be exhorted to think about organic compounds in terms of abstract structural formulas representing molecules when there is absolutely no way at all to deal with molecules as single entities Especially if you are not studying organic compounds in the laboratory concurrently you may come to confuse the abstraction of formulas and ballandstick models of the molecules with the reality of organic compounds and this would be most undesirable At each stage of the way you should try to make or at least visualize a juncture between a structural formula and an actual substance in a bottle This will not be easy it takes time to reach the level of experience that a practicing organic chemist has so that he can tell you with some certainty that the structural formula represents in actuality a limpid colorless liquid with a pleasant odor slightly soluble in water boiling somewhere about A useful method for developing this sort of feeling for the relationship between structures and actual compounds is to check your perception of particular substances with their properties as given in a chemical handbook One perhaps comforting thought for you at this time is that differences between the chemical behaviors of relatively similar organic compounds usually are ascribed to just three important and different kinds of effects two of which have root in common experience One called steric hindrance is a manifestation of experience that two solid objects cannot occupy the same space at once Another is the electrical effect which boils down to a familiar catechism that like electrical charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other The remaining important effect the one that has no basis in common experience derives from quantum mechanics The quantum mechanical effect explains why benzene is unusually stable how and why many reactions occur in special ways and probably most important of all the ways that organic compounds interact with electromagnetic radiation of all kinds from radio waves to x rays We shall try to give as clear explanations as possible of the quantum mechanical effects but some of it will just have to be accepted as fact that we cannot ourselves experience directly nor understand intuitively For example when a grindstone rotates so far as our experience goes it can have an infinitely variable rate of rotation and consequently infinitely variable rotation angular momentum However molecules in the gas phase have only specific rotation rates and corresponding specific rotational momentum values No measurement technique can detect inbetween values of these quantities Molecules are quantized rotators About all you can do is try to accept this fact and if you try long enough you may be able to substitute familiarity for understanding and be happy with that All of us have some concepts we use continually even perhaps unconsciously about energy and work Thermodynamics makes these concepts quantitative and provides very useful information about what might be called the potential for any process to occur be it production of electricity from a battery water running uphill photosynthesis or formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion of gasoline In the past most organic chemists seldom tried to apply thermodynamics to the reactions in which they were interested Much of this was due to the paucity of thermodynamic data for more than a few organic compounds but some was because organic chemists often liked to think of themselves as artistic types with little use for quantitative data on their reactions which may have meant that they didnt really know about thermodynamics and were afraid to ask Times have changed Extensive thermochemical data are now available the procedures are well understood and the results both useful and interesting We shall make considerable use of thermodynamics in our exposition of organic chemistry We believe it will greatly improve your understanding of why some reactions go and others do not Finally you should recognize that you almost surely will have some problems with the following chapters in making decisions as to how much time and emphasis you should put on the various concepts principles facts and so on that we will present for you As best we can we try to help you by pointing out that this idea fact and so on is especially important or words to that effect Also we have tried to underscore important information by indicating the breadth of its application to other scientific disciplines as well as to technology In addition we have caused considerable material to be set in smaller type and indented Such material includes extensions of basic ideas and departments of fuller explanation In many places the exposition is more complete than it needs to be for you at the particular location in the book However you will have need for the extra material later and it will be easier to locate and easier to refresh your memory on what came before if it is one place We will try to indicate clearly what you should learn immediately and what you will want to come back for later The problem is no matter what we think is important you or your professor will have your own judgments about relevance And because it is quite impossible to write an individual text for your particular interests and needs we have tried to accommodate a range of interests and needs through providing a rather rich buffet of knowledge about modern organic chemistry Hopefully all you will need is here but there is surely much more too So to avoid intellectual indigestion we suggest you not try to learn everything as it comes but rather try hardest to understand the basic ideas and concepts to which we give the greatest emphasis As you proceed further the really important facts nomenclature and so on the kind of material that basically requires memorization will emerge as that which in your own course of study you will find you use over and over again In hope that you may wish either to learn more about particular topics or perhaps gain better understanding through exposure to a different perspective on how they can be presented we have provided supplementary reading lists at the end of each chapter Our text contains many exercises You will encounter some in the middle of the chapters arranged to be closely allied to the subject at hand Others will be in the form of supplementary exercises at the end of the chapters Many of the exercises will be drill many others will extend and enlarge upon the text The more difficult problems are marked with a star Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic
