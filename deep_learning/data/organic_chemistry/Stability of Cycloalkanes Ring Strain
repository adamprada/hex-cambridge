Heat of Combustion as a Measure of Bond StrengthRing StrainThe Baeyer Theory on the Strain in Cycloalkane Rings QuestionsSolutionsContributors Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe the Baeyer strain theory describe how the measurement of heats of combustion provides information about the amount of strain present in a cycloalkane ring determine the relative stability of cyclic compounds by assessing such factors as angle strain torsional strain and steric strain Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below angle strain steric strain torsional strain ring strain heat of combustion Heat of Combustion as a Measure of Bond Strength The combustion of carbon compounds especially hydrocarbons has been the most important source of heat energy for human civilizations throughout recorded history The practical importance of this reaction cannot be denied but the massive and uncontrolled chemical changes that take place in combustion make it difficult to deduce mechanistic paths Using the combustion of propane as an example we see from the following equation that every covalent bond in the reactants has been broken and an entirely new set of covalent bonds have formed in the products No other common reaction involves such a profound and pervasive change and the mechanism of combustion is so complex that chemists are just beginning to explore and understand some of its elementary features Since all the covalent bonds in the reactant molecules are broken the quantity of heat evolved in this reaction and any other combustion reaction is related to the strength of these bonds and of course the strength of the bonds formed in the products Precise heat of combustion measurements can provide useful information about the structure of molecules and their relative stability For example heat of combustion is useful in determining the relative stability of isomers Pentane has a heat of combustion of kcalmol while that of its isomer dimethylpropane neopentane is kcalmol These values indicate that dimethylpentane is kcalmol more stable than pentane since it has a lower heat of combustion Ring Strain Table lists the heat of combustion data for some simple cycloalkanes These cycloalkanes do not have the same molecular formula so the heat of combustion per each CH unit present in each molecule is calculated the fourth column to provide a useful comparison From the data cyclopropane and cyclobutane have significantly higher heats of combustion per CH while cyclohexane has the lowest heat of combustion This indicates that cyclohexane is more stable than cyclopropane and cyclobutane and in fact that cyclohexane has a same relative stability as long chain alkanes that are not cyclic This difference in stability is seen in nature where six membered rings are by far the most common What causes the difference in stability or the strain in small cycloalkanes Table Heats of

stable than cyclohexane because the the smaller rings are more strained There are many different types of strain that contribute to the overall ring strain in cycloalkanes including angle strain torsional strain and steric strain Torsional strain and steric strain were previously defined in the discussion of conformations of butane Angle Strain occurs when the sp hybridized carbons in cycloalkanes do not have the expected ideal bond angle of o causing an increase in the potential energy An example of angle strain can be seen in the diagram of cyclopropane below in which the bond angle is o between the carbons The compressed bond angles causes poor overlap of the hybrid orbitals forming the carboncarbon sigma bonds which in turn creates destabilization The CCC bond angles in cyclopropane diagram above o and cyclobutane o are much different than the ideal bond angle of o This bond angle causes cyclopropane and cyclobutane to be less stable than molecules such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane which have a much lower ring strain because the bond angle between the carbons is much closer to o Changes in chemical reactivity as a consequence of angle strain are dramatic in the case of cyclopropane and are also evident for cyclobutane In addition to angle strain there is also steric transannular strain and torsional strain in many cycloalkanes Transannular strain exists when there is steric repulsion between atoms Because cycloalkane lack the ability to freely rotate torsional eclipsing strain exists when a cycloalkane is unable to adopt a staggered conformation around a CC bond Torsional strain is especially prevalent in small cycloalkanes such as cyclopropane whose structures are nearly planar The Eclipsed CH Bonds in Cyclopropane Larger rings like cyclohexane deal with torsional strain by forming conformers in which the rings are not planar A conformer is a stereoisomer in which molecules of the same connectivity and formula exist as different isomers in this case to reduce ring strain The ring strain is reduced in conformers due to the rotations around the sigma bonds which decreases the angle and torsional strain in the ring The nonplanar structures of cyclohexane are very stable compared to cyclopropane and cyclobutane and will be discussed in more detail in the next section The Types of Strain Which Contribute to Ring Strain in Cycloalkanes Angle Strain The strain caused by the increase or reduction of bond angles Torsional Strain The strain caused by eclipsing bonds on adjacent atoms Steric Strain The strain caused by the repulsive interactions of atoms trying to occupy the same space Exercise transDimethylcyclobutane is more stable than cisdimethylcyclobutane Explain this observation Answer The trans form does not have eclipsing methyl groups therefore lowering the energy within the molecule It does however have hydrogenmethyl eclipsing interactions which are not as high in energy as methylmethyl interactions Exercise Cyclobutane has more torsional stain than cyclopropane Explain this observation Answer Cyclobutane has CH groups while cyclopropane only has More CH groups means cyclobutane has more eclipsing HH interactions and therefore has more torsional strain Questions Q transDimethylcyclobutane is more stable than cisdimethylcyclobutane Explain this observation Solutions S The trans form does not have eclipsing methyl groups therefore lowering the energy within the molecule It does however have hydrogenmethyl interactions but are not as high in energy than methylmethyl interactions Contributors William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Kelly Matthews Senior Professor of Chemistry Harrisburg Area Community College Steven
