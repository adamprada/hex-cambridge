Possible Number of StereoisomersComparing Stereoisomerism with Structural Isomerism Learning Objective interpret the stereoisomerism of compounds with three or more chiral centers Possible Number of Stereoisomers In general a structure with n stereocenters will have n different stereoisomers We are not considering for the time being the stereochemistry of double bonds that will come later For example lets consider the glucose molecule in its openchain form recall that many sugar molecules can exist in either an openchain or a cyclic form There are two enantiomers of glucose called Dglucose and Lglucose The Denantiomer is the common sugar that our bodies use for energy It has n stereocenters so therefore there are n possible stereoisomers including Dglucose itself In Lglucose all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose That leaves diastereomers of Dglucose these are molecules in which at least one but not all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to Dglucose One of these diastereomers a sugar called Dgalactose is shown above in Dgalactose one of four stereocenters is inverted relative to Dglucose Diastereomers which differ in only one stereocenter out of two or more are called epimers Dglucose and Dgalactose can therefore be refered to as epimers as well as diastereomers The epimer term is useful because in biochemical pathways compounds with multiple chiral centers are isomerized at one specific center by enzymes known as epimerases Two examples of epimerasecatalyzed reactions are below Now lets extend our analysis to a sugar molecule with three chiral centers Going through all the possible combinations we come up with eight total stereoisomers four pairs of enantiomers Lets draw the RRR stereoisomer Being careful to draw the wedge bonds correctly so that they match the RRR configurations we get Now using the above drawing as our model drawing any other stereoisomer is easy If we want to draw the enantiomer of RRR we dont need to try to visualize the mirror image we just start with the RRR structure and invert the configuration at every chiral center to get SSS Try making models of RRR and SSS and confirm that they are in fact nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other There are six diastereomers of RRR To draw one of them we just invert the configuration of at least one but not all three of the chiral centers Lets invert the configuration at chiral center and but leave chiral center unchanged This gives us the SSR configuration One more definition at this point diastereomers which differ at only a single chiral center are called epimers For example RRR and SRR are epimers The RRR and SSR stereoisomers shown earlier are diastereomers but not epimers because they differ at two of the three chiral centers Example Draw the structure of the enantiomer of the SRS stereoisomer of the sugar used in the previous example List using the XXX format not drawing the structures all of the epimers of SRS List all of the stereoisomers that are diastereomers but not epimers of SRS Solutions to exercises Solution Add text here Example The sugar below is one of the stereoisomers that we have been discussing The only problem is it is drawn with the carbon backbone in a different orientation from what we have seen Determine the configuration at each chiral center to determine which stereoisomer it is Exercise Draw the enantiomer of the xylulosephosphate structure in the previous figure Exercise The structure of the amino acid Dthreonine drawn without stereochemistry is shown below Dthreonine has the S configuration at both of its chiral centers Draw Dthreonine its enantiomer and its two diastereomers Answer Solutions to exercises Comparing Stereoisomerism with Structural Isomerism Dglucose and Dfructose are not stereoisomers because they have different bonding connectivity glucose has an aldehyde group while fructose has a ketone The two sugars do however have the same molecular formula so by definition they are constitutional isomers Dglucose and Dribose are not isomers of any kind because they have different molecular formulas Exercise Identify the relationship between each pair of structures Your choices are not isomers constitutional isomers diastereomers but not epimers epimers enantiomers or same molecule Exercise Identify the relationship between each pair of structures Hint figure out the configuration of each chiral center Solutions to exercises Kahn Academy video tutorial on stereoisomeric relationships Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
