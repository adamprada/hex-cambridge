Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of AcetylidesNucleophilic Addition of Acetylides to CarbonylsContributors and Attributions Learning Objective predict the products and specify the reagents to synthesize larger alkynes with acetylide ions Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of Acetylides Acetylide anions are strong bases and strong nucleophiles Therefore they are able to displace halides and other leaving groups in substitution reactions The product is a substituted alkyne with a longer continuous carbon chain Because the ion is a very strong base the substitution reaction follows the SN mechanism and is most efficient with methyl or primary halides without substitution near the reaction center Secondary tertiary or even bulky primary substrates will give elimination by the E mechanism Nucleophilic Addition of Acetylides to Carbonyls Acetylide anions will add to aldehydes and ketones to form alkoxides that are subsequently protonated to form propargyl alcohols With aldehydes and nonsymmetric ketones in the absence of chiral catalyst the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers Exercise The pKa of ammonia is Estimate the equilibrium constant for the deprotonation of pentyne by amide as shown above Give the possible reactants for the following formations Propose a synthetic route to produce pentene from propyne and an alkyl halide Answer Assuming the pKa of pentyne is about then the difference in pKas is Since pentyne is more acidic the formation of the acetylide will be favored at equilibrium so the equilibrium constant for the reaction is about Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Prof Paul G Wenthold Purdue University
