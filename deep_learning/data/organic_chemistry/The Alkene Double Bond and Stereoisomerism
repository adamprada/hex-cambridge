Steroisomerism in AlkenesGeometric Isomers have Different Physical PropertiesReferencesOutside LinksContributors and Attributions Learning Objective recognize and classify the stereochemistry of alkenes using the cistrans system Steroisomerism in Alkenes There is free rotation about the carbontocarbon single bonds CC in alkanes For example in dichloroethane there is free rotation about the CC bond The two models shown represent exactly the same molecule they are not isomers You can draw structural formulas that look different but if you bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bonds you should recognize that these two structures represent the same molecule In contrast the structure of alkenes requires that the carbon atoms of a double bond and the two atoms bonded to each carbon atom all lie in a single plane and that each doubly bonded carbon atom lies in the center of a triangle This part of the molecules structure is rigid rotation about doubly bonded carbon atoms is not possible without rupturing the bond In dichloroethene restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond become significant This leads to a special kind of isomerism The isomer in which the two chlorine Cl atoms lie on the same side of the molecule is called the cis isomer Latin cis meaning on this side and is named cisdichloroethene The isomer with the two Cl atoms on opposite sides of the molecule is the trans isomer Latin trans meaning across and is named transdichloroethene These two compounds are cistrans isomers or geometric isomers compounds that have different configurations groups permanently in different places in space because of the presence of a rigid structure in their molecule The diagram below summarizes the differences between alkanes and alkenes with respect to rotation where the carbons are red hydrogens are offwhite and the chlorines are green In dichloroethane a free rotation about the CC bond allows the two structures to be interconverted by a twist of one end relative to the other In dichloroethene b restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond are significant Geometric Isomers have Different Physical Properties Consider the alkene with the condensed structural formula CHCHCHCH We could name it butene but there are actually two such compounds the double bond results in cistrans isomerism Cisbutene has both methyl groups on the same side of the molecule Transbutene has the methyl groups on opposite sides of the molecule as shown in the diagram below Cisbutene and transbutene are unique compounds with slightly different physical properties as shown below For stereospecific reactions these compounds produce different stereoisomeric products under the same reaction conditions This phenonenom of reactivity will be explored more closely in the next chapter on alkene reactivity Example Which compounds can exist as cistrans geometric isomers Draw them CHClCHBr CHCBrCH CHCCHCHCH CHCHCHCHCH Solutions Explained All four structures have a double bond and thus meet rule for cistrans isomerism This compound meets rule it has two nonidentical groups on each carbon atom H and Cl on one and H and Br on the other It exists as both cis and trans isomers This compound has two hydrogen atoms on one of its doubly bonded carbon atoms it fails rule and does not exist as cis and trans isomers This compound has two methyl CH groups on one of its doubly bonded carbon atoms It fails rule and does not exist as cis and trans isomers This compound meets rule it has two nonidentical groups on each carbon atom and exists as both cis and trans isomers Exercise Exercise If the compound below can exist as cistrans isomers then draw both bondline structures CHCHCHCHCH CHCHCHCHCH CHCHCHCHCHCH CHCCHCHCH CHCCHCHCH Write out the condensed structure for ethene Draw the Kekul√© Lewis structure for ethene Draw the bondline structure for ethene Why is it that the carbons in ethene cannot freely rotate around the carboncarbon double bond Answer CHCH The carboncarbon double bond is not shown but can be recognized by knowing the neutral bonding patterns of carbon Note how easy it would be to misinterpret this small dash therefore the structure for ethene is typically shown with a condensed or Kekule structure The carbons cannot freely rotate about the carboncarbon double bond because rotating porbitals would have to pass through a point where there would no longer be any overlap so the bond would have to break for there to be free rotation References Vollhardt K PC Shore N Organic Chemistry th Ed New York W H Freeman Outside
