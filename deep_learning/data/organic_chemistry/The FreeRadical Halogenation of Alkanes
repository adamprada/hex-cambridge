Alkanes the most basic of all organic compounds undergo very few reactions One of these reactions is halogenation or the substitution of a single hydrogen on the alkane for a single halogen to form a haloalkane This reaction is very important in organic chemistry because it opens a gateway to further chemical reactions Introduction While the reactions possible with alkanes are few there are many reactions that involve haloalkanes In order to better understand the mechanism a detailed look at the step by step process through which a reaction occurs we will closely examine the chlorination of methane When methane CH and chlorine Cl are mixed together in the absence of light at room temperature nothing happens However if the conditions are changed so that either the reaction is taking place at high temperatures denoted by Δ or there is ultra violet irradiation a product is formed chloromethane CHCl Energetics Why does this reaction occur Is the reaction favorable A way to answer these questions is to look at the change in enthalpy that occurs when the reaction takes place ΔH Energy put into reaction Energy given off from reaction If more energy is put into a reaction than is given off the ΔH is positive the reaction is endothermic and not energetically favorable If more energy is given off in the reaction than was put in the ΔH is negative the reaction is said to be exothermic and is considered favorable The figure below illustrates the difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions ΔH can also be calculated using bond dissociation energies ΔH Lets look at our specific example of the chlorination of methane to determine if it is endothermic or exothermic Since the ΔH for the chlorination of methane is negative the reaction is exothermic Energetically this reaction is favorable In order to better understand this reaction we need to look at the mechanism a detailed step by step look at the reaction showing how it occurs by which the reaction occurs Radical Chain Mechanism The reaction proceeds through the radical chain mechanism The radical chain mechanism is characterized by three steps initiation propagation and termination Initiation requires an input of energy but after that the reaction is selfsustaining The first propagation step uses up one of the products from initiation and the second propagation step makes another one thus the cycle can continue until indefinitely Step Initiation Initiation breaks the bond between the chlorine molecule Cl For this step to occur energy must be put in this step is not energetically favorable After this step the reaction can occur continuously as long as reactants provide without input of more energy It is important to note that this part of the mechanism cannot occur without some external energy input through light or heat Step Propagation The next two steps in the mechanism are called propagation steps In the first propagation step a chlorine radical combines with a hydrogen on the methane This gives hydrochloric acid HCl the inorganic product of this reaction and the methyl radical In the second propagation step more of the chlorine starting material Cl is used one of the chlorine atoms becomes a radical and the other combines with the methyl radical The first propagation step is endothermic meaning it takes in heat requires kcalmol and is not energetically favorable In contrast the second propagation step is exothermic releasing kcalmol Once the reaction is initiated the exothermic energy released from the second propagation step provides the activation energy for the first propagation step creating a cyclic chain reaction following Le Chateliers principle until termination Step Termination In the termination steps all the remaining radicals combine in all possible manners to form more product CHCl more reactant Cl and even combinations of the two methyl radicals to form a side product of ethane CHCH Limitations of the Chlorination The chlorination of methane or any other alkane does not necessarily stop after one chlorination It may actually be very hard to get a monosubstituted chloromethane Instead di tri and even tetrachloromethanes are formed One way to avoid this problem is to use a much higher concentration of methane or other alkane in comparison to chloride This reduces the chance of a chlorine radical running into a chloromethane and starting the mechanism over again to form a dichloromethane Through this method of controlling product ratios one is able to have a relative amount of control over the product Exercises Compounds other than chlorine and methane can react via freeradical halogenation Write out the complete mechanism for the monobromination of ethane Explain how the energetically unfavorable first propagation step can continue to occur without the input of energy from an external source Which step of the radical chain mechanism requires outside energy What can be used as this energy Use the table provided below to calculate the change in enthalpy for the monobromination of ethane Compound Bond Dissociation Energy kcalmol CHCHH CHCHBr HBr Br Solutions The exothermic energy released from the second propagation step provides the activation energy for the first propagation step creating a cyclic chain reaction following Le Chateliers principle until termination The initiation step requires energy from heat o lit For maximum photoefficiency the wavelength of light is correlated with bond being homolytically cleaved References Matyjaszewski Krzysztof Wojciech Jakubowski Ke Min Wei Tang Jinyu
