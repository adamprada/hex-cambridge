A Bond Angles and BallandStick ModelsB Bond Lengths and SpaceFilling ModelsContributors and Attributions The size and shape of molecules are as much a part of molecular structure as is the order in which the component atoms are bonded Contrary to the impression you may get from structural formulas complex molecules are not flat and formless but have welldefined spatial arrangements that are determined by the lengths and directional character of their chemical bonds It is not easy to visualize the possible arrangements of the bonds in space and it is very helpful to have some kind of mechanical model that reflects the molecular geometry including at least an approximation to the relative lengths of the bonds Ballandstick models such as the ones used by Paterno Section D fill this purpose admirably A Bond Angles and BallandStick Models It is well established that the normal carbon atom forms its four single bonds in compounds of the type so that the four attached atoms lie at the corners of a regular tetrahedron The bond angles are and this value is the normal valence angle of carbon For many purposes ballandstick models of organic compounds give useful information about the spatial relationships of the atoms and for the angles between sticks are set at Figure Organic molecules strongly resist deformation forces that alter their valence angles from normal values Therefore ballandstick models correspond better to the behavior of actual molecules if the connectors representing single bonds are made to be rather stiff Figure Ballandstick model of Figure Ballandstick models of some simple organic molecules Whereas methane is tetrahedral ethene is not According to the best available physical measurements all six atoms of ethene lie in a single plane and the bond angles are Methanal formaldehyde also is a planar molecule with an bond angle of Models of ethene and methanal can be built with ballandstick models by using flexible couplings or bent sticks to form the double bonds Figure but the angles are inaccurate because they are rather than the observed to Ethyne has been established experimentally to be a linear molecule that is the bond angle is This geometry also results with ballandstick models if the triple bond is constructed of three flexible couplings or bent sticks as shown in Figure Structural units that have valence angles substantially less than the tetrahedral value include double and triple bonds and small rings such as cyclopropane Several bent bonds are required to construct models of compounds containing these units Interestingly such compounds are much less stable and more reactive than otherwise similar molecules for which models can be constructed with straight sticks at tetrahedral angles B Bond Lengths and SpaceFilling Models The length of a chemical bond is the average distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms regardless of where the bonding electrons happen to be The customary unit of length is the angstrom and measurements often can be made with an accuracy of by using the techniques of molecular spectroscopy xray diffraction for crystalline solids and electron diffraction for volatile compounds Bond lengths vary considerably with structure and depend on the identity of both atoms the type of bonding single double or triple and the nature of other atoms or groups bonded to the two atoms in question These effects are apparent in the data of Table which lists the bond lengths in several simple organic compounds Multiple bonds double or triple clearly are shorter than single bonds and it can be stated as a general observation that the more bonding electrons in a given bond the shorter and stronger the bond The lengths of single bonds also vary significantly depending on what other atoms or groups are attached to the carbons Thus Table shows that single bonds become progressively shorter as the number of multiple bonds or electronegative atoms attached to the carbons increases Although molecular models cannot represent the subtle variations in bond lengths and bond angles that actual molecules exhibit most kinds of commercially available molecular models do attempt to reproduce relative bond lengths with some degree of reality In the ballandstick type the sticks usually come in various lengths to simulate different kinds of bonds bonds typically are scaled to represent bonds to be and and to be correspondingly shorter In some model sets the bonds can be cut to any desired length While the ballandstick models of molecules are very useful for visualizing the relative positions of the atoms in space they are unsatisfactory whenever we also want to show how large the atoms are Actually atomic radii are so large relative to the lengths of chemical bonds that when a model of a molecule such as methyl chloride is constructed with atomic radii and bond lengths both to scale the bonds connecting the atoms are not clearly evident None theless such spacefilling models made with truncated balls held together with snap fasteners are used widely to determine the possible closeness of approach of groups to each other and the degree of crowding of atoms in various arrangements see Figure Especially excellent but expensive models used for this purpose are the CoreyPaulingKolton CPK models Figure shows how the CPK models can indicate intense molecular crowding as between the bromines in dibromonaphthalene a close relative of dibromobenzene mentioned in Section G As we shall see such crowding has many chemical consequences Ideally a model should reflect not only the size and shape of the molecule it represents but also the flexibility of the molecule By this we mean that Figure CPK spacefilling models of organic compounds it should simulate the type of motions available to the molecule particularly bond rotation For example it is known that rotation normally occurs about single bonds in openchain compounds but is restricted about double bonds Motions of this kind are demonstrated easily with ballandstick models but are not at all obvious with the spacefilling type For this reason ballandstick models or their equivalent are more generally useful than the spacefilling models for visualizing structures and the positions of the atoms relative to one another The angstrom unit likely will be replaced eventually
