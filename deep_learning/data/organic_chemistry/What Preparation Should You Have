Contributors and Attributions We have tried to give you a taste of the beginnings of organic chemistry and a few of the important principles that brought order out of the confusion that existed as to the nature of organic compounds Before moving on to other matters it may be well to give you some ideas of what kind of preparation will be helpful to you in learning about organic chemistry from this textbook The most important thing you can bring is a strong desire to master the subject We hope you already have some knowledge of general chemistry and that you already will have had experience with simple inorganic compounds That you will know for example that elemental bromine is and a noxious dark redbrown corrosive liquid that sulfuric acid is a syrupy colorless liquid that reacts with water with the evolution of considerable heat and is a strong acid that sodium hydroxide is a colorless solid that dissolves in water to give a strongly alkaline solution It is important to know the characteristics of acids and bases how to write simple balanced chemical reactions such as and what the concept of a mole of a chemical substance is and to be somewhat familiar with the periodic table of the elements as well as with the metric system at least insofar as grams liters and degrees centigrade are concerned Among other things you also should understand the basic ideas of the differences between salts and covalent compounds as well as between gases liquids and solids what a solution is the laws of conservation of mass and energy the elements of how to derive the Lewis electron structures of simple molecules such as water that and how to calculate molecular formulas from percentage compositions and molecular weights We shall use no mathematics more advanced than simple algebra but we do expect that you can use logarithms and are able to carry through the following conversions forward and backward The above is an incomplete list given to illustrate the level of preparation we are presuming in this text If you find very much of this list partly or wholly unfamiliar you dont have to give up but have a good general chemistry textbook available for study and reference and use it Some useful general chemistry books are listed at the end of the chapter A fourplace table of logarithms will be necessary a set of ballandstick models and a chemical handbook will be very helpful as would be a small electronic calculator or slide rule to carry out the simple arithmetic required for many of the exercises In the next section we review some general chemistry regarding saltlike and covalent compounds that will be of special relevance to our later discussions Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
