Bonding in acetyleneComparison of CC bonds Ethane Ethylene and AcetyleneHybridization SummaryExercisesSolutionsQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to use the concept of sp hybridization to account for the formation of carboncarbon triple bonds and describe a carboncarbon triple bond as consisting of one σ bond and two π bonds list the approximate bond lengths associated with typical carboncarbon single bonds double bonds and triple bonds You may need to review Sections and list the approximate bond angles associated with sp sp and sphybridized carbon atoms and predict the bond angles to be expected in given organic compounds If necessary review Sections and account for the differences in bond length bond strength and bond angles found in compounds containing sp sp and sphybridized carbon atoms such as ethane ethylene and acetylene Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below sp hybrid orbital Study Notes The bond angles associated with sp sp and sphybridized carbon atoms are approximately and respectively Bonding in acetylene Finally the hybrid orbital concept applies well to triplebonded groups such as alkynes and nitriles Consider for example the structure of ethyne another common name is acetylene the simplest alkyne This molecule is linear all four atoms lie in a straight line The carboncarbon triple bond is only Å long In the hybrid orbital picture of acetylene both carbons are sphybridized In an sphybridized carbon the s orbital combines with the px orbital to form two sp hybrid orbitals that are oriented at an angle of with respect to each other eg along the x axis The py and pz orbitals remain nonhybridized and are oriented perpendicularly along the y and z axes respectively The CC sigma bond is formed by the overlap of one sp orbital from each of the carbons while the two CH sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of the second sp orbital on each carbon with a s orbital on a hydrogen Each carbon atom still has two halffilled py and pz orbitals which are perpendicular both to each other and to the line formed by the sigma bonds These two perpendicular pairs of p orbitals form two pi bonds between the carbons resulting in a triple bond overall one sigma bond plus two pi bonds Acetylene is said to have three sigma bonds and two pi bonds The carboncarbon triple bond in acetylene is the shortest pm and the strongest kJmol of the carboncarbon bond types Because each carbon in acetylene has two electron groups VSEPR predicts a linear

Notice that as the bond order increases the bond length decreases and the bond strength increases The hybrid orbital concept nicely explains another experimental observation single bonds adjacent to double and triple bonds are progressively shorter and stronger than normal single bonds such as the one in a simple alkane The carboncarbon bond in ethane structure A below results from the overlap of two sp orbitals In propene B however the carboncarbon single bond is the result of overlap between an sp orbital and an sp orbital while in propyne C the carboncarbon single bond is the result of overlap between an sp orbital and an sp orbital These are all single bonds but the single bond in molecule C is shorter and stronger than the one in B which is in turn shorter and stronger than the one in A The explanation here is relatively straightforward An sp orbital is composed of one s orbital and one p orbital and thus it has s character and p character sp orbitals by comparison have s character and p character while sp orbitals have s character and p character Because of their spherical shape s orbitals are smaller and hold electrons closer and tighter to the nucleus compared to p orbitals Consequently bonds involving sp sp overlap as in alkyne C are shorter and stronger than bonds involving sp sp overlap as in alkene B Bonds involving spspoverlap as in alkane A are the longest and weakest of the group because of the p character of the hybrids Hybridization Summary A single bond is a sigma bond A double bond is made up of a sigma bond and a pi bond A triple bond is made up of a sigma bond and two pi bonds Sigma bonds are made by the overlap of two hybrid orbitals or the overlap of a hybrid orbital and a s orbital from hydrogen Pi bonds are made by the overlap of two unhybridized p orbitals Lone pair electrons are usually contained in hybrid orbitals The hybrid orbitals used and hence the hybridization depends on how many electron groups are around the atom in question An electron group can mean either a bonded atom or a lone pair Molecular geometry is also decided by the number of electron groups so it is directly linked to hybridization of Electron Groups

Questions Q Cyclohexyne is a very strained molecule By looking at the molecule explain why there is such a intermolecular strain using the knowledge of hybridization and bond angles Solutions S The alkyne is a sp hybridized orbital By looking at a sp orbital we can see that the bond angle is but in cyclohexane the regular angles would be Therefore the molecule would be strained to force the to
