A Heuristic View of the Cumulative Distribution Function Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers We can use these ideas to create a plot that approximates the cumulative probability distribution function given any set of measurements of a random variable To do so we put the values found in our measurements in order from smallest to largest We label the ordered values where is the smallest By the argument that we develop in the previous section the probability of observing a value less than is about If we were to make a large number of additional measurements a fraction of about of this large number of additional measurements would be less than This fraction is just so we reason that The probability of observing a value between and is also about so the probability of observing a value less than is about and we expect In general the probability of observing a value between and is also about and the probability of observing a value less than is about In other words we expect the cumulative probability distribution function for to be such that the smallest observation corresponds to The quantity is often called the rank probability of the data point Figure An approximate cumulative probability distribution function Figure is a sketch of the sigmoid shape that we usually expect to find when we plot versus the value of This plot approximates the cumulative probability distribution function We expect the sigmoid shape because we expect the observed values of to bunch up around their average value If within some domain of values all possible values of were equally likely we would expect the difference between successive observed values of to be roughly constant which would make the plot look approximately linear At any value of the slope of the curve is just the probabilitydensity function These ideas mean that we can test whether the experimental data are described by any particular mathematical model say To do so we use the mathematical model to predict each of the N rank probability values That is to say we calculate if describes the data well we will find for all Graphically we can test the validity of the relationship by plotting versus If describes the data well this plot will be approximately linear with a slope of one In Section we introduce the normal distribution which is a mathematical model that describes a great many sources of experimental observations The normal distribution is a distribution function that involves two parameters the mean and the standard deviation The ideas we have discussed can be used to develop a particular graph paperusually called normal probability paper If the data are normally distributed plotting them on this paper produces an approximately straight line We can do essentially the same test without benefit of special graph paper by calculating the average and the estimated standard deviation from the experimental data Calculating and is discussed below Using and as estimates of and we can find the modelpredicted probability of observing a value of the random variable that is less than This value is for a normal distribution whose mean is and whose standard deviation is We can find by using standard tables usually called the normal curve of error in mathematical compilations by numerically integrating the normal distributions probability density function or by using a function embedded in a spreadsheet program like Excel If the data are described by the normal distribution function this value must be approximately equal to the rank probability that is we expect A plot of versus will be approximately linear with a slope of about one
