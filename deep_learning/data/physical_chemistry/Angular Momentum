Momentum A particle moving with momentum p at a position r relative to some coordinate origin has socalled orbital angular momentum equal to The three components of this angular momentum vector in a Cartesian coordinate system located at the origin mentioned above are given in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of and as follows L_z x p_y y p_x L_x y p_z z p_y L_y z p_x x p_z Using the fundamental commutation relations among the Cartesian coordinates and the Cartesian momenta q_k p_j q_k p_j p_j q_k ihbar delta_jk jk xyz which are proven by considering quantities of the from x p_x p_x xfihbar leftxfracpartial fpartial xfracpartial xfpartial xrightihbar f it can be shown that the above angular momentum operators obey the following set of commutation relations Although the components of do not commute with one another they can be shown to commute with the operator defined by This new operator is referred to as the square of the total angular momentum operator The commutation properties of the components of allow us to conclude that complete sets of functions can be found that are eigenfunctions of and of one but not more than one component of It is convention to select this one component as and to label the resulting simultaneous eigenstates of and as according to the corresponding eigenvalues These eigenfunctions of and of will not in general be eigenfunctions of either or of This means that any measurement of or will necessarily change the wave function if it begins as an eigenfunction of The above expressions for and can be mapped into quantum mechanical operators by substituting and as the corresponding coordinate operators and and for and respectively The resulting operators can then be transformed into spherical coordinates the results of which are Properties of General Angular Momenta There are many types of angular momenta that one encounters in chemistry Orbital angular momenta such as that introduced above arise in electronic motion in atoms in atomatom and electronatom collisions and in rotational motion in molecules Intrinsic spin angular momentum is present in electrons and many other nuclei In this Section we will deal with the behavior of any and all angular momenta and their corresponding eigenfunctions At times an atom or molecule contains more than one type of angular momentum The Hamiltonians interaction potentials present in a particular species may or may not cause these individual angular momenta to be coupled to an appreciable extent ie the Hamiltonian may or may not contain terms that refer simultaneously to two or more of these angular momenta For example the ion which has a ground electronic state its electronic configuration is has electronic spin electronic orbital and molecular rotational angular momenta The full Hamiltonian contains terms that couple the electronic spin and orbital angular momenta thereby causing them individually to not commute with In such cases the eigenstates of the system can be labeled rigorously only by angular momentum quantum numbers and belonging to the total angular momentum operators and The total angular momentum of a collection of individual angular momenta is defined componentbycomponent as follows where labels and and labels the constituents whose angular momenta couple to produce J For the remainder of this Section we will study eigenfunctioneigenvalue relationships that are characteristic of all angular momenta and which are consequences of the commutation relations among the angular momentum vectors three components We will also study how one combines eigenfunctions of two or more angular momenta to produce eigenfunctions of the total a Consequences of the Commutation Relations Any set of three operators that obey will be taken to define an angular momentum whose square commutes with all three of its components It is useful to also introduce two combinations of the three fundamental operators and and to refer to them as raising and lowering operators for reasons that will be made clear below These new operators can be shown to obey the following commutation relations Using only the above commutation properties it is possible to prove important properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of and Let us assume that we have found a set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of and the fact that these two operators commute tells us that this is possible Let us label the eigenvalues belonging to these functions in terms of the quantities and Although we certainly hint that these quantities must be related to certain and quantum numbers we have not yet proven this although we will soon do so For now we view and simply as symbols that represent the respective eigenvalues Because both and are Hermitian eigenfunctions belonging to different or quantum numbers must be orthogonal We now prove several identities that are needed to discover the information about the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of general angular momenta that we are after Later in this Section the essential results are summarized i There is a Maximum and a Minimum Eigenvalue for Because all of the components of are Hermitian and because the scalar product of any function with itself is positive semidefinite the following identity holds langle jmtextbfJ_x textbfJ_yjmrangle langle textbfJ_xlangle jm textbfJ_xjmrangle langle textbfJ_ylangle jm textbfJ_yjmrangle ge However is equal to so this inequality implies that which in turn implies that must be less than or equal to Hence for any value of the total angular momentum eigenvalue the zprojection eigenvalue must have a maximum and a minimum value and both of these must be less than or equal to the total angular momentum squared eigenvalue ii The Raising and Lowering Operators Change the Eigenvalue but not the Eigenvalue When Acting on Applying the commutation relations obeyed by to yields another useful result Now using the fact that is an eigenstate of and of these identities give textbfJ_z textbfJ_pm jmrangle mhbar pm hbar textbfJ_pm jmrangle h m jmrangle These equations prove that the functions must either themselves be eigenfunctions of and with eigenvalues and respectively or must equal zero In the former case we see that acting on generates a new eigenstate with the same eigenvalue as but with one unit of h higher or lower in eigenvalue It is for this reason that we call raising and lowering operators Notice that although is indeed an eigenfunction of with eigenvalue is not identical to it is only proportional to Explicit expressions for these coefficients will be obtained below Notice also that because the and hence have the same eigenvalue as in fact sequential application of can be used to show that all for all have this same eigenvalue the eigenvalue must be independent of m For this reason can be labeled by one quantum number j iii The Eigenvalues are Related to the Maximum and Minimum Eigenvalues Which are Related to One Another Earlier we showed that there exists a maximum and a minimum value for m for any given total angular momentum It is when one reaches these limiting cases that applies In particular Applying the following identities respectively to and gives which immediately gives the eigenvalue and in terms of or So we now know the eigenvalues for and However we earlier showed that and have the same eigenvalue when we treated the effect of on and that the eigenvalue is independent of m If we therefore define the quantum number to be we see that the eigenvalues are given by We also see that from which it follows that iv The Quantum Number Can Be Integer or HalfInteger The fact that the values run from to in unit steps because of the property of the operators there clearly can be only integer or halfinteger values for In the former case the quantum number runs over in the latter runs over Only integer and halfinteger values can range from to in steps of unity Species whose intrinsic angular momenta are integers are known as Bosons and those with halfinteger spin are called Fermions v More on Using the above results for the effect of acting on and the fact that and are adjoints of one another two operators and are adjoints if for all and all allows us to write where is the proportionality constant between and the normalized function Likewise the effect of can be expressed as where is the proportionality constant between and the normalized Thus we can solve for after which the effect of on is given by Summary The above results apply to any angular momentum operators The essential findings can be summarized as follows i and have complete sets of simultaneous eigenfunctions We label these eigenfunctions they are orthonormal in both their m and jtype indices ii These eigenfunctions obey iii The raising and lowering operators act on to yield functions that are eigenfunctions of with the same eigenvalue as and eigenfunctions of with eigenvalue of iv When acts on the extremal states or respectively the result is zero The results given above are as stated general Any and all angular momenta have quantum mechanical operators that obey these equations It is convention to designate specific kinds of angular momenta by specific letters however it should be kept in mind that no matter what letters are used there are operators corresponding to and that obey relations as specified above and there are eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that have all of the properties obtained above For electronic or collisional orbital angular momenta it is common to use and for electron spin S and Sz are used for nuclear spin I and Iz are most common and for molecular rotational angular momentum N and Nz are most common although sometimes and may be used Whenever two or more angular momenta are combined or coupled to produce a total angular momentum the latter is designated by and Coupling of Angular Momenta If the Hamiltonian under study contains terms that couple two or more angular momenta then only the components of the total angular momentum and the total will commute with It is therefore essential to label the quantum states of the system by the eigenvalues of and and to construct variational trial or model wave functions that are eigenfunctions of these total angular momentum operators The problem of angular momentum coupling has to do with how to combine eigenfunctions of the uncoupled angular momentum operators which are given as simple products of the eigenfunctions of the individual angular momenta to form eigenfunctions of and a Eigenfunctions of Because the individual elements of are formed additively but is not it is straightforward to form eigenstates of simple products of the form are eigenfunctions of and have eigenvalues equal to the sum of the individual eigenvalues Hence to form an eigenfunction with specified and eigenvalues one must combine only those product states whose sum is equal to the specified value b Eigenfunctions of the ClebschGordon Series The task is then reduced to forming eigenfunctions given particular values for the quantum numbers When coupling pairs of angular momenta and the total angular momentum states can be written according to what we determined above as where the coefficients are called vector coupling coefficients because angular momentum coupling is viewed much like adding two vectors and to produce another vector and where the sum over and is restricted to those terms for which It is more common to express the vector coupling or socalled ClebschGordon CG coefficients as and to view them as elements of a matrix whose columns are labeled by the coupledstate quantum numbers and whose rows are labeled by the quantum numbers characterizing the uncoupled product basis It turns out that this matrix can be shown to be unitary so that the CG coefficients obey sum_mm langle jmjmJMrangle langle jmjmJMrangle delta_jjprime delta_mmprime and sum_JM langle jnjnJMrangle langle jmjmJMrangle delta_nm delta_nm This unitarity of the CG coefficient matrix allows the inverse of the relation giving coupled functions in terms of the product functions to be written as This result expresses the product functions in terms of the coupled angular momentum functions c Generation of the ClebschGordon Coefficients The ClebschGordon coefficients can be generated in a systematic manner however they can also be looked up in books where they have been tabulated eg see Table of R N Zare Angular Momentum John Wiley New York Here we will demonstrate the technique by which the CG coefficients can be obtained but we will do so for rather limited cases and refer the reader to more extensive tabulations for more cases The strategy we take is to generate the state ie the state with maximum value and to then use to generate after which the state ie the state with one lower value is constructed by finding a combination of the product states in terms of which is expressed because both and have the same value which is orthogonal to because and are eigenfunctions of the Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues they must be orthogonal This same process is then used to generate and by orthogonality construction and so on i The States With Maximum and Minimum MValues We begin with the state having the highest value This state must be formed by taking the highest and the highest values ie and and is given by Only this one product is needed because only the one term with mj and mj contributes to the sum in the above CG series The state with the minimum value is also given as a single product state Notice that these states have values given as since this is the maximum value it must be that the value corresponding to this state is ii States With One Lower MValue But the Same Value Applying to and expressing as the sum of lowering operators for the two individual angular momenta gives This result expresses as follows that is the state which has is formed from the two product states and that have this same value iii States With One Lower Value To find the state that has the same value as the one found above but one lower value we must construct another combination of the two product states with ie and that is orthogonal to the combination representing after doing so we must scale the resulting function so it is properly normalized In this case the desired function is It is straightforward to show that this function is indeed orthogonal to iv States With Even One Lower Value Having expressed and in terms of and we are now prepared to carry on with this stepwise process to generate the states and as combinations of the product states with These product states are and Notice that there are precisely as many product states whose values add up to the desired value as there are total angular momentum states that must be constructed there are three of each in this case The steps needed to find the state are analogous to those taken above One first applies to and to to obtain and respectively as combinations of and One then constructs as a linear combination of the and that is orthogonal to the combinations found for and Once is obtained it is then possible to move on to form and by applying to the three states obtained in the preceding application of the process and to then form as the combination of that is orthogonal to the combinations obtained for and Again notice that there are precisely the correct number of product states four here as there are total angular momentum states to be formed In fact the product states and the total angular momentum states are equal in number and are both members of orthonormal function sets because and as well as and are Hermitian operators which have complete sets of orthonormal eigenfunctions This is why the CG coefficient matrix is unitary because it maps one set of orthonormal functions to another with both sets containing the same number of functions d An Example Example Let us consider an example in which the spin and orbital angular momenta of the Si atom in its ground state can be coupled to produce various states In this case the specific values for and are and We could of course take and but the final wave functions obtained would span the same space as those we are about to determine The state with highest value is the state which can be represented by the product of an spin function representing and a spatial function representing where the first function corresponds to the first openshell orbital and the second function to the second openshell orbital Thus the maximum value is and corresponds to a state with Clearly the state would be given as The states and with one lower value are obtained by applying to as follows To apply or to one must realize that each of these operators is in turn a sum of lowering operators for each of the two openshell electrons The result above can therefore be continued as So the function is given by which can be rewritten as Writing the result in this way makes it clear that is a combination of the product states the terms containing and the terms containing There is a good chance that some readers have noticed that some of the terms in the function would violate the Pauli exclusion principle In particular the term places two electrons into the same orbitals and with the same spin Indeed this electronic function would indeed violate the Pauli principle and it should not be allowed to contribute to the final Si wave functions we are trying to form The full resolution of how to deal with this paradox is given in the following Subsection but for now let me say the following i Once you have learned that all of the spinorbital product functions shown for eg and represent Slater determinants we deal with this in the next Subsection that are antisymmetric with respect to permutation of any pair of electrons you will understand that the Slater determinant corresponding to vanishes ii If instead of considering the configuration of Si we wanted to generate wave functions for the states of Si the same analysis as shown above would pertain except that now the state would have a contribution from This contribution does not violate the Pauli principle and its Slater determinant does not vanish So for the remainder of this treatment of the states of Si dont worry about terms arising that violate the Pauli principle they will not contribute because their Slater determinants will vanish To form the other function with the state we must find another combination of and that is orthogonal to and is normalized Since we immediately see that the requisite function is In the spinorbital notation used above this state is Thus far we have found the states with and To find the states with and we must once again apply the tool In particular we apply to to obtain and we apply to to obtain each of which will be expressed in terms of and The state is then constructed to be a combination of these same product states which is orthogonal to and to The results are as follows JMrangle fracsqrt rangle rangle rangle rangle rangle rangle where in all cases a short hand notation has been used in which the product stated have been represented by their quantum numbers with the spin function always appearing first in the product To finally express all three of these new functions in terms of spinorbital products it is necessary to give the products with in terms of these products For the spin functions we have For the orbital product function we have e Coupling Angular Momenta of Equivalent Electrons If equivalent angular momenta are coupled eg to couple the orbital angular momenta of a or configuration there is a tool one can use to determine which of the term symbols violate the Pauli principle To carry out this step one forms all possible unique determinental product states with nonnegative and values and arranges them into groups according to their and values For example the boxes appropriate to the orbital occupancy that we considered earlier for Si are shown below MS ML pα pα pα pα pα pβ pα pβ pα pβ pα pβ pαpβ pα pβ There is no need to form the corresponding states with negative or negative values because they are simply mirror images of those listed above For example the state with and is which can be obtained from the state by replacing a by b and replacing by Given the box entries one can identify those term symbols that arise by applying the following procedure over and over until all entries have been accounted for One identifies the highest value this gives a value of the total spin quantum number that arises in the box For the above example the answer is For all product states of this value one identifies the highest value this gives a value of the total orbital angular momentum that can arise for this For the above example the highest within the states is not hence Knowing an combination one knows the first term symbol that arises from this configuration In the example this is Because the level with this and quantum numbers contains states with and quantum numbers running from to and from to respectively one must remove from the original box this number of product states To do so one simply erases from the box one entry with each such and value Actually since the box need only show those entries with nonnegative and values only these entries need be explicitly deleted In the example this amounts to deleting nine product states with values of After deleting these entries one returns to step and carries out the process again For the example the box after deleting the first nine product states looks as follows those that appear in italics should be viewed as already deleted in counting all of the states MS ML pα pα pα pα pα pβ pα pβ pα pβ pα pβ pαpβ pα pβ It should be emphasized that the process of deleting or crossing off entries in various boxes involves only counting how many states there are by no means do we identify the particular wave functions when we cross out any particular entry in a box For example when the product is deleted from the box in accounting for the states in the level we do not claim that itself is a member of the level the product state could just as well been eliminated when accounting for the states Returning to the example at hand after the term symbols states have been accounted for the highest value is hence there is an state and within this value the highest value is hence there is an state This means there is a level with five states having Deleting five appropriate entries from the above box again denoting deletions by italics leaves the following box MS ML pα pα pα pα pα pβ pα pβ pα pβ pα pβ pαpβ pα pβ The only remaining entry which thus has the highest and values has and Thus there is also a level in the configuration Thus unlike the nonequivalent case in which and levels arise only the and arise in the situation This box method is useful to carry out whenever one is dealing with equivalent angular momenta If one has mixed equivalent and nonequivalent angular momenta one can determine all possible couplings of the equivalent angular momenta using this method and then use the simpler vector coupling method to add the nonequivalent angular momenta to each of these coupled angular momenta For example the configuration can be handled by vector coupling using the straightforward nonequivalent procedure the d orbital and the third electrons spin to each of and arising from the configuration The result is and Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools on Theoretical Chemistry
