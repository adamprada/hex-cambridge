Bands of Orbitals in Solids Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah Contributors and Attributions Not only does the particleinabox model offer a useful conceptual representation of electrons moving in polyenes but it also is the zerothorder model of band structures in solids Let us consider a simple onedimensional crystal consisting of a large number of atoms or molecules each with a single orbital the blue spheres shown below that it contributes to the bonding Let us arrange these building blocks in a regular lattice as shown in the Figure Figure The energy levels arising from and an infinite number of orbitals In the top four rows of this figure we show the case with and building blocks To the left of each row we display the energy splitting pattern into which the building blocks orbitals evolve as they overlap and form delocalized molecular orbitals Not surprisingly for one finds a bonding and an antibonding orbital For one has a bonding one nonbonding and one antibonding orbital Finally in the bottom row we attempt to show what happens for an infinitely long chain The key point is that the discrete number of molecular orbitals appearing in the orbital cases evolves into a continuum of orbitals called a band as the number of building blocks becomes large This band of orbital energies ranges from its bottom whose orbital consists of a fully inphase bonding combination of the building block orbitals to its top whose orbital is a fully outofphase antibonding combination In Figure we illustrate these fully bonding and fully antibonding band orbitals for two cases the bottom involving stype building block orbitals and the top involving type orbitals Notice that when the energy gap between the building block and orbitals is larger than is the dispersion spread in energy within the band of or band of orbitals a band gap occurs between the highest member of the band and the lowest member of the band The splitting between the and orbitals is a property of the individual atoms comprising the solid and varies among the elements of the periodic table For example we teach students that the energy gap in C is smaller than the gap in Si which is smaller than the gap in Ge The dispersion in energies that a given band of orbitals is split into as these atomic orbitals combine to form a band is determined by how strongly the orbitals on neighboring atoms overlap Small overlap produces small dispersion and large overlap yields a broad band So the band structure of any particular system can vary from one in which narrow bands weak overlap do not span the energy gap between the energies of their constituent atomic orbitals to bands that overlap strongly large overlap Figure The bonding through antibonding energies and band orbitals arising from and from atomic orbitals Depending on how many valence electrons each building block contributes the various bands formed by overlapping the buildingblock orbitals of the constituent atoms will be filled to various levels For example if each building block orbital shown above has a single valence electron in an sorbital eg as in the case of the alkali metals the sband will be half filled in the ground state with a and b paired electrons Such systems produce very good conductors because their partially filled bands allow electrons to move with very little eg only thermal excitation among other orbitals in this same band On the other hand for alkaline earth systems with two electrons per atom the sband will be completely filled In such cases conduction requires excitation to the lowest members of the nearby porbital band Finally if each building block were an Al s p atom the sband would be full and the pband would be half filled In Figure a we show a qualitative depiction of the bands arising from sodium atoms and orbitals Notice that the band is very narrow because there is little coupling between neighboring orbitals so they are only slightly stabilized or destabilized relative to their energies in the isolated Na atoms In contrast the and bands show greater dispersion ie are wider and the band is even wider The and bands are full but the band is half filled as a result of which solid Na is a good electrical conductor Figure a Example of sodium atoms and orbitals splitting into filled and partially filled bands in sodium metal In describing the band of states that arise from a given atomic orbital within a solid it is common to display the variation in energies of these states as functions of the number of sign changes in the coefficients that describe each orbital as a linear combination of the constituent atomic orbitals Using the onedimensional array of and orbitals shown in Figure as an example The lowest member of the band deriving from the orbitals is a totally bonding combination of all of the constituent orbitals on the sites of the lattice The highestenergy orbital in this band is a totally antibonding combination of the constituent orbitals Each of the intervening orbitals in this band has expansion coefficients that allow the orbital to be written as Clearly for small values of the series of expansion coefficients has few sign changes as the index runs over the sites of the onedimensional lattice For larger n there are more sign changes Thus thinking of the quantum number as labeling the number of sign changes and plotting the energies of the orbitals on the vertical axis versus on the horizontal axis we would obtain a plot that increases from to In fact such plots tend to display quadratic variation of the energy with This observation can be understood by drawing an analogy between the pattern of sign changes belonging to a particular value of and the number of nodes in the onedimensional particleinabox wave function which also is used to model electronic states delocalized along a linear chain As we saw in Chapter the energies for this model system varied as with being the quantum number ranging from to The lowestenergy state with has no nodes the state with has one node and that with has nodes So if we replace by and replace the box length by where is the interatom spacing and is the number of atoms in the chain we obtain from which on can see why the energy can be expected to vary as In contrast for the orbitals the lowestenergy orbital is because this alternation in signs allows each orbital on one site to overlap in a bonding fashion with the orbitals on neighboring sites Therefore the highestenergy orbital in the band is and is totally antibonding The intervening members of this band have orbitals given by with low corresponding to highenergy orbitals having few interatom sign changes but antibonding character and high to lowenergy orbitals having many interatom sign changes So in contrast to the case for the sband orbitals plotting the energies of the orbitals on the vertical axis versus on the horizontal axis we would obtain a plot that decreases from to For bands comprised of orbitals the energies vary with the quantum number in a manner analogous to how the band varies because the orbital with no interatom sign changes is fully bonding For two and threedimensional lattices comprised of s p and d orbitals on the constituent atoms the behavior of the bands derived from these orbitals follows analogous trends It is common to describe the sign alternations arising from site to site in terms of a socalled vector In the onedimensional case discussed above this vector has only one component with elements labeled by the ratio whose value characterizes the number of interatom sign changes For lattices containing many atoms is very large so ranges from zero to a very large number Thus the ratio ranges from zero to unity in small fractional steps so it is common to think of these ratios as describing a continuous parameter varying from zero to one Moreover it is convention to allow the index to range from to so the argument in the cosine function introduced above varies from to In two or threedimensions the vector has two or three elements and can be written in terms of its two or three index ratios respectively as Here and would describe the number of unit cells along the three principal axes of the threedimensional crystal and do likewise in the twodimensional lattice case In such two and three dimensional crystal cases the energies of orbitals within bands derived from s p d etc atomic orbitals display variations that also reflect the number of interatom sign changes However now there are variations as functions of the and indices and these variations can display rather complicated shapes depending on the symmetry of the atoms within the underlying crystal lattice That is as one moves within the threedimensional space by specifying values of the indices and one can move throughout the lattice in different symmetry directions It is convention in the solidstate literature to plot the energies of these bands as these three indices vary from site to site along various symmetry elements of the crystal and to assign a letter to label this symmetry element The band that has no interatom sign changes is labeled as sometimes G in such plots of band structures In much of our discussion below we will analyze the behavior of various bands in the neighborhood of the point because this is where there are the fewest interatom nodes and thus the wave function is easiest to visualize Lets consider a few examples to help clarify these issues In Figure b where we see the band structure of graphene you can see the quadratic variations of the energies with as one moves away from the point labeled with some bands increasing with and others decreasing with Figure b Band structure plot for graphene The band having an energy of ca eV at the point originates from bonding interactions involving orbitals on the carbon atoms while those having energies near eV at the point derive from carbon bonding interactions The parabolic increase with for the based and decrease with for the based orbitals is clear and is expected based on our earlier discussion of how and bands vary with The band having energy near eV at the point involves orbitals involved in bonding interactions and this band shows a parabolic increase with as expected as we move away from the point These are the delocalized orbitals of the graphene sheet The antibonding band decreases quadratically with and has an energy of ca eV at the point Because there are two atoms per unit cell in this case there are a total of eight valence electrons four from each carbon atom to be accommodated in these bands The eight carbon valence electrons fill the bonding and two bands fully as well as the bonding band Only along the direction labeled P in Figure b do the bonding and antibonding bands become degenerate near eV the approach of these two bands is what allows graphene to be semimetallic ie to conduct at modest temperatures high enough to promote excitations from the bonding to the antibonding band It is interesting to contrast the band structure of graphene with that of diamond which is shown in Figure c Figure c Band structure of diamond carbon The band having an energy of ca eV at the point derives from bonding interactions and the three bands near eV at the point come from bonding interactions Again each of these bands displays the expected parabolic behavior as functions of In diamonds two interpenetrating face centered cubic structure there are two carbon atoms per unit cell so we have a total of eight valence electrons to fill the four bonding bands Notice that along no direction in space do these filled bonding bands become degenerate with or are crossed by any of the other bands The other bands remain at higher energy along all directions and thus there is a gap between the bonding bands and the others is large ca eV or more along any direction in space This is why diamond is an insulator the band gap is very large Finally lets compare the graphene and diamond cases with a metallic case such as shown in Figure d for Al and for Ag Figure d Band structures of Al and Ag For Al and Ag there is one atom per unit cell so we have three valence electrons sp and eleven valence electrons ds respectively to fill the bands shown in Figure d Focusing on the points in the Al and Ag band structure plots we can say the following For Al the based band near eV is filled and the three based bands near eV have an occupancy of ie on average there is one electron in one of these three bands each of which can hold two electrons The and bands are parabolic with positive and negative curvature respectively Along several directions eg there are crossings among the bands these crossings allow electrons to be promoted from occupied to previously unoccupied bands The partial occupancy of the bands and the multiple crossings of bands are what allow Al to show metallic behavior For Ag there are six bands between eV and eV Five of these bands change little with and one shows somewhat parabolic dependence on The former five derive from atomic orbitals that are contracted enough to not allow them to overlap much and the latter is based on bonding orbital interaction Ten of the valence electrons fill the five bands and the eleventh resides in the sbased bonding band If the five based bands are ignored the remainder of the Ag band structure looks a lot like that for Al There are numerous band crossings that include in particular the halffilled band These crossings and the partial occupancy of the band cause Ag to have metallic character One more feature of band structures that is often displayed is called the band density of states An example of such a plot is shown in Figure e for the TiN crystal Figure e Energies of orbital bands in TiN along various directions in space left and densities of states right as functions of energy for this same crystal The density of states at energy is computed by summing all those orbitals having an energy between and Clearly as seen in Figure e for bands in which the orbital energies vary strongly with ie socalled broad bands the density of states is low in contrast for narrow bands the density of states is high The densities of states are important because their energies and energy spreads relate to electronic spectral features Moreover just as gaps between the highest occupied bands and the lowest unoccupied bands play central roles in determining whether the sample is an insulator a conductor or a semiconductor gaps in the density of states suggest what frequencies of light will be absorbed or reflected via interband electronic transitions The bands of orbitals arising in any solid lattice provide the orbitals that are available to be occupied by the number of electrons in the crystal Systems whose highest energy occupied band is completely filled and for which the gap in energy to the lowest unfilled band is large are called insulators because they have no way to easily ie with little energy requirement promote some of their higherenergy electrons from orbital to orbital and thus effect conduction The case of diamond discussed above is an example of an insulator If the band gap between a filled band and an unfilled band is small it may be possible for thermal excitation ie collisions with neighboring atoms or molecules to cause excitation of electrons from the former to the latter thereby inducing conductive behavior The band structures of Al and Ag discussed above offer examples of this case A simple depiction of how thermal excitations can induce conduction is illustrated in Figure Figure The valence and conduction bands and the band gap with a small enough gap to allow thermal excitation to excite electrons and create holes in a previously filled band Systems whose highestenergy occupied band is partially filled are also conductors because they have little spacing among their occupied and unoccupied orbitals so electrons can flow easily from one to another Al and Ag are good examples To form a semiconductor one starts with an insulator whose lower band is filled and whose upper band is empty as shown by the broad bands in Fig Figure The filled and empty bands the band gap and empty acceptor or filled donor bands If this insulator material is synthesized with a small amount of dopant whose valence orbitals have energies between the filled and empty bands of the insulator one can generate a semiconductor If the dopant species has no valence electrons ie has an empty valence orbital it gives rise to an empty band lying between the filled and empty bands of the insulator as shown below in case a of Figure In this case the dopant band can act as an electron acceptor for electrons excited either thermally or by light from the filled band of the insulator into the dopants empty band Once electrons enter the dopant band charge can flow because the insulators lower band is no longer filled and the system thus becomes a conductor Another case is illustrated in the b part of Figure Here the dopant has a filled band that lies close in energy to the empty band of the insulator Excitation of electrons from this dopant band to the insulators empty band can induce current to flow because now the insulators upper band is no longer empty Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U
