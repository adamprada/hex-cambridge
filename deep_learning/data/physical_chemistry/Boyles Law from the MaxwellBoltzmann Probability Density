Chapter we derive Boyles lawBoyles law using simplifying assumptions We are now able to do this derivation much more rigorously We consider the collisions of gas molecules with a small portion of the wall of their container We suppose that the wall is smooth so that we can select a small and compact segment of it that is arbitrarily close to being planar We denote both the segment of the wall and its area as can have any shape so long as it is a smooth flat surface enclosed by a smooth curve Let the volume of the container be and the number of gas molecules in the container be We imagine that we follow the trajectory of one particular molecule as it moves to hit the wall somewhere within We begin our observations at time and suppose that the collision occurs at time Figure Trajectory of a molecule colliding with a wall of its container As sketched in Figure we erect a Cartesian coordinate system with its origin at the location in space of the molecule at time We orient the axes of this coordinate system so that the plane is parallel to the plane of and the zaxis is pointed toward the wall Then the unit vector along the axis and a vector perpendicular to are parallel to one another It is convenient to express the velocity of the selected molecule in spherical coordinates We suppose that referred to the Cartesian coordinate system we have erected the velocity vector of the selected molecule is The vector drawn from the origin of our Cartesian system to the point of impact on the wall follows the trajectory of the molecule from time zero to time The component of the molecular velocity vector is normal to the plane of at the point of impact the magnitude of thecomponent The perpendicular distance from the plane of A to the plane of the Cartesian system is We assume that the collision is perfectly elastic Before collision the velocity component perpendicular to the wall is Afterward it is Only this change in the component contributes to the force on the wall within The and components are not changed by the collision During the collision the molecules momentum change is During our period of observation the average force on the molecule is thus The force that the molecule exerts on the wall is and hence the contribution that this particular collisionby one molecule traveling at velocity makes to the pressure on the wall is We want to find the pressure on segment of the wall that results from all possible impacts To do so we recognize that any other molecule whose velocity components are and and whose location at time enables it to reach within time makes the same contribution to the pressure as the selected molecule does Let us begin by assuming that the velocities of all N of the molecules in the volume are the same as that of the selected molecule In this case we can find the number of the molecules in the container that can reach within time by considering a tubular segment of the interior of the container The long axis of this tube is parallel to the velocity vector of the selected molecule The sides of this tube cut the container wall along the perimeter of This tube also cuts the plane the plane of our coordinate system in such a way as to make an exact replica of in this plane Call this replica The area of is the plane of is parallel to the plane of and the perpendicular distance between the plane of and the plane of is The volume of this tube is therefore Since there are molecules per unit volume the total number of molecules in the tube is When we assume that every molecule has velocity components and all of the molecules in the tube reach within time because each of them travels parallel to the selected molecule and each of them is initially at least as close to as is the selected molecule Therefore each molecule in the tube contributes to the pressure at The total pressure is the pressure per molecule multiplied by the number of molecules However the molecular velocities are not all the same and the pressure contribution is made only by that fraction of the molecules whose velocity components lie in the intervals and This fraction is so that the pressure contribution from molecules whose velocity components lie in these ranges is The total pressure at is just the sum of the contributions from molecules with all possible combinations of velocities and To find this sum we integrate over all possible velocity vectors The allowed values of are There are no constraints on the values of we have However since all of the impacting molecules must have a velocity component in the positive zdirection the possible values of lie in the interval We designate the velocity of the original molecule as and retain this notation to be as specific as possible in describing the tube bounded by and However the velocity components of an arbitrary molecule can have any of the allowed values To integrate See Appendix D over the allowed values we drop the superscripts The pressurepressureon wall at becomes intinfty _ vexpleftfraclambda vrightdv intpi _ mathrmcos theta mathrmsin theta dtheta intpi _ dvarphi and the pressurevolume product becomes Since and are constants this is Boyles law Equating this pressurevolume product to that given by the ideal gas equation we have so that Finally the MaxwellBoltzmann equation becomes and the probability density becomes This derivation can be recast as a computation of the expected value of the pressurepressureexpected value To do so we rephrase our description of the system A molecule whose velocity components are creates a pressure on the area with a probability of The latter term is the probability that a molecule whose velocity is is at time in a location from which it can reach within time If the molecule is to hit the wall within time at time the molecule must be within the tubular segment of volume is The probability that the molecule is within this tubular segment is equal to the fraction of the total volume that this segment occupies Therefore the product is the pressure contribution of a molecule with velocity when is in the interval The total pressure per molecule is the expected value of this pressure contribution the expected value is the integral over the entire volume of velocity space of the pressure contribution times the probability density function for velocities It is useful to view the MaxwellBoltzmann equation as the product of a term called the Boltzmann factorBoltzmann factorand a preexponential term that is proportional to the number of ways that a molecule can have a given velocity If there were no constraints on a molecules speed we would expect that the number of molecules with speeds between and would increase as increases because the probability that a molecule has a speed between and is proportional to the volume in velocity space of a spherical shell of thickness The volume of a spherical shell of thickness is which increases as the square of However the number of molecules with large values of is constrained by the conservation of energy Since the total energy of a collection of molecules is limited only a small proportion of the molecules can have very large velocities The Boltzmann factor introduces this constraint A molecule whose mass is m and whose scalar velocity is has kinetic energy The Boltzmann factor is often written as
