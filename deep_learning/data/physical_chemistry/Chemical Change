Theoretical Simulation of Chemical ChangeContributors and Attributions Experimental Probes of Chemical Change Many of the same tools that are used to determine the structures of molecules can also be used to follow the changes that the molecule undergoes as it is involved in a chemical reaction Specifically for any reaction in which one kind of molecule is converted into another kind one needs to have the ability to identify via some physical measurement the experimental signatures of both and the ability to relate the magnitude of these experimental signals to the concentrations and of these molecules and the ability to monitor these signals as functions of time so that these concentrations can be followed as time evolves The third requirement is what allows one to determine the rates at which the and molecules are reacting Many of the experimental tools used to identify molecules eg NMR allows one to identify functional groups and nearneighbor functional groups IR also allows functional groups to be seen and to determine their concentrations have restricted time scales over which they can be used For example NMR spectra require that the sample be studied for ca second or more to obtain a useable signal Likewise a mass spectroscopic analysis of a mixture of reacting species may require many second or minutes to carry out These restrictions in turn limit the rates of reactions that can be followed using these experimental tools eg one can not use NMR of mass spectroscopy to follow a reaction that occurs on a time scale of s Especially for very fast reactions and for reactions involving unstable species that can not easily be handled socalled pumpprobe experimental approaches are often used For example suppose one were interested in studying the reaction of radicals eg as formed in the decomposition of chloroflurocarbons CFCs by ultraviolet light with ozone to generate and One can not simply deposit a known amount of radicals from a vessel into a container in which gaseous of a known concentration has been prepared the radicals will recombine and react with other species making their concentrations difficult to determine So alternatively one places known concentrations of some radical precursor eg a CFC or some other XCl species and ozone into a reaction vessel One then uses for example a very short light pulse whose photons frequencies are tuned to a transition that will cause the XCl precursor to undergo rapid photodissociation hnu XCl rightarrow X Cltag Because the pump light source used to prepare the radicals is of very short duration and because the XCl dissociation is prompt one knows to within the time at which the Cl radicals begin to react with the ozone The initial concentration of the radicals can be known if the quantum yield for the hnu XCl rightarrow X Cl reaction is known This means that the intensity of photons the probability of photon absorption by XCl and the fraction of excited XCl molecules that dissociate to produce must be known Such information is available albeit from rather tedious earlier studies for a variety of XCl precursors So knowing the time at which the radicals are formed and their initial concentrations one then allows the reaction to proceed for some time duration One then at uses a second light source to probe either the concentration of the the or the to determine the extent of progress of the reaction Which species is so monitored depends on the availability of light sources whose frequencies these species absorb Such probe experiments are carried out at a series of time delays the result of which is the determination of the concentrations of some product or reactant species at various times after the initial pump event created the reactive radicals In this way one can monitor for example the concentration as a function of time after the begins to react with the If one has reason to believe that the reaction occurs in a single bimolecular event as one can then extract the rate constant k for the reaction by using the following kinetic scheme If the initial concentration of is large compared to the amount of that is formed in the pump event can be taken as constant and known If the initial concentration of is denoted and the concentration of is called this kinetic equation reduces to the solution of which is So knowing the concentration as a function of time delay and knowing the initial ozone concentration as well as the initial radical concentration one can find the rate constant Such pumpprobe experiments are necessary when one wants to study species that must be generated and allowed to react immediately This is essentially always the case when one or more of the reactants is a highly reactive species such as a radical There is another kind of experiment that can be used to probe very fast reactions if the reaction and its reverse reaction can be brought into equilibrium to the extent that reactants and products both exist in measurable concentrations For example consider the reaction of an enzyme E and a substrate S to form the enzymesubstrate complex ES At equilibrium the forward rate k_f E_eq S_eq tag and the reverse rate are equal k_f E_eq S_eq k_r ES_eq tag The idea behind so called perturbation techniques is to begin with a reaction that is in such an equilibrium condition and to then use some external means to slightly perturb the equilibrium Because both the forward and reverse rates are assumed to be very fast it is essential to use a perturbation that can alter the concentrations very quickly This usually precludes simply adding a small amount of one or more of the reacting species to the reaction vessel Instead one might employ for example a fast light source or electric field pulse to perturb the equilibrium to one side or the other For example if the reaction thermochemistry is known the equilibrium constant can be changed by rapidly heating the sample eg with a fast laser pulse that is absorbed and rapidly heats the sample and using to calculate the change in and thus the changes in concentrations caused by the sudden heating Alternatively if the polarity of the reactants and products is substantially different one may use a rapidly applied electric field to quickly change the concentrations of the reactant and product species In such experiments the concentrations of the species is shifted by a small amount as a result of the application of the perturbation so that ES ES_eq delta tag once the perturbation has been applied and then turned off Subsequently the following rate law will govern the time evolution of the concentration change d Assuming that is very small so that the term involving cam be neglected and using the fact that the forward and reverse rates balance at equilibrium this equation for the time evolution of can be reduced to So the concentration deviations from equilibrium will return to equilibrium ie will decay to zero exponentially with an effective rate coefficient that is equal to a sum of terms involving both the forward and reverse rate constants So by quickly perturbing an equilibrium reaction mixture for a short period of time and subsequently following the concentrations of the reactants or products as they return to their equilibrium values one can extract the effective rate coefficient Doing this at a variety of different initial equilibrium concentrations eg and and seeing how changes one can then determine both the forward and reverse rate constants Both the pumpprobe and the perturbation methods require that one be able to quickly create or perturb concentrations of reactive species and that one have available an experimental probe that allows one to follow the concentrations of at least some of the species as time evolves Clearly for very fast reactions this means that one must use experimental tools that can respond on a very short time scale Modern laser technology and molecular beam methods have provided some of the most widely used of such tools These experimental approaches are discussed in some detail in Chapter Theoretical Simulation of Chemical Change The most common theoretical approach to simulating a chemical reaction is to use Newtonian dynamics to follow the motion of the nuclei on a BornOppenheimer electronic energy surface If the molecule of interest contains few atoms such a surface could be computed using the methods discussed in Chapter at a large number of molecular geometries and then fit to an analytical function of the or variables denoted Knowing as a function of these variables one can then compute the forces F_J dfracpartialEpartialq_J tag along each coordinate and then use the Newton equations to follow the time evolution of these coordinates and hence the progress of the reaction The values of the coordinates at a series of discrete times constitute what is called a classical trajectory To simulate a chemical reaction one begins the trajectory with initial coordinates characteristic of the reactant species ie within one of the valleys on the reactant side of the potential surface and one follows the trajectory long enough to determine whether the collision results in a nonreactive outcome characterized by final coordinates describing reactant not product molecules or a reactive outcome that is recognized by the final coordinates describing product molecules rather than reactants One must do so for a large number of trajectories whose initial coordinates and moment are representative of the experimental conditions one is attempting to simulate Then one has to average the outcomes of these trajectories over this ensemble of initial conditions More about how one carries out such ensemble averaging is discussed in Chapters and If the molecule contains more than or atoms it is more common to not compute the BornOppenheimer energy at a set of geometries and then fit this data to an analytical form Instead one begins a trajectory at some initial coordinates and with some initial momenta and then uses the Newton equations usually in the finitedifference form q_J q_J dfracp_Jm_J dt tag to propagate the coordinates and momenta forward in time by a small amount Here denotes the gradient of the BO energy computed at the values of the coordinates The above propagation procedure is then used again but with the values of and appropriate to time as new initial coordinates and momenta to generate yet another set of and values In such direct dynamics approaches the energy gradients which produce the forces are computed only at geometries that the classical trajectory encounters along its time propagation In the earlier procedure in which the BO energy is fit to an analytical form one often computes at geometries that the trajectory never accesses In carrying out such a classical trajectory simulation of a chemical reaction there are other issues that must be addressed In particular as mentioned above one can essentially never use any single trajectory to simulate a reaction carried out in a laboratory setting One must perform a series of such trajectory calculations with a variety of different initial coordinates and momenta chosen in a manner to represent the experimental conditions of interest For example suppose one were to wish to model a molecular beam experiment in which a beam of species having a well defined kinetic energy collides with a beam of species having kinetic energy as shown in Figure Figure Crossed beam experiment in which and molecules collide in a reaction vessel Even though the and molecules all collide at right angles and with specified kinetic energies and thus specified initial momenta not all of these collisions occur head on Figure illustrates this point Figure Two A B collisions In the first the and have a small distance of closest approach in the second this distance is larger Here we show two collisions between an and a molecule both of which have identical and velocities and respectively What differs in the two events is their distance of closest approach In the collision shown on the left the and come together closely However in the left collision the A molecule is moving away from the region where would strike it before has reached it These two cases can be viewed from a different perspective that helps to clarify their differences In Figure we illustrate these two collisions viewed from a frame of reference located on the molecule Figure Same two close and distant collisions viewed from sitting on and in the case of no attractive or repulsive interactions In this figure we show the location of the molecule relative to at a series of times showing moving from right to left In the figure on the left the molecule clearly undergoes a closer collision than is the case on the right The distance of closest approach in each case is called the impact parameter and it represents the distance of closest approach if the colliding partners did not experience any attractive or repulsive interactions as the above figures would be consistent with Of course when and have forces acting between them the trajectories shown above would be modified to look more like those shown in Figure Figure Same two close and distant collisions viewed from sitting on A now in the case of repulsive interactions In both of these trajectories repulsive intermolecular forces cause the trajectory to move away from its initial path which defines the respective impact parameters So even in this molecular beam example in which both colliding molecules have well specified velocities one must carry out a number of classical trajectories each with a different impact parameter b to simulate the laboratory event In practice the impact parameters can be chosen to range from ie a head on collision to some maximum value beyond which the and molecules no longer interact and thus can no longer undergo reaction Each trajectory is followed long enough to determine whether it leads to geometries characteristic of the product molecules The fraction of such trajectories weighted by the volume element for trajectories with impact parameters in the range between and then gives the averaged fraction of trajectories that react In most simulations of chemical reactions there are more initial conditions that also must sampled ie trajectories with a variety of initial variables must be followed and properly weighted For example if there is a range of velocities for the reactants andor one must follow trajectories with velocities in this range and weigh the outcomes ie reaction or not of such trajectories appropriately eg with a MaxwellBoltzmann weighting factor and if the reactant molecules have internal bond lengths angles and orientations one must follow trajectories with different initial values of these variables and properly weigh each such trajectory eg using the vibrational states coordinate probability distribution as a weighting factor for the initial values of that coordinate As a result to properly simulate a laboratory experiment of a chemical reaction it usually requires one to follow a very large number of classical trajectories Fortunately such a task is well suited to distributed parallel computing so it is currently feasible to do so even for rather complex reactions There is a situation in which the above classical trajectory approach can be foolish to pursue even if there is reason to believe that a classical Newton description of the nuclear motions is adequate This occurs when one has a rather high barrier to surmount to evolve from reactants to products and when the fraction of trajectories whose initial conditions permit this barrier to be accessed is very small In such cases one is faced with the reactive trajectories being very rare among the full ensemble of trajectories needed to properly simulate the laboratory experiment Certainly one can apply the trajectoryfollowing technique outlined above but if one observes for example that only one trajectory in produces a reaction one may not have adequate statistics to determine the reaction probability One could subsequently run trajectories chosen again to represent the same experiment and see whether or or of these trajectories react thereby increasing the precision of your reaction probability However it may be computationally impractical to perform times as many trajectories to achieve better accuracy in the reaction probability When faced with such rareevent situations one is usually better off using an approach that breaks the problem of determining what fraction of the properly weighted initial conditions produce reaction into two parts among all of the properly weighted initial conditions what fraction can access the highenergy barrier and of those that do access the high barrier how may react This way of formulating the reaction probability question leads to the transition state theory TST method that is treated in detail in Chapter along with some of its more common variants Briefly the answer to the first question posed above involves computing the quasiequilibrium fraction of reacting species that reach the barrier region in terms of the partition functions of statistical mechanics This step becomes practical if the chemical reactants can be assumed to be in some form of thermal equilibrium which is where these kinds of models are useful In the simplest form of TST the answer to the second question posed above is taken to be all trajectories that reach the barrier react In more sophisticated variants other models are introduced to take into consideration that not all trajectories that cross over the barrier indeed proceed onward to products and that some trajectories may tunnel through the barrier near its top I will leave further discussion of the TST to Chapter In addition to the classical trajectory and TST approaches to simulating chemical reactions there are more quantum approaches These techniques should be used when the nuclei involved in the reaction include hydrogen or deuterium nuclei A discussion of the details involved in quantum propagation is beyond the level of this Chapter so I will delay it until Chapter Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of
