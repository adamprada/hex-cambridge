Chemical Equilibrium and Predicting Chemical Change Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers When we talk about predicting chemical reactions we imagine taking quantities of various pure compounds and mixing them under some set of conditions We suppose that they react until they reach a position of equilibrium in which one or more new compounds are present We want to predict what these new compounds are and how much of each will be produced For any given set of reactants we can accomplish this predictive program in two steps First we find all of the sets of products that can be obtained from the given reactants Each such set represents a possible reaction We suppose that for each set of possible products we are able to predict the equilibrium composition Predicting which reaction will occur is equivalent to finding the reaction whose position of equilibrium lies farthest in the direction of its products From this perspective being able to predict the position of equilibrium for the reactants and any stoichiometrically consistent set of products is the same thing as being able to predict what reaction will occur If there is no single reaction whose position of equilibrium is much further in the direction of its products than that of any other reaction multiple reactions can occur simultaneously This twostep procedure corresponds to the sense in which chemical thermodynamics enables us to predict reaction products We measure values for certain characteristic thermodynamic functions for all relevant compounds Given the values of these functions for all of the compounds involved in a hypothesized reaction we calculate the position of equilibrium That we must begin by guessing the products makes this approach cumbersome and uncertain We can never be positive that the true products are among the possibilities that we consider Nevertheless as a practical matter for most combinations of reactants the number of plausible product sets is reasonably small
