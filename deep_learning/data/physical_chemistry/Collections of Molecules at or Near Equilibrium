and Attributions As introduced in Chapter the approach one takes in studying a system composed of a very large number of molecules at or near thermal equilibrium can be quite different from how one studies systems containing a few isolated molecules In principle it is possible to conceive of computing the quantum energy levels and wave functions of a collection of many molecules eg ten ions ten ions and molecules in a volume chosen to simulate a concentration of molar but doing so becomes impractical once the number of atoms in the system reaches a few thousand or if the molecules have significant intermolecular interactions as they do in condensedphase systems Also as noted in Chapter following the time evolution of such a large number of molecules can be confusing if one focuses on the shorttime behavior of any single molecule eg one sees jerky changes in its energy momentum and angular momentum By examining instead the longtime average behavior of each molecule or alternatively the average properties of a significantly large number of molecules one is often better able to understand interpret and simulate such condensedmedia systems Moreover most experiments do not probe such shorttime dynamical properties of single molecules instead their signals report on the behavior of many molecules lying within the range of their detection device eg laser beam STM tip or electrode It is when one want to describe the behavior of collections of molecules under such conditions that the power of statistical mechanics comes into play The Distribution of Energy Among Levels One of the most important concepts of statistical mechanics involves how a specified total amount of energy can be shared among a collection of molecules and within the internal rotational vibrational electronic and intermolecular translational degrees of freedom of these molecules when the molecules have a means for sharing or redistributing this energy eg by collisions The primary outcome of asking what is the most probable distribution of energy among a large number of molecules within a container of volume that is maintained in equilibrium by such energysharing at a specified temperature is the most important equation in statistical mechanics the Boltzmann population formula This equation expresses the probability of finding the system which in the case introduced above is the whole collection of interacting molecules in its quantum state where is the energy of this quantum state is the temperature in K is the degeneracy of the state and the denominator is the socalled partition function The classical mechanical equivalent of the above quantum Boltzmann population formula for a system with a total of coordinates collectively denoted they would be the internal and intermolecular coordinates of the molecules in the system and momenta denoted is where is the classical Hamiltonian is Plancks constant and the classical partition function is This probability density expression which must integrate to unity contains the factor of because as we saw in Chapter when we learned about classical action the integral of a coordinatemomentum product has units of Plancks constant Notice that the Boltzmann formula does not say that only those states of one particular energy can be populated it gives nonzero probabilities for populating all states from the lowest to the highest However it does say that states of higher energy are disfavored by the factor but if states of higher energy have larger degeneracies which they usually do the overall population of such states may not be low That is there is a competition between state degeneracy which tends to grow as the states energy grows and which decreases with increasing energy If the number of particles is huge the degeneracy grows as a high power lets denote this power as of because the degeneracy is related to the number of ways the energy can be distributed among the molecules In fact grows at least as fast as As a result of growing as the product function has the form shown in Fig for for illustrative purposes Figure Probability Weighting Factor as a Function of for By taking the derivative of this function with respect to E and finding the energy at which this derivative vanishes one can show that this probability function has a peak at and that at this energy value By then asking at what energy the function drops to of this maximum value one finds So the width of the graph measured as the change in energy needed to cause to drop to of its maximum value divided by the value of the energy at which assumes this maximum value is This width gets smaller and smaller as increases The primary conclusion is that as the number of molecules in the sample grows which as discussed earlier causes to grow the energy probability function becomes more and more sharply peaked about the most probable energy This in turn suggests that we may be able to model aside from infrequent fluctuations which we may also find a way to take account of the behavior of systems with many molecules by focusing on the most probable situation ie those having the energy and ignoring or making small corrections for deviations from this case It is for the reasons just shown that for macroscopic systems near equilibrium in which and hence is extremely large eg to only the most probable distribution of the total energy among the molecules need be considered This is the situation in which the equations of statistical mechanics are so useful Certainly there are fluctuations as evidenced by the finite width of the above graph in the energy content of the molecule system about its most probable value However these fluctuations become less and less important as the system size ie becomes larger and larger Basis of the Boltzmann Population Formula To understand how this narrow Boltzmann distribution of energies arises when the number of molecules in the sample is large we consider a system composed of identical containers each having volume V and each made out a material that allows for efficient heat transfer to its surroundings eg through collisions of the molecules inside the volume with the walls of the container but material that does not allow any of the molecules in each container to escape These containers are arranged into a regular lattice as shown in Figure in a manner that allows their thermally conducting walls to come into contact Finally the entire collection of such containers is surrounded by a perfectly insulating material that assures that the total energy of all molecules can not change So this collection of identical containers each containing molecules constitutes a closed ie with no molecules coming or going and isolated ie so total energy is constant system Figure Collection of identical cells having energyconducting walls that do not allow molecules to pass between cells Equal a priori Probability Assumption One of the fundamental assumptions of statistical mechanics is that for a closed isolated system at equilibrium all quantum states of the system having energy equal to the energy with which the system is prepared are equally likely to be occupied This is called the assumption of equal a priori probability for such energyallowed quantum states The quantum states relevant to this case are not the states of individual molecules nor are they the states of of the molecules in one of the containers of volume They are the quantum states of the entire system comprised of molecules Because our system consists of identical containers each with molecules in it we can describe the quantum states of the entire system in terms of the quantum states of each such container It may seem foolish to be discussing quantum states of the large system containing molecules given what I said earlier about the futility in trying to find such states However what I am doing at this stage is to carry out a derivation that is based upon such quantum states but whose final form and final working equations will not actually require one to know or even be able to have these states in hand Lets pretend that we know the quantum states that pertain to molecules in a container of volume as shown in Figure and lets label these states by an index That is labels the lowestenergy state of molecules in the container of volume labels the second such state and so on As I said above I understand it may seem daunting to think of how one actually finds these molecule eigenstates However we are just deriving a general framework that gives the probabilities of being in each such state In so doing we are allowed to pretend that we know these states In any actual application we will of course have to use approximate expressions for such energies Assuming that the walls that divide the containers play no role except to allow for collisional ie thermal energy transfer among the containers an energylabeling for states of the entire collection of containers can be realized by giving the number of containers that exist in each singlecontainer Jstate This is possible because under the assumption about the role of the walls just stated the energy of each container state is a sum of the energies of the singlecontainer states that comprise that container state For example if the label specifies the energy of this container state in terms of the energies of the states of the containers Notice that this container state has the same energy as several other container states for example and have the same energy although they are different individual states What differs among these distinct states is which box occupies which singlebox quantum state The above example illustrates that an energy level of the container system can have a high degree of degeneracy because its total energy can be achieved by having the various singlecontainer states appear in various orders That is which container is in which state can be permuted without altering the total energy The formula for how many ways the container states can be permuted such that there are containers appearing in singlecontainer state with a total of containers is Here denote the number of containers existing in singlecontainer states This combinatorial formula reflects the permutational degeneracy arising from placing containers into state containers into state etc If we imagine an extremely large number of containers and we view as well as the as being large numbers nb we will soon see that this is the case at least for the most probable distribution that we will eventually focus on we can ask for what choices of the variables is this degeneracy function a maximum Moreover we can examine at its maximum and compare its value at values of the parameters changed only slightly from the values that maximized As we will see is very strongly peaked at its maximum and decreases extremely rapidly for values of that differ only slightly from the optimal values It is this property that gives rise to the very narrow energy distribution discussed earlier in this Chapter So lets take a closer look at how this energy distribution formula arises We want to know what values of the variables make a maximum However all of the variables are not independent they must add up to the total number of containers so we have a constraint that the variables must obey The variables are also constrained to give the total energy of the container system when summed as We have two problems i how to maximize and ii how to impose these constraints Because takes on values greater than unity for any choice of the will experience its maximum where has its maximum so we can maximize if doing so helps Because the variables are assumed to take on large numbers when is large we can use Sterlings approximation for the natural logarithm of the factorial of a large number to approximate as follows This expression will prove useful because we can take its derivative with respect to the variables which we need to do to search for the maximum of To impose the constraints and we use the technique of Lagrange multipliers That is we seek to find values of that maximize the following function Notice that this function is exactly equal to the function we wish to maximize whenever the variables obey the two constraints So the maxima of and of are identical if the have values that obey the constraints The two Lagrange multipliers and are introduced to allow the values of that maximize to ultimately obey the two constraints That is we first find values of the variables that make maximum these values will depend on and and will not necessarily obey the constraints However we will then choose and to assure that the two constraints are obeyed This is how the Lagrange multiplier method works Lagrange Multiplier Method Taking the derivative of with respect to each independent variable and setting this derivative equal to zero gives This equation can be solved to give Substituting this result into the first constraint equation gives which allows us to solve for in terms of Doing so and substituting the result into the expression for gives where Notice that the are as we assumed earlier large numbers if is large because is proportional to Notice also that we now see the appearance of the partition function and of exponential dependence on the energy of the state that gives the Boltzmann population of that state It is possible to relate the Lagrange multiplier to the total energy of the containers by summing the number of containers in the Kth quantum state multiplied by the energy of that quantum state This shows that the average energy of a container computed as the total energy divided by the number of such containers can be computed as a derivative of the logarithm of the partition function As we show in the following Section of this Chapter all thermodynamic properties of the molecules in the container of volume can be obtained as derivatives of the natural logarithm of this function This is why the partition function plays such a central role in statistical mechanics To examine the range of energies over which each of the singlecontainer system varies with appreciable probability let us consider not just the degeneracy of that set of variables that makes maximum but also the degeneracy for values of differing by small amounts from the optimal values Expanding as a Taylor series in the parameters and evaluating the expansion in the neighborhood of the values we find We know that all of the first derivative terms vanish because has been made maximum at To evaluate the second derivative terms we first note that the first derivative of is So the second derivatives needed to complete the Taylor series through second order are Using this result we can expand in the neighborhood of in powers of as follows or equivalently This result clearly shows that the degeneracy and hence by the equal a priori probability hypothesis the probability of the container system occupying a state having falls off exponentially as the variables move away from their mostprobable values The Thermodynamic Limit As we noted earlier the are proportional to ie so when considering deviations away from the optimal we should consider deviations that are also proportional to In this way we are treating deviations of specified percentage or fractional amount which we denote Thus the ratio that appears in the above exponential has an Mdependence that allows to be written as where and are the fraction and fractional deviation of containers in state and The purpose of writing in this manner is to explicitly show that in the socalled thermodynamic limit when approaches infinity only the most probable distribution of energy need to be considered because only is important as approaches infinity Fluctuations Lets consider this very narrow distribution issue a bit further by examining fluctuations in the energy of a single container around its average energy We already know that the number of containers in a given state can be written as Alternatively we can say that the probability of a container occupying the state is Using this probability we can compute the average energy as To compute the fluctuation in energy we first note that the fluctuation is defined as the average of the square of the deviation in energy from the average The following identity is now useful for further reexpressing the fluctuations Recognizing the first factor immediately above as and the second factor as and noting that allows the fluctuation formula to be rewritten as Because the parameter can be shown to be related to the Kelvin temperature as the above expression can be rewritten as Recognizing the formula for the constantvolume heat capacity allows the fractional fluctuation in the energy around the mean energy to be expressed as What does this fractional fluctuation formula tell us On its lefthand side it gives a measure of the fractional spread of energies over which each of the containers ranges about its mean energy On the right side it contains a ratio of two quantities that are extensive properties the heat capacity and the mean energy That is both and will be proportional to the number of molecules in the container as long as is reasonably large However because the righthand side involves it is proportional to and thus will be very small for large as long as does not become large As a result except near socalled critical points where the heat capacity does indeed become extremely large the fractional fluctuation in the energy of a given container of molecules will be very small ie proportional to This finding is related to the narrow distribution in energies that we discussed earlier in this section Lets look at the expression in a bit more detail for a system that is small but still contains quite a few particlesa cluster of Ar atoms at temperature If we assume that each of the Ar atoms in the cluster has of kinetic energy and that the potential energy holding the cluster together is small and constant so it cancels in will be and will be So In a nanodroplet of diameter Å with each Ar atom occupying a volume of ca there will be ca Ar atoms So the average fractional spread in the energy That is even for a very small nanodroplet the fluctuation in the energy of the system is only a fraction of a percent assuming is not large as near a critical point This example shows why it is often possible to use thermodynamic concepts and equations even for very small systems albeit realizing that fluctuations away from the most probable state are more important than in much larger systems Partition Functions and Thermodynamic Properties Let us now examine how this idea of the most probable energy distribution being dominant gives rise to equations that offer molecularlevel expressions for other thermodynamic properties The first equation is the fundamental Boltzmann population formula that we already examined which expresses the probability for finding the molecule system in its quantum state having energy Sometimes this expression is written as where now the index is used to label an energy level of the system having energy and degeneracy It is important for the student to be used to either notation a level is just a collection of those states having identical energy System Partition Functions Using this result it is possible to compute the average energy sometimes written as of the system and as we saw earlier in this Chapter to show that this quantity can be recast as To review how this proof is carried out we substitute the expressions for and for into the expression for I will use the notation labeling energy levels rather than energy states to allow the student to become used to this By noting that we can then rewrite as And then recalling that we finally obtain All other equilibrium properties can also be expressed in terms of the partition function For example if the average pressure is defined as the pressure of each quantum state defined as how the energy of that state changes if we change the volume of the container by a small amount multiplied by the probability for accessing that quantum state summed over all such states one can show realizing that only not or depend on the volume that If you wonder why the energies should depend on the volume think of the case of gasphase molecules occupying the container of volume V You know that the translational energies of each of these molecules depend on the volume through the particleinabox formula Changing can be accomplished by changing the box length This makes it clear why the energies do indeed depend on the volume Of course there are additional sources of the Vdependence of the energy levels For example as one shrinks the molecules become more crowded so their intermolecular energies also change Without belaboring the point further it is possible to express all of the usual thermodynamic quantities in terms of the partition function The average energy and average pressure are given above as is the heat capacity The average entropy is given as the Helmholtz free energy A is and the chemical potential is expressed as follows As we saw earlier it is also possible to express fluctuations in thermodynamic properties in terms of derivatives of partition functions and thus as derivatives of other properties For example the fluctuation in the energy was shown above to be given by The text Statistical Mechanics D A McQuarrie Harper and Row New York has an excellent treatment of these topics and shows how all of these expressions are derived So if one were able to evaluate the partition function for molecules in a volume at a temperature T either by summing the quantumlevel degeneracy and factors or by carrying out the phasespace integral over all of the coordinates and momenta of the system one could then use the above formulas to evaluate any thermodynamic properties and their fluctuations as derivatives of The averages discussed above derived using the probabilities associated with the most probable distribution are called ensemble averages with the set of states associated with the specified values of and constituting what is called a canonical ensemble Averages derived using the probabilities constant for all states associated with specified values of and are called ensemble averages for a microcanonical ensemble There is another kind of ensemble that is often used in statistical mechanics it is called the grand canonical ensemble and relates to systems with specified volume temperature and chemical potential rather than particle number To obtain the partition function from which all thermodynamic properties are obtained in this case one considers maximizing the same function introduced earlier but now considering each quantum labeled J as having an energy that depends on the volume and on how may particles occupy this volume The variables are now used to specify how many of the containers introduced earlier contain particles and are in the quantum state These variables have to obey the same two constraints as for the canonical ensemble but they also are required to obey which means that the sum adds up to the total number of particles in the isolated systems large container that was divided into M smaller container In this case the walls separating each small container are assumed to allow for energy transfer as in the canonical ensemble and for molecules to move from one container to another unlike the canonical ensemble Using Lagrange multipliers as before to maximize subject to the above three constraints involves maximizing and gives or Imposing the first constraint gives or where the partition function is defined by the sum in the denominator So now the probability of the system having particles and being in the quantum state is Very much as was shown earlier for the canonical ensemble one can then express thermodynamic properties eg etc in terms of derivatives of The text Statistical Mechanics D A McQuarrie Harper and Row New York goes through these derivations in good detail so I will not repeat them here because we showed how to do so when treating the canonical ensemble To summarize them briefly one again uses finds that g is related to the chemical potential as and obtains The formulas look very much like those of the canonical ensemble except for the result expressing the average number of molecules in the container Nave in terms of the derivative of the partition function with respect to the chemical potential In addition to the equal a priori probability postulate stated earlier ie that in the thermodynamic limit ie large every quantum state of an isolated system in equilibrium having fixed and is equally probable statistical mechanics makes another assumption It assumes that in the thermodynamic limit the ensemble average eg using equal probabilities for all states of an isolated system having specified and or using for states of a system having specified and or using for the grand canonical case of any quantity is equal to the longtime average of this quantity ie the value one would obtain by monitoring the dynamical evolution of this quantity over a very long time This second postulate implies that the dynamics of an isolated system spends equal amounts of time in every quantum state that has the specified and this is known as the ergodic hypothesis Lets consider a bit more what the physical meaning or information content of partition functions is Canonical ensemble partition functions represent the thermalaveraged number of quantum states that are accessible to the system at specified values of and This can be seen best by again noting that in the quantum expression the partition function is equal to a sum of the number of quantum states in the jth energy level multiplied by the Boltzmann population factor of that level So is dimensionless and is a measure of how many states the system can access at temperature Another way to think of is suggested by rewriting the Helmholtz free energy definition given above as This identity shows that can be viewed as the Boltzmann population not of a given energy but of a specified amount of free energy For the microcanonical ensemble the probability of occupying each state that has the specified values of and is equal where is the total number of such states In the microcanonical ensemble case plays the role that plays in the canonical ensemble case it gives the number of quantum states accessible to the system IndividualMolecule Partition Functions Keep in mind that the energy levels and degeneracies and discussed so far are those of the full molecule system In the special case for which the interactions among the molecules can be neglected ie in the dilute idealgas limit at least as far as expressing the state energies each of the energies can be written as a sum of the energies of each individual molecule In such a case the above partition function reduces to a product of individualmolecule partition functions where the N factor arises as a degeneracy factor having to do with the permutational indistinguishability of the molecules eg one must not count both with molecule in state and molecule in state and with molecule in state and molecule in state they are the same state and is the partition function of an individual molecule Here is the energy of the lth level of the molecule and is its degeneracy The molecular partition functions in turn can be written as products of translational rotational vibrational and electronic partition functions if the molecular energies can be approximated as sums of such energies Of course these approximations are most appropriate to gasphase molecules whose vibration and rotation states are being described at the lowest level The following equations give explicit expressions for these individual contributions to in the most usual case of a nonlinear polyatomic molecule Translational where is the mass of the molecule and is the volume to which its motion is constrained For molecules constrained to a surface of area the corresponding result is and for molecules constrained to move along a single axis over a length the result is The magnitudes these partition functions can be computed using in amu in Kelvin and or in cm cm or cm as Clearly the magnitude of depends strongly on the number of dimensions the molecule and move around in This is a result of the vast differences in translational state densities in and dimensions recall that we encountered these statedensity issues in Chapter Rotational where and are the three principal moments of inertia of the molecule ie eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor is the symmetry number of the molecule defined as the number of ways the molecule can be rotated into a configuration that is indistinguishable from its original configuration For example is for or for for and for The magnitudes of these partition functions can be computed using bond lengths in Å and masses in amu and in using Vibrational where is the frequency of the harmonic vibration of the molecule of which there are If one wants to treat the vibrations at a level higher than harmonic this expression can be modified by replacing the harmonic energies by higherlevel expressions Electronic where and are the energies and degeneracies of the electronic state the sum is carried out for those states for which the product is numerically significant ie levels that any significant thermal population It is conventional to define the energy of a molecule or ion with respect to that of its atoms So the first term in the electronic partition function is usually written as we where we is the degeneracy of the ground electronic state and is the energy required to dissociate the molecule into its constituent atoms all in their ground electronic states Notice that the magnitude of the translational partition function is much larger than that of the rotational partition function which in turn is larger than that of the vibrational function Moreover note that the dimensional translational partition function is larger than the dimensional which is larger than the dimensional These orderings are simply reflections of the average number of quantum states that are accessible to the respective degrees of freedom at the temperature which in turn relates to the energy spacings and degeneracies of these states The above partition function and thermodynamic equations form the essence of how statistical mechanics provides the tools for connecting moleculelevel properties such as energy levels and degeneracies which ultimately determine the and the to the macroscopic properties such as etc If one has a system for which the quantum energy levels are not known it may be possible to express all of the thermodynamic properties in terms of the classical partition function if the system could be adequately described by classical dynamics This partition function is computed by evaluating the following classical phasespace integral phase space is the collection of coordinates and conjugate momenta as we discussed in Chapter In this integral one integrates over the internal eg bond lengths and angles orientational and translational coordinates and momenta of the molecules If each molecule has internal coordinates translational coordinates and orientational coordinates the total number of such coordinates per molecule is One can then compute all thermodynamic properties of the system using this in place of the quantum in the equations given above for etc The classical partition functions discussed above are especially useful when substantial intermolecular interactions are present and thus where knowing the quantum energy levels of the molecule system is highly unlikely In such cases the classical Hamiltonian is often written in terms of which contains all of the kinetic energy factors as well as all of the potential energies other than the intermolecular potentials and the intermolecular potential which depends only on a subset of the coordinates For example let us assume that depends only on the relative distances between molecules ie on the translational degrees of freedom which we denote Denoting all of the remaining coordinates as the classical partition function integral can be reexpressed as follows The factor would be the partition function if the Hamiltonian contained no intermolecular interactions The factor arises from the integration over all of the translational coordinates if is absent The other factor contains all the effects of intermolecular interactions and reduces to unity if the potential vanishes If as the example considered here assumes only depends on the positions of the centers of mass of the molecules ie not on molecular orientations or internal geometries the partition function can be written in terms of the molecular translational rotational and vibrational partition functions shown earlier Because all of the equations that relate thermodynamic properties to partition functions contain all such properties will decompose into a sum of two parts one coming from and one coming from The latter contains all the effects of the intermolecular interactions This means that in this classical mechanics case all the thermodynamic equations can be written as an ideal component plus a part that arises from the intermolecular forces Again the Statistical Mechanics text by McQuarrie is a good source for reading more details on these topics Equilibrium Constants in Terms of Partition Functions One of the most important and useful applications of statistical thermodynamics arises in the relation giving the equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction or for a physical transformation eg adsorption of molecules onto a metal surface or sublimation of molecules from a crystal in terms of molecular partition functions Specifically for any chemical or physical equilibrium eg the former could be the equilibrium the latter could be one can relate the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of numbers of molecules per unit volume or per unit area depending on whether species undergo translational motion in or dimensions in terms of the partition functions of these molecules For example in the hypothetical chemical equilibrium the equilibrium constant can be written if the species can be treated as having negligibly weak intermolecular potentials as Here is the partition function for molecules of type confined to volume at temperature As another example consider the isomerization reaction involving the normal N and zwitterionic Z forms of arginine that were discussed in Chapter Here the pertinent equilibrium constant would be So if one can evaluate the partition functions for reactant and product molecules in terms of the translational electronic vibrational and rotational energy levels of these species one can express the equilibrium constant in terms of these moleculelevel properties Notice that the above equilibrium constant expressions equate ratios of species concentrations in numbers of molecules per unit volume to ratios of corresponding partition functions per unit volume Because partition functions are a count of the number of quantum states available to the system ie the average density of quantum states this means that we equate species number densities to quantum state densities when we use the above expressions for the equilibrium constant In other words statistical mechanics produces equilibrium constants related to numbers of molecules ie number densities not molar or molal concentrations Contributors and Attributions Jack
