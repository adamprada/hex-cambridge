Collisions between like Gas Molecules Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers When we consider collisions between different gas molecules of the same substance we can denote the relative velocity and the expected value of the relative velocity as and respectively By the argument we make above we can find the number of collisions between any one of these molecules and all of the others Letting this collision frequency be we find where Since we have while we have The frequency of collisions between molecules of the same substance becomes The mean time between collisions is and the mean free path When we consider the rate of collisions between all of the molecules of type in a container there is a minor complication If we multiply the collision frequency per molecule by the number of molecules available to undergo such collisions we count each collision twice because each such collision involves two type molecules To find the collision rate among like molecules we must divide this product by That is
