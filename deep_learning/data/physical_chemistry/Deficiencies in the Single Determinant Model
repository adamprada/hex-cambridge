Deficiencies in the Single Determinant Model Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah Electron CorrelationEssential Configuration Interaction To achieve reasonable chemical accuracy eg kcalmole in EAs or IPs or bond energies in electronic structure calculations one can not describe the wavefunction in terms of a single determinant The reason such a wavefunction is inadequate is because the spatial probability density functions are not correlated This means the probability of finding one electron at position r is independent of where the other electrons are which is absurd because the electrons mutual Coulomb repulsion causes them to avoid one another This mutual avoidance is what we call electron correlation because the electrons motions as reflected in their spatial probability densities are correlated ie interrelated Let us consider a simple example to illustrate this problem with single determinant functions The determinant when written as can be multiplied by itself to produce the electron spin and spatial probability density If we now integrate over the spins of the two electrons and make use of and we obtain the following spatial ie with spin absent probability density This probability being a product of the probability density for finding one electron at r times the density of finding another electron at clearly has no correlation in it That is the probability of finding one electron at r does not depend on where the other electron is This product form for is a direct result of the singledeterminant form for y so this form must be wrong if electron correlation is to be accounted for Electron Correlation Now we need to ask how should be written if electron correlation effects are to be taken into account As we now demonstrate it turns out that one can account for electron avoidance by taking to be a combination of two or more determinants that differ by the promotion of two electrons from one orbital to another orbital For example in describing the bonding electron pair of an olefin or the electron pair in alkaline earth atoms one mixes in doubly excited determinants of the form or respectively Briefly the physical importance of such doublyexcited determinants can be made clear by using the following identity involving determinants where This identity is important to understand so please make sure you can work through the algebra needed to prove it It allows one to interpret the combination of two determinants that differ from one another by a double promotion from one orbital to another as equivalent to a singlet coupling ie having spin function of two different orbitals and that comprise what are called polarized orbital pairs In the simplest embodiment of such a configuration interaction CI description of electron correlation each electron pair in the atom or molecule is correlated by mixing in a configuration state function CSF in which that electron pair is doubly excited to a correlating orbital A CSF is the minimum combination of determinants needed to express the proper spin eigenfunction for a given orbital occupation In the olefin example mentioned above the two nonorthogonal polarized orbital pairs involve mixing the p and p orbitals to produce two leftright polarized orbitals as depicted in Figure Figure Left and Right Polarized Orbitals of an Olefin In this case one says that the electron pair undergoes leftright correlation when the determinant is mixed into the CI wavefunction In the alkaline earth atom case the polarized orbital pairs are formed by mixing the and orbitals actually one must mix in equal amounts of and orbitals to preserve overall symmetry in this case and give rise to angular correlation of the electron pair Such a pair of polarized orbitals is shown in Figure Figure Angularly Polarized Orbital Pairs More specifically the following four determinants are found to have the largest amplitudes in for Be The fact that the latter three terms possess the same amplitude is a result of the requirement that a state of symmetry is desired It can be shown that this function is equivalent to psi cong frac C_ salphasbeta sap_xalphasap_xbeta sap_xbetasap_xalpha sap_yalphasap_ybeta sap_ybetasap_yalpha sap_zalphasap_zbeta sap_zbetasap_zalpha where Here two electrons occupy the orbital with opposite and spins and are thus not being treated in a correlated manner while the other pair resides in polarized orbitals in a manner that instantaneously correlates their motions These polarized orbital pairs are formed by combining the orbital with the orbital in a ratio determined by This ratio can be shown using perturbation theory to be proportional to the magnitude of the coupling matrix element between the two configurations involved and inversely proportional to the energy difference between these configurations In general configurations that have similar Hamiltonian expectation values and that are coupled strongly give rise to strongly mixed ie with large ratios polarized orbital pairs IILater in this Chapter you will learn how to evaluate Hamiltonian matrix elements between pairs of antisymmetric wavefunctions If you are anxious to learn this now go to the subsection entitled The SlaterCondon Rules and read that before returning here In each of the three equivalent terms in the alkaline earth wavefunction one of the valence electrons moves in a orbital polarized in one direction while the other valence electron moves in the orbital polarized in the opposite direction For example the first term describes one electron occupying a polarized orbital while the other electron occupies the orbital The electrons thus reduce their Coulomb repulsion by occupying different regions of space in the SCF picture both electrons reside in the same region of space In this particular example the electrons undergo angular correlation to avoid one another The use of doubly excited determinants is thus seen as a mechanism by which can place electron pairs which in the singleconfiguration picture occupy the same orbital into different regions of space ie each one into a different member of the polarized orbital pair thereby lowering their mutual Coulomb repulsion Such electron correlation effects are extremely important to include if one expects to achieve chemically meaningful accuracy ie kcalmole Essential Configuration Interaction There are occasions in which the inclusion of two or more determinants in is essential to obtaining even a qualitatively correct description of the molecules electronic structure In such cases we say that we are including essential correlation effects To illustrate let us consider the description of the two electrons in a single covalent bond between two atoms or fragments that we label X and Y The fragment orbitals from which the bonding and antibonding MOs are formed we will label and respectively Several spin and spatial symmetry adapted electron determinants ie CSFs can be formed by placing two electrons into the and orbitals For example to describe the singlet determinant corresponding to the closedshell orbital occupancy a single Slater determinant suffices An analogous expression for the determinant is given by Also the component of the triplet state having orbital occupancy can be written as a single Slater determinant as can the component of the triplet state However to describe the singlet and triplet states belonging to the occupancy two determinants are needed is the singlet and is the triplet note you can obtain this triplet by applying to the triplet In each case the spin quantum number its zaxis projection and the quantum number are given in the conventional term symbol notation As the distance between the X and Y fragments is changed from near its equilibrium value of and approaches infinity the energies of the and orbitals vary in a manner well known to chemists as depicted in Figure if X and Y are identical Figure Orbital Correlation Diagram Showing Two Type Orbitals Combining to Form a Bonding and an Antibonding Molecular Orbital If X and Y are not identical the and orbitals still combine to form a bonding and an antibonding orbital The energies of these orbitals for R values ranging from near to are depicted in Figure for the case in which X is more electronegative than Y Figure Orbital Correlation Diagram For Type Orbitals in the Heteronuclear Case The energy variation in these orbital energies gives rise to variations in the energies of the six determinants listed above As the determinants energies are difficult to intuit because the and orbitals become degenerate in the homonuclear case or nearly so in the case To pursue this point and arrive at an energy ordering for the determinants that is appropriate to the region it is useful to express each such function in terms of the fragment orbitals and that comprise and To do so the LCAOMO expressions for and and are substituted into the Slater determinant definitions given above Here and are the normalization constants The parameter is in the homonuclear case and deviates from in relation to the and orbital energy difference if lies below then if lies above Let us examine the case to keep the analysis as simple as possible The process of substituting the above expressions for and into the Slater determinants that define the singlet and triplet functions can be illustrated as follows for the case The first two of these atomicorbitalbased Slater determinants and are called ionic because they describe atomic orbital occupancies which are appropriate to the region that correspond to and valence bond structures while and are called covalent because they correspond to structures In similar fashion the remaining five determinant functions may be expressed in terms of fragmentorbitalbased Slater determinants In so doing use is made of the antisymmetry of the Slater determinants eg which implies that any determinant in which two or more spinorbitals are identical vanishes The result of decomposing the MObased determinants into their fragmentorbital components is as follows These decompositions of the six valence determinants into fragmentorbital or valence bond components allow the energies of these states to specified For example the fact that both and contain ionic and covalent structures implies that as both of their energies will approach the average of the covalent and ionic atomic energies The energy approaches the purely ionic value as The energies of and all approach the purely covalent value as The behaviors of the energies of the six valence determinants as varies are depicted in Figure for situations in which the homolytic bond cleavage is energetically favored ie for which Figure Configuration Correlation Diagram Showing How the Determinants Energies Vary With It is essential to realize that the energies of the determinants do not represent the energies of the true electronic states For values at which the determinant energies are separated widely the true state energies are rather well approximated by individual determinant energies such is the case near Re for the state However at large the situation is very different and it is in such cases that what we term essential configuration interaction occurs Specifically for the example the and determinants undergo essential CI coupling to form a pair of states of symmetry the CSF cannot partake in this CI mixing because it is of ungerade symmetry the states can not mix because they are of triplet spin symmetry The CI mixing of the and determinants is described in terms of a x secular problem

EleftbeginarraycABendarrayright The diagonal entries are the determinants energies depicted in Figure The offdiagonal coupling matrix elements can be expressed in terms of an exchange integral between the and orbitals Later in this Chapter you will learn how to evaluate Hamiltonian matrix elements between pairs of antisymmetric wavefunctions and to express them in terms of one and twoelectron integrals If you are anxious to learn this now go to the subsection entitled the SlaterCondon Rules and read that before returning here At where the and determinants are degenerate the two solutions to the above CI matrix eigenvalue problem are with respective amplitudes for the and CSFs given by The first solution thus has which when decomposed into atomic orbital components yields The other root has So we see that and which both contain ionic and covalent parts combine to produce which is purely covalent and which is purely ionic The above essential CI mixing of and as qualitatively alters the energy diagrams shown above Descriptions of the resulting valence singlet and triplet S states are given in Figure for homonuclear situations in which covalent products lie below the ionic fragments Figure State Correlation Diagram Showing How the Energies of the States Comprised of Combinations of Determinants vary with
