Entropy Changes for A Spontaneous Process in An Isolated System Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In Section we consider the entropy changes in a system and its surroundings when the process is reversible We consider now the diametrically opposite situation in which an isolated system undergoes a spontaneous change From the entropybased statement of the second law we know how the entropy of this system and its surroundings change Since the system is isolated no change occurs in the surroundings Thus and since we have Let us attempt to develop these conclusions from the machinebased statement of the second law Since the process occurs irreversibly we cannot use the heat of the process to find the entropy change for the system We can calculate the entropy change for a process from the defining equation only if the process is reversible However entropy is a state function using the figure of speech that we introduce in Section we can find the entropy change for the spontaneous process by evaluating along a second and reversible path that connects the same initial and final states Figure A cycle that includes a spontaneous process in an isolated system In Figure these paths are diagrammed in temperatureentropy space The transition from state A to state B occurs irreversibly and therefore it does not necessarily correspond to a path that we can specify on this diagram The dashed line drawn for this transition is supposed to remind us of this fact We can readily devise a reversible path from B back to A First we reversibly and adiabatically return the temperature of the system to its original value In this step the system does work on the surroundings or vice versa The system reaches point C on the diagram Then we reversibly and isothermally add or remove heat from the system to return to the original state at point A For the transfer of heat to be reversible we must have for this step Hence the final and original temperature of the system at point A is equal to the temperature of the surroundings The reversible path must exist because the tiling theorem asserts that adiabats vertical lines and isotherms horizontal lines tile the plane arbitrarily densely Taken literally this description of state A is inconsistent We suppose that the initial state A is capable of spontaneous change therefore it cannot be an equilibrium state We suppose that the final state A is reached by a reversible process therefore it must be an equilibrium state We bridge this contradiction by refining our definition of the initial state The final state A is an equilibrium state with welldefined state functions What we have in mind is that these final equilibriumstate values also characterize the initial nonequilibrium state Evidently the initial state A that we have in mind is a hypothetical state This hypothetical state approximates the state of a real system that undergoes spontaneous change By invoking this hypothetical initial state we eliminate the contradiction between our descriptions of initial state A and final state A Given a real system that undergoes spontaneous change we must find approximate values for the real systems state functions by finding an equilibriumor quasiequilibriumsystem that adequately models the initial state of the spontaneously changing system In the development below we place no constraints on the nature of the system or the spontaneous process We assume that the state functions of any hypothetical initial state A can be adequately approximated by some equilibriumstate model However before we consider the general argument let us show how these conditions can be met for another specific system Consider a vessel whose interior is divided by a partition The real gas of a pure substance occupies the space on one side of the partition The space on the other side of the partition is evacuated We suppose that this vessel is isolated The real gas is at equilibrium We can measure its state functions including its pressure volume and temperature Now suppose that we puncture the partition As soon as we do so the gas expands spontaneously to fill the entire vessel reaching a new equilibrium position at a new pressure volume and temperature The gas undergoes a free expansion as defined in Section At the instant the partition is punctured the system becomes able to undergo spontaneous change In this hypothetical initial state before any significant quantity of gas passes through the opening neither the actual condition of the gas nor the values of its state functions have changed After the expansion to the new equilibrium state the original state can be restored by reversible processes of adiabatic compression and isothermal volume adjustment Problems and in Chapter deal with the energy and entropy changes for ideal and real gases around a cycle in which spontaneous expansion in an isolated system is followed by reversible restoration of the initial state Returning to the general cycle depicted in Figure we see that there are some important conditions on the heat and work terms in the individual steps Since the system is isolated while it undergoes the transition from A to B it exchanges no heat or work with the surroundings in this step For the reversible adiabatic transition from B to C in every incremental part of the path The transition from C to A occurs reversibly and isothermally letting the heat of this step be the entropy changes for these reversible steps are from the defining equation and The energy and entropy changes around this cycle must be zero whether the individual steps occur reversibly or irreversibly We have and We want to analyze this cycle using the machinebased statement of the second law We have and Let us assume that the system does net work on the surroundings as this cycle is traversed so that Then and it follows that The system exchanges heat with the surroundings in only one step of this process In this step the system extracts a quantity of heat from a reservoir in the surroundings The temperature of this reservoir remains constant at throughout the process The heat extracted by the system is converted entirely into work This result contradicts the machinebased statement of the second law Hence is false it follows that and that For the entropy change in the spontaneous process in the isolated system we have Now we introduce the premise that If this is true the entropy change in the spontaneous process in the isolated system becomes The converse is also true that is implies that The premise that is independent of the machinebased statement of the second law which requires only that as we just demonstrated It is also independent of the first law which requires only that If we can conclude that for a spontaneous process in an isolated system we must have and These conditions correspond to doing work on the system and finding that heat is liberated by the system There is no objection to this it is possible to convert mechanical energy into heat quantitatively The conclusions that and have important consequences we consider them below First however we consider a line of thought that leads us to infer that and hence that must be true Because and we have The system can be taken from state A to state B by the reversible process A Above we see that if we have In we introduce Duhems theorem which asserts that two thermodynamic variables are sufficient to specify the state of a closed reversible system in which only pressurevolume work is possible We gave a proof of Duhems theorem when the two variables are chosen from among the pressure temperature and composition variables that describe the system We avoided specifying whether other pairs of variables can be used If we assume now that specifying the variables energy and entropy is always sufficient to specify the state of such a system it follows that states A and B must in fact be the same state In and in greater detail in Chapter we see that the first law and our entropybased statement of the second law do indeed imply that specifying the energy and entropy specifies the state of a closed reversible system in which only pressurevolume work is possible If state A and state B are the same state that is if the state functions of state A are the same as those of state B it is meaningless to say that there is a spontaneous process that converts state A to state B Therefore if A can be converted to B in a spontaneous process in an isolated system it must be that That is From the machinebased statement of the second law we find When we supplement this conclusion with our Duhems theorembased inference that we can conclude that for any spontaneous process in any isolated system Because the system is isolated we have and For any spontaneous process in any isolated system we have We can also conclude that the converse is true that is if for a process in which an isolated system goes from state A to state B the process must be spontaneous Since any process that occurs in an isolated system must be a spontaneous process it is only necessary to show that implies that state B is different from state A This is trivial Because entropy is a state function requires that state B be different from state A None of our arguments depends on the magnitude of the change that occurs Evidently the same inequality must describe every incremental portion of any spontaneous process otherwise we could define an incremental spontaneous change for which the machinebased statement of the second law would be violated For every incremental part of any spontaneous change in any isolated system we have and These are pivotally important results we explore their ramifications below Before doing so however let us again consider a system in which only pressurevolume work is possible There is an alternative way to express the idea that such a system is isolated Since an isolated system cannot interact with its surroundings in any way it cannot exchange energy with its surroundings Its energy must be constant Since it cannot exchange pressurevolume work its volume must be constant Hence isolation implies constant and If only pressurevolume work is possible the converse must be true that is if only pressurevolume work is possible constant energy and volume imply that there are no interactions between the system and its surroundings Therefore constant and imply that the system is isolated and it must be true that In this case a spontaneous process in which and are constant must be accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the system If is constant and only pressurevolume work is possible the process involves no work We have a criterion for spontaneous change spontaneous process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that the energy and volume of the system are constant In Section we arrive at this conclusion by a different argument
