Continuum OrbitalsContributors and Attributions Visible and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy Visible and ultraviolet spectroscopies are used to study transitions between states of a molecule or ion in which the electrons orbital occupancy changes We call these electronic transitions and they usually require light in the cm to cm regime When such transitions occur the initial and final states generally differ in their electronic vibrational and rotational energies because any change to the electrons orbital occupancy will induce changes in the BornOppenheimer energy surface which in turn governs the vibrational and rotational character Excitations of innershell and core orbital electrons may require even higher energy photons as would excitations that eject an electron The interpretation of all such spectroscopic data relies heavily on theory as this Section is designed to illustrate The Electronic Transition Dipole and Use of Point Group Symmetry The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with a molecules electrons and nuclei can be treated using perturbation theory as we discussed in Chapter The result is a standard expression that we derived in Chapter R_if fracpihbar fomega_fi textbfE_ langle Phi_f boldsymbolmu Phi_irangle for the rate of photon absorption between initial and final states In this equation is the intensity of the photon source at the frequency is the frequency corresponding to the transition under study and is the electric field vector of the photon field The vector is the electric dipole moment of the electrons and nuclei in the molecule Because each of these wave functions is a product of an electronic ye a vibrational and a rotational function we realize that the electronic integral appearing in this rate expression involves a transition dipole matrix element between the initial and final electronic wave functions This element is a function of the internal vibrational coordinates of the molecule and is a vector locked to the molecules internal axis frame Molecular pointgroup symmetry can often be used to determine whether a particular transitions dipole matrix element will vanish and as a result the electronic transition will be forbidden and thus predicted to have zero intensity If the direct product of the symmetries of the initial and final electronic states and do not match the symmetry of the electric dipole operator which has the symmetry of its and components these symmetries can be read off the right most column of the character tables the matrix element will vanish For example the formaldehyde molecule has a ground electronic state that has symmetry in the point group Its singlet excited state also has symmetry because both the and orbitals are of symmetry In contrast the lowest these orbitals are shown in Figure singlet excited state is of symmetry because the highest energy oxygen centered nonbonding orbital is of symmetry and the orbital is of symmetry so the Slater determinant in which both the and orbitals are singly occupied has its symmetry dictated by the direct product which is Figure Electronic Transition From the Nonbonding orbital to the antibonding Orbital of Formaldehyde The transition thus involves ground and excited states whose direct product is of symmetry This transition thus requires that the electric dipole operator possess a component of symmetry A glance at the point groups character table shows that the molecular axis is of symmetry Thus if the lights electric field has a nonzero component along the symmetry axis the molecules axis the transition is predicted to be allowed Light polarized along either of the molecules other two axes cannot induce this transition In contrast the transition has a groundexcited state direct product of symmetry The s point group character table shows that the electric dipole operator ie its and components in the moleculefixed frame has no component of symmetry thus light of no electric field orientation can induce this transition We thus say that the transition is forbidden The above examples illustrate one of the most important applications of visibleUV spectroscopy The information gained in such experiments can be used to infer the symmetries of the electronic states and hence of the orbitals occupied in these states It is in this manner that this kind of experiment probes electronic structures The FranckCondon Factors Beyond such electronic symmetry analysis it is also possible to derive vibrational selection rules for electronic transitions that are allowed It is conventional to expand the transition dipole matrix element in a power series about the equilibrium geometry of the initial electronic state since this geometry is characteristic of the molecular structure prior to photon absorption and because the photon absorption takes place quickly the nuclei dont have time to move far from there The first term in this expansion when substituted into the integral over the vibrational coordinates gives which has the form of the electronic transition dipole multiplied by the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wave functions The factor was discussed above it is the electronic transition integral evaluated at the equilibrium geometry of the absorbing state Symmetry can often be used to determine whether this integral vanishes as a result of which the transition will be forbidden The vibrational overlap integrals do not necessarily vanish because and are eigenfunctions of different vibrational Hamiltonians because they belong to different BornOppenheimer energy surfaces is an eigenfunction whose potential energy is the final electronic states energy surface has the initial electronic states energy surface as its potential The squares of these integrals which are what eventually enter into the transition rate expression R_if fracpihbar fomega_fi textbfE_ langle Phi_f boldsymbolmu Phi_irangle are called FranckCondon factors Their relative magnitudes play strong roles in determining the relative intensities of various vibrational bands ie series of peaks within a particular electronic transitions spectrum In Figure I show two potential energy curves and illustrate the kinds of absorption and emission transitions that can occur when the two electronic states have significantly different geometries Figure Absorption From One Initial State to One Final State Followed by Relaxation and Then Emission From the Lowest State of the Upper Surface Whenever an electronic transition causes a large change in the geometry bond lengths or angles of the molecule the FranckCondon factors tend to display the characteristic broad progression shown in Figure when considered for one initialstate vibrational level and various finalstate vibrational levels Figure Broad FranckCondon Progression Characteristic of Large Geometry Change Notice that as one moves to higher values the energy spacing between the states Evf Evf decreases this of course reflects the anharmonicity in the excitedstate vibrational potential For the above example the transition to the state has the largest FranckCondon factor This means that the overlap of the initial states vibrational wave function is largest for the final states function with As a qualitative rule of thumb the larger the geometry difference between the initial and final state potentials the broader will be the FranckCondon profile as shown in Figure and the larger the value for which this profile peaks Differences in harmonic frequencies between the two states can also broaden the FranckCondon profile If the initial and final states have very similar geometries and frequencies along the mode that is excited when the particular electronic excitation is realized the type of FranckCondon profile shown in Figure may result Figure FranckCondon Profile Characteristic of Small Geometry Change Another feature that is important to emphasize is the relation between absorption and emission when the two states energy surfaces have different equilibrium geometries or frequencies Subsequent to photon absorption to form an excited electronic state but prior to photon emission the molecule can undergoe collisions with other nearby molecules This of course is especially true in condensedphase experiments These collisions cause the excited molecule to lose some of its vibrational and rotational energy thereby relaxing it to lower levels on the excited electronic surface This relaxation process is illustrated in Figure Figure Absorption Followed by Relaxation to Lower Vibrational Levels of the Upper State Subsequently the electronically excited molecule can undergo photon emission also called fluorescence to return to its ground electronic state as shown in Figure Figure Fluorescence From Lower Levels of the Upper Surface The FranckCondon principle discussed earlier also governs the relative intensities of the various vibrational transitions arising in such emission processes Thus one again observes a set of peaks in the emission spectrum as shown in Figure Figure Absorption and Emission Spectra With the Latter Red Shifted There are two differences between the lines that occur in emission and in absorption First the emission lines are shifted to the red ie to lower energy or longer wavelength because they occur at transition energies connecting the lowest vibrational level of the upper electronic state to various levels of the lower state In contrast the absorption lines connect the lowest vibrational level of the ground state to various levels of the upper state These relationships are shown in Figure Figure Absorption to High States on the Upper Surface Relaxation and Emission From Lower States of the Upper Surface The second difference relates to the spacings among the vibrational lines In emission these spacings reflect the energy spacings between vibrational levels of the ground state whereas in absorption they reflect spacings between vibrational levels of the upper state The above examples illustrate how vibrationallyresolved visibleUV absorption and emission spectra can be used to gain valuable information about athe vibrational energy level spacings of the upper and ground electronic states these spacings in turn reflect the strengths of the bonds existing in these states bthe change in geometry accompanying the groundtoexcited state electronic transition as reflected in the breadth of the FranckCondon profiles these changes also tell us about the bonding changes that occur as the electronic transition occurs So again we see how visibleUV spectroscopy can be used to learn about the electronic structure of molecules in various electronic states Time Correlation Function Expressions for Transition Rates The above socalled goldenrule expression for the rates of photoninduced transitions are written in terms of the initial and final electronicvibrationalrotational states of the molecule There are situations in which these states simply cannot be reliably known For example the higher vibrational states of a large polyatomic molecule or the states of a molecule that strongly interacts with surrounding solvent molecules are such cases In such circumstances it is possible to recast the golden rule formula into a form that is more amenable to introducing specific physical models that lead to additional insights Specifically by using socalled equilibrium averaged time correlation functions it is possible to obtain rate expressions appropriate to a large number of molecules that exist in a distribution of initial states eg for molecules that occupy many possible rotational and perhaps several vibrational levels at room temperature As we will soon see taking this route to expressing spectroscopic transition rates also allows us to avoid having to know each vibrationalrotational wave function of the two electronic states involved as noted above this is especially useful for large molecules or molecules in condensed media where such knowledge is likely not available To begin reexpressing the spectroscopic transition rates the expression obtained earlier R_if fracpihbar fomega_fi textbfE_ langle Phi_f boldsymbolmu Phi_irangle appropriate to transitions between a particular initial state and a specific final state is rewritten as R_if fracpihbar int fomegatextbfE_ cdot langle Phi_f boldsymbolmu Phi_i rangle deltaomega_fiomegadomega Here the function is used to specifically enforce the resonance condition which states that the photons frequency must be resonant with the transition frequency The following integral identity can be used to replace the function by a form that is more amenable to further development Then the statetostate rate of transition becomes If this expression is then multiplied by the equilibrium probability that the molecule is found in the state and summed over all such initial states and summed over all final states that can be reached from with photons of energy the equilibrium averaged rate of photon absorption by the molecular sample is obtained This expression is appropriate for an ensemble of molecules that can be in various initial states with probabilities The corresponding result for transitions that originate in a particular state but end up in any of the allowed by energy and selection rules final states reads R_i frachbarsum_f rho_i int fomega textbfE_ cdot langle Phi_f boldsymbolmu Phi_i rangle int_inftyinfty expiomega_fiomegat dt domega As we discuss in Chapter for an ensemble in which the number of molecules the temperature and the system volume are specified takes the form where is the partition function of the molecules and is the degeneracy of the state whose energy is If you are unfamiliar with partition functions and do not want to simply trust me in the analysis of time correlation functions that we am about to undertake I suggest you interrupt your study of Chapter and read up through Section of Chapter at this time In the above expression for a double sum occurs Writing out the elements that appear in this sum in detail one finds sum_if rho_i textbfE_ langle Phi_i boldsymbolmu Phi_frangle textbfE_ langle Phi_f boldsymbolmu Phi_irangle expiomega_fit In situations in which one is interested in developing an expression for the intensity arising from transitions to all allowed final states the sum over the final states can be carried out explicitly by first writing and then using the fact that the set of states are complete and hence obey The result of using these identities as well as the Heisenberg definition of the timedependence of the dipole operator is sum_irho_i langle Phi_i textbfE_ boldsymbolmu textbfE_ boldsymbolmu t Phi_irangle In this form one says that the time dependence has been reduce to that of an equilibrium averaged ie as reflected in the sum_i rho_i langle Phi_i Phi_irangle expression time correlation function involving the component of the dipole operator along the external electric field at and this component at a different time If is positive ie in the photon absorption case the above expression will yield a nonzero contribution when multiplied by and integrated over positive values If is negative as for stimulated photon emission this expression will contribute when multiplied by for negative values In the latter situation is the equilibrium probability of finding the molecule in the excited state from which emission will occur this probability can be related to that of the lower state by rho_rm excited rho_rm lower exp E_rm excited E_rm lowerkT The absorption and emission cases can be combined into a single expression for the net rate of photon absorption by recognizing that the latter process leads to photon production and thus must be entered with a negative sign The resultant expression for the net rate of decrease of photons is int int fomega langle Phi_i textbfE_ boldsymbolmu textbfE_ boldsymbolmu t Phi_irangle exp hbaromegakT expiomega t domega dt It is convention to introduce the socalled line shape function I omega sum_i rho_i expiomega t dt in terms of which the net photon absorption rate is R_rm eqavenet frachbar exp hbaromegakT The function C t sum_i rho_i langle Phi_i textbfE_ boldsymbolmu textbfE_ boldsymbolmu t Phi_irangle is called the equilibrium averaged time correlation function of the component of the electric dipole operator along the direction of the external electric field Its Fourier transform is the spectral line shape function The convolution of with the light sources function multiplied by the correction for stimulated photon emission gives the net rate of photon absorption Although the correlation function expression for the photon absorption rate is equivalent to the statetostate expression from which it was derived we notice that does not contain explicit reference to the finalstate wave functions instead requires us to describe how the dipole operator changes with time That is in the time correlation framework one is allowed to use models of the time evolution of the system to describe the spectra This is especially appealing for large complex molecules and molecules in condensed media because for such systems it would be hopeless to attempt to find the finalstate wave functions but it may be reasonable albeit challenging to model the systems time evolution Prof Eric Heller at Harvard has pioneered the use of timedomain methods for treating molecular spectroscopy his web site offers access to further information and insight into this subject It turns out that a very wide variety of spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties eg light scattering intensities diffusion coefficients and thermal conductivity can be expressed in terms of molecular time correlation functions The text Statistical Mechanics D A McQuarrie Harper and Row New York has a good treatment of many of these cases Lets now examine how such time evolution issues are used within the correlation function framework for the specific photon absorption case Line Broadening Mechanisms If the rotational motion of the systems molecules is assumed to be entirely unhindered eg by any environment or by collisions with other molecules it is appropriate to express the time dependence of each of the dipole time correlation functions listed above in terms of a free rotation model For example when dealing with diatomic molecules the electronicvibrationalrotational appropriate to a specific electronicvibrational transition becomes Ct q_r q_v q_e q_t sum_J J expbigg frachbarJJpiIkTbigg expBig frachbarnu_rm vibv_ikTBig g_ie langle phi_J textbfE_ boldsymbolmu_ifR_e textbfE_ boldsymbolmu_ifR_et phi_Jrangle langle chi_iv chi_fvrangle Here is the rotational partition function I being the molecules moment of inertia and being the molecules rotational energy for the state with quantum number and degeneracy is the vibrational partition function being the vibrational frequency is the degeneracy of the initial electronic state is the translational partition function for the molecules of mass moving in volume and is the adiabatic electronic energy spacing The origins of such partition functions are treated in Chapter of this text The functions describe the time evolution of the electronic transition dipole vector for the rotational state In a freerotation model this function is taken to be of the form where is the rotational frequency in cycles per second for rotation of the molecule in the state labeled by This oscillatory time dependence combined with the time dependence arising from the electronic and vibrational factors produce when this function is Fourier transformed to generate a series of function peaks The intensities of these peaks are governed by the quantities Boltzmann population factors as well as by the FranckCondon factors and the terms This same analysis can be applied to the pure rotation and vibrationrotation time dependences with analogous results In the former function peaks are predicted to occur at and in the latter at omega omega_fviv omega_J with the intensities governed by the time independent factors in the corresponding expressions for In experimental measurements such sharp function peaks are of course not observed Even when very narrow bandwidth laser light sources are used ie for which is an extremely narrowly peaked function spectral lines are found to possess finite widths Let us now discuss several sources of line broadening some of which will relate to deviations from the unhindered rotational motion model introduced above a Doppler Broadening In the above expressions for the averaging over initial rotational vibrational and electronic states is explicitly shown There is also an average over the translational motion implicit in all of these expressions Its role has not yet been emphasized because the molecular energy levels whose spacings yield the characteristic frequencies at which light can be absorbed or emitted do not depend on translational motion However the frequency of the electromagnetic field experienced by moving molecules does depend on the velocities of the molecules so this issue must now be addressed Elementary physics classes express the socalled Doppler shift of a waves frequency induced by relative movement of the light source and the molecule as follows Here is the frequency of the unmoving light source seen by unmoving molecules is the velocity of relative motion of the light source and molecules is the speed of light and wobserved is the Dopplershifted frequency ie the frequency seen by the molecules The second identity is obtained by expanding in a power series the factor and is valid in truncated form when the molecules are moving with speeds significantly below the speed of light For all of the cases considered earlier a function is subjected to Fourier transformation to obtain a spectral line shape function which then provides the essential ingredient for computing the net rate of photon absorption In this Fourier transform process the variable is assumed to be the frequency of the electromagnetic field experienced by the molecules The above considerations of Doppler shifting then lead one to realize that the correct functional form to use in converting to is where is the nominal frequency of the light source As stated earlier within there is also an equilibrium average over translational motion of the molecules For a gasphase sample undergoing random collisions and at thermal equilibrium this average is characterized by the wellknown MaxwellBoltzmann velocity distribution Here is the mass of the molecules and and label the velocities along the labfixed Cartesian coordinates Defining the axis as the direction of propagation of the lights photons and carrying out the averaging of the Doppler factor over such a velocity distribution one obtains int_inftyinfty explefti t omegaBigdfracv_zcBigright leftfracmpi kTrightexpbiggfracm v_xv_yv_zkTbigg dv_x dv_y dv_z expiomega tint_inftyinfty leftfracmpi kTright expleftitomega dfracv_zcrightexpBigdfracmv_zkTBigdv_z This result when substituted into the expressions for yields expressions identical to those given for the three cases treated above but with one modification The translational motion average need no longer be considered in each instead the earlier expressions for must each be multiplied by a factor that embodies the translationaly averaged Doppler shift The spectral line shape function can then be obtained for each by simply Fourier transforming When applied to the rotation vibrationrotation or electronicvibrationrotation cases within the unhindered rotation model treated earlier the Fourier transform involves integrals of the form This integral would arise in the electronicvibrationrotation case the other two cases would involve integrals of the same form but with the absent in the vibrationrotation situation and with missing for pure rotation transitions All such integrals can be carried out analytically and yield The result is a series of Gaussian peaks in space centered at with widths determined by given the temperature and the mass of the molecules The hotter the sample the faster the molecules are moving on average and the broader is the distribution of Doppler shifted frequencies experienced by these molecules The net result then of the Doppler effect is to produce a line shape function that is similar to the unhindered rotation models series of functions but with each function peak broadened into a Gaussian shape If spectra can be obtained to accuracy sufficient to determine the Doppler width of the spectral lines such knowledge can be used to estimate the temperature of the system This can be useful when dealing with systems that cannot be subjected to alternative temperature measurements For example the temperatures of stars can be estimated if their velocity relative to the earth is known by determining the Doppler shifts of emission lines from them Alternatively the relative speed of a star from the earth may be determined if its temperature is known As another example the temperature of hot gases produced in an explosion can be probed by measuring Doppler widths of absorption or emission lines arising from molecules in these gases b Pressure Broadening To include the effects of collisions on the rotational motion part of any of the above functions one must introduce a model for how such collisions change the dipolerelated vectors that enter into The most elementary model used to address collisions applies to gaseous samples which are assumed to undergo unhindered rotational motion until struck by another molecule at which time a kick is applied to the dipole vector and after which the molecule returns to its unhindered rotational movement The effects of such infrequent collisioninduced kicks are treated within the socalled pressure broadening sometimes called collisional broadening model by modifying the freerotation correlation function through the introduction of an exponential damping factor This damping functions time scale parameter is assumed to characterize the average time between collisions and thus should be inversely proportional to the collision frequency Its magnitude is also related to the effectiveness with which collisions cause the dipole function to deviate from its unhindered rotational motion ie related to the collision strength In effect the exponential damping causes the time correlation function to lose its memory and to decay to zero This memory point of view is based on viewing as the projection of along its value as a function of time t Introducing this additional time dependence into produces when is Fourier transformed to generate integrals of the form In the limit of very small Doppler broadening the factor can be ignored ie set equal to unity and results This integral can be performed analytically and generates a pair of Lorentzian peaks in space centered again at The full width at half height of these Lorentzian peaks is One says that the individual peaks have been pressure or collisionally broadened When the Doppler broadening can not be neglected relative to the collisional broadening the above integral is more difficult to perform Nevertheless it can be carried out and again produces a series of peaks centered at but whose widths are determined both by Doppler and pressure broadening effects The resultant line shapes are thus no longer purely Lorentzian nor Gaussian which are compared in Figure for both functions having the same full width at half height and the same integrated area but have a shape that is called a Voight shape Figure Typical Forms of Gaussian and Lorentzian Peaks having identical widths and areas Experimental measurements of line widths that allow one to extract widths originating from collisional broadening provide information through on the frequency of collisions and the strength of these collisions By determining at a series of gas densities one can separate the collisionfrequency dependence and determine the strength of the individual collisions meaning how effective each collision is in reorienting the molecules dipole vector c Rotational Diffusion Broadening Molecules in liquids and very dense gases undergo such frequent collisions with the other molecules that the mean time between collisions is short compared to the rotational period for their unhindered rotation As a result the time dependence of the dipolerelated correlation functions can no longer be modeled in terms of free rotation that is interrupted by infrequent collisions and Doppler shifted Instead a model that describes the incessant buffeting of the molecules dipole by surrounding molecules becomes appropriate For liquid samples in which these frequent collisions cause the dipole to undergo angular motions that cover all angles ie in contrast to a frozen glass or solid in which the molecules dipole would undergo strongly perturbed pendular motion about some favored orientation the socalled rotational diffusion model is often used In this picture the rotationdependent part of is expressed as langle phi_J textbfE_ boldsymbolmu_ifR_e textbfE_ boldsymbolmu_ifR_e phi_Jrangle exp D_rm rott where is the rotational diffusion constant whose magnitude details the time decay in the averaged value of at time with respect to its value at time the larger the faster is this decay As with pressure broadening this exponential time dependence when subjected to Fourier transformation yields int_inftyinfty expiomega t exp D_rm rott expbigg fracomegatkTmcbigg explefti Bigomega_fviv dfracDelta E_ifhbar pm omega_JBig t right Again in the limit of very small Doppler broadening the factor can be ignored ie set equal to unity and int_inftyinfty expiomega t exp D_rm rott explefti Bigomega_fviv dfracDelta E_ifhbar pm omega_JBig t right results This integral can be evaluated analytically and generates a pair of Lorentzian peaks in space centered again at The full width at half height of these Lorentzian peaks is In this case one says that the individual peaks have been broadened via rotational diffusion In such cases experimental measurement of line widths yield valuable information about how fast the molecule is rotationally diffusing in its condensed environment d Lifetime or Heisenberg Homogeneous Broadening Whenever the absorbing species undergoes one or more processes that depletes its numbers we say that it has a finite lifetime For example a species that undergoes unimolecular dissociation has a finite lifetime as does an excited state of a molecule that decays by spontaneous emission of a photon Any process that depletes the absorbing species contributes another source of time dependence for the dipole time correlation functions discussed above This time dependence is usually modeled by appending in a multiplicative manner a factor This in turn modifies the line shape function in a manner much like that discussed when treating the rotational diffusion case Not surprisingly when the Doppler contribution is small one obtains In these Lorentzian lines the parameter describes the kinetic decay lifetime of the molecule One says that the spectral lines have been lifetime or Heisenberg broadened by an amount proportional to The latter terminology arises because the finite lifetime of the molecular states can be viewed as producing via the Heisenberg uncertainty relation states whose energy is uncertain to within an amount e Site Inhomogeneous Broadening Among the above line broadening mechanisms the pressure rotational diffusion and lifetime broadenings are all of the homogeneous variety This means that each and every molecule in the sample is affected in exactly the same manner by the broadening process For example one does not find some molecules with short lifetimes and others with long lifetimes in the Heisenberg case the entire ensemble of molecules is characterized by a single lifetime In contrast Doppler broadening is inhomogeneous in nature because each molecule experiences a broadening that is characteristic of its particular velocity That is the fast molecules have their lines broadened more than do the slower molecules Another important example of inhomogeneous broadening is provided by socalled site broadening Molecules imbedded in a liquid solid or glass do not at the instant of their photon absorption all experience exactly the same interactions with their surroundings The distribution of instantaneous solvation environments may be rather narrow eg in a highly ordered solid matrix or quite broad eg in a liquid at high temperature or in a supercritical liquid Different environments produce different energy level splittings because the initial and final states are solvated differently by the surroundings and thus different frequencies at which photon absorption can occur The distribution of energy level splittings causes the sample to absorb at a range of frequencies as illustrated in Figure where homogeneous and inhomogeneous line shapes are compared Figure Illustration of homogeneous band showing absorption at several concentrations of the absorbing species left and of inhomogeneous band showing absorption at one concentration by numerous subpopulations The spectral line shape function is therefore further broadened when site inhomogeneity is present and significant These effects can be modeled by convolving the kind of function that results from Doppler lifetime rotational diffusion and pressure broadening with a Gaussian distribution that describes the inhomogeneous distribution of energy level splittings Here is a line shape function such as those described earlier each of which contains a set of frequencies eg omega_fvivDelta E_ifhbar omega_J Delta E hbar omegaDelta E hbar at which absorption or emission occurs and is a Gaussian probability function describing the inhomogeneous broadening of the energy splitting A common experimental test to determine whether inhomogeneous broadening is significant involves hole burning In such experiments an intense light source often a laser is tuned to a frequency that lies within the spectral line being probed for inhomogeneous broadening Then with the intense light source constantly turned on a second tunable light source is used to scan through the profile of the spectral line and an absorption spectrum is recorded Given an absorption profile as shown in Figure in the absence of the intense burning light source Figure Absorption Profile in the Absence of Hole Burning one expects to see a profile such as that shown in Figure if inhomogeneous broadening is operative Figure Absorption Profile With Laser Turned On to Burn a Hole The interpretation of the change in the absorption profile caused by the bright light source proceeds as follows In the ensemble of molecules contained in the sample some molecules will absorb at or near the frequency of the bright light source other molecules those whose environments do not produce energy level splittings that match will not absorb at this frequency Those molecules that do absorb at will have their transition saturated by the intense light source thereby rendering this frequency region of the line profile transparent to further absorption When the probe light source is scanned over the line profile it will induce absorptions for those molecules whose local environments did not allow them to be saturated by the light The absorption profile recorded by this probe light sources detector thus will match that of the original line profile until The probe light sources frequency matches upon which no absorption of the probe sources photons will be recorded because molecules that absorb in this frequency regime have had their transition saturated Hence a hole will appear in the absorption spectrum recorded by the probe light sources detector in the region of Unfortunately the technique of hole burning does not provide a fully reliable method for identifying inhomogeneously broadened lines If a hole is observed in such a burning experiment this provides ample evidence but if one is not seen the result is not definitive In the latter case the transition may not be strong enough ie may not have a large enough rate of photon absorption for the intense light source to saturate the transition to the extent needed to form a hole Photoelectron Spectroscopy Photoelectron spectroscopy PES is a special kind of electronic spectroscopy It uses visible or UV light to excite a molecule or ion to a final state in which an electron is ejected In effect it induces transitions to final states in which an electron has been promoted to an unbound socalled continuum orbital Most PES experiments are carried out using a fixedfrequency light source usually a laser This sources photons when absorbed eject electrons whose intensity and kinetic energies are then measured Subtracting the electrons from the photons energy gives the binding energy of the electron If the sample subjected to the PES experiment has molecules in a variety of initial states eg two electronic states or various vibrationalrotational levels of the ground electronic state having various binding energies one will observe a series of peaks corresponding to electrons ejected with a variety of kinetic energies as Figure illustrates and as the energybalance condition requires The peak of electrons detected with the highest kinetic energy came from the highestlying state of the parent while those with low kinetic energy came from the lowestenergy state of the parent Figure Photoelectron spectrum showing absorption from two states of the parent By examining the spacings between these peaks one learns about the spacings between the energy levels of the parent species that has been subjected to electron loss Alternatively if the parent species exists primarily in its lowest state but the daughter species produced when an electron is removed from the parent has excited electronic vibrationrotation states that can be accessed one can observe a different progression of peaks In this case the electrons with highest kinetic energy arise from transitions leading to the lowestenergy state of the daughter as Figure illustrates In that figure the lower energy surface belongs to the parent and the upper curve to the daughter Figure Photoelectron events showing detachment from one state of the parent to several states of the daughter An example of experimental photodetachment data is provided in Figure showing the intensity of electrons detected when anion loses an electron vs the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons Figure Photoelectron spectrum of Cu The peaks belong to a FranckCondon vibrational progression of neutral Cu The peak at a kinetic energy of ca eV corresponding to a binding energy of eV arises from in losing an electron to produce in The most intense peak corresponds to a to transition As in the visibleUV spectroscopy case FranckCondon factors involving the overlap of the anion and neutral vibrational wave functions govern the relative intensities of the PES peaks Another example is given in Figure where the photodetachment spectrum of the anion of the carbene vinylidene appears Figure Photoelectron spectrum of showing detachments to two electronic states of the neutral In this spectrum the peaks having electron binding energies near eV correspond to transitions in which groundstate in is detached to produce groundstate in various v levels The spacings between this group of peaks relate to the spacings in vibrational states of this electronic state The series of peaks with binding energies near eV correspond to transitions in which is detached to produce in its excited electronic state The spacings between peaks in this range relate to spacings in vibrational states of this state The spacing between the peaks near eV and those near eV relate to the energy difference between the and electronic states of the neutral Because PES offers a direct way to measure energy differences between anion and neutral or neutral and cation state energies it is a powerful and widely used means of determining molecular electron affinities EAs and ionization potentials IPs Because IPs and EAs relate via Koopmans theorem to orbital energies PES is thus seen to be a way to measure orbital energies Its vibrational envelopes also offer a good way to probe vibrational energy level spacings and hence the bonding strengths Probing Continuum Orbitals There is another type of spectroscopy that can be used to directly probe the orbitals of a molecule that lie in the continuum ie at energies higher than that of the parent neutral I ask that you reflect back on our discussion in Chapter of tunneling and of resonance states that can occur when an electron experiences both attractive and repulsive potentials In such cases there exists a special energy at which the electron can be trapped by the attractive potential and have to tunnel through the repulsive barrier to eventually escape It is these kinds of situations that this spectroscopy probes This experiment is called electrontransmission spectroscopy ETS In such an experiment a beam of electrons having a known intensity and narrowly defined range of kinetic energies is allowed to pass through a sample usually gaseous of thickness The intensity of electrons observed to pass through the sample and arrive at a detector lying along the incident beams direction is monitored as are the kinetic energies of these electrons Such an experiment is described in qualitative form in Figure Figure Qualitative depiction of a prototypical electron transmission spectrum setup If the molecules in the sample have a resonance orbital whose energy is close to the kinetic energy of the colliding electrons it is possible for an electron from the beam to be captured into such an orbital and to exist in this orbital for a considerable time Of course in the absence of any collisions or other processes to carry away excess energy this anion will reemit an electron at a later time Hence such anions are called metastable and their electronic states are called resonance states If the captured electron remains in this orbital for a length of time comparable to or longer than the time it takes for the nascent molecular anion to undergo vibrational or rotational motion various events can take place before the electron is reemitted isome bond lengths or angles can change this will happen if the orbital occupied by the beams electron has bonding or antibonding character so when the electron is subsequently emitted the neutral molecule is left with a change in vibrational energy iithe molecule may rotate so when the electron is ejected it is not emitted in the same direction as the incident beam In the former case one observes electrons emitted with energies that differ from that of the incident beam by amounts related to the internal vibrational energy levels of the anion In the latter one sees a reduction in the intensity of the beam that is transmitted directly through the sample and electrons that are scattered away from this direction Such an ETS spectrum is shown in Figure for a gaseous sample of molecules In this spectrum the energy of the transmitted beams electrons is plotted on the horizontal axis and the derivative of the intensity of the transmitted beam is plotted on the vertical axis It is common to plot such derivatives in ETStype experiments to allow the variation of the signal with energy to be more clearly identified Figure ETS Spectrum plotted in derivative form as described in the text of In this ETS spectrum of the oscillations that appear within the major spectral feature displayed whose center is near eV correspond to stretching and bending vibrational levels of the metastable anion It is the bending vibration that is primarily excited because the beam electron enters the LUMO of which is an orbital of the form shown in Figure Figure Antibonding orbital of holding the excess electron in Occupancy of this antibonding orbital causes both CO bonds to lengthen and the OCO angle to bend away from deg The bending allows the antibonding nature of this orbital to be reduced Other examples of ETS spectra are shown in Figure Figure ETS spectra of several DNA bases Here again a derivative spectrum is shown and the vertical lines have been added to show where the derivative passes through zero which is where the ETS absorption signal would have a peak These maxima correspond to electrons entering various virtual orbitals of the uracil and DNA base molecules It is by finding these peaks in the ETS spectrum that one can determine the energies of such continuum orbitals Before closing this section it is important to describe how one uses theory to simulate the metastable states that arise in such ETS experiments Such calculations are not at all straightforward and require the introduction of special tools designed to properly model the resonant continuum orbital For metastable anions it is difficult to approximate the potential experienced by the excess electron For example singly charged anions in which the excess electron occupies a molecular orbital that possesses nonzero angular momentum have effective potentials as shown in Figure which depend on the angular momentum value of the orbital Figure Radial potentials and shape resonance energy levels for two values For example the orbital of shown in Figure produces two counteracting contributions to the effective radial potential experienced by an electron occupying it Figure Antibonding orbital of showing its character First the two nitrogen centers exert attractive potentials on the electron in this orbital These attractions are strongest when the excess electron is near the nuclei but decay rapidly at larger distances because the other electrons Coulomb repulsions screen the nuclear attractions Secondly because the molecular orbital is comprised of atomic basis functions of etc symmetry it possesses nonzero angular momentum Because the orbital has gerade symmetry its larger character is dominated by angular momentum As a result the excess electron has a centrifugal radial potential derived largely from its character The attractive shortrange valence potentials and the centrifugal potential combine to produce a net effective potential as illustrated in Figure The energy of an electron experiencing such a potential may or may not lie below the asymptote If the attractive potential is sufficiently strong as it is for the electron in the orbital will be bound and its energy will lie below this asymptote On the other hand if the attractive potential is not as strong as is the case for the lesselectronegative nitrogen atoms in the energy of the orbital can lie above the asymptote In the latter cases we speak of metastable shaperesonance states They are metastable because their energies lie above the asymptote so they can decay by tunneling through the centrifugal barrier They are called shaperesonances because their metastability arises from the shape of their repulsive centrifugal barrier If one had inhand a reasonable approximation to the attractive shortrange potential and if one knew the Lsymmetry of the orbital occupied by the excess electron one could form as above However to compute the lifetime of the shape resonance one has to know the energy of this state The most common and powerful tool for studying such metastable states theoretically is the stabilization method SM that Prof Howard Taylor at USC pioneered This method involves embedding the system of interest eg the anion within a finite radial box in order to convert the continuum of states corresponding for example to into discrete states that can be handled using more conventional methods By then varying the size of the box one can vary the energies of the discrete states that correspond to ie one varies the kinetic energy of the orbital containing the excess electron As the box size is varied one eventually notices eg by plotting the orbitals that one of the states possesses a significant amount of valence ie shortrange character That is one such state has significant amplitude not only at larger but also in the region of the two nitrogen centers It is this state that corresponds to the metastable shaperesonance state and it is the energy where significant valence components develop that provides the stabilization estimate of the state energy Let us continue using as an example for how the SM would be employed especially how one usually varies the box within which the anion is constrained One would use a conventional atomic orbital basis set that would likely include s and functions on each atom perhaps some polarization d functions and some conventional diffuse s and orbitals on each atom These basis orbitals serve primarily to describe the motions of the electrons within the usual valence regions of space To this basis one would append extra sets of diffuse symmetry orbitals These orbitals could be and maybe functions centered on each nitrogen atom or they could be and maybe orbitals centered at the midpoint of the NN bond One usually would not add just one such function rather several such functions each with an orbital exponent that characterizes its radial extent would be used Let us assume for example that such functions have been used Next using the conventional atomic orbital basis as well as the extra basis functions one carries out a calculation most often a variational calculation in which one computes many energy levels on the anion In this calculation one tabulates the energies of many say M of the electronic states of Of course because a finite atomic orbital basis set must be used one finds a discrete spectrum of orbital energies and thus of electronic state energies There are occupied orbitals having negative energy that represent via Koopmans theorem the bound states of the There are also socalled virtual orbitals ie those orbitals that are not occupied whose energies lie above zero ie do not describe bound states The latter orbitals offer a discrete approximation to the continuum within which the resonance state of interest lies One then scales the orbital exponents of the extra basis orbitals by a factor alpha_J rightarrow eta alpha_J and repeats the calculation of the energies of the M lowest energies of This scaling causes the extra basis orbitals to contract radially if or to expand radially if It is this basis orbital expansion and contraction that produces expansion and contraction of the box discussed above That is one does not employ a box directly instead one varies the radial extent of the most diffuse basis orbitals to simulate the box variation If the conventional orbital basis is adequate one finds that the extra orbitals whose exponents are being scaled do not affect appreciably the energy of the neutral molecule This can be probed by plotting the energy as a function of the scaling parameter h if the energy varies little with the conventional basis is adequate In contrast to plots of the neutral energy vs plots of the energies of the M states show significant hdependence as Figure illustrates Figure Typical stabilization plot showing several levels of the metastable anion and their avoided Crossings What does such a stabilization plot tell us and what do the various branches of the plot mean First one should notice that each of the plots of the energy of an anion state relative to the neutral molecules energy which is independent of grows with increasing h This hdependence arises from the hscaling of the extra diffuse basis orbitals Because most of the amplitude of such basis orbitals lies outside the valence region the kinetic energy is the dominant contributor to such orbitals energy Because enters into each orbital as and because the kinetic energy operator involves the second derivative with respect to r the kinetic energies of orbitals dominated by the diffuse basis functions vary as For small all of the diffuse basis functions have their amplitudes concentrated at large r and have low kinetic energy This is because for small all of these orbitals are very diffuse and concentrate electron density at large distances As grows these functions become more radially compact and their kinetic energies grow For example note the three lowest energies shown above increasing from near zero as grows As further increases one reaches a point at which the third and fourth anionstate energies undergo an avoided crossing At this value if one examines the nature of the two wave functions whose energies avoid one another one finds that one of them contains substantial amounts of both valence and extradiffuse function character Just to the left of the avoided crossing the lowerenergy state the third state for small contains predominantly extra diffuse orbital character while the higherenergy state the fourth state contains largely valence orbital character However at the special value of where these two states nearly cross the kinetic energy of the third state as well as its radial size and its de Broglie wavelength are appropriate to connect properly with the fourth state By connect properly we mean that the two states have wave function amplitudes phases and slopes that match So at this special value one can achieve a description of the shaperesonance state that correctly describes this state both in the valence region and in the larger region Only by tuning the energy of the larger states using the scaling can one obtain this proper boundary condition matching In summary by carrying out a series of anionstate energy calculations for several states and plotting them vs one obtains a stabilization graph By examining this graph and looking for avoided crossings one can identify the energies at which metastable resonances occur It is also possible to use the shapes ie the magnitude of the energy splitting between the two states and the slopes of the two avoiding curves of the avoided crossings in a stabilization graph to compute the lifetimes of the metastable states Basically the larger the avoided crossing energy splitting between the two states the shorter is the lifetime of the resonance state So the ETS and PES experiments offer wonderful probes of the bound and continuum states of molecules and ions that tell us a lot about the electronic nature and chemical bonding of these species The theoretical study of these phenomena is complicated by the need to properly identify and describe any continuum orbitals and states that are involved The stabilization technique allows us to achieve a good approximation to resonance
