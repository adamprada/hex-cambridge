The particleinabox type problems provide important models for several relevant chemical situations The particleinabox model for motion in one or two dimensions discussed earlier can obviously be extended to three dimensions For two and three dimensions it provides a crude but useful picture for electronic states on surfaces ie when the electron can move freely on the surface but cannot escape to the vacuum or penetrate deeply into the solid or in metallic crystals respectively I say metallic crystals because it is in such systems that the outermost valence electrons are reasonably well treated as moving freely rather than being tightly bound to a valence orbital on one of the constituent atoms or within chemical bonds localized to neighboring atoms Free motion within a spherical volume such as we discussed in Chapter gives rise to eigenfunctions that are also used in nuclear physics to describe the motions of neutrons and protons in nuclei In the socalled shell model of nuclei the neutrons and protons fill separate etc orbitals refer back to Chapter to recall how these orbitals are expressed in terms of spherical Bessel functions and what their energies are with each type of nucleon forced to obey the Pauli exclusion principle ie to have no more than two nucleons in each orbital because protons and neutrons are Fermions For example has two protons in orbitals and neutrons in orbitals whereas has two protons and one neutron To remind you I display in Figure the angular shapes that characterize and orbitals Figure The angular shapes of and functions This same spherical box model has also been used to describe the valence electrons in quasispherical nanoclusters of metal atoms such as and their positive and negative ions Because of the metallic nature of these species their valence electrons are essentially free to roam over the entire spherical volume of the cluster which renders this simple model rather effective In this model one thinks of each valence electron being free to roam within a sphere of radius ie having a potential that is uniform within the sphere and infinite outside the sphere The orbitals that solve the Schr√∂dinger equation inside such a spherical box are not the same in their radial shapes as the etc orbitals of atoms because in atoms there is an additional attractive Coulomb radial potential present In Chapter we showed how the particleinasphere radial functions can be expressed in terms of spherical Bessel functions In addition the pattern of energy levels which was shown in Chapter to be related to the values of x at which the spherical Bessel functions vanish are not the same as in atoms again because the radial potentials differ However the angular shapes of the spherical box problem are the same as in atomic structure because in both cases the potential is independent of and As the orbital plots shown above indicate the angular shapes of s p and orbitals display varying number of nodal surfaces The orbitals have none orbitals have one and orbitals have two Analogous to how the number of nodes related to the total energy of the particle constrained to the plane the number of nodes in the angular wave functions indicates the amount of angular or orbital rotational energy Orbitals of shape have no angular energy those of shape have less then do orbitals etc It turns out that the pattern of energy levels derived from this particleinasphericalbox model can offer reasonably accurate descriptions of what is observed experimentally In particular when a cluster or cluster ion has a closedshell electronic configuration in which for a given radial quantum number all of the orbitals associated with that are doubly occupied nanoscopic metal clusters are observed to display special stability eg lack of chemical reactivity large electron detachment energy Clusters that produce such closedshell electronic configurations are sometimes said to have magicnumber sizes The energy level expression given in Chapter for an electron moving inside a sphere of radius and having a potential relative to the vacuum of can be used to model the energies of electron within metallic nanoclusters Each electron occupies an orbital having quantum numbers and with the energies of the orbitals given above in terms of the zeros of the spherical Bessel functions Spectral features of the nanoclusters are then determined by the energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital and can be tuned by changing the radius of the cluster or the charge ie number of electrons of the cluster Another very useful application of the model problems treated in Chapter is the onedimensional particleinabox which provides a qualitatively correct picture for electron motion along the orbitals of delocalized polyenes The one Cartesian dimension corresponds to motion along the delocalized chain In such a model the box length is related to the carboncarbon bond length and the number of carbon centers involved in the delocalized network In Figure such a conjugated network involving nine centers is depicted In this example the box length would be eight times the CC bond length Figure The atomic orbitals of a conjugated chain of nine carbon atoms so the box length is eight times the CC bond length The eigenstates and their energies represent orbitals into which electrons are placed In the example case if nine electrons are present eg as in the nonatetraene radical the ground electronic state would be represented by a total wave function consisting of a product in which the lowest four s are doubly occupied and the fifth is singly occupied The component spin angular momentum states of the electrons are labeled and as discussed earlier We write the total wave function above as a product wave function because the total Hamiltonian involves the kinetic plus potential energies of nine electrons To the extent that this total energy can be represented as the sum of nine separate energies one for each electron the Hamiltonian allows a separation of variables in which each Hj describes the kinetic and potential energy of an individual electron Of course the full Hamiltonian contains electronelectron Coulomb interaction potentials that cannot be written in this additive form However as we will treat in detail in Chapter it is often possible to approximate these electronelectron interactions in a form that is additive Recall that when a partial differential equation has no operators that couple its different independent variables ie when it is separable one can use separation of variables methods to decompose its solutions into products Thus the approximate additivity of implies that solutions of are products of solutions to The two lowest excited states would correspond to states of the form and where the spinorbitals orbitals multiplied by or appearing in the above products depend on the coordinates of the various electrons For example denotes The electronic excitation energies from the ground state to each of the above excited states within this model would be DeltaE dfrac pi hbarm left dfracL dfracLright taga and It turns out that this simple model of electron energies provides a qualitatively correct picture of such excitation energies Its simplicity allows one for example to easily suggest how a molecules color as reflected in the complementary color of the light the molecule absorbs varies as the conjugation length of the molecule varies That is longer conjugated molecules have lowerenergy orbitals because appears in the denominator of the energy expression As a result longer conjugated molecules absorb light of lower energy than do shorter molecules This simple particleinabox model does not yield orbital energies that relate to ionization energies unless the potential inside the box is specified Choosing the value of this potential that exists within the box such that is equal to minus the lowest ionization energy of the nonatetraene radical gives energy levels as which can then be used as approximations to ionization energies The individual molecular orbitals are depicted in Figure for a model of the hexatriene orbital system for which the box length is five times the distance between neighboring pairs of carbon atoms The magnitude of the Catom centered atomic orbital in the molecular orbital is given by Figure The phases of the six molecular orbitals of a chain containing six atoms In this figure positive amplitude is denoted by the clear spheres and negative amplitude is shown by the darkened spheres Where two spheres of like shading overlap the wave function has enhanced amplitude ie there is a bonding interaction where two spheres of different shading overlap a node occurs ie there is antibonding interaction Once again we note that the number of nodes increases as one ranges from the lowestenergy orbital to higher energy orbitals The reader is once again encouraged to keep in mind this ubiquitous characteristic of quantum mechanical wave functions This simple model allows one to estimate spin densities at each carbon center and provides insight into which centers should be most amenable to electrophilic or nucleophilic attack For example radical attack at the carbon of the nineatom nonatetraene system described earlier would be more facile for the ground state than for either or In the former the unpaired spin density resides in which varies as so is nonzero at which has nonzero amplitude at the site In and the unpaired density is in and respectively both of which have zero density at because sinnpxRCC vanishes for or at Plots of the wave functions for ranging from to are shown in another format in Figure where the nodal pattern is emphasized Figure The nodal pattern for a chain containing seven atoms I hope that by now the student is not tempted to ask how the electron gets from one region of high amplitude through a node to another highamplitude region Remember such questions are cast in classical Newtonian language and are not appropriate when addressing the wavelike properties of quantum mechanics Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons
