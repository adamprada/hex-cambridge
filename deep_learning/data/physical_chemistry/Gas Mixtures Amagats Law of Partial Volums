Gas Mixtures Amagats Law of Partial Volums Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers Amagats law of partial volumes asserts that the volume of a mixture is equal to the sum of the partial volumes of its components For a mixture of components etc Amagats law gives the volume as For real gases Amagats law is usually an even better approximation than Daltons law Again for mixtures of ideal gases it is exact For an ideal gas the partial volume is Since we have for a mixture of ideal gases Applied to the mixture the idealgas equation yields Amagats law Also we have
