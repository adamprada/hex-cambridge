Carnot Cycle Heat Engines Sadi Carnot Mendoza a French physicist and engineer was very interested in the improvement of steam engines to perform the tasks needed by modern society Figure Sadi Carnot To simplify his analysis of the inner workings of an engine Carnot devised a useful construct for examining what affect engine efficiency His construct is the heat engine The idea behind a heat engine is that it will take energy in the form of heat and transform it into an equivalent amount of work Unfortunately such a device is impractical As it turns out nature prevents the complete conversion of energy into work with perfect efficiency This leads to an important statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics It is impossible to convert heat into an equivalent amount of work without some other changes occurring in the universe As such a more reasonable picture of the heat engine is one which will allow for losses of energy to the surroundings The fraction of energy supplied to the engine that can be converted to work defines the efficiency of the engine The Carnot Cycle The Carnot cycle is a theoretical cyclic heat engine that can used to examine what is possible for an engine for which the job is convert heat into work For simplicity all energy provided to the engine occurs isothermally and reversibly at a temperature and all of the energy lost to the surroundings also occurs isothermally and reversibly at temperature In order to insure this the system must change between the two temperatures adiabatically Thus the cycle consists of four reversible legs two of which are isothermal and two of which are adiabatic Isothermal expansion from p and V to p and V at Th Adiabatic expansion from p V Th to p V Tl Isothermal compression from p and V to p and V at Tl Adiabatic compression from p V Tl to p V Th Plotted on a pressurevolume diagram the Carnot cycle looks as follows Because this is a closed cycle the ending state is identical initial state any state function must have a net change of zero as the system moves around the cycle Furthermore the efficiency of the engine can be expressed by the net amount of work the engine produces per unit of heat supplied to power the engine In order to examine this expression it is useful to write down expressions fo the heat and work flow in each of the four legs of the engine cycle Leg Heat Work I qh nRTh lnVV nRTh lnVV II CVTl Th III ql nRTl lnVV nRTl lnVV IV CVTh Tl The total amount of work done is given by the sum of terms in the thirst column Clearly the terms for the two adiabatic legs cancel as they have the same magnitude but opposite signs So the total work done is given by The efficiency of the engine can be defined as the total work produced per unit of energy provided by the high temperature reservoir or That expression has a lot of variables but it turns out that it can be simplified dramatically It turns out that by the choice of pathways connecting the states places a very important restriction on the relative values of V V V and V To understand this we must consider how the work of adiabatic expansion is related to the initial and final temperatures and volumes In Chapter it was shown that the initial and final temperatures and volumes of an adiabatic expansion are related by or Using the adiabatic expansion and compression legs II and IV this requires that and Since the second terms are reciprocals of one another the first terms must be as well A simple rearrangement shows that This is very convenient It is what allows for the simplification of the efficiency expression Equation refeff becomes Canceling terms in the numerator and denominator yields This expression gives the maximum efficiency and depends only on the high and low temperatures Also it should be noted that the heat engine can be run backwards By providing work to the engine it can be forces to draw heat from the low temperature reservoir and dissipate it into the high temperature reservoir This is how a refrigerator or heat pump works The limiting efficiency of such a device can also be calculated using the temperatures of the hot can cold reservoirs Example What is the maximum efficiency of a freezer set to keep ice cream at a cool oC which it is operating in a room that is oC What is the minimum amount of energy needed to remove J from the freezer and dissipate it into the room Solution The efficiency is given by Equation refeff and converting the temperatures to an absolute scale the efficiency can be calculated as This value can be used in the following manner So or It is interesting to note that any arbitrary closed cyclical process can be described as a sum of infinitesimally small Carnot cycles and so all of the conclusions reached for the Carnot cycle apply to any cyclical process Contributors Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
