Heat Transfer in Reversible Processes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers If a system is in thermal contact with its surroundings a reversible change can involve the exchange of heat between the system and the surroundings In Chapter we make a number of important observations about the nature of any heat transfer that occurs during a reversible process Let us review these ideas A system can undergo a change in which it accepts or liberates heat while its temperature remains constant If we boil a liquid at constant pressure a thermometer immersed in the liquid continues to show the same temperature even though we add more and more heat energy The added heat is used within the system to convert the liquid to its vapor If the liquid is stirred well any localized temperature excursions away from the equilibrium temperature are small it is a good approximation to say that the temperature of the system is homogenous throughout the system and that it has a constant value Nevertheless for a finite boiling rate we recognize that the idea of an isothermal process is indeed an approximation For heat transfer to occur from the surroundings to the system the surroundings must be at a higher temperature than the system The portion of the system in immediate contact with the wall of the vessel must be at a higher temperature than the portion in the interior of the vessel When we think about a constanttemperature system undergoing a reversible change while in thermal contact with its surroundings we imagine that heat can be transferred in either direction with equal facility If the system is taking up heat as the process proceeds we imagine that we can reverse the direction of the change simply by changing the direction of heat transfer Heat will flow from the system to the surroundings and the process will run backwards We can reverse the direction of heat flow by changing the temperature of the surroundings Initially the surroundings must be hotter than the system To reverse the direction of heat flow we must make the temperature of the surroundings less than that of the system Since a reversible process is one whose direction can be reversed by an arbitrarily small change in some state function the original temperatures must be arbitrarily close to one another For a system that exchanges heat with its surroundings a process can be reversible only if the temperatures of the system and the surroundings are arbitrarily close to one another In a reversible process net heat transfer occurs between two entitiesthe system and its surroundingsthat are arbitrarily close to thermal equilibrium Such a process is an idealization As we have noted several times a reversible process is a creature of theory that is merely approximated in real systems A reversible process does not have to be a constanttemperature process If the temperatures of system and surroundings change simultaneously they can remain arbitrarily close to one another throughout the process Nor must a system undergoing reversible change be in thermal contact with its surroundings A system can undergo a reversible change adiabatically Finally we have noted that the term isothermal process is often intended to mean a constanttemperature thermallyreversible process However the same words are frequently intended to indicate only that the final temperature of the system is the same as the initial temperature This is the case whenever the isothermal process is a spontaneous process The intended meaning is usually clear from the context
