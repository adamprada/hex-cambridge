How The Enthalpy Change for a Reaction Depends on Temperature Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In Section we see how to use tabulated enthalpies of formation to calculate the enthalpy change for a particular chemical reaction Such tables typically give enthalpies of formation at a number of different temperatures so that the enthalpy change for a given reaction can also be calculated at these different temperatures it is just a matter of repeating the same calculation at each temperature We often need to find the enthalpy change associated with increasing the temperature of a substance at constant pressure As we observe in this enthalpy change is readily calculated by integrating the heat capacity over the temperature change We may want to know for example the enthalpy change for increasing the temperature of one mole of methane from K to K with the pressure held constant at one bar In Table we find We might be tempted to think that the difference represents the enthalpy change associated with heating the methane This is not so The reason becomes immediately apparent if we consider a cycle in which we go from the elements to a compound at two different temperatures For methane this cycle is shown in Figure Figure A thermochemical cycle relating at two temperatures The difference between the standard enthalpies of formation of methane at K and K reflects the enthalpy change for increasing the temperatures of all of the reactants and products from K to K That is Over the temperature range from K to K the heat capacities of carbon hydrogen and methane are approximated by with values of and given in Table From this information we calculate the enthalpy change for increasing the temperature of one mole of each substance from K to K at bar and Thus from the cycle we calculate The tabulated value is The two values differ by or about This difference arises from the limitations of the twoparameter heatcapacity equations As another example of a thermochemical cycle let us consider the selective oxidation of methane to methanol at K and K From the enthalpies of formation in Table we calculate the enthalpies for the reaction to be and As in the previous example we use the tabulated heatcapacity parameters to calculate the enthalpy change for increasing the temperature of one mole of each of these gases from K to K at bar We find and Figure A thermochemical cycle relating at two temperatures The cycle is shown in Figure Inspecting this cycle we see that we can calculate the enthalpy change for warming one mole of methanol from K to K by summing the enthalpy changes around the bottom left side and top of the cycle that is This is J or about larger than the value obtained by integrating the heat capacity for methanol
