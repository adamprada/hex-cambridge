SummaryContributors and Attributions The Hydrogenic atom problem forms the basis of much of our thinking about atomic structure To solve the corresponding Schrödinger equation requires separation of the and variables The Schrödinger equation for a single particle of mass moving in a central potential one that depends only on the radial coordinate can be written as or introducing the shorthand notation frachbarmu nabla psi V psi Epsi This equation is not separable in Cartesian coordinates because of the way and appear together in the square root However it is separable in spherical coordinates where it has the form Subtracting from both sides of the equation and multiplying by then moving the derivatives with respect to to the righthand side one obtains fracsinthetafracpartialpartial theta leftsinthetafracpartial psipartialtheta right fracsinthetafracpartial psipartialphi fracmu rhbarEVr psi leftfracpartialpartial rleftrfracpartialpsipartial rrightright Notice that except for itself the righthand side of this equation is a function of only it contains no or dependence Lets call the entire right hand side to emphasize this fact To further separate the and dependence we multiply by and subtract the derivative terms from both sides to obtain Now we have separated the dependence from the and r dependence We now introduce the procedure used to separate variables in differential equations and assume y can be written as a function of times a function of and Dividing by we obtain Now all of the dependence is isolated on the left hand side the right hand side contains only and dependence Whenever one has isolated the entire dependence on one variable as we have done above for the dependence one can easily see that the left and right hand sides of the equation must equal a constant For the above example the left hand side contains no or dependence and the right hand side contains no dependence Because the two sides are equal for all values of and they both must actually be independent of and dependence that is they are constant This again is what is done when one employs the separations of variables method in partial differential equations For the above example we therefore can set both sides equal to a socalled separation constant that we call It will become clear shortly why we have chosen to express the constant in the form of minus the square of an integer You may recall that we studied this same equation earlier and learned how the integer arises via the boundary condition that and represent identical geometries The Equation The resulting equation reads the symbol is used to represent second derivative This equation should be familiar because it is the equation that we treated much earlier when we discussed zcomponent of angular momentum So its further analysis should also be familiar but for completeness I repeat much of it The above equation has as its most general solution Because the wave functions of quantum mechanics represent probability densities they must be continuous and singlevalued The latter condition applied to our function means nb we used this in our earlier discussion of zcomponent of angular momentum that or This condition is satisfied only when the separation constant is equal to an integer This provides another example of the rule that quantization comes from the boundary conditions on the wave function Here is restricted to certain discrete values because the wave function must be such that when you rotate through about the zaxis you must get back what you started with The Equation Now returning to the equation in which the dependence was isolated from the and dependence and rearranging the terms to the lefthand side we have fracsinthetafracpartial partial theta leftsinthetafracpartial Qpartialtheta right fracmQsintheta FrQ In this equation we have separated the and terms so we can further decompose the wave function by introducing which yields fracThetasinthetafracpartial partial theta leftsinthetafracpartial Thetapartialtheta right fracmsintheta fracFrQRlambda where a second separation constant has been introduced once the and dependent terms have been separated onto the right and left hand sides respectively We now can write the equation as fracsinthetafracpartial partial theta leftsinthetafracpartial

fracddzleftzfracdPdzright fracmPz lambda P Now we can look for polynomial solutions for because is restricted to be less than unity in magnitude If we first let P sum_ka_kzk and substitute into the differential equation to obtain Equating like powers of gives Note that for large values of Since the coefficients do not decrease with for large this series will diverge for unless it truncates at finite order This truncation only happens if the separation constant obeys where is an integer you can see this from the recursion relation giving in terms of only for certain values of will the numerator vanish So once again we see that a boundary condition ie that the wave function not diverge and thus be normalizable in this case give rise to quantization In this case the values of are restricted to before we saw that is restricted to Since the above recursion relation links every other coefficient we can choose to solve for the even and odd functions separately Choosing and then determining all of the even in terms of this followed by rescaling all of these to make the function normalized generates an even solution Choosing and determining all of the odd in like manner generates an odd solution For the series truncates after one term and results in For the same thing applies and For so one obtains and so on These polynomials are called Legendre polynomials and are denoted For the more general case where one can proceed as above to generate a polynomial solution for the function Doing so results in the following solutions These functions are called Associated Legendre polynomials and they constitute the solutions to the problem for nonzero values The above and functions when reexpressed in terms of and yield the full angular part of the wave function for any centrosymmetric potential These solutions are usually written as and are called spherical harmonics They provide the angular solution of the Schrödinger equation for any problem in which the potential depends only on the radial coordinate Such situations include all oneelectron atoms and ions eg etc the rotational motion of a diatomic molecule where the potential depends only on bond length the motion of a nucleon in a spherically symmetrical box as occurs in the shell model of nuclei and the scattering of two atoms where the potential depends only on interatomic distance The functions possess varying number of angular nodes which as noted earlier give clear signatures of the angular or rotational energy content of the wave function These angular nodes originate in the oscillatory nature of the Legendre and associated Legendre polynomials the higher is the more sign changes occur within the polynomial The Equation Let us now turn our attention to the radial equation which is the only place that the explicit form of the potential appears Using our earlier results for the equation obeyed by the function and specifying to be the Coulomb potential appropriate for an electron in the field of a nucleus of charge yields We can simplify things considerably if we choose rescaled length and energy units because doing so removes the factors that depend on and We introduce a new radial coordinate and quantity as follows Notice that if is negative as it will be for bound states ie those states with energy below that of a free electron infinitely far from the nucleus and with zero kinetic energy and are real On the other hand if is positive as it will be for states that lie in the continuum and will be imaginary These two cases will give rise to qualitatively different behavior in the solutions of the radial equation developed below We now define a function such that and substitute for to obtain fracrhofracddrholeftrhofracdSdrhoright leftfracfracLLrhodfracsigmarhoright S The differential operator terms can be recast in several ways using The strategy that we now follow is characteristic of solving second order differential equations We will examine the equation for at large and small values Having found solutions at these limits we will use a power series in to interpolate between these two limits Let us begin by examining the solution of the above equation at small values of to see how the radial functions behave at small As the term will dominate over Neglecting these other two terms we find that for small values of or the solution should behave like and because the function must be normalizable we must have Since can be any nonnegative integer this suggests the following more general form for Srho approx rhoL earho This form will insure that the function is normalizable since as for all as long as is a real quantity If is imaginary such a form may not be normalized see below for further consequences Turning now to the behavior of for large we make the substitution of into the above equation and keep only the terms with the largest power of ie the term and we allow the derivatives in the above differential equation to act on Upon so doing we obtain the equation which leads us to conclude that the exponent in the large behavior of S is Having found the small and large behaviors of we can take to have the following form to interpolate between large and small rvalues where the function is expanded in an infinite power series in as Again substituting this expression for into the above equation we obtain and then substituting the power series expansion of and solving for the aks we arrive at a recursion relation for the ak coefficients For large the ratio of expansion coefficients reaches the limit which when substituted into gives the same behavior as the power series expansion of Because the power series expansion of describes a function that behaves like for large the resulting function would not be normalizable because the efactor would be overwhelmed by this dependence Hence the series expansion of must truncate in order to achieve a normalizable function Notice that if is imaginary as it will be if is in the continuum the argument that the series must truncate to avoid an exponentially diverging function no longer applies Thus we see a key difference between bound with real and continuum with r imaginary states In the former case the boundary condition of nondivergence arises in the latter it does not because does not diverge if is imaginary To truncate at a polynomial of order we must have This implies that the quantity s introduced previously is restricted to which is certainly an integer let us call this integer If we label states in order of increasing we see that doing so is consistent with specifying a maximum order in the polynomial after which the value can run from in steps of unity up to Substituting the integer for we find that the energy levels are quantized because is quantized equal to and the scaled distance turns out to be Here the length is the socalled Bohr radius which turns out to be Å it appears once the above Eexpression is substituted into the equation for Using the recursion equation to solve for the polynomials coefficients for any choice of and quantum numbers generates a socalled Laguerre polynomial They contain powers of from zero through and they have sign changes as the radial coordinate ranges from zero to infinity It is these sign changes in the Laguerre polynomials that cause the radial parts of the hydrogenic wave functions to have nodes For example orbitals have no radial nodes but d orbitals have one and as shown in Figure orbitals have one while orbitals have two Once again the higher the number of nodes the higher the energy in the radial direction Figure Plots of the probability densities of the radial parts of the and orbitals Let me again remind you about the danger of trying to understand quantum wave functions or probabilities in terms of classical dynamics What kind of potential would give rise to for example the plot shown above Classical mechanics suggests that should be large where the particle moves slowly and small where it moves quickly So the plot suggests that the radial speed of the electron has three regions where it is low ie where the peaks in are and two regions where it is very large ie where the nodes are This in turn suggests that the radial potential experienced by the electron is high in three regions near peaks in P and low in two regions Of course this conclusion about the form of is nonsense and again illustrates how one must not be drawn into trying to think of the classical motion of the particle especially for quantum states with small quantum number In fact the low quantum number states of such oneelectron atoms and ions have their radial plots focused in regions of rspace where the potential is most attractive ie largest in magnitude Finally we note that the energy quantization does not arise for states lying in the continuum because the condition that the expansion of terminate does not arise The solutions of the radial equation appropriate to these scattering states which relate to the scattering motion of an electron in the field of a nucleus of charge are a bit outside the scope of this text so we will not treat them further here To review separation of variables has been used to solve the full Schrödinger equation for one electron moving about a nucleus of charge The and solutions are the spherical harmonics The boundstate radial solutions depend on the and quantum numbers and are given in terms of the Laguerre polynomials Summary To summarize the quantum numbers and arise through boundary conditions requiring that be normalizable ie not diverge and The radial equation which is the only place the potential energy enters is found to possess both boundstates ie states whose energies lie below the asymptote at which the potential vanishes and the kinetic energy is zero and continuum states lying energetically above this asymptote The former states are spatially confined by the potential but the latter are not The resulting hydrogenic wave functions angular and radial and energies are summarized on pp in the text by L Pauling and E B Wilson for up to and including and up to ie for and orbitals There are both bound and continuum solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation for the attractive coulomb potential because at energies below the asymptote the potential confines the particle between and an outer classical turning point whereas at energies above the asymptote the particle is no longer confined by an outer turning point see Figure This provides yet another example of how quantized states arise when the potential spatially confines the particle but continuum states arise when the particle is not spatially confined Figure Radial Potential for Hydrogenic Atoms and Bound and Continuum Orbital Energies The solutions of this oneelectron problem form the qualitative basis for much of atomic and molecular orbital theory For this reason the reader is encouraged to gain a firmer understanding of the nature of the radial and angular parts of these wave functions The orbitals that result are labeled by and quantum numbers for the bound states and by and quantum numbers and the energy for the continuum states Much as the particleinabox orbitals are used to qualitatively describe p electrons in conjugated polyenes these socalled hydrogenlike orbitals provide qualitative descriptions of orbitals of atoms with more than a single electron By introducing the concept of screening as a way to represent the repulsive interactions among the electrons of an atom an effective nuclear charge can be used in place of in the and to generate approximate atomic orbitals to be filled by electrons in a manyelectron atom For example in the crudest approximation of a carbon atom the two electrons experience the full nuclear attraction so for them whereas the and electrons are screened by the two electrons so for them Within this approximation one then occupies two orbitals with two orbitals with and two orbitals with in forming the full sixelectron wave function of the lowestenergy state of carbon It should be noted that the use of screened nuclear charges as just discussed is different from the use of a quantum defect parameter d as discussed regarding Rydberg orbitals in Chapter The screened charge for carbons and orbitals is attempting to represent the effect of the innershell electrons on the and orbitals The modification of the principal quantum number made by replacing by represents the penetration of the orbital with nominal quantum number inside its innershells Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools on Theoretical Chemistry
