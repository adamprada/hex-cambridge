Introduction to the Second Law Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay No headers Rudolph Clausius is kind enough in his work The Mechanical Theory of Heat Clausius to indicate where we have been in our discussion of thermodynamics as well as where we are going The fundamental laws of the universe which correspond to the two fundamental theorems of the mechanical theory of heat The energy of the universe is constant The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum Rudolf Clausius The Mechanical Theory Of Heat The second law of thermodynamics which introduces us to the topic of entropy is amazing in how it constrains what we can experience and what we can do in the universe As Sean M Carroll a CalTech Theoretical physicist suggests in a interview with Wired Magazine Biba Im trying to understand how time works And thats a huge question that has lots of different aspects to it A lot of them go back to Einstein and spacetime and how we measure time using clocks But the particular aspect of time that Im interested in is the arrow of time the fact that the past is different from the future We remember the past but we dont remember the future There are irreversible processes There are things that happen like you turn an egg into an omelet but you cant turn an omelet into an egg We as observers of nature are time travelers And the constraints on what we can observe as we move through time step from the second law of thermodynamics But more than just understanding what the second law says we are interested in what sorts of processes are possible And even more to the point what sorts of processes are spontaneous A spontaneous process is one that will occur without external forces pushing it A process can be spontaneous even if it happens very slowly Unfortunately Thermodynamics is silent on the topic of how fast processes will occur but is provides us with a powerful toolbox for predicting which processes will be spontaneous But in order to make these predictions a new thermodynamic law and variable is needed since the first law which defined and is insufficient Consider the following processes with with Both reactions will occur spontaneously but one is exothermic and the other endothermic So while it is intuitive to think that an exothermic process will be spontaneous there is clearly more to the picture than simply the release of energy as heat when it comes to making a process spontaneous The Carnot cycle because a useful thought experiment to explore to help to answer the question of why a process is spontaneous Contributors Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
