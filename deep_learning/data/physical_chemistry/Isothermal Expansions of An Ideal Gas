Isothermal Expansions of An Ideal Gas Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers For an isothermal reversible expansion of an ideal gas we have by definition that Since the energy of an ideal gas depends only on the temperature a constant temperature implies constant energy so that Using the equation we find for in the previous section we have qrevwrevRT ln fracV_V_ ideal gas isothermal reversible expansion where and are the initial and final volumes respectively Since enthalpy is defined as we have For the spontaneous isothermal expansion of an ideal gas from to against a constant applied pressure we again have These are state functions and the amounts by which they change in this spontaneous process must be the same as those for the reversible process between the same two states The heat and work exchanged in the spontaneous process are different demonstrating that heat and work are not state functions We have one mole ideal gas isothermal free expansion
