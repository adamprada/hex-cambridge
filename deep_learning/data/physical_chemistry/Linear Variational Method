Linear Variational Method Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah Contributors and Attributions A widely used example of Variational Methods is provided by the socalled linear variational method Here one expresses the trial wave function a linear combination of socalled basis functions Substituting this expansion into and then making this quantity stationary with respect to variations in the subject to the constraint that remains normalized gives This is a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem that we can write in matrix notation as It is called a generalized eigenvalue problem because of the appearance of the overlap matrix on its right hand side This set of equations for the coefficients can be made into a conventional eigenvalue problem as follows The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the overlap matrix are found by solving All of the eigenvalues are positive because is a positivedefinite matrix Next one forms the matrix whose elements are another matrix can be formed in a similar way replacing with One then multiplies the generalized eigenvalue equation on the left by to obtain This equation is then rewritten using and as This is a conventional eigenvalue problem in which the matrix is and the eigenvectors are The net result is that one can form and then find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors Its eigenvalues will be the same as those of the original generalized eigenvalue problem Its eigenvectors can be used to determine the eigenvectors of the original problem by multiplying by Although the derivation of the matrix eigenvalue equations resulting from the linear variational method was carried out as a means of minimizing it turns out that the solutions offer more than just an upper bound to the lowest true energy of the Hamiltonian It can be shown that the nth eigenvalue of the matrix is an upper bound to the true energy of the nth state of the Hamiltonian A consequence of this is that between any two eigenvalues of the matrix there is at least one true energy of the Hamiltonian This observation is often called the bracketing condition The ability of linear variational methods to provide estimates to the ground and excitedstate energies from a single calculation is one of the main strengths of this approach Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools on Theoretical Chemistry Integrated by Tomoyuki Hayashi UC Davis
