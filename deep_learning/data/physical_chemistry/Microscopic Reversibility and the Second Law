Microscopic Reversibility and the Second Law Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers The principle of microscopic reversibility requires that parallel mechanisms give rise to the same expression for the concentrationdependence of the equilibrium constant That is the function that characterizes the equilibrium composition must be the same for each mechanism If for the reaction the equilibrium composition for mechanism is and that for mechanism is microscopic reversibility asserts that and In and of itself microscopic reversibility makes no assertion about the value of compared to that of While microscopic reversibility asserts that the same function characterizes the concentration relationships for parallel mechanisms it does not assert that the numerical value of this function is necessarily the same for each of the mechanisms However that these numerical values must be equal follows directly when we introduce another of our most basic observations No matter how many mechanisms may be available to a reaction in a particular system the concentration of any reagent can have only one value in an equilibrium state At equilibrium etc therefore the numerical values of the equilibrium constants must be the same The uniqueness of the equilibrium composition is a fundamental feature of our ideas about what chemical equilibrium means Nevertheless it is of interest to show that we can arrive at this conclusion from a different perspective We can use an idealized machine to show that the second law of thermodynamics requires that parallel mechanisms must produce the same the equilibrium composition Our argument is a proof by contradiction Let us suppose that and are gases Suppose that the reaction occurs in the absence of a catalyst but that reaction occurs in the opposite direction when a catalyst is present More precisely we assume that the position of equilibrium lies to the right in the absence of the catalyst and to the left in its presence while all other reaction conditions are maintained constant These assumptions mean that the equilibrium composition for the catalyzed mechanism is different from that of the mechanism that does not involve the catalyst We can show that these assumptions imply that the second law of thermodynamics is false If we accept the validity of the second law this violation means that the assumptions cannot in fact describe any real system We are getting a bit ahead of ourselves here inasmuch as our detailed consideration of the laws of thermodynamics begins in Chapter Given our assumptions we can build a machine consisting of a large cylinder closed by a frictionless piston The cylinder contains a mixture of and and a quantity of the catalyst We provide a container for the catalyst and construct the device so that the catalyst container can be opened and closed from outside the cylinder Finally we immerse the entire cylinder in a fluid which we maintain at a constant temperature When the catalyst container is sealed so that the gaseous contents of the cylinder are not in contact with the catalyst reaction occurs according to and the piston moves outward doing work on the surroundings When the catalyst container is open reaction occurs according to and the piston moves inward Figure shows these changes schematically At the end of a cycle the machine is in exactly the same state as it was in the beginning and the temperature of the reaction mixture is the same at the end of a cycle as it was at the beginning By connecting the piston to a load we can do net work on the load as the machine goes through a cycle For example if we connect the piston to a mechanical device that converts the reciprocating motion of the piston into rotary motion we can wind a rope around an axle and thereby lift an attached weight Figure A machine that violates the second law We can operate this machine as an engine by alternately opening and closing the catalyst container We can make the cylinder as large as we want so the energy we expend in opening and closing the catalyst container can be made arbitrarily small compared to the amount of work we get out of the machine in a given cycle All of this occurs with the machine maintained at a constant temperature If energy is conserved the machine must absorb heat from the bath during the cycle otherwise the machine would be doing work with no offsetting consumption of energy This would be a violation of the first law of thermodynamics See Sections From experience we know that this machine cannot function in the manner we have described This experience is embodied in the second law of thermodynamics we know that it is impossible to construct a machine that operates in a cycle exchanges heat with its surroundings at only one temperature and produces work in the surroundings Section Our argument assumes that two reaction mechanisms are available in a particular physical system that they consume the same reactants that they produce the same products and that the equilibrium compositions are different These assumptions imply that the second law is false Since we are confident that it is possible for some system to satisfy the first three of these assumptions the second law requires that the last one be false the equilibrium compositions must be the same We see that there is a complementary relationship between microscopic reversibility and this statement of the second law Microscopic reversibility asserts that a unique function of concentrations characterizes the equilibrium state for any reaction mechanism but does not require that every mechanism reach the same state at equilibrium This statement of the second law implies that a reactions equilibrium composition unique but it does not specify a law relating the equilibrium concentrations of the reacting species In Chapters and we see that by augmenting this statement of the second law with some additional ideas we are led to a more rigorous statement from which we are eventually able to infer the same functional form for the equilibrium constant Microscopic reversibility asserts that a unique function of concentrations characterizes the equilibrium state for any reaction mechanism but does not require that every mechanism reach the same state at equilibrium G N Lewis gave an early statement of the principle of microscopic reversibility He called it the law of entire equilibrium and observed that it is a law which in its general form is not deducible from thermodynamics but proves to be compatible with the laws of thermodynamics in all cases where a comparison is possible It is worth noting that we have not shown that the existence of a unique equilibrium state implies either microscopic reversibility or the second law Also even though the principle of microscopic reversibility is inferred from the laws of mechanics our development of the equilibrium constant relationshipwhich we do view as a law of thermodynamicsdepends on our equations for the rates of elementary reactions Our rate equations are not logical consequences of the laws of motion Rather they follow from assumptions we make about the average behavior of systems that contain many molecules Consequently we should not suppose that we have deduced a thermodynamic result the condition for chemical equilibrium solely from the laws of mechanics In Section we give brief additional consideration to the relationship between the theories of mechanics and thermodynamics Beginning in Chapter we develop thermodynamic equations by applying statistical models to the distribution of molecular energy levels
