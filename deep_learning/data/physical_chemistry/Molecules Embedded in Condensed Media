Molecules Embedded in Condensed Media Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah No headers Often one wants to model the behavior of a molecule or ion that is not isolated as it might be in a gasphase experiment When one attempts to describe a system that is embedded for example in a crystal lattice in a liquid or a glass one has to have some way to treat both the effects of the surrounding medium on the molecule of interest and the motions of the mediums constituents In socalled quantum mechanics molecular mechanics QMMM approaches to this problem one treats the molecule or ion of interest using the electronic structure methods outlined earlier in this Chapter but with one modification The oneelectron component of the Hamiltonian which contains the electronnuclei Coulomb potential is modified to also contain a term that describes the potential energy of interaction of the electrons and nuclei with the surrounding medium In the simplest such models this solvation potential depends only on the dielectric constant of the surroundings In more sophisticated models the surroundings are represented by a collection of fractional point charges that may also be attributed with local dipole moments and polarizabilities that allow them to respond to changes in the internal charge distribution of the molecule or ion The locations of such partial charges and the magnitudes of their dipoles and polarizabilities are determined to make the resultant solvation potential reproduce known from experiment or other simulations solvation characteristics eg solvation energy radial distribution functions in a variety of calibration cases The book Molecular Modeling nd ed A R Leach Prentice Hall Englewood Cliffs offers a good source of information about how these terms are added into the oneelectron component of the Hamiltonian to account for solvation effects In addition to describing how the surroundings affect the Hamiltonian of the molecule or ion of interest one needs to describe the motions or spatial distributions of the mediums constituent atoms or molecules This is usually done within a purely classical treatment of these degrees of freedom That is if equilibrium properties of the solvated system are to be simulated then MonteCarlo MC sampling this subject is treated in Chapter of this text of the surrounding mediums coordinates is used Within such a MC sampling the potential energy of the entire system is calculated as a sum of two parts i the electronic energy of the solute molecule or ion which contains the interaction energy of the molecules electrons and nuclei with the surrounding medium plus ii the intramedium potential energy which is taken to be of a simple molecular mechanics MM force field character ie to depend on interatomic distances and internal angles in an analytical and easily computed manner Again the book Molecular Modeling nd ed A R Leach Prentice Hall Englewood Cliffs offers a good source of information about these matters If alternatively dynamical characteristics of the solvated species are to be simulated a classical molecular dynamics MD treatment is used In this approach the solutemedium and internalmedium potential energies are handled in the same way as in the MC case but where the time evolution of the mediums coordinates are computed using the MD techniques discussed in Chapter of this text
