Nonideality Henrys Law and Azeotropes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay AzeotropesContributors and Attributions The proceeding discussion was based on the behaviors of ideal solutions of volatile compounds and for which both compounds follow Raoults Law Henrys Law can be used to describe these deviations For which the Henrys Law constant is determined for the specific compound Henrys Law is often used to describe the solubilities of gases in liquids The relationship to Raoults Law is summarized in Figure Figure The relationship between Raoults Law and Henrys Law for a binary mixture Henrys Law is depicted by the upper straight line and Raoults Law by the lower Example Solubility of Carbon Dioxide in Water The solubility of in water at oC is x M with a partial pressure of over the solution of bar Assuming the density of a saturated solution to be kgL calculate the Henrys Law constant for Solution In one L of solution there is g of water assuming the mass of CO dissolved is negligible The solubility of can be used to find the number of moles of dissolved in L of solution also and so the mol fraction of is And so or Azeotropes An azeotrope is defined as the common composition of vapor and liquid when they have the same composition Figure Phase diagrams for left a maximum boiling point azeotrope and right Ta maximum boiling point azeotrope Azeotropes can be either maximum boiling or minimum boiling as show in Figure Regardless distillation cannot purify past the azeotrope point since the vapor and quid phases have the same composition If a system forms a minimum boiling azeotrope and also has a range of compositions and temperatures at which two liquid phases exist the phase diagram might look like Figure Figure Phase diagram for a binary solution with the boiling point of a minimum boiling azeotrope that is higher that when components are miscible single phase Another possibility that is common is for two substances to form a twophase liquid form a minimum boiling azeotrope but for the azeotrope to boil at a temperature below which the two liquid phases become miscible In this case the phase diagram will look like Figure Example In the diagram make up of a system in each region is summarized below the diagram The point e indicates the azeotrope composition and boiling temperature Single phase liquid mostly compound A Single phase liquid mostly compound B Single phase liquid mostly A and vapor Single phase liquid mostly B and vapor Vapor miscible at all mole fractions since it is a gas Solution Within each twophase region III IV and the twophase liquid region the lever rule will apply to describe the composition of each phase present So for example the system with the composition and temperature represented by point b a singlephase liquid which is mostly compound A designated by the composition at point a and vapor with a composition designated by that at point c will be described by the lever rule using the lengths of tie lines lA and lB Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
