PotentialContributors and Attributions Having seen how one can use information about the gradients and Hessians on a BornOppenheimer surface to locate geometries corresponding to stable species and transition states let us now move on to see how this same data is used to treat vibrations on this surface For a polyatomic molecule whose electronic energys dependence on the Cartesian coordinates of its atoms the potential energy can be expressed approximately in terms of a Taylor series expansion about any of the local minima Of course different local minima ie different isomers will have different values for the equilibrium coordinates and for the derivatives of the energy with respect to these coordinates The Taylor series expansion of the electronic energy is written as V g_k V sum_k leftdfracpartial Vpartial q_kright q_k dfrac sum_jk q_j H_jk q_k Here is the energy at the current geometry is the gradient of the energy along the coordinate is the secondderivative or Hessian matrix and is the length of the step to be taken along this Cartesian direction If the geometry corresponds to a minimum or transition state the gradient terms will all vanish and the Hessian matrix will possess for linear species or for nonlinear molecules positive eigenvalues and or zero eigenvalues corresponding to translational and or rotational motions of the molecule for a minimum and one negative eigenvalues and or positive eigenvalues for a transition state The Newton Equations of Motion for Vibration The Kinetic and Potential Energy Matrices Truncating the Taylor series at the quadratic terms assuming these terms dominate because only small displacements from the equilibrium geometry are of interest one has the socalled harmonic potential The classical mechanical equations of motion for the coordinates can be written in terms of the above potential energy and the following kinetic energy function where is the time rate of change of the coordinate and is the mass of the atom on which the Cartesian coordinate resides The Newton equations thus obtained are where the force along the coordinate is given by minus the derivative of the potential along this coordinate within the harmonic approximation These classical equations can more compactly be expressed in terms of the time evolution of a set of socalled massweighted Cartesian coordinates defined as in terms of which the above Newton equations become and the massweighted Hessian matrix elements are The Harmonic Vibrational Energies and Normal Mode Eigenvectors Assuming that the undergo some form of sinusoidal time evolution and substituting this into the Newton equations produces a matrix eigenvalue equation in which the eigenvalues are the squares of the socalled normal mode vibrational frequencies and the eigenvectors give the amplitudes of motion along each of the massweighted Cartesian coordinates that belong to each mode Hence to perform a normalmode analysis of a molecule one forms the massweighted Hessian matrix and then finds the or nonzero eigenvalues as well as the corresponding eigenvectors It is useful to note that if this same kind of analysis were performed at a geometry corresponding to a transition state or of the values would be positive but one of them would be negative The eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of the massweighted Hessian points along a very important direction that we will discuss later it is the direction of the socalled intrinsic reaction coordinate IRC When reporting the eigenvalues at such a transitionstate geometry one often says that there is one imaginary frequency because one of the values is negative this value of characterizes the curvature of the energy surface along the IRC at the transition state The positive vibrational eigenvalues of transitionstate geometries are used as discussed in Chapter to evaluate statistical mechanics partition functions for reaction rates and the negative value plays a role in determining the extent of tunneling through the barrier on the reaction surface Within this harmonic treatment of vibrational motion the total vibrational energy of the molecule is given as a sum of or independent contributions one for each normal mode The corresponding total vibrational wave function Psi prod_jNtext or psinu_j xj is a product of or harmonic oscillator functions one for each normal mode The energy gap between one vibrational level and another in which one of the quantum numbers is increased by unity ie for fundamental vibrational transitions is Delta E_nu_j rightarrow nu_j hbar omega_j The harmonic model thus predicts that the fundamental and hot band transitions should occur at the same energy and the overtone transitions should occur at exactly twice this energy One might wonder whether massweighted Cartesian coordinates would be better or more appropriate to use when locating minima and transition states on BornOppenheimer energy surfaces Although massweighted coordinates are indeed essential for evaluating harmonic vibrational frequencies and as we will see later for tracing out socalled intrinsic reaction paths their use produces the same minima and transition states as one finds using coordinates that are massweighted This is because the condition that all components of the gradient of the energy surface vanish at a minimum or at a transition state will automatically be obeyed when expressed in terms of massweighted coordinates since Notice that this means the geometries of all local minima and transition states on a given BornOppenheimer surface will be exactly the same regardless of what isotopes appear in the molecule For example for the reactions HCN rightarrow HNC or or or the geometries of the reactants products and transition states for each of the distinct reactions will not depend on the identity of the hydrogen isotopes However the harmonic vibrational frequencies will depend on the isotopes because the massweighted Hessian differs from the Hessian expressed in terms of nonmassweighted coordinates The Use of Symmetry Symmetry Adapted Modes It is often possible to simplify the calculation of the normal mode harmonic frequencies and eigenvectors by exploiting molecular point group symmetry For molecules that possess symmetry at a particular stable geometry the electronic potential displays symmetry with respect to displacements of symmetry equivalent Cartesian coordinates For example consider the water molecule at its equilibrium geometry as illustrated in Figure A very small movement of the molecules left atom in the positive direction produces the same change in the potential as a correspondingly small displacement of the right atom in the negative direction Similarly movement of the left H in the positive y direction produces an energy change identical to movement of the right H in the positive y direction Figure Water molecule showing its two bond lengths and angle The equivalence of the pairs of Cartesian coordinate displacements is a result of the fact that the displacement vectors are connected by the point group operations of the group In particular reflection of through the yz plane the two planes are depicted in Figure produces and reflection of through this same plane yields Figure Two planes of symmetry of the water molecule More generally it is possible to combine sets of Cartesian displacement coordinates into socalled symmetry adapted coordinates where the index labels the irreducible representation in the appropriate point group and j labels the particular combination of that symmetry ie there may be more than one kind of displacement that has a given symmetry G These symmetryadapted coordinates can be formed by applying the point group projection operators that are treated in detail in Chapter to the individual Cartesian displacement coordinates To illustrate again consider the molecule in the coordinate system described above The massweighted Cartesian displacement coordinates can be symmetry adapted by applying the following four projection operators to each of the original coordinates the symbol s denotes reflection through a plane and means rotation about the molecules axis Of course one will not obtain x independent symmetry adapted coordinates in this manner many identical combinations will arise and only will be independent The independent combinations of symmetry normalized to produce vectors of unit length are Q_a_ dfracsqrt X_L X_R Q_a_ dfracsqrt Y_L Y_R Q_a_ Y_O Those of symmetry are Q_b_ dfracsqrt X_L X_R Q_b_ dfracsqrt Y_L Y_R Q_b_ X_O and the combinations Q_b_ dfracsqrt Z_L Z_R Q_b_ Z_O are of symmetry whereas is of symmetry Point Group Symmetry of the Harmonic Potential These nine symmetryadapted coordinates are expressed as unitary transformations of the original massweighted Cartesian coordinates These transformation coefficients can be used to carry out a unitary transformation of the x massweighted Hessian matrix In so doing we need only form blocks H_Gamma_jl sum_kk C_Gamma_jk H_kk sqrtm_k m_k C_Gamma_lk within which the symmetries of the two modes are identical The offdiagonal elements H_Gamma_jGamma_l sum_kk C_Gamma_jk H_kk sqrtm_k m_k C_Gamma_lk vanish because the potential and the full vibrational Hamiltonian commutes with the point group symmetry operations As a result the x massweighted Hessian eigenvalue problem can be subdivided into two x matrix problems of and symmetry one x matrix of symmetry and one x matrix of symmetry For example the symmetry block His formed as follows leftbeginarrayccc dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt endarrayright leftbeginarrayccc m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial x_Lm_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial x_L partial x_Rm_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial x_L partial y_Om_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial x_R partial x_Lm_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial x_Rm_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial x_R partial y_Om_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial y_O partial x_Lm_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial y_O partial x_Rm_H m_Hdfracpartial Vpartial y_Om_H endarrayright leftbeginarrayccc dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt endarrayright The and blocks are formed in a similar manner The eigenvalues of each of these blocks provide the squares of the harmonic vibrational frequencies the eigenvectors provide the coefficients of the normal mode of symmetry in terms of the massweighted Cartesian coordinates The relationship can then be used to express these coefficients in terms of the original Cartesian coordinates Regardless of whether symmetry is used to block diagonalize the massweighted Hessian six for nonlinear molecules or five for linear species of the eigenvalues will equal zero The eigenvectors belonging to these zero eigenvalues describe the translations and or rotations of the molecule For example when expressed in terms of the original ie nonmassweighted Cartesian coordinates are three translation eigenvectors of and symmetry and is a rotation about the yaxis in the Figure of symmetry This rotation vector can be generated by applying the projection operator to or to The other two rotations are of and symmetry and involve spinning of the molecule about the and axes of the Figure respectively So of the Cartesian displacements are of symmetry of of and of Of these there are three translations and and three rotations and a This leaves two vibrations of and one of symmetry For the example treated here the three nonzero eigenvalues of the massweighted Hessian are therefore of and symmetry They describe the symmetric and asymmetric stretch vibrations and the bending mode respectively as illustrated in Figure Figure Symmetric and asymmetric stretch modes and bending mode of water The method of vibrational analysis presented here can work for any polyatomic molecule One knows the massweighted Hessian and then computes the nonzero eigenvalues which then provide the squares of the normal modes harmonic vibrational frequencies Point group symmetry can be used to block diagonalize this Hessian and to label the vibrational modes according to symmetry as we show in Figure for the molecule
