Other Statements of the First Law Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers The first law has been stated in many ways Some are intended to be humorous or evocative rather than precise statements for example You cant get something useful work in some system for nothing no decrease in the energy of some other system Others are potentially ambiguous because we construct them to be as terse as possible To make them terse we omit ideas that we deem to be implicit A compact and often used statement is and is a state function In this statement the fact that energy is conserved is taken to be implicit in the operational definition We can give an equally valid statement by saying Energy is conserved in all processes In making this statement we assume that the definition of energy is understood and that the statefunction postulate is implicit in this definition To see that the postulate that energy is conserved and the postulate that energy is a state function are logically independent let us consider a system that undergoes a particular cyclic process which we call Cycle A In Cycle A the final state of the system is the same as its initial state the postulate that energy is a state function is then equivalent to the statement that The postulate that energy is conserved is equivalent to the statement that Now what can we say about Obviously if we combine the information from the two postulates it follows that The essential point however is that is not required by either postulate alone is not required by the postulate that energy is a state function because the surroundings do not necessarily traverse a cycle whenever the system does is not required by conservation of energy which merely requires and absent the requirement that be a state function could be anything In Chapter we explore a statement of the second law that denies the possibility of constructing a perpetual motion machine of the second kind Such a perpetual motion machine converts heat from a constanttemperature reservoir into work This statement is It is impossible to construct a machine that operates in a cycle exchanges heat with its surroundings at only one temperature and produces work in the surroundings A parallel statement is sometimes taken as a statement of the first law This statement denies the possibility of constructing a perpetual motion machine of the first kind This statement is It is impossible to construct a machine that operates in a cycle and converts heat into a greater amount of work The shared perspective and phrasing of these statements is esthetically pleasing Let us consider the relationship between this statement of the first law and the statement given in For brevity let us denote this impossibility statement as the machinebased statement of the first law and refer to it as proposition MFL We refer to the statement of the first law given in as proposition FL In the machinebased statement MFL we mean by a machine a system that accepts heat from its surroundings and produces a greater amount of work which appears in the surroundings If such a machine exists the machinebased statement of the first law is false and proposition MFL is true For one cycle of this firstlaw violating machine we have Since we have It follows that Our statement of the principle of conservation of energy then requires that for one cycle of this perpetual motion machine Our statement of the first law FL requires that since energy is a state function Since this is a contradiction the existence of a perpetual motion machine of the first kind proposition MFL implies that the first law energy is a state function proposition FL is false MFL FL From this result we can validly conclude If the first law is true the existence of a perpetual motion machine of the first kind is impossible MFL FL FLMFLFLMFL We cannot conclude that the impossibility of perpetual motion of the first kind implies that energy is a state function MFL FL does not imply MFLFL That is the impossibility of perpetual motion of the first kind as we have interpreted it is not shown by this argument to be equivalent to the first law as we have stated it It remains possible of course that this equivalence could be proved by some other argument Evidently when we take the impossibility of constructing a perpetual motion machine of the first kind as a statement of the first law we have a different interpretation in mind The difference is this When we specify a machine that operates in a cycle we intend that everything about the machine shall be the same at the end of the cycle as at the beginningincluding its energy That is we intend the statement to be understood as requiring that for one cycle of the perpetual motion machine Equivalently we intend the statement to be understood to include the stipulation that energy is a state function Now for one cycle of the perpetual motion machine we have and Given the basic idea that energy is additive so that we have that The impossibility statement asserts that this is false equivalently the impossibility statement asserts that energy cannot be created This conclusion is a weak form of the principle of conservation of energy it says less than we want the first law to say We postulate that energy can be neither created nor destroyed That is and are both false When we consider the impossibility statement to assert the principle of energy conservation we implicitly stipulate that the machine can also be run in reverse See problem We intend the first law to assert the existence of energy and to summarize its properties However we express the first law we recognize that the concept of energy encompasses several closely interrelated ideas
