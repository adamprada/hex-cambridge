Prelude to Chemical Equilibria Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay Contributors and Attributions The small is great the great is small all is in equilibrium in necessity Victor Hugo in Les Miserables As was discussed in Chapter the natural tendency of chemical systems is to seek a state of minimum Gibbs function Once the minimum is achieved movement in any chemical direction will not be spontaneous It is at this point that the system achieves a state of equilibrium From the diagram above it should be clear that the direction of spontaneous change is determined by minimizing If the slope of the curve is negative the reaction will favor a shift toward products And if it is positive the reaction will favor a shift toward reactants This is a nontrivial point as it underscores the importance of the composition of the reaction mixture in the determination of the direction of the reaction Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
