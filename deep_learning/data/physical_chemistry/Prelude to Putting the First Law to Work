Prelude to Putting the First Law to Work Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay Contributors and Attributions As has been seen in previous chapters may important thermochemical quantities can be expressed in terms of partial derivatives Two important examples are the molar heat capacities and which can be expressed as and These are properties that can be measured experimentally and tabulated for many substances These quantities can be used to calculate changes in quantities since they represent the slope of a surface or in the direction of the specified path constant or This allows us to use the following kinds of relationships and Delta H int leftdfracpartial Hpartial Tright_p dT Because thermodynamics is kind enough to deal in a number of state variables the functions that define how those variable change must behave according to some very well determined mathematics This is the true power of thermodynamics Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
