possible to use Hess Law to simplify the tabulation of reaction enthalpies Hess Law is based on the addition of reactions By knowing the reaction enthalpy for constituent reactions the enthalpy of a reaction that can be expressed as the sum of the constituent reactions can be calculated The key lies in the canceling of reactants and products that Ccur in the data reactions but not in the target reaction Example Find for the reaction Given with with Solution The target reaction can be generated from the data reactions plus equals COg O_g rightarrow CO_g so Standard Enthalpy of Formation One of the difficulties with many thermodynamic state variables such as enthalpy is that while it is possible to measure changes it is impossible to measure an absolute value of the variable itself In these cases it is necessary to define a zero to the scale defining the variable For enthalpy the definition of a zero is that the standard enthalpy of formation of a pure element in its standard state is zero All other enthalpy changes are defined relative to this standard Thus it is essential to very carefully define a standard state Definition the Standard State The standard state of a substance is the most stable form of that substance at atmosphere pressure and the specified temperature Using this definition a convenient reaction for which enthalpies can be measured and tabulated is the standard formation reaction This is a reaction which forms one mole of the substance of interest in its standard state from elements in their standard states The enthalpy of a standard formation reaction is the standard enthalpy of formation Some examples are with with It is important to note that the standard state of a substance is temperature dependent For example the standard state of water at C is solid whereas the standard state at room temperature is liquid Once these values are tabulated calculating reaction enthalpies becomes a snap Consider the heat combustion of methane at C as an example The reaction can expressed as a sum of a combination of the following standard formation reactions with with with Delta H_fo kJmol The target reaction can be generated from the following combination of reactions with with H_g O_g rightarrow H_Ol with Delta H_fo colorred times left kJmol right kJmol CH_g O_g rightarrow CO_g H_Ol with Alternately the reaction enthalpy could be calculated from the following relationship where is the stoichiometric coefficient of a species in the balanced chemical reaction For the combustion of methane this calculation is beginalign Delta _rxn mol leftDelta H_foCO_right mol leftDelta H_foH_Oright mol leftDelta H_foCH_right mol kJmol mol left kJmol right mol left kJmol right kJmol endalign A note about units is in order Note that reaction enthalpies have units of kJ whereas enthalpies of formation have units of kJmol The reason for the difference is that enthalpies of formation or for that matter enthalpies of combustion sublimation vaporization fusion etc refer to specific substances andor specific processes involving those substances As such the total enthalpy change is scaled by the amount of substance used General reactions on the other hand have to be interpreted in a very specific way When examining a reaction like the combustion of methane with The correct interpretation is that the reaction of one mole of CHg with two moles of Og to form one mole of COg and two moles of HOl releases kJ at C Ionization Reactions Ionized species appear throughout chemistry The energy changes involved in the formation of ions can be measured and tabulated for several substances In the case of the formation of positive ions the enthalpy change to remove a single electron at K is defined as the ionization potential with The removal of subsequent electrons requires energies called the nd Ionization potential rd ionization potential and so on with with An atom can have as many ionization potentials as it has electrons although since very highly charged ions are rare only the first few are important for most atoms Similarly the electron affinity can be defined for the formation of negative ions In this case the first electron affinity is defined by with The minus sign is included in the definition in order to make electron affinities mostly positive Some atoms such as noble gases will have negative electron affinities since the formation of a negative ion is very unfavorable for these species Just as in the case of ionization potentials an atom can have several electron affinities with with Average Bond Enthalpies In the absence of standard formation enthalpies reaction enthalpies can be estimated using average bond enthalpies This method is not perfect but it can be used to get ballpark estimates when more detailed data is not available A bond dissociation energy is defined by with In this process one adds energy to the reaction to break bonds and extracts energy for the bonds that are formed As an example consider the combustion of ethanol In this reaction five CH bonds one CC bond and one CO bond and one OO bond must be broken Also four CO bonds and one OH bond are formed Bond Average Bond Energy kJmol CH CC CO OO CO OH The reaction enthalpy is then given by beginalign Delta H_c kJmol kJmol kJmol nonumber kJmol kJmol kJmol nonumber kJmol endalign Because the bond energies are defined for gasphase reactants and products this method does not account for the enthalpy change of condensation to form liquids or solids and so the result may be off systematically due to these differences Also since the bond enthalpies are averaged over a large number of molecules containing the particular type of bond the results may deviate due to the variance in the actual bond enthalpy in the specific molecule under consideration Typically reaction enthalpies derived by this method are only reliable to within Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry
