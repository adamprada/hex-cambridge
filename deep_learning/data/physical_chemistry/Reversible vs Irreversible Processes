Reversible vs Irreversible Processes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers When we think about a physical system that is undergoing a reversible change we imagine that the system passes through a series of states In each of these states every thermodynamic variable has a welldefined value in every phase of the system We suppose that successive states of the changing system are arbitrarily close to one another in the sense that the successive values of every thermodynamic are arbitrarily close to one another These suppositions are equivalent to assuming that the state of the system and the value of every thermodynamic variable are continuous functions of time Then every thermodynamic variable is either constant or a continuous function of other thermodynamic variables When we talk about a reversible process we have in mind a physical system that behaves in this way and in which an arbitrarily small change in one of the thermodynamic variables can reverse the direction in which other thermodynamic variables change A process that is not reversible is said to be irreversible We distinguish between two kinds of irreversible processes A process that cannot occur under a given set of conditions is said to be an impossible process A process that can occur but does not do so reversibly is called a possible process or a spontaneous process Another essential characteristic of a reversible process is that changes in the system are driven by conditions that are imposed on the system by the surroundings In our discussion of the phase equilibria of water we note that the surroundings can transfer heat to the system only when the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the system However if the process is to be reversible this temperature difference must be arbitrarily small so that heat can be made to flow from the system to the surroundings by an arbitrarily small decrease in the temperature of the surroundings Similar considerations apply when the process involves the exchange of work between system and surroundings We focus on changes in which the work exchanged between system and surroundings is pressurevolume work A process can occur reversibly only if the pressure of the system and the pressure applied to the system by the surroundings differ by an arbitrarily small amount To abbreviate these statements we customarily introduce a figure of speech and say that for a reversible process or and that or Since a reversible process involves a complementary exchange of energy increments between system and surroundings it is evident that an isolated system cannot undergo a reversible change Any change that occurs in an isolated system must be spontaneous By the contrapositive an isolated system that cannot undergo change must be at equilibrium While and are necessary conditions for a reversible process they are not sufficient A spontaneous process can occur under conditions in which the system temperature is arbitrarily close to the temperature of the surroundings and the system pressure is arbitrarily close to the applied pressure Consider a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in a cylinder closed by a frictionless piston We suppose that the surroundings are maintained at a constant temperature and that the surroundings apply a constant pressure to the piston We suppose that the system contains a small quantity of a poorly effective catalyst By controlling the activity of the catalyst we can arrange for the formation of water to occur at an arbitrarily slow ratea rate so slow that the temperature and pressure gradients that occur in the neighborhood of the catalyst are arbitrarily small Nevertheless the reaction is a spontaneous process not a reversible one If the process were reversible an arbitrarily small increase in the applied pressure would be sufficient to reverse the direction of reaction causing water to decompose to hydrogen and oxygen
