Some Important Properties of Events Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics The Probability of Alternative EventsThe Probability of Compound Events If we know the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a trial we can calculate the probabilities for combinations of outcomes These calculations are based on two rules which we call the laws of probability If we partition the outcomes into exhaustive and mutually exclusive events the laws of probability also apply to events Since as we define them events is a more general term than outcomes we call them the law of the probability of alternative events and the law of the probability of compound events These laws are valid so long as three conditions are satisfied We have already discussed the first two of these conditions which are that the outcomes possible in any individual trial must be exhaustive and mutually exclusive The third condition is that if we make more than one trial the outcomes must be independent that is the outcome of one trial must not be influenced by the outcomes of the others We can view the laws of probability as rules for inferring information about combinations of events The law of the probability of alternative events applies to events that belong to the same distribution The law of the probability of compound events applies to events that can come from one or more distributions An important special case occurs when the compound events are successive samplings of a given distribution that we identify as the parent distribution If the random variable is a number and we average the numbers that we obtain from successive samplings of the parent distribution these averagesof themselves constitute a distribution If we know certain properties of the parent distribution we can calculate corresponding properties of the distribution of averagesof values obtained by sampling the parent distribution These calculations are specified by the central limit theorem which we discuss in Section In general when we combine events from two distributions we can view the result as an event that belongs to a third distribution At first encounter the idea of combining events and distributions may seem esoteric A few examples serve to show that what we have in mind is very simple Since an event is a set of outcomes an event occurs whenever any of the outcomes in the set occurs Partitioning the outcomes of tossing a die into even outcomes and odd outcomes illustrates this idea The event even outcome occurs whenever the outcome of a trial is or The probability of an event can be calculated from the probabilities of the underlying outcomes We call the rule for this calculation the law of the probabilities of alternative events We create the opportunity for confusion here because we are illustrating the idea of alternative events by using an example in which we call the alternatives alternative outcomes rather than alternative events We need to remember that event is a more general term than outcome One possible partitioning is that which assigns every outcome to its own event We discuss the probabilities of alternative events further below To illustrate the idea of compound events let us consider a first distribution that comprises tossing a coin and a second distribution that comprises drawing a card from a poker deck The first distribution has two possible outcomes the second distribution has possible outcomes If we combine these distributions we create a third distribution that comprises tossing a coin and drawing a card from a poker deck The third distribution has possible outcomes If we know the probabilities of the outcomes of the first distribution and the probabilities of the outcomes of the second distribution and these probabilities are independent of one another we can calculate the probability of any outcome that belongs to the third distribution We call the rule for this calculation the law of the probability of compound events We discuss it further below A similar situation occurs when we consider the outcomes of tossing two coins We assume that we can tell the two coins apart Call them coin and coin We designate heads and tails for coins and as and respectively There are four possible outcomes in the distribution we call tossing two coins and If we could not tell the coins apart would be the same thing as there would be only three possible outcomes We can view the distribution tossing two coins as being a combination of the two distributions that we can call tossing coin and tossing coin We can also view the distribution tossing two coins as a combination of two distributions that we call tossing a coin a first time and tossing a coin a second time We view the distribution tossing two coins as being equivalent to the distribution tossing one coin twice This is an example of repeated trials which is a frequently encountered type of distribution In general we call such a distribution a distribution of events from a trial repeated N times and we view this distribution as being completely equivalent to N simultaneous trials of the same kind Chapter considers the distribution of outcomes when a trial is repeated many times Understanding the properties of such distributions is the single most essential element in understanding the theory of statistical thermodynamics The central limit theorem relates properties of the repeatedtrials distribution to properties of the parent distribution The Probability of Alternative Events If we know the probability of each of two mutually exclusive events that belong to an exhaustive set the probability that one or the other of them will occur in a single trial is equal to the sum of the individual probabilities Let us call the independent events A and B and represent their probabilities as and respectively The probability that one of these events occurs is the same thing as the probability that either A occurs or B occurs We can represent this probability as The probability of this combination of events is the sum That is Above we define Y as the event that a single toss of a die comes up either or Because each of these outcomes is one of six mutuallyexclusive equallylikely outcomes the probability of either of them is From the law of the probability of alternative events we have We define as the event that a single toss of a die comes up even From the law of the probability of alternative events we have We define as the event that a single toss comes up If there are independent events denoted the law of the probability of alternative events asserts that the probability that one of these events will occur in a single trial is If these independent events encompass all of the possible outcomes the sum of their individual probabilities must be unity Figure A simple case that illustrates the laws of probability The Probability of Compound Events Let us now suppose that we make two trials in circumstances where event is possible in the first trial and event is possible in the second trial We represent the probabilities of these events by and and stipulate that they are independent of one another that is the probability that occurs in the second trial is independent of the outcome of the first trial Then the probability that occurs in the first trial and occurs in the second trial is equal to the product of the individual probabilities To illustrate this using outcomes from dietossing let us suppose that event is tossing a and event is tossing a Then and The probability of tossing a in a first trial and tossing a in a second trial is then If we want the probability of getting one and one in two tosses we must add to this the probability of tossing a first and a second If there are independent events denoted the law of the probability of compound events asserts that the probability that will occur in a first trial and will occur in a second trial etc is beginalign PleftE_ and E_ anddots E_idots and E_omega right PleftE_righttimes
