Statistics the Mean and the Variance of a Distribution Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers There are two important statistics associated with any probability distribution the mean of a distribution and the variance of a distribution The mean is defined as the expected value of the random variable itself The Greek letter is usually used to represent the mean If is the cumulative probability distribution the mean is the expected value for From our definition of expected value the mean is The variance is defined as the expected value of The variance measures how dispersed the data are If the variance is large the data areon averagefarther from the mean than they are if the variance is small The standard deviation is the square root of the variance The Greek letter is usually used to denote the standard deviation Then denotes the variance and If we have a small number of points from a distribution we can estimate and by approximating these integrals as sums over the domain of the random variable To do this we need to estimate the probability associated with each interval for which we have a sample point By the argument we make in Section the best estimate of this probability is simply where is the number of sample points We have therefore That is the best estimate we can make of the mean from data points is where is the ordinary arithmetic average Similarly the best estimate we can make of the variance is Now a complication arises in that we usually do not know the value of The best we can do is to estimate its value as It turns out that using this approximation in the equation we deduce for the variance gives an estimate of the variance that is too small A more detailed argument see Section shows that if we use to approximate the mean the best estimate of usually denoted is Figure Variance is analogous to a moment of inertia Dividing by rather than compensates exactly for the error introduced by using rather than The mean is analogous to a center of mass The variance is analogous to a moment of inertia For this reason the variance is also called the second moment about the mean To show these analogies let us imagine that we draw the probability density function on a uniformly thick steel plate and then cut along the curve and the axis Figure Let be the mass of the cutout piece of plate is the mass below the probability density curve Let and be the increments of area and mass in the thin slice of the cutout that lies above a small increment of Let be the density of the plate expressed as mass per unit area Since the plate is uniform is constant We have and so that The mean of the distribution corresponds to a vertical line on this cutout at If the cutout is supported on a knifeedge along the line gravity induces no torque the cutout is balanced Since the torque is zero we have Since is a constant property of the cutout it follows that The cutouts moment of inertia about the line is The moment of inertia about the line is simply the mass per unit area times the variance of the distribution If we let we have We define the mean of as the expected value of It is the value of we should expect to get the next time we sample the distribution Alternatively we can say that the mean is the best prediction we can make about the value of a future sample from the distribution If we know the best prediction we can make is If we have only the estimated mean then is the best prediction we can make Choosing makes the difference as small as possible These ideas relate to another interpretation of the mean We saw that the variance is the second moment about the mean The first moment about the mean is Since the last two integrals are and respectively the first moment about the mean is zero We could have defined the mean as the value for which the first moment of about is zero The first moment about the mean is zero The second moment about the mean is the variance We can define third fourth and higher moments about the mean Some of these higher moments have useful applications
