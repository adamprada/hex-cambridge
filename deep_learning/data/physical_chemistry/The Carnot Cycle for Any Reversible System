The Carnot Cycle for Any Reversible System Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers To show that for any reversible system taken around a Carnot cycle we first observe that the Carnot cycle can be traversed in the opposite direction In this case work is delivered to the engine and a quantity of heat is transferred from the lowtemperature reservoir to the hightemperature reservoir Operated in reverse the Carnot engine is a refrigerator Suppose that we have two identical idealgas Carnot machines one of which we operate as an engine while we operate the other as a refrigerator If we configure them so that the work output of the engine drives the refrigerator the effects of operating them together cancel completely The refrigerator exactly consumes the work output of the engine The heat transfers to and from the heat reservoirs offset exactly Now let us consider an idealgas Carnot engine and any other reversible engine that extracts heat from a hightemperature reservoir and rejects a portion of it to a lowtemperature reservoir Let us call these engines A and B We suppose that one is operated to produce work in its surroundings the other is operated to consume this work and transfer net heat energy from the lowtemperature to the hightemperature reservoir Let the net work done in one cycle on machines A and B be and respectively We can choose to make these engines any size that we please Let us size them so that one complete cycle of either engine exchanges the same quantity of heat with the hightemperature reservoir That is if the hightemperature reservoir delivers heat to engine A then it delivers heat to engine B Figure diagrams these engines With one operating as an engine and the other operating as a refrigerator we have When both engine and refrigerator have completed a cycle the high temperature reservoir has returned to its original state Figure Matched heat engine and refrigerator and a system that combines them We can create a combined device that consists of A running as an engine B running as a refrigerator and the hightemperature reservoir Figure also diagrams this combination When it executes one complete cycle the initial condition of the combined device is restored Therefore since E is a state function we have where we use the constraint Let us consider the possibility that that is the combined device does net work on the surroundings Then implies that In this cyclic process the combined device takes up a positive quantity of heat from a constanttemperature reservoir and delivers a positive quantity of work to the surroundings There is no other change in either the system or the surroundings This violates the machinebased statement of the second law Evidently it is not possible for the combined device to operate in the manner we have hypothesized We conclude that any such machine must always operate such that that is the net work done on the combined machine during any complete cycle must be either zero or some positive quantity In concluding that we specify that the combined machine has A running as a heat engine and B running as a refrigerator Now suppose that we reverse their roles and let and represent the net work for the reversed combination Applying the same argument as previously we conclude that But since the direction of operation is reversed for both machines we must also have and Hence we have or We conclude therefore that for any two matched reversible engines operating around a Carnot cycle This conclusion can be restated as a condition on the efficiencies of the two machines The individual efficiencies are and The efficiency equation is unaffected by the direction of operation because changing the direction changes the sign of every energy term in the cycle Changing the direction of operation is equivalent to multiplying both the numerator and denominator by minus one Then from it follows that Since we sized A and B so that we have so that for any reversible Carnot engines A and B operating between the same two heat reservoirs For the ideal gas engine we found For any reversible Carnot engine we have so that and This means that the efficiency relationship applies to any reversible Carnot engine It follows that the integral of around a Carnot cycle is zero for any reversible system The validity of these conclusions is independent of type of work that the engine produces if engine A is an idealgas engine engine B can be comprised of any system and can produce any kind of work In obtaining this result from the machinebased statement of the second law we make the additional assumption that pressurevolume work can be converted entirely to any other form of work and vice versa That is we assume that the work produced by engine A can reversibly drive engine B as a refrigerator whether engines A and B produce the same or different kinds of work
