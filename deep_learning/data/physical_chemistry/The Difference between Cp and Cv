The Difference between Cp and Cv Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay Contributors and Attributions Constant volume and constant pressure heat capacities are very important in the calculation of many changes The ratio appears in many expressions as well such as the relationship between pressure and volume along an adiabatic expansion It would be useful to derive an expression for the difference as well As it turns out this difference is expressible in terms of measureable physical properties of a substance such as and In order to derive an expression lets start from the definitions and The difference is thus In order to evaluate this difference consider the definition of enthalpy Differentiating this yields Dividing this expression by and constraining to constant gives The last term is kind enough to vanish since at constant pressure After converting the remaining terms to partial derivatives This expression is starting to show some of the players For example and So Equation reftotal becomes In order to evaluate the partial derivative above first consider Then the total differential can be expressed Dividing by and constraining to constant will generate the partial derivative we wish to evaluate The last term will become unity so after converting to partial derivatives we see that This incidentally is an example of partial derivative transformation type III Now we are getting somewhere and So the Equation refeq can be rewritten If we can find an expression for we are almost home free Fortunately that is an easy expression to derive Begin with the combined expression of the first and second laws Now divide both sides by and constrain to constant The last term is unity so after conversion to partial derivatives we see A Maxwell relation specifically the Maxwell relation on can be used Substituting this into Equation refeq yields and since then Now substituting this into the expression into Equation refeq to get This can now be substituted into the Equation refeq yields The terms will cancel And subtracting from both sides gives the desired result And this is a completely general result since the only assumptions made were those that allowed us to use the combined first and second laws in the form That means that this expression can be applied to any substance whether gas liquid animal vegetable or mineral But what is the result for an ideal gas Since we know that for an ideal gas and Substitution back into Equation reffinal yields beginalign C_p C_V dfracTV leftdfracTrightleftdfracpright So for an ideal gas That is good to know no Example Derive the expression for the difference between and by beginning with the definition of differentiating dividing by to generate the partial derivative definition of In this approach you will need to find expressions for and and also utilize the MaxwellRelation on Solution Begin with the definition of enthalpy Differentiate the expression Now divide by and constrain to constant as described in the instructions to generate the partial derivative definition of Now what is needed is an expression for This can be derived from the total differential for by dividing by and constraining to constant This again is an example of partial derivative transformation type III To continue we need an expression for This can be quickly generated by considering the total differential of its natural variables Dividing by and constraining to constant yields Using the Maxwell Relation on we can substitute So Equation refeqE becomes Now substitute this back into the expression for Equation refeqE This can now substituted for the righthand side of the initial expression for back into Equation refeqE Several terms cancel one another Equation refeqE can then be rearranged to yield or which might look familiar Equation reffinal Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
