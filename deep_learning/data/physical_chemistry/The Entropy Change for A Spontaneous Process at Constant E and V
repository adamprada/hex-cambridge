The Entropy Change for A Spontaneous Process at Constant E and V Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers For any spontaneous process we have which we can rearrange to Substituting our result from Section we have spontaneous process If the energy of the system is constant throughout the process we have and spontaneous process constant energy The spontaneous work is the sum of the pressurevolume work and the nonpressurevolume work If we introduce the further condition that the spontaneous process occurs while the volume of the system remains constant we have Making this substitution and repeating our earlier result for a reversible process we have the parallel relationships spontaneous process constant and reversible process constant and For a reversible process If the spontaneous process occurs while is constant summing the incremental contributions to a finite change of state produces the parallel relationships spontaneous process constant and reversible process constant and Constant corresponds to the common situation in chemical experimentation in which we place a reaction vessel in a constanttemperature bath If we introduce the further condition that only pressurevolume work is possible we have The parallel relationships become spontaneous process constant and only work reversible process constant and only work If the energy and volume are constant for a system in which only pressurevolume work is possible the system is isolated The conditions we have just derived are entirely equivalent to our earlier conclusions that and for an isolated system that is at equilibrium or undergoing a spontaneous change respectively Summing the incremental contributions to a finite change of state produces the parallel relationships spontaneous process only work reversible process only work The validity of these expressions is independent of any variation in either or
