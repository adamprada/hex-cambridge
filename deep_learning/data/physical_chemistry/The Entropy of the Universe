The Entropy of the Universe Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In Section we conclude that the entropy change is positive for any spontaneous change in an isolated system Since we can consider the universe to be an isolated system it follows that for any spontaneous process To reach this conclusion by a more detailed argument let us consider an arbitrary system that is in contact with its surroundings We can subdivide these surroundings into subsystems As diagrammed in Figure we define a surroundings subsystem Surroundings that interacts with the system and a more remote surroundings subsystem Surroundings that does not That is we assume that we can define Surroundings so that it is unaffected by the process Then we define an augmented system consisting of the original system plus Surroundings The augmented system is isolated from the remote portion of the surroundings so that the entropy change for the augmented system is positive by the argument in the previous section Denoting entropy changes for the system Surroundings Surroundings and the augmented system by and respectively we have and Since the remote portion of the surroundings is unaffected by the change we have For any spontaneous change whether the system is isolated or not we have any spontaneous change Figure Expanding a system to create a new augmented isolated system This statement is an essential part of the entropybased statement of the second law We have now developed it from the machinebased statement of the second law by convincing but not entirely rigorous arguments In Section we find that for any reversible process Thus for any possible process we have The equality applies when the process is reversible the inequality applies when it is spontaneous Because entropy is a state function and change sign when the direction of a process is reversed We say that a process for which is an impossible process Our definitions mean that these classificationsreversible spontaneous and impossibleare exhaustive and mutually exclusive We conclude that is necessary and sufficient for a process to be reversible is necessary and sufficient for a process to be spontaneous See problem
