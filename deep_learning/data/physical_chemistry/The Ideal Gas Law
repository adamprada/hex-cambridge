The Ideal Gas Law Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay Contributors and Attributions The ideal gas law combines the empirical laws into a single expression It also predicts the existence of a single universal gas constant which turns out to be one of the most important fundamental constants in science The ideal gas law constant is of fundamental importance and can be expressed in a number of different sets of units Value Units atm L mol K J mol K cal mol K The ideal gas law as derived here is based entirely on empirical data It represents limiting ideal behavior As such deviations from the behavior suggested by the ideal gas law can be understood in terms of what conditions are required for ideal behavior to be followed or at least approached As such it would be nice if there was a theory of gases that would suggest the form of the ideal gas law and also the value of the gas law constant As it turns out the kinetic molecular theory of gases does just that Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
