The LindemannHinshelwood Mechanism for Firstorder Decay Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers Firstorder kinetics for a unimolecular reaction corresponds to a constant probability that a given molecule reacts in unit time In Section we outline a simple mechanism that rationalizes this fact This mechanism assumes that the probability of reaction is zero unless the molecule has some minimum energy For molecules whose energy exceeds the threshold value we assume that the probability of reaction is constant However when collisions are frequent a molecule can have excess energy only for brief intervals The LindemannHinshelwood mechanism for gasphase unimolecular reactions provides a mathematical model of these ideas Since molecules exchange energy via collisions any given molecule acquires excess energy by collisions with other molecules and loses it within a short time through other collisions If it retains its excess energy long enough it will react If collisions are very infrequent every molecule that acquires excess energy reacts before it undergoes a deactivating collision In this case the reaction rate is proportional to the rate at which molecules acquire excess energy which is proportional to the number of collisions In a collection of molecules the total number of collisions is proportional to not and so the reaction rate depends on not We represent molecules with excess energy as and assume that all molecules undergo reaction with a constant probability molecules are formed in collisions between molecules and they are deactivated by subsequent collisions with molecules where is the products of the reaction The rate at which the number of moles of molecules changes is and since we suppose that is always very small the steadystate approximation applies so that and The reaction rate is given by When the rate of deactivating collisions between and is greater than the rate at which molecules go on to become products the rate law Equation reflaw for consumption of becomes first order beginalign lim_k_ceAgg k_ frack_k_ceAk_ceAk_ frack_k_ceAcancelk_cancelceA where the first order rate constant is a function of and This is termed the rate laws highpressure limit The lowpressure limit occurs when The rate law Equation reflaw becomes second order in beginalign lim_k_ceAll k_ frack_k_ceAk_ceAk_ frack_ cancelk_ceAcancelk_ where the second order rate constant is a function of only The rate of product formation becomes equal to the rate at which molecules are formed
