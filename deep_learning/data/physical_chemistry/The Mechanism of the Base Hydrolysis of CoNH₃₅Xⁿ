The Mechanism of the Base Hydrolysis of CoNH₃₅Xⁿ Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics Mechanism Mechanism Mechanism This chapter focuses on the relationship between rate laws and reaction mechanisms We have noted that the rate law is rarely sufficient to establish the mechanism of a particular reaction The base hydrolysis of cobalt pentammine complexes is a reaction for which numerous lines of evidence converge to establish the mechanism To illustrate the range of data that can be useful in the determination of reaction mechanisms we summarize this evidence here CobaltIII complexes usually undergo substitution reactions at readily measurable rates Cobalt pentammine complexes have been studied extensively Mechanism In acidic aqueous solutions the reaction etc usually proceeds exclusively through the aquo complex The first step in the reaction is the breaking of a bond and the formation of a bond step Subsequently a moiety can replace the aquo group step For example In aqueous solution water is always present at a much higher concentration than the various possible entering groups so it is reasonable that it should be favored in the competition to form the new bond to Nevertheless we expect the strength of the bond to be an indicator of the nucleophilicity of in these substitution reactions The fact that the aquo complex is the predominant reaction product strongly suggests that the energetics of the reaction are dominated by the breaking of the bond formation of the new bond to the incoming ligand apparently has little effect Whether the old bond has been completely broken so that is a true intermediate before the new bond has begun to form remains an issue on which it is possible to disagree Mechanism There is a conspicuous exception to the description given above When the entering group is the hydroxide ion the reaction is This is called the basehydrolysis reaction It is faster than the formation of the aquo complex in acidic solutions and the rate is law found to be This rate law is consistent with nucleophilic attack by the hydroxide ion at the cobalt center so that bond formation occurs simultaneously with breaking of the bond However this interpretation means that the hydroxide ion is a uniquely effective nucleophile toward cobaltIII Nucleophilic displacements have been investigated on many other electrophiles In general hydroxide is not a particularly effective nucleophile toward other electrophilic centers So assignment of an mechanism to this reaction is reasonable only if we can explain why hydroxide is uniquely reactive in this case and not in others Mechanism An alternative mechanism usually labeled the Substitution Nucleophilic firstorder in the Conjugate Base mechanism mechanism is also consistent with the secondorder rate law In this mechanism hydroxide removes a proton from one of the ammine ligands to give a sixcoordinate intermediate containing an amido ligand step This intermediate loses the leaving group in the rate determining step to form a fivecoordinate intermediate step This intermediate picks up a water molecule to give the aquo complex step In a series of proton transfers to step and from step the aqueous solvent the aquo complex rearranges to the final product With as the leaving group the mechanism is The evidence in favor of the mechanism is persuasive It requires that the ammine protons be acidic so that they can undergo the acidbase reaction in the first step That this reaction occurs is demonstrated by protonexchange experiments In basic the ammine protons undergo exchange according to The ammine protons are also necessary base hydrolysis does not occur for similar compounds like in which there are no protons on the nitrogen atoms that are bound to cobalt ie there are no moieties The evidence that is an intermediate is also persuasive When the base hydrolysis reaction is carried out in the presence of other possible entering groups the rate at which is consumed is unchanged but the product is a mixture of and If this experiment is done with a variety of leaving groups the proportions of and are constantindependent of which leaving group the reactant molecule contains These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that all reactants give the same intermediate The product distribution is always the same because it is always the same species undergoing the productforming reaction
