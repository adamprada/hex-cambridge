The Rate of Collisions between Unlike Gas Molecules Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers We define the collision frequencycollision frequency as the number of collision per unit time between a single molecule of type and any of the molecules of type present in the same container We find If there are molecules of type present in a unit volume of the gas the total number of collisions between type molecules and type molecules is times greater For clarity let us refer to the total number of such collisions per unit volume and per unit time as the collision rate We have
