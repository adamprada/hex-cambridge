The Variational Method Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah Contributors and Attributions Let us now turn to the other method that is used to solve Schrödinger equations approximately the variational method In this approach one must again have some reasonable wavefunction that is used to approximate the true wavefunction Within this approximate wavefunction one embeds one or more variables that one subsequently varies to achieve a minimum in the energy of computed as an expectation value of the true Hamiltonian The optimal values of the parameters are determined by making To achieve the desired energy minimum We also should verify that the second derivative matrix has all positive eigenvalues otherwise one may not have found the minimum The theoretical basis underlying the variational method can be understood through the following derivation Suppose that someone knew the exact eigenstates ie true and true of the true Hamiltonian These states obey Because these true states form a complete set it can be shown that the eigenfunctions of all the Hamiltonian operators we ever encounter have this property our socalled trial wavefunction can in principle be expanded in terms of these Before proceeding further allow me to overcome one likely misconception What I am going through now is only a derivation of the working formula of the variational method The final formula will not require us to ever know the exact or the exact but we are allowed to use them as tools in our derivation because we know they exist even if we never know them With the above expansion of our trial function in terms of the exact eigenfunctions let us now substitute this into the quantity that the variational method instructs us to compute Using the fact that the obey and that the are orthonormal the above expression reduces to One of the basic properties of the kind of Hamiltonian we encounter is that they have a lowestenergy state Sometimes we say they are bounded from below which means their energy states do not continue all the way to minus infinity There are systems for which this is not the case we saw one earlier when studying the Stark effect but we will now assume that we are not dealing with such systems This allows us to introduce the inequality which says that all of the energies are higher than or equal to the energy of the lowest state which we denote Introducing this inequality into the above expression gives This means that the variational energy computed as will lie above the true groundstate energy no matter what trial function we use The significance of the above result that is as follows We are allowed to imbed into our trial wavefunction parameters that we can vary to make computed as Equation as low as possible because we know that we can never it lower than the true groundstate energy The philosophy then is to vary the parameters in to render as low as possible because the closer is to the better is our variational wavefunction Let me now demonstrate how the variational method is used in such a manner by solving an example problem Example Two electron Atoms Suppose you are given a trial wavefunction of the form to represent a twoelectron ion of nuclear charge and suppose that you are lucky enough that I have already evaluated the variational energy expression Equation refenergy which Ill call for you and found Now lets find the optimum value of the variational parameter for an arbitrary nuclear charge by setting After finding the optimal value of well then find the optimal energy by plugging this into the above expression Note that represents the shielding factor of one s electron to the other reducing the optimal effective nuclear charge by this amount those familiar with Slaters Rules will not be surprised by this number Now using this optimal in our energy expression gives Since is the Bohr radius Å eV or one atomic unit of energy Is this energy any good The total energies of some twoelectron atoms and ions have been experimentally determined to be as shown in Table below Using our optimized expression for lets now calculate the estimated total energies of each of these atoms and ions as well as the percent error in our estimate for each ion Table Comparison of Experimental true total energies with predicted for select twoelectron species Z Atom Experimental Calculated Error H eV eV He eV eV Li eV eV Be eV eV B eV eV C eV eV N eV eV O eV eV The energy errors are essentially constant over the range of but produce a larger percentage error at small Z Aside In when quantum mechanics was quite young it was not known whether the isolated gasphase hydride ion was stable with respect to loss of an electron to form a hydrogen atom Lets compare our estimated total energy for to the ground state energy of a hydrogen atom and an isolated electron which is known to be eV When we use our expression for W and take we obtain eV which is greater than eV so this simple variational calculation erroneously predicts to be unstable More complicated variational treatments give a ground state energy of of eV in agreement with experiment and agreeing that is indeed stable with respect to electron detachment Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and
