Propagation Surface Hopping Dynamics LandauZener Surface JumpsContributors and Attributions Transition State Theory The most successful and widely employed theoretical approach for studying rates involving species undergoing reaction at or near thermalequilibrium conditions is the transition state theory TST of the authors late colleague Henry Eyring This would not be a good way to model for example photochemical reactions in which the reactants do not reach thermal equilibrium before undergoing significant reaction progress However for most thermal reactions it is remarkably successful In this theory one views the reactants as undergoing collisions that act to keep all of their degrees of freedom translational rotational vibrational electronic in thermal equilibrium Among the collection of such reactant molecules at any instant of time some will have enough internal energy to access a transition state TS on the BornOppenheimer potential energy surface upon which the reaction takes place Within TST the rate of progress from reactants to products is then expressed in terms of the concentration of species that exist near the TS multiplied by the rate at which these species move through the TS region of the energy surface The concentration of species at the TS is in turn written in terms of the equilibrium constant expression of statistical mechanics discussed in Chapter For example for a bimolecular reaction passing through a TS denoted AB one writes the concentration in molecules per unit volume of AB species in terms of the concentrations of A and of B and the respective partition functions as There is however one aspect of the partition function of the TS species that is specific to this theory The partition function contains all of the usual translational rotational vibrational and electronic partition functions that one would write down as we did in Chapter for a conventional AB molecule except for one modification It does not contain a vibrational contribution for motion along the one internal coordinate corresponding to the reaction path Figure Typical potential energy surface in two dimensions showing local minima transition states and paths connecting them As we discussed in Chapter in the vicinity of the TS the reaction path can be identified as that direction along which the PES has negative curvature along all other directions the energy surface is positively curved For example in Figure a reaction path begins at Transition Structure B and is directed downhill More specifically if one knows the gradients and Hessian matrix elements of the energy surface at the TS one can express the variation of the potential energy along the Cartesian coordinates of the molecule as follows where E is the energy at the TS and the denote displacements away from the TS geometry Of course at the TS the gradients all vanish because this geometry corresponds to a stationary point As we discussed in Chapter the Hessian matrix has zero eigenvalues whose eigenvectors correspond to overall translation and rotation of the molecule This matrix has positive eigenvalues whose eigenvectors correspond to the vibrations of the TS species as well as one negative eigenvalue The latter has an eigenvector whose components along the Cartesian coordinates describe the direction of the reaction path as it begins its journey from the TS backward to reactants when followed in one direction and onward to products when followed in the opposite direction Once one moves a small amount along the direction of negative curvature the reaction path is subsequently followed by taking infinitesimal steps downhill along the gradient vector whose components are Note that once one has moved downhill away from the TS by taking the initial step along the negatively curved direction the gradient no longer vanishes because one is no longer at the stationary point Returning to the TST rate calculation one therefore is able to express the concentration of species at the TS in terms of the reactant concentrations and a ratio of partition functions The denominator of this ratio contains the conventional partition functions of the reactant molecules and can be evaluated as discussed in Chapter However the numerator contains the partition function of the TS species but with one vibrational component missing ie Other than the one missing the TSs partition function is also evaluated as in Chapter The motion along the reaction path coordinate contributes to the rate expression in terms of the frequency ie how often with which reacting flux crosses the TS region given that the system is in nearthermal equilibrium at temperature To compute the frequency with which trajectories cross the TS and proceed onward to form products one imagines the TS as consisting of a narrow region along the reaction coordinate the width of this region we denote We next ask what the classical weighting factor is for a collision to have momentum along the reaction coordinate Remembering our discussion of such matters in Chapter we know that the momentum factor entering into the classical partition function for translation along the reaction coordinate is Here m is the mass factor associated with the reaction coordinate s We can express the rate or frequency at which such trajectories pass through the narrow region of width as with being the speed of passage cm s and being the inverse of the distance that defines the TS region So has units of s In summary we expect the rate of trajectories moving through the TS region to be However we still need to integrate this over all values of that correspond to enough energy to access the TSs energy relative to that of the reactants which we denote Moreover we have to account for the fact that it may be that not all trajectories with kinetic energy equal to or greater pass on to form product molecules some trajectories may pass through the TS but later recross the TS and return to produce reactants Moreover it may be that some trajectories with kinetic energy along the reaction coordinate less than can react by tunneling through the barrier The way we account for the fact that a reactive trajectory must have at least in energy along s is to integrate over only values of greater than To account for the fact that some trajectories with energies above may recross we include a socalled transmission coefficient k whose value is between zero and unity In the most elementary TST tunneling is ignored Putting all of these pieces together we carry out the integration over just described to obtain where the momentum is integrated from to and the scoordinate is integrated only over the small region If the transmission coefficient is factored out of the integral treating it as a multiplicative factor the integral over can be evaluated and yields the following The exponential energy dependence is usually then combined with the partition function of the TS species that reflect this species other vibrational coordinates and momenta and the reaction rate is then expressed as This implies that the rate coefficient for this bimolecular reaction is given in terms of molecular partition functions by which is the fundamental result of TST Once again we notice that ratios of partition functions per unit volume can be used to express ratios of species concentrations in number of molecules per unit volume just as appeared in earlier expressions for equilibrium constants as in Chapter The above rate expression undergoes only minor modifications when unimolecular reactions are considered For example in the hypothetical reaction via the TS one obtains where again is a partition function of A with one missing vibrational component Before bringing this discussion of TST to a close I need to stress that this theory is not exact It assumes that the reacting molecules are nearly in thermal equilibrium so it is less likely to work for reactions in which the reactant species are prepared in highly nonequilibrium conditions Moreover it ignores tunneling by requiring all reactions to proceed through the TS geometry For reactions in which a light atom ie an H or D atom is transferred tunneling can be significant so this conventional form of TST can provide substantial errors in such cases however there are straightforward approximations similar to those we discussed in Chapter that can be used to make tunneling corrections to this rate expression Nevertheless TST remains the most widely used and successful theory of chemical reaction rates and can be extended to include tunneling and other corrections as we now illustrate Variational Transition State Theory Within the TST expression for the rate constant of a bimolecular reaction or of a unimolecular reaction the height E of the barrier on the potential energy surface appears in the TS species partition function or respectively In particular the TS partition function contains a factor of the form in which the BornOppenheimer electronic energy of the TS relative to that of the reactant species appears This energy is the value of the potential energy at the TS geometry which we denote It turns out that the conventional TS approximation to overestimates reaction rates because it assumes all trajectories that cross the TS proceed onward to products unless the transmission coefficient is included to correct for this In the variational transition state theory VTST one does not evaluate the ratio of partition functions appearing in at but one first determines at what geometry S the TS partition function ie or is smallest Because this partition function is a product of i the factor as well as ii translational rotational and vibrational partition functions which depend on the value of for which this product is smallest need not be the conventional TS value What this means is that the location S along the reaction path at which the freeenergy reaches a saddle point is not the same the location where the BornOppenheimer electronic energy has its saddle This interpretation of how and differ can be appreciated by recalling that partition functions are related to the Helmholtz free energy by so determining the value of where reaches a minimum is equivalent to finding that where the free energy is at a maximum So in VTST one adjusts the dividing surface through the location of the reaction coordinate S to first find that value where has a minimum One then evaluates both and the other components of the TS species partition functions at this value Finally one then uses the expressions given above but with taken at This is how VTST computes reaction rates in a somewhat different manner than does the conventional TST As with TST the VTST in the form outlined above does not treat tunneling and the fact that not all trajectories crossing proceed to products These corrections still must be incorporated as an addon to this theory ie in the k factor for recrossing and through tunneling corrections to achieve high accuracy for reactions involving light species recall from Chapter that tunneling probabilities depend exponentially on the mass of the tunneling particle I refer the reader to the web page of Prof Don Truhlar who has been one of the pioneers of VTST for further details Reaction Path Hamiltonian Theory Let us review what the reaction path is as defined earlier in Chapter It is a path that begins at a transition state TS and evolves along the direction of negative curvature on the potential energy surface as found by identifying the eigenvector of the Hessian matrix H_jk dfracEq_kq_j that belongs to the negative eigenvalue moves further downhill along the gradient vector whose components are terminates at the geometry of either the reactants or products depending on whether one began moving away from the TS forward or backward along the direction of negative curvature The individual steps along the reaction coordinate can be labeled as they evolve from the TS to the products labeled S_P and as they evolve from reactants SR to the TS If these steps are taken in very small infinitesimal lengths they form a continuous path and a continuous coordinate that we label At any point along a reaction path the BornOppenheimer potential energy surfacef its gradient components and its Hessian components can be evaluated in terms of derivatives of with respect to the Cartesian coordinates of the molecule However when one carries out reaction path dynamics one uses a different set of coordinates for reasons that are similar to those that arise in the treatment of normal modes of vibration as given in Chapter In particular one introduces massweighted coordinates that are related to the Cartesian coordinates in the same way as we saw in Chapter The gradient and Hessian matrices along these new coordinates x_j can be evaluated in terms of the original Cartesian counterparts The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the massweighted Hessian can then be determined Upon doing so one finds zero eigenvalues whose eigenvectors describe overall rotation and translation of the molecule positive eigenvalues and eigenvectors along which the gradient has zero or nearly so components and one eigenvalue that may be positive zero or negative along whose eigenvector the gradient has its largest component The one unique direction along gives the direction of evolution of the reaction path in these massweighted coordinates All other directions ie within the space spanned by the other vectors possess nearly zero gradient component and positive curvature This means that at any point on the reaction path being discussed one is at or near a local minimum along all directions that are transverse to the reaction path direction ie the gradient direction one can move to a neighboring point on the reaction path by moving a small infinitesimal amount along the gradient In terms of the massweighted Hessians eigenmode directions and the potential energy surface can be approximated in the neighborhood of each such point on the reaction path by expanding it in powers of displacements away from this point If these displacements are expressed as components along the eigenvectors and along the gradient direction one can write the BornOppenheimer potential energy surface locally as E ES textbfgcdot textbfv_S delta S dfrac omega_S delta S sum_K N dfrac omega_K delta X_K Within this local quadratic approximation describes a sum of harmonic potentials along each of the modes transverse to the reaction path direction Along the reaction path appears with a nonzero gradient and a curvature that may be positive negative or zero The eigenmodes of the local ie in the neighborhood of any point along the reaction path massweighted Hessian decompose the internal coordinates into along which is harmonic and one along which the reaction evolves In terms of these same coordinates the kinetic energy can also be written and thus the classical Hamiltonian can be constructed Because the coordinates we use are massweighted in Cartesian form the kinetic energy contains no explicit mass factors T dfrac sum_j m_j leftfracdq_jdtright dfrac sum_j leftfracdx_jdtright This means that the momenta conjugate to each massweighted coordinate obtained in the usual way as all have identical unit mass factors associated with them To obtain the working expression for the reaction path Hamiltonian RPH one must transform the above equation for the kinetic energy by replacing the Cartesian massweighted coordinates by the eigenmode displacement coordinates the reaction path displacement coordinate and translation and rotational coordinates The three translational coordinates can be separated and ignored because centerofmass energy is conserved in further consideration The rotational coordinates do not enter into the potential but they do appear in However it is most common to ignore their effects on the dynamics that occurs in the internalcoordinates this amounts to ignoring the effects of overall centrifugal forces on the reaction dynamics We will proceed with this approximation in mind although the reader should keep in mind that doing so is an approximation that one might have to revisit in more sophisticated treatments Although it is tedious to perform the coordinate transformation of outlined above it has been done in the paper W H Miller N C Handy and J E Adams Reaction Path Hamiltonian for Polyatomic Molecules J Chem Phys and results in the following form for the RPH H sum_KN dfracp_K delta X_K omega_KS ES dfrac dfracp_S sum_KKN p_K delta X_K B_KKF where In the absence of the socalled dynamical coupling factors and this expression for describes harmonicoscillator Hamiltonian each of which has a locally defined frequency that varies along the reaction path ie is dependent a Hamiltonian for motion along the reaction coordinate with serving as the potential In this limit ie with the factors turned off the reaction dynamics can be simulated in what is termed a vibrationally adiabatic manner by placing each transverse oscillator into a quantum level that characterizes the reactants population of this mode assigning an initial momentum to the reaction coordinate that is characteristic of the collision to be simulated eg could be sampled from a MaxwellBoltzmann distribution if a thermal reaction is of interest or could be chosen equal to the mean collision energy of a beamcollision experiment timeevolving the and coordinate and momentum using the above Hamiltonian assuming that each transverse mode remains in the quantum state that it had when the reaction began The assumption that remains fixed which is why this model is called vibrationally adiabatic does not mean that the energy content of the mode remains fixed because the frequencies vary as one moves along the reaction path As a result the kinetic energy along the reaction coordinate will change both because varies along and because varies along S Lets return now to the RPH theory in which the dynamical couplings among motion along the reaction path and the modes transverse to it are included In the full RPH the terms couple modes and while couples the reaction path to mode These couplings express how energy can flow among these various degrees of freedom Explicit forms for the and factors are given in terms of the eigenvectors of the massweighted Hessian matrix as follows B_KK langle dtextbfv_KdS textbfv_Krangle B_KS langle dtextbfv_KdS textbfv_Srangle where the derivatives of the eigenvectors are usually computed by taking the eigenvectors at two neighboring points and along the reaction path In summary once a reaction path has been mapped out one can compute along this path the massweighted Hessian matrix and the potential Given these quantities all terms in the RPH are in hand This knowledge can subsequently be used to perform the propagation of a set of classical coordinates and momenta forward in time For any initial ie momenta and one can use the above form for H to propagate the coordinates and momenta forward in time In this manner one can use the RPH theory to follow the time evolution of a chemical reaction that begins with coordinates and moment characteristic of reactants under specified laboratory conditions and moves through a TS and onward to products Once time has evolved long enough for product geometries to be realized one can interrogate the values of to determine how much energy has been deposited into various productmolecule vibrations and of to see what the final kinetic energy of the product fragments is Of course one also monitors what fraction of the trajectories whose initial conditions are chosen to represent some experimental situation progress to product geometries vs returning to reactant geometries In this way one can determine the overall reaction probability Classical Dynamics Simulation of Rates One can also perform classical dynamics simulations of reactive events without using the reaction path Hamiltonian Following a procedure like that outlined in Chapter where classical condensedmedia MD simulations were discussed one can timeevolve the Newton equations of motion of the molecular reaction species using for example the Cartesian coordinates of each atom in the system and with either a BornOppenheimer surface or a parameterized functional form eg a force field Of course it is essential that whatever function one uses must be able to accurately describe the reactive surface especially near the transition state recall that may force fields do not do so because they do not account for bond breaking and forming With each such coordinate having an initial velocity and an initial value one then uses Newtons equations written for a time step of duration to propagate and forward in time according for example to the following firstorder propagation formula or using the Verlet algorithm described in Chapter Here m_q is the mass factor connecting the velocity dqdt and the momentum p_q conjugate to the coordinate q and is the force along the coordinate at the initial geometry By applying the timepropagation process one generates a set of new coordinates and new velocities appropriate to the system at time Using these new coordinates and momenta as and and evaluating the forces at these new coordinates one can again use the Newton equations to generate another finitetimestep set of new coordinates and velocities Through the sequential application of this process one generates a sequence of coordinates and velocities that simulate the systems dynamical behavior In using this kind of classical trajectory approach to study chemical reactions it is important to choose the initial coordinates and momenta in a way that is representative of the experimental conditions that one is attempting to simulate The tools of statistical mechanics discussed in Chapter guide us in making these choices and allow us efficient methods eg the Monte Carlo technique for sampling such initial values When one attempts for example to simulate the reactive collisions of an A atom with a BC molecule to produce AB C it is not appropriate to consider a single classical or quantal collision between A and BC Why Because in any laboratory setting The A atoms are probably moving toward the BC molecules with a distribution of relative speeds That is within the sample of molecules which likely contains or more molecules some A BC pairs have low relative kinetic energies when they collide and others have higher relative kinetic energies There is a probability distribution for this relative kinetic energy that must be properly sampled in choosing the initial conditions The BC molecules may not all be in the same rotational or vibrational state There is a probability distribution function describing the fraction of BC molecules that are in a particular state and a particular state An ensemble of initial values of the BC molecules internal vibrational coordinate and momentum as well as its orientation and rotational angular momentum must be selected to represent this When the A and BC molecules collide with a relative motion velocity vector they do not all hit head on Some collisions have small impact parameter the closest distance from A to the center of mass of BC if the collision were to occur with no attractive or repulsive forces and some have large values see Figure The probability function for these impact parameters is which is simply a statement of the geometrical fact that larger values have more geometrical volume element than smaller values Figure Coordinates needed to characterize an atomdiatom collision showing the impact parameter b So to simulate the entire ensemble of collisions that occur between A atoms and BC molecules in various states and having various relative kinetic energies and impact parameters b one must run classical trajectories or quantum propagations for a large number of and values with each such trajectory assigned an overall weighting or importance factor of After such an ensemble of trajectories representative of an experimental condition has been carried out one has available a great deal of data This data includes knowledge of what fraction of the trajectories produced final geometries characteristic of products so the net reaction probability can be calculated In addition the kinetic and potential energy content of the internal vibrational and rotational modes of the product molecules can be interrogated and used to compute histograms giving probabilities for observing products in these states This is how classical dynamics simulations allow us to study chemical reactions andor energy transfer RRKM Theory Another theory that is particularly suited for studying unimolecular decomposition reactions is named after the four scientists who developed it Rice Ramsperger Kassel and Marcus To use this theory one imagines an ensemble of molecules that have been activated to a state in which they possess a specified total amount of internal energy of which an amount exists as rotational energy and the remainder as internal vibrational energy The mechanism by which the molecules become activated could involve collisions or photochemistry It does not matter as long as enough time has passed to permit one to reasonably assume that these molecules have the energy distributed randomly among all their internal vibrational degrees of freedom When considering thermally activated unimolecular decomposition of a molecule the implications of such assumptions are reasonably clear For photochemically activated unimolecular decomposition processes one usually also assumes that the molecule has undergone radiationless relaxation and returned to its ground electronic state but in a quite vibrationally hot situation That is in this case the molecule contains excess vibrational energy equal to the energy of the optical photon used to excite it Finally when applied to bimolecular reactions one assumes that collision between the two fragments results in a longlived complex The lifetime of this intermediate must be long enough to allow the energy which is related to the fragments collision energy to be randomly distributed among all vibrational modes of the collision complex For bimolecular reactions that proceed directly ie without forming a longlived intermediate one does not employ RRKMtype theories because their primary assumption of energy randomization almost certainly would not be valid in such cases The RRKM expression of the unimolecular rate constant for activated molecules A ie either a longlived complex formed in a bimolecular collision or a hot molecule dissociating to products through a transition state A rightarrow TS rightarrow P is k_rm rate dfracGEE_ E_rm rotNEE_rm roth Here the total energy is related to the energies of the activated molecules by E E_rm rot E_rm vib where is the rotational energy of the activated molecule and is the vibrational energy of this molecule This same energy must of course appear in the transition state where it is decomposed as an amount needed to move from A to the TS ie the energy needed to reach the barrier and vibrational translational along the reaction coordinate and rotational energies E E_ E_rm vib E_rm trans E_rm rot In the rate coefficient expression is the total sum of internal vibrational quantum states that the transition state possesses having energies up to and including This energy is the total energy but with the activation energy removed and the overall rotational energy of the TS removed The quantity is the density of internal vibrational quantum states excluding the mode describing the reaction coordinate that the activated molecule possesses having an energy between and In this expression the energy is the total energy with the rotational energy of the activated species removed In the most commonly employed version of RRKM theory the rotational energies of the activated molecules and of the TS are assumed to be related by Here and are the average taken over the three eigenvalues of the moment inertia tensors moments of inertia of the activated molecules and TS species respectively The primary assumption embodied in the above relationship is that the rotational angular momenta of the activated and TS species are the same so their rotational energies can be related as expressed in the equation to changes in geometries as reflected in their moments of inertia Because RRKM theory assumes that the vibrational energy is randomly distributed its fundamental rate coefficient equation k_rm rate dfracGEE_ E_rm rot NEE_rm roth depends on the total energy the energy required to access the TS and the amount of energy contained in the rotational degrees of freedom that is thus not available to the vibrations To implement a RRKM rate coefficient calculation one must know the total energy available the barrier energy the geometries and hence the moments of inertia and of the activated molecules and of the TS respectively the rotational energy of the activated molecules as well as all vibrational energies of the activated molecules and all vibrational energies of the TS ie excluding the reaction coordinate The rotational energy of the TS species can then be related to that of the activated molecules through E_rm rot E_rm rot E_rm rot left fracIIright To simulate an experiment in which the activated molecules have a thermal distribution of rotational energies the RRKM rate constant is computed for a range of values and then averaged over using the thermal Boltzmann population as a weighting factor This can be carried out for example using the MC process for selecting rotational values This then produces a rate constant for any specified total energy E Alternatively to simulate experiments in which the activated species are formed in bimolecular collisions at a specified energy the RRKM rate coefficient is computed for a range of values with each related to the collisional impact parameter that we discussed earlier In that case the collisional angular momentum is given as where is the relative collision speed related to the collision energy and m is the reduced mass of the two colliding fragments Again using E_rm rot E_rm rot E_rm rot left fracIIright the TS rotational energy can be related to that of the activated species Finally the RRKM rate coefficient is evaluated by averaging the result over a series of impact parameters each of which implies a value and thus an with as the weighting factor he evaluation of the sum of states and the density of states that appear in the RRKM expression is usually carried out using a statecounting algorithm such as that implemented by Beyer and Swinehart in Commun Assoc Comput Machin This algorithm uses knowledge of the harmonic vibrational frequencies of the activated molecules and the frequencies of the TS and determines how many ways a given amount of energy can be distributed among these modes By summing over all such distributions for energy varying from zero to the algorithm determines GE By taking the difference it determines Professor Bill Hase has been one of the early pioneers involved in applying RRKM theory to chemical processes Correlation Function Expressions for Rates Recall from Chapter that rates of photon absorption can in certain circumstances be expressed either in terms of squares of transition dipole matrix elements connecting each initial state to each final state textbfE_ cdot langle Phi_f boldsymbolmu Phi_i rangle or in terms of the equilibrium average of the product of a transition dipole vector at time dotted into this same vector at another time sum_i rho_i langle Phi_i textbfE_ cdot boldsymbolmu textbfE_ boldsymbolmu t Phi_i rangle That is these rates can be expressed either in a statetostate manner or in a timedependent correlation function framework In Chapter this same correlation function approach was examined further In an analogous fashion it is possible to express chemical reaction rate constants in a timedomain language again using time correlation functions The TST or VTST and RRKM expressions for the rate constant all involve through the partition functions or state densities the reactant and transitionstate energy levels and degeneracies These theories are therefore analogs of the statetostate photonabsorption rate equations To make the connection between the statetostate and timecorrelation function expressions one can begin with a classical expression for the rate constant given below Here is the partition function of the reactant species L is the number of coordinates and momenta upon which the Hamiltonian depends and is The flux factor and the reaction probability are defined in terms of a dividing surface which could for example be a plane perpendicular to the reaction coordinate and located along the reaction path that was discussed earlier in this Chapter in Section Points on such a surface can be defined by specifying one condition that the L coordinates qj must obey and we write this condition as Points lying where are classified as lying in the reactant region of coordinate space while those lying where are in the product region For example if the dividing surface is defined as being a plane perpendicular to the reaction path the function f can be written as Here is the reaction coordinate which of course depends on all of the variables and is the value of at the dividing surface If the dividing surface is placed at the transition state on the energy surface vanishes because the transition state is then by convention the origin of the reaction coordinate So now we see how the dividing surface can be defined but how are the flux and probability c constructed The flux factor is defined in terms of the dividing surface function as follows deltaftextbfq sum_j dfracfq_j dfracdq_jdt Here is the Heaviside step function if if whose derivative is the Dirac delta function and the other identities follow by using the chain rule When the dividing surface is defined in terms of the reaction path coordinate as introduced earlier ie the factor sum_j dfracfq_j dfracdq_jdt contains only one term when the L coordinates are chosen as in the reaction path theory to be the reaction coordinate and L coordinates perpendicular to the reaction path For such a choice one obtains sum_j dfracfq_j dfracdq_jdt fracdSdt dfracP_Sm_S where is the momentum along and is the mass factor associated with in the reaction path Hamiltonian So in this case the total flux factor reduces to We have seen exactly this construct before in Section where the TST expression for the rate coefficient was developed The reaction probability factor is defined in terms of those trajectories that evolve at long time onto the product side of the dividing surface such trajectories obey ctextbfptextbfq lim_t rightarrow infty hfqt This longtime limit can in turn be expressed in a form where the flux factor again occurs In this expression the flux pertains to coordinates and momenta at Because of time reversibility the integral can be extended to range from until t infty Using the expressions for c and for as developed above in the equation for the rate coefficient given at the beginning of this Section allows the rate coefficient to be rewritten as follows In this form the rate constant appears as an equilibrium average represented by the integral over the initial values of the variables and with the weighting factor of the time correlation function of the flux To evaluate the rate constant in this timedomain framework for a specific chemical reaction one would proceed as follows Run an ensemble of trajectories whose initial coordinates and momenta are selected eg using MonteCarlo methods discussed in Chapter from a distribution with as its weighting factor Make sure that the initial coordinates lie on the dividing surface because the flux expression contains the factor Monitor each trajectory to observe when it again crosses the dividing surface ie when again obeys at which time the quantity can be evaluated as Ftextbfptextbfq deltaftextbfq sum_j dfracfq_j dfracdq_jdt using the coordinates and momenta at time to compute these quantities Using a planar dividing surface attached to the reaction path at as noted earlier allows to be calculated in terms of the initial momentum lying along the reaction path direction as and permits to be computed when the trajectory again crosses this surface at at time as So all that is really needed if the dividing surface is defined in this manner is to start trajectories with to keep track of the initial momentum along to determine at what times the trajectory returns to and to form the product for each such time It is in this manner that one can compute fluxflux correlation functions and thus the rate coefficient Notice that trajectories that undergo surface recrossings contribute negative terms to the fluxflux correlation function computed as discussed above That is a trajectory with a positive initial value of can at some later time t cross the dividing surface with a negative value of ie be directed back toward reactants This recrossing will contribute a negative value via the product to the total correlation function which integrates over all times Of course if this same trajectory later undergoes yet another crossing of the dividing surface at t with positive it will contribute a positive term to the correlation function via Thus the correlation function approach to computing the rate coefficient can properly account for surface recrossings unlike the TST which requires one to account for such effects in the transmission coefficient k Wave Packet Propagation The discussions in Chapters and should have made it clear that it is very difficult to timepropagate wave functions rigorously using quantum mechanics On the other hand to propagate a classical trajectory is relatively straightforward In addition to the semiclassical tools introduced in Chapter there is another powerful tool that allows one to retain much of the computational ease and convenient interpretation of the classical trajectory approach while also incorporating quantum effects that are appropriate under certain circumstances In this wave packet propagation approach one begins with a quantum mechanical wave function that is characterized by two parameters specifying the average value of the position and of the momentum along each coordinate One then propagates not the quantum wave function but the values of these two parameters which one assumes will evolve according to Newtonian dynamics Lets see how these steps are taken in more detail and try to understand when such an approach is expected to work or to fail First the form of the socalled wave packet quantum function is written as follows Here we have a total of N coordinates that we denote It is these coordinates that the quantum wave function depends upon The total wave function is a product of terms one for each coordinate Notice that this wave function has two distinct ways in which the coordinate appear First it has a Gaussian spatial dependence centered at the values and having Gaussian width factors related to This dependence tends to make the wave functions amplitude largest when is close to Secondly it has a form that looks like the travelling wave that we encountered in Chapter in which the coordinate moves with momentum So these wave packet functions have built into them characteristics that allow them to describe motion via the of an amplitude that is centered at with a width given by the parameter In this approach to chemical dynamics we assume the parameters and will undergo classical time evolution according to the Newton equations where is the potential energy surface BornOppenheimer or force field upon which we wish to propagate the wave packet and is the mass associated with coordinate For the form of the wave function given above the and parameters can be shown to be the expectation values of the coordinates and momenta P_J int Y i hbardfracq_J Y dq Moreover the parameter appearing in the Gaussian part of the function can be shown to equal the dispersion or spread of this wave function along the coordinate There is an important characteristic of the above Gaussian wave packet functions that we need to point out It turns out that functions of the form can be shown to have uncertainties in and in whose product is as small as possible The proof that the wave packet form of the wave function has the smallest uncertainty product is given in the text book Quantum Mechanics rd ed L I Schiff McGrawHill New York The Heisenberg uncertainty relation which is discussed in many texts dealing with quantum mechanics says that this product of coordinate and momentum dispersions must be greater than or equal to In a sense the Gaussian wave packet function is the most classical function that one can have because its uncertainty product is as small as possible ie equals We say this is the most classical possible quantum function because in classical mechanics both the coordinate and the momentum can be known precisely So whatever quantum wave function allows these two variables to be least uncertain is the most classical To use wave packet propagation to simulate a chemical dynamics event one begins with a set of initial classical coordinates and momenta as well as a width or uncertainty for each coordinate Each width must be chosen to represent the range of that coordinate in the experiment that is to be simulated For example assume one were to represent the dynamics of a wave function that is prepared by photon absorption of a vibrational state of the HCl molecule from the ground S state to an excitedstate energy surface Such a situation is described qualitatively in Figure In this case one could choose to be the half width of the harmonic or Morse oscillator wave function of HCl and take because this is the average value of the momentum for and the equilibrium bond length For such initial conditions classical Newtonian dynamics would then be used to propagate the and In the HCl example introduced above this propagation would be performed using the excitedstate energy surface for since for the molecule is assumed to be on this surface The total energy at which the initial wave packet it delivered to the upper surface would be dictated by the energy of the photon used to perform the excitation In Figure two such examples are shown Once the packet is on the upper surface its position and momentum begin to change according to the Newton equations This in turn causes the packet to move as shown for several equally spaced time steps in Figure for the two different photons cases At such subsequent times the quantum wave function is then assumed within this model to be given by That is it is taken to be of the same form as the initial wave function but to have simply moved its center from to with a momentum that has changed from to Figure Propagation of wave packet prepared by absorption of two different photons It should be noticed that the time evolution of the wave packet shown in Figure displays clear classical behavior For example as time evolves it moves to large Rvalues and its speed as evidenced by the spacings between neighboring packets for equal time steps is large when the potential is low and small when the potential is higher As we learned in Chapter the time correlation function can be used to extract spectral information by Fourier transformation For the HCl example considered here this correlation function will be large at but will decay in magnitude as the wave packet moves to the right at t t etc because its overlap with becomes smaller and smaller as time evolves This decay in will occur more rapidly for the highenergy photon case because moves to the right more quickly because the classical momentum grows more rapidly These dynamics will induce exponential decays in ie will vary as at short times In fact the decay of discussed above produces when is Fourier transformed the primary characteristic of the correlation function for the higherenergy photon case where dissociation ultimately occurs In such photodissociation spectra one observes a Lorentzian line shape whose width is characterized by the decay rate which in turn relates to the total energy of the packet and the steepness of the excitedstate surface This steepness determines how fast grows which then determines how fast the HCl bond fragments In the lowerenergy photon case shown in Figure a qualitatively different behavior occurs in and thus in the spectrum The packets movement to larger causes to initially undergo decay However as the packet moves to its largeR turning point shortly after time it strikes the outer wall of the surface where it is reflected Subsequently it undergoes motion to smaller R eventually returning to its initial value of R Such recurrences which occur on time scales that we denote are characteristic of bound motion in contrast to the directly dissociative motion discussed earlier This recurrence will cause to again achieve a large amplitude but will subsequently again undergo decay as the packet once again departs Clearly the correlation function will display a series of recurrences followed by exponential decays The frequency of the recurrences is determined by the frequency with which the packet traverses from its inner to outer turning points and back again which is proportional to This of course is the vibrational period of the HCl bond So in such boundmotion cases the spectrum ie the Fourier transform of Ct will display a series of peaks spaced by with the envelope of such peaks having a width determined by In more complicated multimode cases eg in molecules containing several coordinates the periodic motion of the wave packet usually shows another feature that we have not yet discussed Let us for simplicity consider a case in which only two coordinates are involved For the wave packet to return to or near its initial location enough time must pass for both coordinates to have undergone an excursion to their turning points and back For example consider the situation in which one coordinates vibrational frequency is ca cm and the others is cm these two modes then require ca ps and ps respectively to undergo one complete oscillation At the wave packet which is a product of two packets one for each mode produces a large Ct After ps the first modes coordinate has returned to its initial location but the second mode is only of the way along in its periodic motion Moreover after ps the second modes coordinate has returned to near where it began but now the first mode has moved away So at both ps and ps the correlation function will not be large because one of the mode contribution to will be small However after ps both modes coordinates will be in positions to produce a large value of Ct the highfrequency mode will have undergone oscillations and the lowerfrequency mode will have undergone oscillations My point in discussing this example is to illustrate that molecules having many coordinates can produce spectra that display rather complicated patterns but which in principle can be related to the time evolution of these coordinates using the correlation functions connection to the spectrum Of course there are problems that arise in using the wave packet function to describe the time evolution of a molecule or any system that should be treated using quantum mechanics One of the most important limitations of the wave packet approach to be aware of relates to it inability to properly treat wave reflections It is well know that when a wave strikes a hard wall it is reflected by the wall However when for example a water wave moves suddenly from a region of deep water to a much more shallow region one observes both a reflected and a transmitted wave In the discussion of tunneling resonances given in Chapter we also encountered reflected and transmitted waves Furthermore when a wave strikes a barrier that has two or more holes or openings in it one observes wave fronts coming out of these openings The problem with the most elementary form of wave packets presented above is that each packet contains only one piece It therefore can not break into two or more pieces as it for example reflects from turning points or passes through barriers with holes Because such wave packets can not fragment into two or more packets that subsequently undergo independent dynamical evolution they are not able to describe dynamical processes that require multiplefragmentation events It is primarily for this reason that wave packet approaches to simulating dynamics are usually restricted to treating shorttime dynamics where such fragmentation of the wave packet is less likely to occur Prompt molecular photodissociation processes such as we discussed above is a good example of such a shorttime phenomenon There have been many refinements of the wave packet approach described above some of which are designed to allow for splitting of the wave function I refer the reader to the work of one of the pioneers of the timedependent wave packet approach Prof Eric Heller for more information on this subject Surface Hopping Dynamics There are of course chemical reactions and energytransfer collisions in which two or more BornOppenheimer BO energy surfaces are involved Under such circumstances it is essential to have available the tools needed to describe the coupled electronic and nuclearmotion dynamics appropriate to this situation The way this problem is addressed is by returning to the Schrödinger equation before the singlesurface BO approximation was made and expressing the electronic wave function which depends on the electronic coordinates and the nuclear coordinates as Here can be the BO electronic wave function belonging to the electronic state in which case we say we are using an adiabatic basis of electronic states The are amplitudes that will relate to the probability that the system is on the energy surface Next we assume that the coordinates of the nuclei undergo classical motion in a manner to be specified in further detail below that allows us to know their locations and velocities or momenta at any time This assumption implies that the time dependence of the above wave function is carried in the time dependence of the coordinates as well as in the amplitudes We next substitute this expansion into the timedependent Schrödinger equation where is the electronic Hamiltonian which depends on the nuclear coordinates and thus on the time variable We then multiply the resultant equation on the left by one of the wave functions and integrate over the electronic coordinates to obtain an equation for the amplitudes Here is the electronic Hamiltonian matrix element that couples to This set of coupled differential equations for the amplitudes can be solved numerically by for example starting at with and and propagating the amplitudes values forward in time The next step is to express using the chain rule in terms of derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates and the time rate of change of these coordinates So now the equations for the read as follows The are called nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements for each pair of states and they are a vector in the space of the nuclear coordinates and it is their magnitudes that play a central role in determining the efficiency of surface hoppings Below we will make use of the following symmetry property of these quantities which derive from the orthogonality of the These matrix elements are becoming more commonly available in widely utilized quantum chemistry and dynamics computer packages although their efficient evaluation remains a challenge that is undergoing significant study Qualitatively one can expect a coupling to be large if motion along a coordinate causes an orbital occupied in to be distorted in a manner that would produce significant overlap with an orbital in If the electronic functions appearing in the equations are BO eigenfunctions the offdiagonal elements vanish and the diagonal elements are the BO energy levels In this case only the terms involving generate transitions between surfaces On the other hand if one chooses electronic functions that have vanishing values only the terms induce transitions among surfaces The latter case is said to involve using diabatic wave functions while the former involves adiabatic wave functions For the remainder of this discussion I will assume we are making use of adiabatic ie BO wave functions but I will carry through the derivation in a manner that will allow either adiabatic or diabatic functions to be used Because one is eventually interested in the populations for being in various electronic states it is common to recast the above equations for the amplitudes into equations for socalled density matrix elements The diagonal elements of the matrix are the state probabilities while the offdiagonal elements contain information about the phases of the complex quantities So in place of the equations for the one can use the following equations for the Setting it is then possible to derive an equation for the time evolution of the diagonal elements of the density matrix where In addition to calculating amplitudes the probabilities then being computed as one often needs to identify using perhaps the kind of strategy discussed in Chapter the seam at which the surfaces of interest intersect This helps focus attention on those geometries near which a surface hop is most likely to occur To utilize the most basic form of surface hopping theory one proceeds as follows One begins with initial values of the nuclear coordinates and their velocities that properly characterize the kind of collision or reaction one wishes to simulate Of course one has to utilize an ensemble of trajectories with initial conditions chosen to properly describe such an experimental situation In addition one specifies which electronic surface say the surface the system is initially on For each such set of initial conditions one propagates a classical trajectory describing the time evolution of the Ra and dRadt on this initial surface As one is propagating the classical trajectory one also propagates the coupled differential equations for the density matrix elements with the nuclei moving on the energy surface After each timepropagation step of duration one evaluates the quantity shown above these elements give estimates for the rate of change of the population of the state due to transitions to other states from which one computes These quantities control the fractional change in the probability of being on the surface due to transitions from state into state They are used as follows A random number is chosen If a hop to surface is allowed to occur otherwise no hop occurs and the system remains to continue its time evolution on surface K If a hop occurs the coordinates and momenta are allowed to now propagate on the energy surface where the forces will of course be different but with one change The component of the velocity vector along the nonadiabatic coupling vector is modified to allow for the fact that the systems electronic energy has suddenly changed from to which must be compensated for by a change in the kinetic energy of the nuclei so that total energy is conserved If this results in an increase in speed if it produces a decrease in speed In the latter case if lies considerably below it might turn out that there is just not enough total energy to access the surface in this case the hop is not allowed to occur Following the above decision about allowing the hop and adjusting the speed along the direction of the vector the trajectory is then continued with the system now propagating on the or surface and the differential equations involving continue to be propagated with no changes other than the fact the nuclei may or may not be evolving on a different surface The entire process is repeated until the trajectory reaches termination eg a reaction or quenching is observed or some specified time limit is reached at which time one can probe the properties of the products as reflected in the coordinates and velocities of the nuclei Carrying out surface hopping trajectories for an ensemble of trajectories with initial conditions representative of an experiment generates an ensemble of final values ie at the end of each trajectory whose averages can be used to estimate the overall probability of ending up in the electronic state The algorithm discussed above is the socalled fewestswitches method detailed in J C Tully J Chem Phys pioneered by Prof John Tully This surfacehopping algorithm remains one of the most widely used approaches to treating such coupledstate dynamics LandauZener Surface Jumps There is a simplified version of the surface hopping procedure just discussed that is often used when one has two electronic surfaces that intersect in a region of space that i is energetically accessible in the experiment being simulated and ii can be located and characterized eg in terms of its coordinates and energy gradients in a computationally feasible manner To illustrate we again consider the case of Al interacting with whose potential energy surfaces are reproduced below from Figure c Figure a Depiction of the and BornOppenheimer surfaces arising when combines with to form With the LandauZener model described in this Section trajectories are propagated on one energy surface until a point on or very near the seam denoted in Figure a is encountered at which time an equation giving the probability of undergoing a jump to the other surface is invoked It is the purpose of this Section to derive and explain this LandauZener equation In Chapter we learned that the rates of transitions from one state labeled to another labeled can sometimes be expressed in terms of matrix elements of the perturbation connecting the two states as follows Because the coupling matrix elements have units of energy and the function has units of inverse frequency the rate expression clearly has units of In the rate equation is the energy of the transition induced by light of energy and is the perturbation due to the electric dipole operator These photoninduced rates can be viewed as relating to transitions between two surfaces that cross i one surface being that of the initial state plus a photon of energy and ii the second being that of the final state with no photon In this point of view the photon lifts the lowerenergy state upward in energy until it crosses the upper state and then the dipole operator effects the transition Making analogy with the photonabsorption case we consider expressing the rates of transitions between an initial state consisting of an electronic state multiplied by a state describing the initial vibrational including interfragment collisional and rotational state of the system a final state consisting of the product of another electronic and vibrationrotation state as follows That is we use the same golden rule rate expression but with no photon energy needed to cause the two surfaces to intersect Next we use the identity to write which can be substituted into our rate expression to obtain rm Ratefracpiint_inftyinftyexpBigfracivarepsilon_fvarepsilon_ithbarBig dfracpi langle Psi_fchi_fRvrPsi_ichi_iRrangle langle Psi_fchi_fRvrPsi_ichi_iRrangle hbardt Defining two nuclearmotion Hamiltonian one for each BO surface and assuming that the nuclearmotion wave functions obey this expression becomes In the expression the elements of for our surfacejumping problem would involve either the electronic Hamiltonian couplings if one uses a diabatic basis or the nonadiabatic coupling elements if one used a BO adiabatic basis In either case these elements are functions of the nuclear coordinates and thus do not commute with the differential operators appearing in As a result the operator combination must be handled carefully eg as one does in the coupledcluster expansion treated in Chapter by expanding the exponential operators and keeping track of the fact that not all terms commute The lowestorder term in the expansion of this combination of operators is which yields the approximation I now want to pursue Using this approximation in our expression for the rate of surface jumping transitions gives We now use to write the rate as where we define the electronic transition integrals in shorthand as Because of the energyconserving dfunction we can actually simplify this expression even further by summing over the complete set of the finalstates vibrationrotation functions and making use of the completeness relation to obtain This expression can be seen to have units of s since the delta function has units of inverse energy and each electronic coupling integral has units of energy In the above rate expression we see a dfunction that limits the integration to only those geometries for which these are the geometries that lie on the intersection seam Any geometry can be expressed in terms of the geometry of the point on the seam closest to plus a displacement of magnitude along the unit vector normal to the seam at point If we now expand the energy difference in a Taylor series about the point lying on the seam we obtain The gradient of the potential difference has zero components within the subspace of the seam its only nonvanishing component lies along the normal vector Now using the function can be expressed as with the factor constraining the integral to lie within the seam This result can be interpreted as follows gives the probability density for being at a point on the seam this factor has units of lengthN gives the rate of transitions from one surface to the other at the point on the seam this factor has units of length times s The factor has units of length N so the entire expression has units of s as it should In this form the rate expression can be used by i sampling eg using Monte Carlo over as much of the seam as is energetically accessible using the initialstate spatial probability density as a weighting factor and ii forming the sampling average of the rate quantity computed for each accepted geometry There is another way to utilize the above rate expression If we think of a swarm of trajectories ie an ensemble representative of the experiment of interest and ask what is the rate at which trajectories pass through a narrow region of thickness at a point on the seam we could write where gives the probability density for a trajectory being at the point on the seam and lying within a distance along the direction normal to the seam The quantity is the component of the velocity along with which the system moves through the seam divided by the thickness This ratio gives the inverse of the time the system spends within the thin region or equivalently the frequency of passing through the thin strip of the seam at S The quantity is the volume element whose units cancel those of If we multiply this rate at which trajectories pass through by the probability that a surface jump will occur and integrate over the entire seam space we can express the rate at which the trajectories will undergo jumps If we divide this rate by the number of trajectories to produce the average rate per trajectory and compare this expression to the rate we derived earlier we see that they would be equivalent if the probability of a surface jump were given by The above expression for the probability of jumping from to is known as the LandauZener LZ formula The way it is used in most applications is as follows An ensemble of classical trajectories with initial coordinates and momenta selected to represent an experimental condition are run on the potential energy surface Whenever any trajectory passes very close to an intersection seam between and another surface the seam geometry nearest to is determined and the gradient of the energy difference is evaluated at In addition the component of the velocity along the direction of this gradient is computed The electronic coupling matrix elements between the two states are evaluated at S and the above formula is used to estimate the probability of a surface jump In most applications of LZ theory the electronic states in the region of a crossing seam are taken to be diabatic states because then the coupling matrix elements can be taken from the splitting between the two adiabatic states that undergo an avoided crossing near rather than by evaluating nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements between adiabatic BO states In summary the LZ expression for the probability of a surface jump should be viewed as an approximate version of the algorithm provided by the fewestswitches surface hopping approach discussed earlier Before closing this Section it is useful to point out how this formula applies to two distinct cases If as suggested in Figure b a molecule is prepared eg by photon absorption in an excited electronic state the upper blue curve that undergoes a crossing with a dissociative electronic state the green curve one may wish to estimate the rate of the process called predissociation in which the excited molecule jumps to the dissociative surface and falls apart This rate is often computed by multiplying the frequency at which the excited molecule passes through the curve crossing by the LZ estimate of the surface jumping probability P with computed as discussed above and usually being equal to the vibrational frequency of the bond whose stretching generates the curve crossing igure b Qualitative depiction of predissociation that can occur from an excited blue surface onto a dissociative green surface Alternatively one may be interested in determining the probability that the fragment species atoms in Figure b collide on the green curve and undergo a transition to the upper blue curve as a result of this collision For example prompt fluorescence from this upper blue curve might be the experimental signature one wishes to simulate In this case the outcome ie generation of the molecule in the upper blue curves electronic state can occur in either of two ways a The system collides on the green curve and undergoes a surface jump at the crossing thus ending up on the blue surface from which it promptly fluoresces this process has a probability computed using the LZ formula b The system collides on the green curve and does not jump to the blue curve at the crossing but remains on the green curve this has probability until it reaches the turning point After reflecting off the turning point the system still on the green curve jumps to the blue curve this has probability when it again reaches the crossing after which prompt fluorescence occurs The overall probability for this path is So the total yield of fluorescence would be related to the quantity The point of these two examples is that the LZ formula gives an estimate of the jump probability for a given crossing event one still needs to think about how various crossing events relate to the particular experiment at hand Contributors and Attributions Jack
