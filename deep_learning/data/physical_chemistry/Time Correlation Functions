Time Correlation Functions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah Contributors and Attributions One of the most active research areas in statistical mechanics involves the evaluation of socalled equilibrium time correlation functions such as we encountered in Chapter The correlation function is defined in terms of two physical operators and a time dependence that is carried by a Hamiltonian via and an equilibrium average over a Boltzmann population The quantum mechanical expression for is while the classical mechanical expression here we allow the factor that occurs in the partition function shown in Section to be canceled out in the numerator and denominator for simplicity is where and are the values of all the coordinates and momenta of the system at and and are their values according to Newtonian mechanics at time As shown above an example of a time correlation function that relates to molecular spectroscopy is the dipoledipole correlation function that we discussed in Chapter for which and are both the electric dipole interaction between the photons electric field whose direction is characterized by the vector and the molecules dipole operator The Fourier transform of this particular relates to the absorption intensity for light of frequency It turns out that many physical properties eg absorption line shapes Raman scattering intensities and transport coefficients eg diffusion coefficients viscosity can be expressed in terms of timecorrelation functions It is beyond the scope of this text to go much further in this direction so I will limit my discussion to the optical spectroscopy case at hand which requires that we now discuss how the timeevolution aspect of this problem is dealt with The text Statistical Mechanics D A McQuarrie Harper and Row New York has a nice treatment of such other correlation functions so the reader is directed to that text for further details The computation of correlation functions involves propagating either wave functions or classical trajectories which produce the qt values entering into the expression for In the classical case one carries out a large number of Newtonian trajectories with initial coordinates and momenta chosen to represent the equilibrium condition of the molecule system For example one could use the MC method to select these variables employing as the probability function for accepting or rejecting initial and values In this case the weighting function contains not just the potential energy but also the kinetic energy and thus the total Hamiltonian because now we need to also select proper initial values for the momenta So with many eg M selections of the initial and variables of the molecules being made one would allow the Newton dynamics of each set of initial conditions to proceed During each such trajectory one would monitor the initial value of the property and the time progress of the property One would then compute the MC average to obtain the correlation function Where the index labels the accepted configurations and momenta of the MC sampling In the quantum case the time propagation is especially challenging and is somewhat beyond the scope of this text However I want to give you some idea of the steps that are involved realizing that this remains an area of very active research development As noted in Section it is possible to timepropagate a wave function that is known at if one is able to expand in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian However for systems comprised of many molecules which are most common in statistical mechanics studies it is impossible to compute or realistically approximate these eigenfunctions Thus it is not productive to try to express in terms of these eigenfunctions Therefore an entirely new set of tools has been introduced to handle timepropagation in the quantum case and it is these new devices that I now attempt to describe in a manner much like we saw in Section s discussion of time propagation of wave functions To illustrate consider the time propagation issue contained in the quantum definition of shown above One is faced with propagating from up to time using and then acting with the operator acting with the operator on and then propagating from up to time using then requires that these two timepropagated functions be multiplied together and integrated over the coordinates that depends on The operator that also appears in the definition of can be combined for example with the first time propagation step and actually handled as part of the time propagation as follows The latter expression can be viewed as involving a propagation in complex time from to Although having a complex time may seem unusual as I will soon point out it turns out that it can have a stabilizing influence on the success of these tools for computing quantum correlation functions Much like we saw earlier in Section socalled Feynman path integral techniques can be used to carry out the above time propagations One begins by dividing the time interval into discrete steps this can be the real time interval or the complex interval The number will eventually be taken to be large so each time step has a small magnitude This fact allows us to use approximations to the exponential operator appearing in the propagator that are valid only for short time steps For each of these short time steps one then approximates the propagator in the most commonly used socalled split symmetric form Here and are the potential and kinetic energy operators that appear in It is possible to show that the above approximation is valid up to terms of order So for short times ie small these symmetric split operator approximation to the propagator should be accurate The time evolved wave function can then be expressed as The potential is except when external magnetic fields are present a function only of the coordinates of the system while the kinetic term is a function of the momenta assuming Cartesian coordinates are used By making use of the completeness relations for eigenstates of the coordinate operator int dq q_jrangle langle q_jlabel and inserting this identity times once between each combination of factors the expression given above for can be rewritten as follows Phiq_P t int dq_P dq_P dq_ dq_ prod_jP expbig fracidelta t hbarVq_j Vq_jbig langle q_j expbigfraci delta tThbarbig q_jrangle Phiq_ Then by using the analogous completeness identity for the momentum operator one can write Finally by using the fact recall this from Section that the momentum eigenfunctions when expressed as functions of coordinates are given by langle q_jp rangle fracsqrtpi expbigfracipqhbarbig the above integral becomes This integral over can be carried out analytically to give When substituted back into the multidimensional integral for we obtain or Phiq_P t leftfracmpi ihbar delta trightP int dq_P dq_P dq_ dq_ expBigsum_jP big fracidelta t hbarVq_j Vq_j fraci mq_j q_j hbar delta tbigBig Fq_ Recall what we said earlier that the time correlation function was to be computed by propagating from up to time using and then acting with the operator B acting with the operator on and then propagating from up to time using multiplying together these two functions and integrating over the coordinates that depends on So all of the effort described above would have to be expended for taken to be after which the result would be multiplied by the operator B as well as for taken to be to allow the quantum time correlation function to be evaluated These steps can be performed but they are very difficult to implement so I will refer the student to Computer Simulations of Liquids M P Allen and D J Tildesley Oxford U Press New York for further discussion on this topic Why are the multidimensional integrals of the form shown above called path integrals Because the sequence of positions describes a path connecting to By integrating over all of the intermediate positions for any given and one is integrating over all paths that connect to Further insight into the meaning of the above is gained by first realizing that fracmdelta t q_j q_j fracmdelta t q_j q_j delta t int T dt is the finitedifference representation within the discrete time steps of length dt of the integral of Tdt over the jth time step and that is the representation of the integral of over the jth time step So for any particular path ie any specific set of values the sum over all such terms represents the integral over all time from until of the socalled Lagrangian This time integral of the Lagrangian is called the action in classical mechanics recall that in Chapter we used quantization of the action in the particleinabox problem Hence the Ndimensional integral in terms of which is expressed can be written as F q_P t leftfracmpi ihbar delta trightP sum_text all paths expbigfracihbar int dt L big Fq_ t Here the notation all paths is realized in the earlier version of this equation by dividing the time axis from to into equal divisions and denoting the coordinates of the system at the jth time step by By then allowing each to assume all possible values ie integrating over all possible values of using for example the MonteCarlo method discussed earlier one visits all possible paths that begin at at and end at at By forming the classical action for each path and then summing over all paths and multiplying by one is able to form The difficult step in implementing this Feynman path integral method in practice involves how one identifies all paths connecting to Each path contributes an additive term involving the complex exponential of the quantity Because the time variable appearing in each action component can be complex recall that in one of the time evolutions is really the exponentials of these action components can have both real and imaginary parts The real parts which arise from the cause the exponential terms to be damped ie to undergo exponential decay but the imaginary parts give rise in to oscillations The sum of many many actually an infinite number of oscillatory terms is extremely difficult to evaluate because of the tendency of contributions from one path to cancel those of another path The practical evaluation of such sums remains a very active research subject The most commonly employed approximation to this sum involves finding the paths for which the action is smallest because such paths produce the lowestfrequency oscillations in and thus may be less subject to cancelation by contributions from other paths The paths that minimize the action are in fact the classical paths That is they are the paths that the system whose quantum wave function is being propagated would follow if the system were undergoing classical Newtonian mechanics subject to the conditions that the system be at at and at at In this socalled semiclassical approximation to the propagation of the initial wave function using Feynman path integrals one finds all classical paths that connect at and at at and one evaluates the action for each such path One then applies the formula Phiq_P t leftfracmpi ihbar delta trightP sum_text all paths expbigfracihbar int dt L big Fq_ t but includes in the sum only the contribution from the classical paths In this way one obtains an approximate quantum propagated wave function via a procedure that requires knowledge of only classical propagation paths Clearly the quantum propagation of wave functions even within the semiclassical approximation discussed above is a rather complicated affair However keep in mind the alternative that one would face in evaluating for example spectroscopic line shapes if one adopted a timeindependent approach One would have to know the energies and wave functions of a system comprised of many interacting molecules This knowledge is simply not accessible for any but the simplest molecules For this reason the timedependent framework in which one propagates classical trajectories or uses pathintegral techniques to propagate initial wave functions offers the most feasible way to evaluate the correlation functions that ultimately produce spectral line shapes and other time correlation functions for complex molecules in condensed media Before finishing this Section it might help if I showed how one obtains the result that classical paths are those that make the action integral minimum This provides the student with an introduction to the subject called calculus of variations or functional analysis which most students reading this text have probably not studied in a class First lets clarify what a functional is A function depends on one or more variables x that take on scalar values that is given a scalar number produces the value of the function at this value of A functional is a function of the function if given the function acts on it to produce a value In more general functionals might depend not only of f but on various derivatives of Lets consider an example Suppose one has a functional of the form meaning that the functional involves an integral from through of an integrand that may contain i the variable explicitly ii the function and iii the derivative of this function with respect to the variable This is the kind of integral one encounters when evaluating the action integral where the function is the coordinate that evolves from to The task at hand is to determine that function for which this integral is a minimum We solve this problem proceeding much as one would do if one had to minimize a function of a variable we differentiate with respect to the variable and set the derivative to zero However in our case we have a function of a function not a function of a variable so how do we carry out the derivative We assume that the function that minimizes is known and we express any function that differs a little bit from the correct as where is a scalar quantity used to suggest that and differ by only a small amount and is a function that obeys this is how we guarantee that we are only considering paths that connect to the proper at and at By considering all possible functions that obey these conditions we have in a parameterization of all paths that begin at and end at tf where the exact path does but differ by a small amount from Substituting into gives The terms in the integrand are then expanded in powers of the parameter and substituted into the integral for Collecting terms of each power of allows this integral to be written as The condition that Se be stable with respect to variations in can be expressed as which is equivalent to requiring that the terms linear in in the above expansion for vanish Next we use integration by parts to rewrite the first term involving as a term involving instead Because the function vanishes at and the first term vanishes so this identity can be used to rewrite the condition that the terms in that are linear in vanish as Because this result is supposed to be valid for any function that vanishes at and tf the factor multiplying in the above integral must itself vanish This shows that the path that makes stationary is the path that obeys Newtons equations the classical path I urge the student reader to study this example of the use of functional analysis because this mathematical device is an important tool too master Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools on Theoretical Chemistry
