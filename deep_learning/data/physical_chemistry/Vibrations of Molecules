Vibrations of Molecules Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah Contributors and Attributions This Schrödinger equation forms the basis for our thinking about bond stretching and angle bending vibrations as well as collective vibrations in solids called phonons The radial motion of a diatomic molecule in its lowest rotational level can be described by the following Schrödinger equation where is the reduced mass of the two atoms If the molecule is rotating then the above Schrödinger equation has an additional term on its lefthand side Thus each rotational state labeled by the rotational quantum number has its own vibrational Schrödinger equation and thus its own set of vibrational energy levels and wave functions It is common to examine the vibrational problem and then to use the vibrational levels of this state as approximations to the vibrational levels of states with nonzero values treating the vibrationrotation coupling via perturbation theory Let us thus focus on the situation By substituting into this equation one obtains an equation for in which the differential operators appear to be less complicated This equation is exactly the same as the equation seen earlier in this text for the radial motion of the electron in the hydrogenlike atoms except that the reduced mass m replaces the electron mass m and the potential is not the Coulomb potential If the vibrational potential is approximated as a quadratic function of the bond displacement expanded about the equilibrium bond length where has its minimum the resulting harmonicoscillator equation can be solved exactly Because the potential grows without bound as approaches or only boundstate solutions exist for this model problem That is the motion is confined by the nature of the potential so no continuum states exist in which the two atoms bound together by the potential are dissociated into two separate atoms In solving the radial differential equation for this potential the larger behavior is first examined For larger the equation reads dfracdFdx dfrac k x dfracmuhbar Phi dfrackmuhbar x F where is the bond displacement away from equilibrium Defining and as a new scaled radial coordinate and realizing that dfracddx beta dfracddx allows the larger Schrödinger equation to be written as which has the solution The general solution to the radial equation is then expressed as this larger solution multiplied by a power series in the variable where the are coefficients to be determined Substituting this expression into the full radial equation generates a set of recursion equations for the amplitudes As in the solution of the hydrogenlike radial equation the series described by these coefficients is divergent unless the energy happens to equal specific values It is this requirement that the wave function not diverge so it can be normalized that yields energy quantization The energies of the states that arise by imposing this nondivergence condition are given by and the eigenfunctions are given in terms of the socalled Hermite polynomials as follows where Within this harmonic approximation to the potential the vibrational energy levels are evenly spaced In experimental data such evenly spaced energy level patterns are seldom seen most commonly one finds spacings that decrease as the quantum number increases In such cases one says that the progression of vibrational levels displays anharmonicity Because the Hermite functions are odd or even functions of depending on whether n is odd or even the wave functions ynx are odd or even This splitting of the solutions into two distinct classes is an example of the effect of symmetry in this case the symmetry is caused by the symmetry of the harmonic potential with respect to reflection through the origin along the axis ie changing to Throughout this text many symmetries arise in each case symmetry properties of the potential cause the solutions of the Schrödinger equation to be decomposed into various symmetry groupings Such symmetry decompositions are of great use because they provide additional quantum numbers ie symmetry labels by which the wave functions and energies can be labeled The basic idea underlying how such symmetries split the solutions of the Schrödinger equation into different classes relates to the fact that a symmetry operator eg the reflection plane in the above example commutes with the Hamiltonian That is the symmetry operator obeys textbfS textbfH textbfH textbfS So leaves unchanged as it acts on this allows us to pass through in the above equation Any operator that leaves the Hamiltonian ie the energy unchanged is called a symmetry operator If you have never learned about how point group symmetry can be used to help simplify the solution of the Schrödinger equation this would be a good time to interrupt your reading and go to Chapter and read the material there The harmonic oscillator energies and wave functions comprise the simplest reasonable model for vibrational motion Vibrations of a polyatomic molecule are often characterized in terms of individual bondstretching and anglebending motions each of which is in turn approximated harmonically This results in a total vibrational wave function that is written as a product of functions one for each of the vibrational coordinates Two of the most severe limitations of the harmonic oscillator model the lack of anharmonicity ie nonuniform energy level spacings and lack of bond dissociation result from the quadratic nature of its potential By introducing model potentials that allow for proper bond dissociation ie that do not increase without bound as the major shortcomings of the harmonic oscillator picture can be overcome The socalled Morse potential see Figure is often used in this regard In this form the potential is zero at the equilibrium bond length and is equal to as Sometimes the potential is written as Vr D_e exparr_e D_e so it vanishes as and is equal to at The latter form is reflected in Figure Figure Morse potential energy as a function of bond length In the Morse potential function is the bond dissociation energy is the equilibrium bond length and is a constant that characterizes the steepness of the potential and thus affects the vibrational frequencies The advantage of using the Morse potential to improve upon harmonicoscillatorlevel predictions is that its energy levels and wave functions are also known exactly The energies are given in terms of the parameters of the potential as follows where the force constant is given in terms of the Morse potentials parameters by The Morse potential supports both bound states those lying below the dissociation threshold for which vibration is confined by an outer turning point and continuum states lying above the dissociation threshold for which there is no outer turning point and thus the no spatial confinement Its degree of anharmonicity is governed by the ratio of the harmonic energy to the dissociation energy The energy spacing between vibrational levels and are given by E_n E_n hbar sqrtdfrackmu left dfrac nhbar sqrtkmuD_e right These spacings decrease until reaches the value at which after which the series of bound Morse levels ceases to exist ie the Morse potential has only a finite number of bound states and the Morse energy level expression shown above should no longer be used It is also useful to note that if becomes too small ie in the Morse model the potential may not be deep enough to support any bound levels It is true that some attractive potentials do not have a large enough value to have any bound states and this is important to keep in mind So bound states are to be expected when there is a potential well and thus the possibility of inner and outer turning points for the classical motion within this well but only if this well is deep enough The eigenfunctions of the harmonic and Morse potentials display nodal character analogous to what we have seen earlier in the particleinboxes model problems Namely as the energy of the vibrational state increases the number of nodes in the vibrational wave function also increases The state having vibrational quantum number has nodes I hope that by now the student is getting used to seeing the number of nodes increase as the quantum number and hence the energy grows As the quantum number grows not only does the wave function have more nodes but its probability distribution becomes more and more like the classical spatial probability as expected In particular for large the quantum and classical probabilities are similar and are large near the outer turning point where the classical velocity is low They also have large amplitudes near the inner turning point but this amplitude is rather narrow because the Morse potential drops off strongly to the right of this turning point in contrast to the left of the outer turning point the potential decreases more slowly so the large amplitudes persist over longer ranges near this turning point Contributors and
