throughout the course three major recurring chemical principles become evident structure determines functionactivity binding reactions initiate all biological events and chemical principles such as dynamic equilibria mass action and reaction kinetics and mechanisms derived from the study of small molecules can be applied to the behavior of macromolecules the order of the topics is based on evolving chemical logic topic lipid structure the first topic is lipid and lipid aggregate structurefunction instead of amino acids and proteins as is typically presented prior to taking a biochemistry course students have had little significant exposure to the chemical properties of macromolecules so
