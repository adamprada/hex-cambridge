to understand the much more complicated topic of protein folding and stability the concepts of mass conservation dynamic equilibria and kinetics and chemical potential are used to understand how aggregation at equilibrium depends on amphiphile concentration lipids serve as useful models to introduce stereochemistry and prochirality as well likewise it is easier to understand how torsion angle changes in the aliphatic side chains of phospholipid molecule alter acyl chain packing than it is to understand the complexities of a ramachandran plot from a chemical perspective it is more logical to introduce the spontaneous self assembly of small amphiphilic molecules into
