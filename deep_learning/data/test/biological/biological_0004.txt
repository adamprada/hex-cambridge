behavior of benzene in water and thermodynamic cycles involving the transfer of nmethylacetamide from water to a nonpolar solvent and from mutational studies dynamic and linked equilibria considerations along with reaction kinetics are used to describe the varying effects of denaturing urea guanidinium chloride and stabilizing ammonium sulfate glycerol solutes on protein stability as well as the competing processes of protein folding and aggregation in vitro and in vivo topic nuclei acid and carbohydrate structure the same principles which determine protein structurefunction can be applied to the study of the structure and stability of nucleic acids complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins
