other and dna in the active transcription complex it is particularly important to stress how equilibrium and mass conservation principles along with reaction kinetics effectively determine the concentrationdependent behavior of all molecules including the processes of binding and spontaneous structure formation topic binding and transport binding is an antecedent to the expression of biological activity the simplest expression of activity which involves a simple physical non covalent process is binding and transport of solute molecules across a biological membrane mathematical analyses of the flux of solute across a membrane catalyzed by a transport protein involves the same assumptions rapid equilibriumsteady
