known is discussed preceding this the basis for catalysis by small molecules is discussed following the chemical logic that the properties of macromolecules can be inferred from small molecules students learn that with respect to catalysis enzymes are not different just better than small molecule catalyst as previously described by jeremy knowles topic energy and signal transduction the final sequence involves specific examples of how enzymes can transduce both energy and information signals into useable outputs energy transduction involving the conversion of light electrochemical gradients or chemical energy into phosphoanhydride bonds is discussed special attention is paid to biological oxidation
