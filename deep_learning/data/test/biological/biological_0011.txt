reside inside membranebound organelles molecules can move into the cell by passive diffusion across the membrane but usually their movement is facilitated by a membrane receptor molecules can also move up a concentration gradient in a process called active transport given the amphiphilic nature of the bilayer polar head group exterior nonpolar interior you would expect that polar molecule like glucose would have difficulty in moving across the membrane in fact membrane transport proteins are involved in the movement of both nonpolar and polar molecules transporters carrier proteins and permeases these membrane proteins move specific ligand molecules across a membrane
