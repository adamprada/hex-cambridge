that bind the protein channel and the local environment of the protein in the membrane flow of ions through the channel proceeds in a thermodynamically favored direction which depends on their concentration and voltage gradients across the membrane pores some membranes nuclear mitochondria assemble proteins such as porins to form large but regulated pores porins are found in mitochondrial membranes while nucleoporins are found in the nuclear membrane small molecules can generally pass through these membrane pores while large one are selected based on their tendency to form transient intermolecular attractive forces with the pore proteins the following link shows
