them as they move and mature through the cell during this maturation process protein pumps in the endosome lead to a decrease in the endosomal ph which can lead to conformation changes in protein structure and shedding of proteins eventually the late endosome reaches and fuses with the lysosome an internal organelle which contains degradative enzymes undegraded components like viral nucleic acids or cholesterol are delivered to the cell this transport can also go in the reverse direction and recycle receptors to the cell membrane likewise vesicles pinched off from the golgi complex can fuse with endosomes with some components
