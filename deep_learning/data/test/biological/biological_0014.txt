called the proteasome lets consider some key characteristics of a cell before we get into the details cells and their internal compartments have regulated concentrations of ions and hydronium ion as expected the ph of the cytosol the aqueous substance surrounding all the organelles within the cell varies from about depending on the metabolic state of the cell some organelles have proton transporters that can significantly alter the ph inside an organelle for example the ph inside the lysosome a degradative organelle is about the collapse of the ph gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is sufficient to drive the
