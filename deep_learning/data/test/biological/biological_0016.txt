of molecules and organelles rather is a highly organized for optimal chemical production use and degradation cell have a variety of shapes some circulating immune cells must slip through the cells that line capillary walls to migrate to sites of infection the same process occurs when tumor cells metastasize and escape to other sites in the body in order to do so the cell must drastically change shape a response that requires dissociation of the cytoskeleton polymers into monomers which are available later for repolymerization the cell is an amazingly crowded place in chemistry labs we typically work with dilute
