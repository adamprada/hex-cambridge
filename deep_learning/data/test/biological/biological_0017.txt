as well as dislike ones which from an equilibrium perspective would not occur in dilute solutions hence the study of biomolecules in dilute solutions in the lab may not reveal the actual complexities of interactions and activities of the same molecule in vivo recently investigators have added a neutral copolymer of sucrose and epichlorhydrine to cells in vitro these particles induced organization of extracellular molecules secreted by cell forming an organized extracellular matrix which induced the organization of the microfilaments on the inside of the cell as well as inducing changes in cell activity in vitro enzyme activity of a
