process of phase separation is also called liquidliquid demixing as two liquidlike substances separate it appears that proteins that interact with rna are composed of less diverse amino acid and have more flexible more liquidlike structures allowing their preferential interaction with rna to form large rnaprotein particles like the ribosome and other rna processing structures in a fashion that mimics liquidliquid demixing all of these interactions are just manifestations of the various intermolecular forces you studied in earlier chemistry classes you have studied lipid protein nucleic acid and carbohydrate structure in introductory biology andor chemistry classes now follow the following
