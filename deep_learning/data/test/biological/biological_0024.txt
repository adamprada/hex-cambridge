examples of how posttranslational modifications of proteins and epigenetic modifications of dna can alter gene expression explain how the apparent kd for a protein binding to dna can be altered by the presence of another protein bound to dna at a proximal site describe the basis of rna interference in gene expression one of the central questions of modern biology is what controls gene expression as we have previously described genes must be turned on at the right time in the right cell to a first approximation all the cells in an organism contain the same dna with the exception
