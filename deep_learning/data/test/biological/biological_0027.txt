are conservedit has been proposed that the dimer might be the biological functional form of clpro from the dimeric structures of coronavirus clpros it has been also predicted that domainiii might play a role in substrate recognition and be responsiblefor positioning the n terminus of one protomer monomer to interact with the active site of the other protomerthe critical role of domain iii in dimerization and enzymaticactivity of sars clpro has been shown in addition lai and coworkers reported that sars clpro exists as a monomerdimer mixture at a relatively highprotein concentration approx mgml and is exclusively monomer ata lower
