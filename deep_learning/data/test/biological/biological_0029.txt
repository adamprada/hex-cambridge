the fluorogenic substrate by sars clpros the fluorogenic substrate at a concentration of um was incubated with um fulllength or nterminal deleted sars clpro in mm sodium phosphate ph mm nacl mm dtt mm edta at o c increase of emission fluorescence intensity at nm wavelength was recorded at min intervals ex nm the emission spectrum was recorded for more than h the initial reaction velocity was determined from the linear portion of the progress curve which corresponded to between and hydrolysis of the substrate the activity of the fulllength sars clpro was taken as a give a molecular explanation
