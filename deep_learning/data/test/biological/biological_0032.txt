dimers c the integrated areas of the peaks give dimermonomer ratios of and for protein concentrations of and mgml write the chemical and mathematical equilibrium expression for the process and using these explain if the variation of the dimermonomer ratio is expected the monomerdimer interaction was then studied by isothermal titration calorimetry in the experiments concentrated protein around Î¼m or mgml was injected into a buffer solution and enthalpy changes measured results are shown below note that all injections of the protein give enthalpy values indicated the process is endothermic fig typical calorimetric dilution data measured by itc a the
