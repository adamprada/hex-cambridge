models based on it for sn modeling shows that sn forms a dimer but with a reduced substrate binding pocket to confirm this a small peptide substrate tsavlq was synthesized this represented the n terminal sequence of the best reported peptide substrate for the enzyme the binding affinity of the peptide for s and sn was determine by surface plasmon resonance biosensors s or sn were immobilized to cells for sensor chip from biacore buffer was continuously flowed over the derivitized chip the peptide was diluted into the buffer solution and injected in increasing concentrations from Î¼m binding responses were
