elements as the respective domains of eftu and are highly conserved among all organisms domain i binds guanine nucleotides and domains i ii and iii together provide most of the contact surface for sectrnasec binding domain iv of selb which consists of four wingedhelix motifs and recognizes the sec insertion sequence element has no analogs in other translational gtpases and differs in bacteria archaea and eukarya despite the structural similarities of the nucleotidebinding domains of selb and eftu their nucleotidebinding properties are markedly different selb from escherichia coli binds gtp with higher affinity than gdp in contrast eftu binds gtp
