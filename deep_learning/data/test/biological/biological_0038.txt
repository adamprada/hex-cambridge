prompted us to probe the conformational changes of selb upon binding of different guanine nucleotides in solution in principle a number of techniques can be used to probe conformational rearrangements of proteins upon ligand binding among them isothermal titration calorimetry itc is an underexploited method to estimate structural changes by measuring the heat released or absorbed during complex formation the figure below illustrates the components of an itc system this enthalpy change determined at different temperatures allows calculating the heat capacity change which in turn provides information about conformational changes of macromolecules upon binding their ligands thus itc provides a
