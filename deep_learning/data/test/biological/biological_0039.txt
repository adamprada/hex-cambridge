cell c what is the most logical control experiment that you would perform how would you correct the experimental derived enthalpy changes for the those see in the control case d consider the following simple equilibrium for the interaction of a ligand l with a macromolecule m characterized by the dissociation constant kd as shown below where m is the concentration of the free macromolecule l is the concentration of free ligand and ml is the concentration of complex for dissociable binding interactions kd is as important as pka for a ionizable proton from an acid an equation for ml
