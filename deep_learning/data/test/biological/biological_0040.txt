derive an equation that gives the relations between dg and keq as well as kd questions based on article answer the following questions based on the itc thermograms for binding of gtp to selb a and gdp to selb b below a the titration curves above appear sigmoidal in contrast to the hyperbolic saturation binding curve you drew for a simple m l binding equilibrium sigmoidal ml vs l binding plots are often associated with cooperative binding interactions why are these plots not hyperbolic even they the enthalpy changes can be best modeled by a simple noncooperative binding of m
