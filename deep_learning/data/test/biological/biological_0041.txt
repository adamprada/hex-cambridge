thermograms comparing the binding of gtp a and two analogs of gtp gtpγs b gdpnp c are shown below d again assuming similar concentration of selb in the sample c compare the kds for the interaction of gtpγs and gdpn to selb e the structures of gtp and the two analogs are shown below suggests a reason that the investigators used the analogs in their studies f the itc thermograms be fit to a theoretical model for m and l binding with a stoichiometry of one from this data fit kd can be determined how would you calculate the ds
