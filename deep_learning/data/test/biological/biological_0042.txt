to a ligand would be affected by the change in enthalpy on binding of protons to the buffer base to investigate the effect of buffer ionization enthalpy the each of the buffers has a different dhion which is the enthalpy change on ionization of a proton from the buffer acid state two facts that characterize the graphs b figure b above shows the dependence of binding enthalpy of selbgtp interaction y axis on the buffer protonionization enthalpy at ï½c ï½c ï½c and ï½c for different buffers whose enthalpy of ionization are known at different temperature x axis what are the
