capacity dcp ddhdt can give us insight into the nature of the binding interactions to understand this first consider change in thermodynamic parameter when benzene is transferred from pure benzene to water a graph showing thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature for this transfer reaction is shown below c is the positive value of dg for transfer of benzene from pure benzene to water in accord with your understanding of physical and chemical properties of benzene explain d at first glance you might expect that the collective benzenebenzene imfs and hoho imfs might be stronger than benzeneho imfs and
