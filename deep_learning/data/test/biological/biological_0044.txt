dh with increasing temperature and hence a positive dcp we will use this idea to analyze the dcp for selb and gtp binding for graph c above what is the sign of dcp what molecular interpretation can you give to that value the main source of dcp changes on binding arise from loss of water of interacting water from the surfaces of protein and ligand on binding with the main contribution arising from the hydrophoboic effect another less sizeable contribution to dcp would arise from burying polar residues with the ensuing changes in bound and bulk water interaction potentials the
