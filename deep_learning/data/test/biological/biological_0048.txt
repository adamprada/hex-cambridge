can cyclize by an intramolecular nucleophilic addition of one of the oh groups on the sugar with the aldehyde or ketone resulting in a hemiacetal or hemiketal addition of another alcohol from an exogenous alcohol under acidicanhydrous condition results in an acetal if the added alcohol is from another sugar a covalent acetal link between the two sugars results as with peptides the process can be reversed under aqueous conditions through hydrolysis of the acetal link resulting in monomeric sugars biochemist name the acetal link between sugars a glycosidic bond click to see figures showing these reactions cyclization of simple
