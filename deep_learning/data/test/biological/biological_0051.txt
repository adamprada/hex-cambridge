the pocket binds the lectin ricin and tomato lectin ricin is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a galβglcnac binding subunit b chain kda and a toxic subunit a chain ca kda connected through a disulfide linkage tomato lectin is known to bind a linear polymer of nacetyllactosamine polylacnac which is comprised of up to galβglcnac linked principally by glcnacβgalβ links which in mammals is found in both the cell and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins a study was done to exam the flagellar pocket of the bloodstream form of trypanosoma brucei by studying the ricinbinding glycoprotein ricinbinding glycoproteins were purified as follows
