the beads were collected by gentle centrifugation and packed into a column why was the extract diluted fold before the chromatography beads were added why did they switch from sds to triton x draw a diagram showing the ricin beads in the column and any interacting species d bound proteins were eluted from the column after extensive washing without altering ph or ionic strength how could bounds proteins be eluted name the eluting agent aliquots of the eluted fractions were separated by page a membrane was placed on the gel and electrophoresis of the proteins onto the membrane was performed
