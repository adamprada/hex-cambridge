is visualized with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated ricin b in gel a explain the chemical effect of dithiothreitol on the proteins which do to alter the migration of the proteins b why is there only one main band left after treatment with pngasef before the electrophoresis hint google the enzyme glycans released from the ricinbinding glycoproteins by pngasef were separated by biogel p gel filtration chromatography figure biogel p chromatogram of glycans obtained from ricinbinding glycoproteins glycans released from ricinbinding glycoproteins by the action of pngasef were purified from detergents and salts the monosaccharide compositions of the fractions were determined by gcms
