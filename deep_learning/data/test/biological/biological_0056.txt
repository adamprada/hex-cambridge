methylated at every position except oh and oh and how each monosaccharide is substituted the latter reveals inter alia the occurrence of branching points however methylation analysis neither indicates which residues are attached to each other ie does not provide sequence information nor if a particular linkage is of the α or β configuration ncbi the methylation analysis in conjunction with nmr analysis showed large amounts of substitutedβglcnac and osubstitutedβgal nmr analysis shows most of the glcnac and gal residues were present as lacnac repeats of approximately finally fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled ricin was added to fixed tryptosomes and detected by fluorescence
