a molecule of dsdna and so will i in analogy to protein structure dsdna has a linear sequence primary structure secondary structure right handed double helix and tertiaryquaternary structure it is folded and packed in the cell structure of dna and rna jsmol dna structure alternative dna structures the links above show the classic dsdna helix in which dna is in the b form other forms of dna exists including adna and zdna singlestranded sections of dna can through intramolecular basepairing form stemloop hairpin structures and quadruplex structures found at the ends of chromosomes telomeres jsmol b a and z
