male figure human chromosomes with an extra copy of chromosome which causes down syndrome the human genome has about billion base pairs of dna i am uncertain if that estimate is for all pairs or since each member of a pairs is almost identical it is an estimate of the dna in one member each of the just different pairs of chromosomes i will assume that it is for one member of each pair therefore on average each single chromosome of a pair has about million base pairs which consists of one molecule of dna and lots of proteins bound
