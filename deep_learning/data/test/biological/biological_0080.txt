first part of the section we will discuss the rigid movement of whole lipid molecules in a bilayer within a leaftlet and between leaflets in the second part and the following supplement we will consider the movement of atoms within a molecule the movements include motions like bond bending bond stretching and torsion angle changes like we saw in the previous chapter section on the conformatic lipid distribution in cellsc lipid raftscertain lipids often cluster within a leaftlet to form lipid rafts which can be considered to result from a lateral phase separation of the lipids within one leaflet of
