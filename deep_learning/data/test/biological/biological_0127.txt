crisprcas systems consist of an array of short direct repeats interspersed by variable invaderderived sequences spacers and a cas operon during invasion small fragments of the invading dna from phage or plasmids protospacers are incorporated into host crispr loci transcribed and processed to generate small crispr rnas crrna the invading nucleic acid is then recognized and silenced by cas proteins guided by the crrnas there are three types of crisprcas system each characterized by the presence of a signature gene programmed dna cleavage requires the fewest components in the type ii crisprcas system requiring only crrna a transactivating crrna tracrrna
