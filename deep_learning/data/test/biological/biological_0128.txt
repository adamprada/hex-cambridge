protospacer adjacent motif pam is characteristic of the invading dna targeted by the type i and type ii crisprcas systems the pam serves two functions it has been linked to the acquisition of new spacer sequences and it is necessary for the subsequent recognition and silencing of target dna the sequence length and position of the pam vary depending on the crisprcas type and organism pams from type ii systems are located downstream of the protospacer and contain bp of conserved sequence a variable sequence of up to bp separates the conserved sequence of the pam from the protospacer this
