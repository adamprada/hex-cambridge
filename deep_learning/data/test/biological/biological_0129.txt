generate mutations in cells by introducing dsdna breaks the capabilities of cas can be expanded to various genome engineering purposes such as transcription repression or activation with its nickase generated by inactivating one of its two nuclease domains or nuclease null variants another appealing possibility for the cas system is to target different casmediated activities to multiple target sites for example transcriptional repression of one gene but activation of another to achieve this multiple cas orthologs will need to be employed as a single ortholog cannot concurrently mediate different activities at multiple sites therefore to broaden our understanding of cas
