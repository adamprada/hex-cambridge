genomes that matched any of the spacer sequences from crispr this search generated unique target sequences from the genomes of bacteriophage known to infect s thermophilus we then aligned nucleotide segments from the identified target genomes inclusive of the nucleotide protospacer and nucleotide flanking regions figure b shows b logo plot revealing the pam for lmg cas the positions of the protospacer pam and linker are indicated what is the most likely consensus sequence of the pam sequence how far is it away from the protospacer c figure c shows a schematic representation of the crispr nucleic acid complexes label
