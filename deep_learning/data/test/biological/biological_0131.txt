a shows a schematic representation of transformation assay the target plasmid contained protospacer whose sequence was identical to the first spacer of crispr a bp linker and the identified pam the first control plasmid contained only protospacer whereas the second control plasmid lacked both protospacer and pam the target and control plasmids were then used to transformed cells in the presence of iptg and the appropriate antibiotics why did the investigators add iptg what difference would you expect to find in the cells in the left panel compared to the right in their assay b figure b shows plasmid transformation
