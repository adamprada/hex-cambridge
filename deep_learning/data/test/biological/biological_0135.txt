cas c figure a below shows a representative gel shift assay for cassgrna and the binding curve measured from the assay from inspection of the graph what is the approximate kd for the interaction the top wedge indicates increasing concentration of the cassgrna b a bar graph plotting kd values for dna targets with pam mutations labeled red are shown below b average values from at least three replicates are shown with error bars representing sd targets where binding was not observed are shown with kd values at the lower limit nm ps denotes the protospacer sequence interpret the results
