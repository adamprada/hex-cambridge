covalent modification of dna chromatin packing at the level of dnahistone interactions are critical key to these interactions are the state of covalent modification of lysine k side chains in protein by histone acetylases hats which are also called lysine acetylases kats and histone deacetylases hdacs two chemical modifications of lysine side chains in histones are shown below a offer a chemical explanation of why structure b will not be acetylated by kat b what affect might kat modification of histone lysine side chains have on transcriptional competency of dna in nucleosomes naphthoquinone derivatives are naturally occurring compounds that are
