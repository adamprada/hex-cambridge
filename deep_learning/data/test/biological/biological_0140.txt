histone h without modfication does plu inhibit hk acetylation how does nac affect plumbagin effect on acetylation fig d another inhibitor of hk acetylation isogarcinol isogar was studied by western blotting did nac have same effect on hk acetylation of cells treated with isogar as those treated with plu shown in fig c nac seems to behave differently in the presence of two acetylation inhibitors these results offer two possibilities for its effects ros could lead to decrease acetylation of histones and nac by decreasing ros restore acetylation alternatively plumbagin reacts with the rsh of nac which decreases it effect
