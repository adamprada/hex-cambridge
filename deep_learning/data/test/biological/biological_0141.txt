kats p a and cbp b using hela cell core histones with Î¼m plumbagin lanes in a and b either in the presence or absence of nac dtt and another reducing agent trolox lane interpret the results what part of nac and dtt appear important in their effects on plumbagin inhibition fig a these data suggest a chemical reaction of nac and dtt with plumgartin the generic structure of naphthoquinone derivatives including plumgartin are shown below along with nac and dtt fig b the thiol group on nac is likely to react with a sp c ultimately leading to a
