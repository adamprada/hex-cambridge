are shown below compare this graph with the proceeding one what conclusion can you draw fig not shown the authors used uvvis and fluorescence spectroscopy to study the effect of nac on the spectra of naphthoquinone analogs what likely effects would you expect to observe on the spectrum of lawsone fig a the ultimate goal of the investigators was to make a naphthoquinone derivative that was not cytotoxic which presumably results from its interactions with free thiols they synthesized ptk as shown below why would this reaction produce a potential inhibitor that did not react with free thols in cells
