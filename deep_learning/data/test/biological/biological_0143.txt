concentrations of ptk used are indicated in the figure e error bars sd what conclusions can you draw from the blots how might ptk inhibit p kat activity enzyme kinetic analyses would be useful the enzyme has two substates acetyl coa and histones previous studies have shown that substrates bind to p in an ordered mechanism the noncompetitive inhibitor ptk could bind to the free enzyme as well as to the substratebound form resulting in an abortive ternary complex t presume that added reversible inhibitors behavior in a similar fashion with single and multisubstrate reactions here are some simple rules
