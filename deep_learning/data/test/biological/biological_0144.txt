rapid equilibrium figure ab figure a and b below show double reciprocal or lineweaverburk plots v vs s of p kat with one substrate fixed and the other varying at different fixed concentrations of inhibitor ptk in figure a the concentration of core histones was kept constant at μm while increasing the concentration of isotope labeled hacetylcoa from to μm either in the absence no inhibitor or increasing concentrations of ptk and μm the direction of increasing inhibitor concentration is shown by the red arrow in figure b inhibition of p kat activity by ptk was studied at a fixed
