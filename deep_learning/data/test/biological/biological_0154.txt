d transition how to calculate dgo for from protein denaturation curves multiple methods can be used to investigate the denaturation of a protein these include uv fluorescence cd and viscosity measurement in all these methods the dependent variable y is measured as a function of the independent variable which is often temperature for thermal denaturation curves or denaturant such as urea guanidine hydrochloride concentration from these curves we would like to calculate the standard free energy of unfolding dgo for the protein for the reaction the denaturation curves usually show a sigmoidal cooperative transition from the native to the denatured
