fluorescence intensity viscosity etc can be thought of as the sum contributed by the native state and from the denatured state which are present in different fractional concentrations from hence the following equation should be reasonably intuitive where fn is the fraction native and yn is the contribution to the dependent variable y from the native state and fd is the fraction denatured and yd is the contribution to the dependent variable y from the denatured state conservation give equation substituting into gives rearranging this equation gives notice the right hand side of the equations contains variables that are easily
