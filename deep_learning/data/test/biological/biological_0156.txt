denatured state would be equally favored at this point keq and dgo if temperature is the denaturing agent the temperature at this point is called the melting point tm of the protein which is analogous to the tm in the heat capacity vs temperature graphs for the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles figure gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles figure gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles ordinarily at a temperature much below the tm for the protein or at a low urea concentration so little of the protein would be
