figure in this section b dgd dgdwo urea murea although it is nice to know the keq and dg for the transition in the presence of various urea concentrations it would be even more useful to determine those parameters in the absence of urea that is under physiological conditions a comparison of the calculated values of dg in the absence of urea for a series of similar proteins such as those varying by a single amino acid prepared by sitespecific mutagenesis of the normal or wildtype gene would indicate how the mutants were stabilized or destabilized compared to the wildtype
