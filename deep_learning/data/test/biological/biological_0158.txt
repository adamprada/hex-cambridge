as a denaturant by monitoring change in an observable spectra signal for example vs temperature knowing keq denoted kd below since at the moment my program wont allow me to change it and dh ds can be calculated from equation below as a semilog plot of lnkeq vs t is a straight line with a slope of dhr and a y intercept of dsr or hence from equations and is should be evident that all the major thermodynamics constants dg dh and ds for the transition can be calculated from thermal denaturation curves equation shows that the derivative of equation
