with those determined directly using differential scanning calorimetry by analyzing a plot of cp vs t note that the area under the cp vs t curve as the protein transitions to the unfolded state has units of kcal the dh for the unfolding is inversely proportional to the width of the curve in contrast to the long extrapolation of the dg vs urea to urea to get dg the y intercept in the absence of urea which has some physical meaning extrapolation of the straight line from the van t hoff plot from equation to get dsr the y intercept
