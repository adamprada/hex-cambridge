chain amphiphiles form bilayers describe lipid phases other than micelles and gelliquid crystalline bilayers formed by single and double chain amphiphiles e why micelles and bilayers micelles and liposomes form spontaneously ie delta g when water is added to dried phospholipids multilamellar vesicles mlvs form with water trapped between the successive polar head groups of the multiple bilayers sonicating these will produce small unilamellar vesicles suvs if however an aqueous detergent solution such as betadoctylglucopyranoside is added to a concentration greater than its cmc mixed micelles of the phospholipid and detergent result by slowly dialyzing away the detergent which is
