n of head groups hg the number of acyl chains ch hence the surface area per hg is equal to the area per hc or asn hg as n ch for a dca n hg n ch therefore asn hg asnch there is twice the surface area available per head group compared to that of the sca therefore the dca can tolerate more compression in fact it can easily be compressed to a bilayer which as we saw has much less ashg the cylindrical form actually has to much space per head group since water can enter the structure the
