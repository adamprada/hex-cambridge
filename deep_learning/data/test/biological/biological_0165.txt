globular cylindrical planar forms in reality things are more complicated in this introductory chapter on lipid aggregates i have simplified the nature of the complex lipid structures than can form on aggregation of single and double chain amphiphiles the general rule holds that single chain amphiphiles form micelles and double chain amphiphiles form bilayers however under the right condition single chain fatty acids can from bilayers which makes fatty acids like oleic acid prime candidates for components of the membranes of protocells in the evolution of life from abiotic conditions in addition other lipids phases can be observed what aggregates
