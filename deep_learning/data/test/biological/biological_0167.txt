lipids are not just used as a passive component of membranes or as a source of stored energy they are involved in the process of signal transduction at the cell membrane a process by which the interior components of the cell respond to a signal external to the cell allowing the cell to respond to their local environment usually a chemical signal on the outside of the cell is the primary messenger that causes the cell to respond usually the chemical transmitter of information does not get into the cell rather it binds to surface receptors on the cell membrane
