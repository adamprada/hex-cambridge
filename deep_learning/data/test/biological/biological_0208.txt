vs s graphs in the presence and absence of allosteric inhibitors and activators for multisubunit enzymes that display sigmoidal cooperative behavior k systems conforming to the mwc model differentiate between k and v systems for allosterically regulated enzymes using the mwc model and explain shifts in graphs of v vs s in the presence of allosteric effectors in reality many enzymes have more than one substrate a b and more than one product p q for example the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol with nad a biological oxidizing agent to form acetaldehyde and nadh topic hierarchy contributors
