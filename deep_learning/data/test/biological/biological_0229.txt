are ways to break a bond to a cx bond producing either a carbocation carbanion or free radical intermediate all of the which are unstable and reactive both the carbocation and free radical are electron deficient and the carbanion although not electron deficienct has a negative on c an atom which has a relatively low electronegativity preferential stabilization of reactants intermediates and products these unstable intermediates are higher in energy than the reactants and hence the transition state which is even higher in energy than the intermediates must have a structure which resembles the intermediates more than the reactants ie
