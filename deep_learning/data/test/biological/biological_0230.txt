determining the relative stability of the reactants and products from structural considerations consider two reactants r and r which produce products p and p respectively any structural features that preferentially stabilizes r compared to r or p compared to p but doesnt stabiiize r and p to the same extent will lead to a greater driving force for r p compared to r this is shown graphically below mechanisms which lead to the stabilization of a reactant intermediate or product include resonance and inductive effects electron release or withdrawing an example of how the comparative acidity of two similar molecules
