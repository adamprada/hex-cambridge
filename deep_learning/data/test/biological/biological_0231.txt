below helps explain the preferential formation of the tertiary alcohol oxidation of organic molecules organic molecules are usually oxidized in two electron steps two methods can be used to determined if a c atom in an organic molecule has been oxidized if the number of bonds from the c to oxygen increase or the number of bonds to h decrease the c is oxidized more generally if the number of bonds from c to a more electronegative atom increases or the number of binds from c to a less electronegative atom decrease the carbon is oxidized a more powerful method
