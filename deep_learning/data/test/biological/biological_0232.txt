electrons of an atom to that atom assign all bonded electrons to the more electronegative atom of the two atoms bonded assign one electron of a bond to each atom if the two atoms are identical sum up the assigned electrons from subtract this number from the total number of electrons usually present in the outer shell of the atom the group number the result is the oxidation number an illustration of the sequential two step oxidation of ethane to acetic acid and assigned oxidation numbers a review of how to count electrons around an atom determining formal charge and
