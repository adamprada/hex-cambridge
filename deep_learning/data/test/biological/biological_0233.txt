alcohol adds and forms the hemiacetal or hemketal the acid can protonate the oh group leading to its expulsion as water in an acidcatalyzed elimination the carbocation or resonantform oxonium ion can react with another roh to form an acetal or ketal if the nucleophile is an amine an addition can occur followed by an elimination to form an imine or schiff base an acetal or ketal are really geminal ethers as water addition to aldehydes or ketones produced geminal diols as with other ethers these geminal ethers are stable to base and are hence often used as protecting groups
