attack such as by br on an adjacent c can occur sn with electrons flowing to the protonated oxonium ion a great electron sink as it departs reaction of carboxylic acid derivatives carboxylic acids undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions assisted by the fact that compared to aldehydes and ketones they have good leaving groups with the substitution reaction the stability of the double bond in the carbonyl is retained two things control the reactivity of these derivatives the stability of the reactants and the stability of the products the stability of the reactants a reactant is less reactive if stabilized by
