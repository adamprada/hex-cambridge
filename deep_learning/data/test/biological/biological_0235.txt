the reactant less stabilized by resonance is the acid chloride since a nonbonded pair of electrons on the larger chlorine molecule cant delocalize as readily given ccl bond distance notice this order of decreased stability based on resonance stabilization is also the order of increased electrophilicity of the carbonyl c which is most electrophilic in the absence of electron delocalization from the adjacent n o or cl the stability of the products if the deprotonated leaving group is considered as one of the products whch differentiates the different reactions then the order of decreased stability of products is cl rcoo
