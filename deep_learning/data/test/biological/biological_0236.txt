acetaldehyde with h and methyl group and acetone with methyl groups the Î´go for hydration of these is and kcalmol respectively showing that increased electron release toward the carbonyl c which makes it less electrophilic and more stable decreases the reactivity of the carbonyl in nucleophilic substitution the leaving group anion must be more stable than the nucleophile kinetics of reactivity of carbonyls the relative kinetic reactivity of various carbonyls toward nucleophiles follows the order of electrophilicity of the c ie the extent of the positive charge on the carbonyl c the slow step in a nucleophilic attack is breaking
