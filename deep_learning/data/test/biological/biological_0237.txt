synthetic reactions to obtain energy sugars and fatty acids are converted to carbon dixoide hence cc bonds must be broken in contrast cc bonds must be synthesized in photosynthesis in all reactions electrons from bond broken flow to atoms where bonds will be made flow is from a source a pair of electrons possibly with a negative charge to a sink a slightly or fully positive atom heres a couple ways to make a cc bond react two carbon centered radicals free radical mechanisms are uncommon biologically react a carbocation with a carbanion a carbocation is unstable unless incorporated into
