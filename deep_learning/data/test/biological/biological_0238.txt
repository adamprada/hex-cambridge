to a carbonyl which is stabilized by the enolate resonance form acts as a nucleophile which addes to a carbonyl c in an aldehyde or ketone in another cc bond synthesis reaction a claisen condensation a carbanion formed the deprotonation of a ch alpha to a carbonyl which is stabilized by the enolate resonance form acts as a nucleophile which substitutes at a carbonyl c in an ester breaking cc bonds in addition to a retroaldol condensation a common method to break a cc is through a decarboxylation reaction at a betaketo acid notice that the analogous reaction at an
