will discuss diffusion processes first diffusion equations will be derived for cases not involving a binding receptor the equation will show the rate of diffusion of a solute across a membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration is a linear function of across the membrane next we will derive equations for receptormediated diffusion across a membrane facilitated diffusion we will deal with the situation when the solute must be transported up a concentration gradient which requires atp as an exogenous source of energy a process called active transport topic hierarchy contributors and attributions prof
