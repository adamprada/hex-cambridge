derivatives are uses as substrates or cofactors or coenzymes to facilitate the flow of electrons in bond making and breaking for each of the reactions below using the analogy of sourcesink write a reasonable mechanism which shows electron flow during the reaction with the exception of the first reaction all require a vitamin derivative to facilitate electron flow imagine reaction one occurring spontaneously in solution in the absence of an enzyme although enzymes exists to catalyze this reaction the rest of the reactions involve vitamin derivatives as part of an enzymecatalyzed reaction draw plausible mechanisms for each of the reactions
