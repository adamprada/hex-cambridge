is so electronegative an even better sink is a positive n of an iminium ion examples of which are show below the cofactors encountered in enzyme catalyzed reactions are often vitamin derivatives we will study more about some of these later just the business parts of the cofactors are shown below rx type spontaneous decarboxylation of βketo acids no cofactor required although nucleophilic catalysis by an amine through schiff base formation will speed up the reaction rx type decarboxylation of αketo acids requires thiamine pyrophosphate tpp a derivative of thiamine vitamin b a deficiency of which causes beriberi tpp is
