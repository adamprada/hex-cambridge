java jsmol html pyridoxal phosphate enzymes pyridoxal phosphate plp is a derivative of the vitamin b or pyridoxal deficiencies cause convulsions chronic anemia and neuropathy it assists in many reactions catalyzed by plpdependent enzymes the plp is bound covalently to lysine residues in a schiff base linkage aldimine in this form it reacts with many free amino acids as substrates to replace the schiff base to lys of the enzyme with a schiff base to the amino acid substrate first a review of schiff base formation plp structure and covalent attachment to enzyme for reactions assume that the amino acid
