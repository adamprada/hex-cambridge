chemical properties of the coenzyme most of these reactions are made possible by a common structural feature that is electron withdrawal toward the cationic nitrogen atom of the imine and into the electron sink of the pyridoxal ring from the alpha carbon atom of the attached amino acid activates all three of the substitutents of this carbon for reactions which require electron withdrawal from this atom molecular modeling plp tyrosine aminotransferase jmol from pdb rx type αdecarboxylation of amino acids rx type betaelimination from serine example serine dehydratase hint remove h on αc first then oh rx type racemization of
