thiol it is acetylated at the thiol in many metabolic reactions to produce acetylcoa containing a thioester bond a biological acetylating reagent this molecule can be cleaved in an exergonic fashion due in part to the weak bond between the acetyl c and the sk leading to transfer of the acetyl group we have previously discussed the importance of histone lys acetylation by histone acetylases in the control of gene expression rx type methyl transferases an additional posttranslational modification of histone proteins methylation is yet another method in which gene transcription is control natures methylating agent is sadenosine methionine a
