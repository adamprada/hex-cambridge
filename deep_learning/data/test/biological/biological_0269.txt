the outer leaflet in microdomains or rafts of cell membranes it can be cleaved by the protein enzyme sphingomyelinase a phosphdiesterase resulting in the generation of ceramide in the membrane this enzyme cleaves sm in bilayer membranes this reaction is a hydrolysis catalyzed by the enzyme draw a mechanism showing the hydrolysis in the absence of the enzyme which would alter the mechanism that would give ceramide draw the lewis structure of the other product as well finally draw a cartoon of the enyzme with reactant in the active site sphingomyelinase smase can be activated when an external signal such
