method to remove free unencapsulated neuraminidase from the luvs to study the properties of the luvs they were treated with gm ganglioside in methanol in a volume of the luv preparation a ganglioside is a glycolipid contains a nonpolar lipid and polar sugar head group usually found in membranes the sugar head group of gm consists of neuraminic acid galactose and glucose as shown in the structure below note that the encapsulated neuraminidase cleaves the terminal glycoylneuraminic acid from gm the most common types of gangliosides are glycosphingolipids since the final solution was meoh an amount insufficient to alter liposome
