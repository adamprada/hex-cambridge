this triton x concentration did not inhibit sphingomyelinase or neuraminidase figure a sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase average values se n average values se n explain using a cartoon and words the changes in the luv on addition of smase and of tx the same experiment was repeated addition of smase to the luvs but instead of monitoring sm hydrolysis glycoylneuraminic acid cleavage from the added gm was studied aliquots of the vesicle suspension were removed at fixed timesafter the addition of sphingomyelinase and analyzed for thegm product of neuraminidase activity the results are shown in figure b below figure b
