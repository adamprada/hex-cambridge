smase treated vesicles as describe above was determined the luvs were filtered through membrane with small pores allowing free neuramidase to pass through but not encapsulated luv they assayed the neuramidase using a soluble substrate of the enzyme nacetylneuraminylgalglu the results are shown in figure a figure a fraction of released neuraminidase in the time course of sphingomyelinase action free neuraminidase was separated from the vesicles by filtration average values se n does the constant presence of neuramindase present from minutes suggest constant leakage from the luvs or an leakage arising from the filtration method note that the value at
