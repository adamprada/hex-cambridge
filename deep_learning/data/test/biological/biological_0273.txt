gm hydrolysisis totally different from the one depending on sphingomyelinaseactivity suggest a hypothesis to account for the enhanced hydrolysis of gm in the presence of smase draw a cartoon diagram in your explanation in another experiment antibody that binds and neutralizes the activity of neuraminidase was added to preformed luvs and experiment repeated the graphs below the two cases figure c gm ganglioside hydrolysis by luvs with encapsulated neuraminidase with and without antineuraminidase antibody added to the luv suspension average values se n the paper did not define the symbols but one is in the absence of added antibody and
