describedin figure a aliquots were removed from the reaction mixtureat regular intervals and mixed with an impermeant nonspecific antibody igg labeled with another fluorophore rhodamine when nbd is excited with uv light it fluorescence emission wavelength overlaps the excitation wavelength of rhodamine if the two fluorphores are close enough excitation of nbd can lead to rhodamine fluorescence emission in a process called fluorescence resonance energy transfer figure excitation emission spectra of nbd green and rhodamine blue results are shown in the figure below control experiments also shown in the figureindicated that in the absence of sphingomyelinase nbdpe fluorescenceremained invariant with
