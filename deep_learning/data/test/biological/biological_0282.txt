protein to the im the leader is cleaved by proteolysis and is removed from the final active protein the cterminus must be critical for its function since mutations in this region causes the hyperplasia discussed above models of sr suggest that it is similar to related protein that have a Î²barrel structure with a hydrophobic binding pocket which can bind cholesterol if the first nterminal amino acids are removed from the precursor preprotein the protein n sr retains activity when added to luvs with a lipid composition similar to the om only the cterminal alpha helical end of the protein
