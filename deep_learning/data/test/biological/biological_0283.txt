protein is not large enough to pass cholesterol these results show that the protein must change conformations to elicit its biological activity the experiments described below were done to determine if a conformational change occurs in the protein on interaction with lipids and whether a molten globule state of the protein is formed a model structure of n sr is shown below in figure a it has a tightly folded nterminal domain and a more loosely folded cterminal domain a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein under different protonation states was done in a bath of water molecules in order
