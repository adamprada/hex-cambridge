would be more consistent with a molten globule conformation do these structures support the notion that the protein might interact with the membrane through its cterminal helix snapshots of molecular dynamics simulations were taken every picoseconds and the distance between the cγ of asp d in the ω loop and the guanidino group of arg r on the cterminal alpha helix was determined and represented graphically below in figure c top panel below same color coding as before the bottom panel in c shows the distance between asp d and arg r figure movement of the star molecule during molecular
