ala they changed them to cys and created in silico the following mutation pairs in single letter code scsc and dcac note da mutant places the c closer to the end of the c helix than in the ss mutant where the c is position why did they believe that changes these amino acids to cys would not dramatically change the folding of the protein energy minimization results showed that the cα backbone of the cterminal helix or ω loop did not change what would the likely effect be on the local structure in the vicinity of the pair how
