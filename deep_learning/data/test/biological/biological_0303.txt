and the introns are sliced out and exons joined in a contiguous stretch to form messenger rna which leaves the nucleus translation occurs in the cytoplasm remember prokaryotes do not have a nucleus animation of transcription animation of mrna splicing translation if information in a mrna sequence is decoded to form a protein in this process a triplet of nucleotides a codon in the rna has the information of a single amino acid translation occurs on a large rnaprotein complex called the ribosome an intermediary transfer rna trna molecule becomes covalently linked to a single amino acid by the enzyme
