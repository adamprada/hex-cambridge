in eukaryotes and prokaryotes animation of translation as was mentioned in the protein chapter amino acid section two other amino acids occasionally appear in proteins excluding amino acids altered through posttranslational modification one is selenocysteine which is found in arachea eubacteria and animals the other is just recently found is pyrrolysine found on arachea these new amino acids derive from modification of sertrna and probably lystrna after the trna is charged with the normal amino acid to produce selenocystrna and pyrrolystrna respectively the pyrrolystrna recognizes the mrna codon uag which is usually a stop codon while selenocystrna recognizes uga also
