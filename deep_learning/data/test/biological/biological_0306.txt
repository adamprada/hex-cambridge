genes or splice sites to remove intron rna comparing putative gene sequences for homology with known genes from different organisms but avoiding sequences that might be conserved regulatory regions identification of rna transcripts or expressed protein which does not require dna sequence analysis as the top three steps do inactivating chemically or through specific mutagenesis a gene product rna or protein new findings make it even more complicated to define a gene especially if the transcripts of a gene region are studied cheng et al studied all transcripts from different human chromosomes and different cell lines they found a large
