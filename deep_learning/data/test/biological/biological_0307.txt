with this property can be classified in two ways group introns found commonly in yeast algae viruses and plant mitochondria and chloroplasts after they have been spliced out of transcribed rna these rna sequences ultimately get translated into proteins with endonuclease activity these translated proteins differ from typical protein restriction enzymes which bind and cleave dna at specific dna sites of about six base pairs leading to many cleavages of chromosomal dna given the high probability of finding such sites in a large genome group protein introns recognize specific sequences of base pairs which would be found randomly distributed in
