the endonuclease and its rna coding sequences are involved in ultimate insertion of intron dna carried on a plasmid into a specific site in host dna the rna which is easier to engineer than proteins facilitates specific insertion of intron dna into host dna such insertions can be used to knockout specific genes with high specificity a dna sequence can be added by linking a gene of interest to the intron dna of the plasmid another form of novel junk dna involves the transcription and ultimate translation of a gene whose structure predicts should be larger than the actual protein
