protein folding and requires no enzymes the biological role if any of inteins is not clear however they can be used in the laboratory in the production and purification of eukaryotic proteins in bacterial whose expression in the absence of an intein produces a protein that is toxic to the bacterial cell or difficult to purify figure mechanism of intein splicing powerpoint animation of protein splicing from new england biolabs the intein database mutations the figures below show the types of mutations and how point mutations can occur from mismatch pairing incorporation of base analogs and from chemical mutagenesis figure
