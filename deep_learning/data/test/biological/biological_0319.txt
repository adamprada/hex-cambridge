instance attaching some molecule that binds to a unique sequence in the major groove of a given fragment to a big bead and using that bead to separate out that one unique fragment you would need a different bead for each unique fragment the best way to separate the fragments from each other is to base the separation on the actual size of the fragment by using electrophoresis on an agarose or polyacrylamide gel a carbohydrate extract called agarose is made from algae water is added to the extract which is then heated the carbohydrate extract dissolves in the water
