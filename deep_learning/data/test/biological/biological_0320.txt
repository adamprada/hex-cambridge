electrode is placed at the other end if a voltage is applied across the agarose slab the negatively charged dna fragments will move through the agarose gel toward the positive electrode this migration of charged molecules in solution toward an oppositely charged electrode is called electrophoresis pretend you are one of the fragments to you the gel looks like a tangle cobweb you sneak your way through the openings in the web as you move straight forward to the positive electrode the larger the fragment the slower you move because it is hard to get through the tangled web conversely
