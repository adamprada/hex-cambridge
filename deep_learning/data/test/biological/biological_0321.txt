single stranded piece of dna the complementary strand is synthesized four different reaction mixtures are set up each contain all radioactive deoxynucleotides datp dctp dgtp dttp required for the reaction and dna polymerase in addition dideoxyatp ddatp is added to one reaction tube the datp and ddatp attach randomly to the growing end of the complementary stranded if ddatp is added no further nucleotides can be added after since its end has an h and not a oh thats why they call it dideoxy the new chain is terminated if datp is added the chain will continue to grow until
