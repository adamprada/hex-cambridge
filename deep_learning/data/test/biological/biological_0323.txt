the dna fragments have no detectable color they can not be directly visualized in the gel alternative methods are used in the one described above radiolabeled ddxtps where used once the sequencing gel is run it can be dried and the bands visualized by radioautography also called autoradiography a place of xray film is placed over the dried gel in a dark environment the radiolabeled bands will emit radiation which will expose the xray film directly over the bands the film can be developed to detect the bands in a newer technique the primer can be labeled with a flourescent
