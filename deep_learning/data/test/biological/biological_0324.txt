dna polymerase elongates the dna on a template releasing the fluorophore into solution ie the fluorophore is not incorporated into the dna chain the reaction takes place in a visualization chamber called a zero mode waveguide which is a cylindrical metallic chamber with a width of nm and a volume of zeptoliters x l it sits on a glass support through which laser illumination of the sample is achieved given the small volume nonincorporated fluorescently tagged deoxynucleotides diffuse in and out in the microsecond timescale when a deoxynucleotide is incorporated into the dna its residence time is in the millisecond
