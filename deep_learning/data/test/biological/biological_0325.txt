viruses which can infect any cell the dna of the plasmid or virus is engineered to contain a copy of a specific dna sequence of interest the plasmid or virus is then reintroduced into the cell where amplification occurs initially a dna containing a gene or regulatory sequence of interest is cut at specific places with an enzyme called a restriction endonuclease or restriction enzyme for short the enzyme doesnt cleave dna any old place but rather at restricted places in the sequence much as an endoprotease cleaves a protein after a given amino acid within a protein chain instead
