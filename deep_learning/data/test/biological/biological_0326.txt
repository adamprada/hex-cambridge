recombinant dna molecule this technique of dna cloning is the basis for the entire field of recombinant dna technology figure cloning a restriction fragment into a plasmid animation of gene splicing the plasmid can be added to bacteria which take it up in a process called transformation the plasmid can be replicated in the bacteria which will copy the dna fragment of interest typically the plasmid carries a gene that can make the bacteria resistant to an antibiotic only bacteria that carry the plasmid and presumably the insert will grow to isolate the desired fragment the plasmids are isolated from
