when the virus infects the bacteria it instructs the cells to make millions of new viruses hence copying the foreign fragment of interest sometimes cloning or copying a fragment of dna is not what an investigator really wants if the genomic dna comes from a human cell for instance the gene will contain introns if you put this dna into a plasmid or bacteriophage the introns go with it bacteria can replicate this dna but often one wants not to just copy amplify the dna but also transcribe it into rna and then translate it into protein bacteria however can
