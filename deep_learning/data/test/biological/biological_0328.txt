a new method was developed to copy amplify dna in a test tube it doesnt require a plasmid or a virus it just requires a dna fragment some primers small polynucleotides complementary to sections of dna on each strand and straddling the section of dna to be amplified just add to this mixture datp dctp dgtp dttp and a heat stable dna polymerase from the organism thermophilus aquaticus which lives in hot springs and off you go the mixture is first heated to a temperature which will cause the dsdna strands to separate the temperature is cooled allowing a large
