copying dna in the test tube the polymerase chain reaction pcr animation of pcr d editing dna during our studies of protein structure we spent much time discussing how specific amino acids could be covalently modified to either identify the presence of the amino acid or in an attempt to modify the activity of the protein a newer and revolutionary technique has emerged in the last years using recombinant dna technology the gene that encodes the protein can be altered at one or more nucleotide in a way which would either change one or more amino acids or add or
