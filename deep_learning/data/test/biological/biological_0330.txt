probe then take a cell preparation in which the chromosomes can be seen under the microscope to the cell add base which unwinds the double stranded dna helix add the fluorescent probe to the cell and allow double stranded dna to reform the fluorescent probe will bind to the chromosome at the site of the gene to which the dna is complementary hybridization is the process whereby a singlestranded nucleotide sequence the target binds through hbonds to another complementary nucleotide sequence the probe what if you dont know the nucleotide sequence of the gene but you know the amino acid
