sequence of each individual must be different from every other individual in the world with the exception of identical twins the difference must be less than the difference between a human and a chimp which are identical let us say that each of have dna sequences that are identical as compared to some normal human given that we have about billion base pairs of dna that means we are all different in about x which is about million base pairs different this means that on the average we have one nucleotide difference for each base pairs of dna some of
