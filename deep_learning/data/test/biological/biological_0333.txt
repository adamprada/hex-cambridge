of the gel the dna from the gel transfers to the filter paper then a small radioactive oligonucleotide probe complementary to a polymorphic site on the dna is added to the paper it binds only to the fragment containing dna complementary to the probe the filter paper is dried and a piece of xray film is placed over the sheet also run on the gel and transferred to the sheet are a set of radioactive fragments which are not complementary to the probe which serve as a set of markers to ensure that the gel electrophoresis and transfer to the
