denaturants urea guanidine salts and stabilizers glycerol ammonium sulfate on proteins using benzene solubility in water as a model to study the role of hydrophobic effect in protein unfolding and by inference in protein stability interpret graphs of dg dh ds and dcp for the transfer of benzene to water as a function of temperature from the above graph explain if trends in the thermodynamic parameters for benzene transfer into water predict the observed protein unfoldingstability behavior of proteins as a function of temperature give a molecular interpretation of the observed dcp for the transfer of nonpolar molecules into water
