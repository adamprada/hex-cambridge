new sense must play a major role in stability also since proteins are so highly packed compared to a lose denatured state london forces must also play a significant part remember dispersion forces are short range and become most significant under conditions of closest packing opposing folding is the chain conformational entropy just described since proteins are so marginally stable even one unpaired buried ionic side chain or unpaired buried h bond donors and acceptors in the protein may be enough to unravel the native structure leading to the denatured state topic hierarchy thumbnail structure of human hemoglobin the proteins
