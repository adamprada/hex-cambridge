water molecule are tilted at a slight angle due to the presence of lonepair electrons on the oxygen atom through vsepr theory it is shown that ho has a steric number of with two lone pairs and two bond pairs making its molecular geometry bent as a result the angle between the two oxygenhydrogen bonds are approximately which is slightly smaller than the angle typically found in tetrahadralshaped molecules see above image this is due to the particularly strong repulsions by the lonepair electrons on the oxygen atom which pushes the hydrogens closer together than usual each of the oxygenhydrogen
