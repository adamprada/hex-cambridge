bent structure of ho this creates a dipole on the overall molecule with the oxygen end being negatively charged and the hydrogen end being positively charged as a polar molecule with hydrogen atoms ho can undergo hydrogen bonding with neighboring ho atoms in which the oxygen atoms are weakly bonded to hydrogen atoms from other molecules due to the differences in electrical charge see image above this intermolecular attraction makes water a relatively stable substance and gives it physical properties such as a relatively high boiling point c and melting point c compare this to other molecules of this size
