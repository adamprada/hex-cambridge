of hf the stronger hydrogen bond of f compared with that of other halide anions decreases the thermodynamic activity of ho the acidity of oxo acids such as phosphoric acid sulfuric acid nitric acid and perchloric acid is related to the formal oxidation number of p s n and cl namely if the oxo acid hnxom is denoted by honxomn the positive charge on x becomes positive m n and the acidity is higher for larger value of this number the number parallels the ease of dissociation of oh to give a proton acidity is higher in the following order
