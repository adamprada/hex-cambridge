to class a and f cl br i toward those of class b the class a type metal cations are hard acids and class b type ones are soft acids the metal cations which are not much dependent on the kind of halogens have borderline character what should be noticed here is that kf tends to become large for the combination of a hard acid and a hard base or a soft acid and a soft base if the concept is extended from simple metal cations and halide anions to general lewis acids and bases they can similarly be classified
