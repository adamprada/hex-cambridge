element and oxygen it then took a long time before the present definitions of acidbase and redox reactions were proposed and the old definitions were no longer satisfactory furthermore the lewis acid accepts an electron pair from a base forming a lewis acidbase complex and the oxidizing agent accepts electrons from a reducing agent and is reduced the fact that acids and oxidizing agents are electron acceptors and that bases and reducing agents are electron donors is one of the causes of this confusion problems the latimer diagram of oxygen is shown below write the oxidation number of oxygen in
