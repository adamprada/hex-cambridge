the more general term hydron covers all isotopes of hydrogen the swedish chemist svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions h in an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of h ions in the water note that chemists often write haq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acidbase reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus does not exist alone in water it exists in a hydrated form which for simplicity is often written as the hydronium hydroxonium ion ho thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a
