hydroxide because the numbers are equal pure water is neutral not acidic or basic and has an electrical conductivity of microsiemen Î¼s m for comparison sea waters conductivity is about one million times higher s m an arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium ions note to qualify as an arrhenius acid upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise an increase in the aqueous hydronium concentration or a decrease in the aqueous hydroxide concentration conversely
