conjugate acid hb most acidbase reactions are fast so that the components of the reaction are usually in dynamic equilibrium with each other brønstedlowry acids and bases while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it has limitations in chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acidbase reactions involve the transfer of a hydron a brønstedlowry acid or simply brønsted acid is a species that donates a hydron to a brønstedlowry base the brønstedlowry acidbase theory has several advantages over the arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of acetic acid chcooh both theories easily
