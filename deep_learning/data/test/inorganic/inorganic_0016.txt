a lewis acid is a species that reacts with a lewis base to form a lewis adduct the lewis acid accepts a pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor brønsted acidbase reactions involve hydron transfer reactions while lewis acidbase reactions involve electron pair transfers all brønsted acids are lewis acids but not all lewis acids are brønsted acids bf f bf nh h nh in the first example bf is a lewis acid since it accepts an electron pair from the fluoride ion this reaction cannot be described in terms of the
