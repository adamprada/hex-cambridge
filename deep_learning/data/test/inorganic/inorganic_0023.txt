d electrons does not require a large amount of energy and examples of compounds with acid ligands are known in which all the f d s and p orbitals participate in bonding trivalent compounds are the most common but other oxidation states are not uncommon especially thorium protactinium uranium and neptunium tend to assume the or higher oxidation state because their radioactivity level is low thorium and uranium which are found as minerals can be handled legally in a normal laboratory compounds such as tho thcl uo ucl ucl ucl uf etc find frequent use especially uranium hexafluoride uf is
