electropositive elements give up their electrons when they make compounds with electronegative elements they can also gain an electron to achieve a noble gasns configuration this is possible with strong electron donors such as alkali metals especially when the cation that is formed is stabilized by coordination to a crown ether typically these compounds are synthesized by combining the alkali metal and the appropriate crown ether in liquid ammonia and then evaporating the ammonia cavities and channels in an electride electride salts are formed under similar conditions except in this case the anion is simply an electron that exists in
