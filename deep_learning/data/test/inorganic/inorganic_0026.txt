in the birch reduction in which aromatic compounds are hydrogenated to produce dienes electrides are also useful for reducing metal ions to metals evaporation of blue electride solutions in anhydrous ammonia affords a mirror of na such solutions slowly lose their color as the electrons reduce ammonia to the amide anion it is interesting to consider in the context of lattice energies and bornhaber cycles what might happen without these ligands present that is we can ask the question of whether sodium metal would prefer to exist in the metallic form as nas or to form the sodide salt nana
