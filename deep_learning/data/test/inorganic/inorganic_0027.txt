surprising result from these calculations is that sodium would be marginally stable as a sodide salt and very stable by kj as an electride all the terms in these simple cycles are known precisely but we must be doing something wrong here because nas is clearly metallic the key subtle point here is that bornhaber cycles consider only the potential energy rather than the total energy of the substances in the cycle normally we can ignore the kinetic energy part of the total energy but in this case we cannot because of the quantum mechanical effect of resonance no headers
