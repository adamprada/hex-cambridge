the allredrochow electronegativity is no more rigid than the pauling electronegativity electronegativity pauling established electronegativity as the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electron to itself it is a measure of the atoms ability to attract electron to itself while the electron is still attached to another atom the higher the values the more likely that atom can pull electron from another atom and into itself electronegativity correlates with bond polarity ionization energy electron affinity effective nuclear charge and atomic size table pauling electronegativity values h li be b c n o f na mg al si
