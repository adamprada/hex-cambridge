electron unlike the rest of the group metals the elements in the halogen group usually have the highest electronegativity values because they only need to attract one valence electron to complete the octet in their outer shell whereas the group elements except for hydrogen are willing to give up their only valence electron so they can fulfill having a complete filled outer shell slaters rules slaters rules are rules that provides the values for the effective nuclear charge concept or these rules are based on experimental data for electron promotion and ionization energies and is determined from this equation where
