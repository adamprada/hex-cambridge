the inner core electrons will shield the outer core electrons from the nucleus not only would the outer core electrons experience effective nuclear charge but it will make them easily removed from the outer shell thus it is easier for outer electrons to penetrate the p shell which has little likelihood of being near the nuclear rather than the s shell consider this each of the outer electron in the ns np group contributes s s in the n shell and s in the n or lower shells example slaters rules lets consider this example of finding the for s
