in the periodic table oxides of metallic elements are generally basic oxides and oxides of nonmetallic elements acidic oxides take for example the reactions with water of calcium oxide a metallic oxide and carbon dioxide a nonmetallic oxide caos hol caoh cog hol hcoaq calcium oxide reacts with water to produce a basic solution of calcium hydroxide whereas carbon dioxide reacts with water to produce a solution of carbonic acid there is a gradual transition from basic oxides to acidic oxides from the lower left to the upper right in the periodic table basicity of the oxides increase with increasing
