in most cases our analyte is in solution form if our sample is a solid then we must bring it into solution before the analysis when analyzing a lake sediment for cu zn and fe for example we bring the analytes into solution as cu zn and fe by extracting them with a suitable reagent for this reason only the introduction of solution samples is considered in this text what reagent we choose to use depends on our research goals if we need to know the total amount of metal in the sediment then we might use a microwave digestion
