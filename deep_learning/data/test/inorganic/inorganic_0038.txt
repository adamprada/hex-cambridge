cucl for example leaves us with solid particulates of cucl converting the particulate cucl to gas phases atoms of cu and cl requires thermal energy there are two common atomization methods flame atomization and electrothermal atomization although a few elements are atomized using other methods flame atomizer figure shows a typical flame atomization assembly with closeup views of several key components in the unit shown here the aqueous sample is drawn into the assembly by passing a highpressure stream of compressed air past the end of a capillary tube immersed in the sample when the sample exits the nebulizer it
