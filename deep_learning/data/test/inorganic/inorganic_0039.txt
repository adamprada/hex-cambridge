showing the burner slot where the flame is located b the nebulizers impact bead and c the interior of the spray chamber although the unit shown here is from an older instrument the basic components of a modern flame aa spectrometer are the same burner the slot burner in figure a provides a long optical pathlength and a stable flame because absorbance increases linearly with the path length a long path length provides greater sensitivity a stable flame minimizes uncertainty due to fluctuations in the flame the burner is mounted on an adjustable stage that allows the entire assembly to
