cr the concentration of free atoms is greatest just above the burner head for metals such as ag which are difficult to oxidize the concentration of free atoms increases steadily with height figure other atoms show concentration profiles that maximize at a characteristic height figure absorbance versus height profiles for ag and cr in flame atomic absorption spectroscopy flame the flames temperature which affects the efficiency of atomization depends on the fueloxidant mixture several examples of which are listed in table of these the airacetylene and the nitrous oxideacetylene flames are the most popular normally the fuel and oxidant are
