is typically cm above the primary combustion zone as atoms approach the flames secondary combustion zone the decrease in temperature allows for formation of stable molecular species figure profile of typical flame using a slot burner the relative size of each zone depends on many factors including the choice of fuel and oxidant and their relative proportions sample introduction the most common means for introducing samples into a flame atomizer is a continuous aspiration in which the sample flows through the burner while we monitor the absorbance continuous aspiration is sample intensive typically requiring from ml of sample flame microsampling
