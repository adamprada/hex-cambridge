short time dip sampling is usually accomplished with an automatic sampler the signal for flame microsampling is a transitory peak whose height or area is proportional to the amount of analyte that is injected advantages and disadvantages of flame atomization the principal advantage of flame atomization is the reproducibility with which the sample is introduced into the spectrophotometer a significant disadvantage to flame atomizers is that the efficiency of atomization may be quite poor there are two reasons for poor atomization efficiency first the majority of the aerosol droplets produced during nebulization are too large to be carried to the
