of a flame a typical electrothermal atomizer also known as a graphite furnace consists of a cylindrical graphite tube approximately cm in length and mm in diameter as shown in figure the graphite tube is housed in an sealed assembly that has optically transparent windows at each end a continuous stream of an inert gas is passed through the furnace protecting the graphite tube from oxidation and removing the gaseous products produced during atomization a power supply is used to pass a current through the graphite tube resulting in resistive heating figure diagram showing a crosssection of an electrothermal analyzer
