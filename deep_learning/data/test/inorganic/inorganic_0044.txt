stage the sample is atomized by rapidly increasing the temperature to between oc the result is a transient absorbance peak whose height or area is proportional to the absolute amount of analyte injected into the graphite tube together the three stages take approximately s with most of this time used for drying and ashing the sample electrothermal atomization provides a significant improvement in sensitivity by trapping the gaseous analyte in the small volume within the graphite tube the analytes concentration in the resulting vapor phase may be as much as greater than in a flame atomization this improvement in sensitivityand
