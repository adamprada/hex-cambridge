absorption spectrum because atomic absorption lines are narrow we need to use a line source instead of a continuum source compare for example figure with figure the effective bandwidth when using a continuum source is roughly larger than an atomic absorption line thus pt p t and a because a hollow cathode lamp is a line source pt and p have different values giving a t and a figure photo of a typical multielemental hollow cathode lamp the cathode in this lamp is fashioned from an alloy containing co cr cu fe mn and ni and is surrounded by a
