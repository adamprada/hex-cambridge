consideration is the intensity of the emission line if several emission lines meet our need for sensitivity we may wish to use the emission line with the largest relative p because there is less uncertainty in measuring p and pt when analyzing samples containing mg crl for example the first three wavelengths in table provide an appropriate sensitivity the wavelengths of nm and nm however have a greater p and will provide less uncertainty in the measured absorbance table atomic emission lines for a cr hollow cathode lamp wavelength nm slit width nm mg crl giving a p relative the
