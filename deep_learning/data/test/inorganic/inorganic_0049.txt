solvent if the sample is not soluble it may be digested either on a hotplate or by microwave using hno hso or hclo alternatively we can extract the analyte using a soxhlet extractor liquid samples may be analyzed directly or extracted if the matrix is incompatible with the method of atomization a serum sample for instance is difficult to aspirate when using flame atomization and may produce an unacceptably high background absorbance when using electrothermal atomization a liquidliquid extraction using an organic solvent and a chelating agent is frequently used to concentrate analytes dilute solutions of cd co cu fe
