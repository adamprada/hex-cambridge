is its effect on the measured absorbance among the products of combustion are molecular species that exhibit broad absorption bands and particulates that scatter radiation from the source if we fail to compensate for these spectral interference then the intensity of transmitted radiation decreases the result is an apparent increase in the samples absorbance fortunately absorption and scattering of radiation by the flame are corrected by analyzing a blank spectral interferences also occur when components of the samples matrix other than the analyte react to form molecular species such as oxides and hydroxides the resulting absorption and scattering constitutes the
