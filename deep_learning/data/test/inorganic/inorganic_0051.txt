eliminated by increasing the atomization temperature for example by switching to a higher temperature flame it may be possible to prevent the formation of interfering oxides and hydroxides if the identity of the matrix interference is unknown or if it is not possible to adjust the flame or furnace conditions to eliminate the interference then we must find another method to compensate for the background interference several methods have been developed to compensate for matrix interferences and most atomic absorption spectrophotometers include one or more of these methods one of the most common methods for background correction is to use
