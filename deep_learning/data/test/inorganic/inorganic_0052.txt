wavelengths passed by the monochromator if this is not true subtracting the two absorbances may underestimate or overestimate the background other methods of background correction have been developed including zeeman effect background correction and smithhieftje background correction both of which are included in some commercially available atomic absorption spectrophotometers consult the chapters additional resources for additional information minimizing chemical interferences the quantitative analysis of some elements is complicated by chemical interferences occurring during atomization the two most common chemical interferences are the formation of nonvolatile compounds containing the analyte and ionization of the analyte one example of the formation of
