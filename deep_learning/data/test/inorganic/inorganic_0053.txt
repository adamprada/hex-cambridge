fuel and oxidant another approach is to add a releasing agent or a protecting agent to the samples a releasing agent is a species that reacts with the interferent releasing the analyte during atomization adding sr or la to solutions of ca for example minimizes the effect of po and al by reacting in place of the analyte thus adding ppm srcl to the capo and caal mixtures described in the previous paragraph increased the absorbance to a protecting agent reacts with the analyte to form a stable volatile complex adding ww edta to the capo solution described in the
