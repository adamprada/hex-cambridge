left preventing the analytes ionization potassium and cesium are frequently used as an ionization suppressor because of their low ionization energy standardizing the method because beers law also applies to atomic absorption we might expect atomic absorption calibration curves to be linear in practice however most atomic absorption calibration curves are nonlinear or linear for only a limited range of concentrations nonlinearity in atomic absorption is a consequence of instrumental limitations including stray radiation from the hollow cathode lamp and the variation in molar absorptivity across the absorption line accurate quantitative work therefore often requires a suitable means for computing
