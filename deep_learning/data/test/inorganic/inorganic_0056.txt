tissue weight ffdt the sample is digested at oc for h using ml of m hno after centrifuging at rpm for minutes the supernatant is transferred to a ml volumetric flask the digestion is repeated two more times for hours each using ml aliquots of m hno these supernatants are added to the ml volumetric flask which is diluted to volume with m hno the concentrations of cu and zn in the diluted supernatant are determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy using an airacetylene flame and external standards copper is analyzed at a wavelength of nm with a slit width
