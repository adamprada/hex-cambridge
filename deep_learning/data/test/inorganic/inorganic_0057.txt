the analysis of cu background correction compensates for background absorption and scattering due to interferents in the sample such interferences are most severe when using a wavelength less than nm this is the case for zn but not for cu a cu hollow cathode lamp has several emission lines explain why this method uses the line at nm wavelength nm slit width nm mg cul for a p relative with mg cul giving an absorbance of the emission line at nm has the best sensitivity in addition it is the most intense emission line which decreases the uncertainty in the
