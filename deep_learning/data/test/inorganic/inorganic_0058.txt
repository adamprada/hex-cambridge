gives the concentration of copper as Î¼gml the concentration of copper in the tissue sample therefore is evaluation of atomic absorption spectroscopy scale of operation atomic absorption spectroscopy is ideally suited for the analysis of trace and ultratrace analytes particularly when using electrothermal atomization for minor and major analyte sample can be diluted before the analysis most analyses use a macro or a meso sample the small volume requirement for electrothermal atomization or flame microsampling however makes practical the analysis micro and ultramicro samples see figure to review the meaning of macro and meso for describing samples and the meaning
