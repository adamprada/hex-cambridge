the principle limitation is the variation in the concentration of free analyte atoms resulting from variations in the rate of aspiration nebulization and atomization when using a flame atomizer and the consistency of injecting samples when using electrothermal atomization sensitivity the sensitivity of a flame atomic absorption analysis is influenced strongly by the flames composition and by the position in the flame from which we monitor the absorbance normally the sensitivity of an analysis is optimized by aspirating a standard solution of the analyte and adjusting operating conditions such as the fueltooxidant ratio the nebulizer flow rate and the height
