width of absorption lines atomic absorption provides excellent selectivity atomic absorption can be used for the analysis of over elements at concentrations at or below the level of Î¼gl time cost and equipment the analysis time when using flame atomization is short with sample throughputs of determinations per hour when using a fully automated system electrothermal atomization requires substantially more time per analysis with maximum sample throughputs of determinations per hour the cost of a new instrument ranges from between for flame atomization and from for electrothermal atomization the more expensive instruments in each price range include doublebeam optics automatic
