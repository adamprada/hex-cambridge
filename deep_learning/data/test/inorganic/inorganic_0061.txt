combine to form a band we would expect the band to be completely filled since mg has two electrons per orbital by this reasoning solid mg should be an insulator but mg has all the properties of a metal high electrical and thermal conductivity metallic luster malleability etc in this case the s and p bands are sufficiently broad because of strong orbital overlap between mg atoms that they form a continuous band this band which contains a total of four orbitals one s and three p per atom is only partially filled by the two valence electrons mg crystals
