use them to calculate the bonding energy from this we learn that each s or p electron is worth about kjmol in bonding energy the concepts of promotion energy and bonding energy are very useful in rationalizing periodic trends in the bond strengths and magnetic properties of metals which are described below the cohesive energy of mg metal is the difference between the bonding and promotion energies the ground state of a gas phase mg atom is ars but it can be promoted to the arsp state which is kjmol above the ground state mg uses two electrons per atom
