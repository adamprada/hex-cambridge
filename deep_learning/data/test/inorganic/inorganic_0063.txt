d elements relative to those in the d and d series in the d series the contraction of orbitals affects the ability of the d electrons to contribute to bonding past v in the first row of the transition metals the d electrons become much less effective in bonding because they overlap weakly with their neighbors weak overlap of d orbitals gives narrow dbands and results in the emergence of magnetic properties as discussed below schematic representation of the sizes of different orbitals of cr and w in the first transition series shielding of the d orbitals is poor therefore
