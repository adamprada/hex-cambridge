of bonding electrons and therefore the bonding energy increases steadily going from rb to mo in the d series and from cs to w in the d series mo and w have the most bonding energy because they can use all six of their valence electrons in bonding without promotion elements past mo and w have more d electrons but some of them are spin paired and so some promotion energy is needed to prepare these electrons for bonding for example pt metal must be promoted from the sd atomic ground state to sdp in order to make six bonds
