zn are distinctly different from the d and d elements in their bonding and consequently in their magnetic properties in the d series we see the expected increase in cohesive energy going from ca s to sc sd to ti sd to v sd but then something very odd happens the d series has a crater in the cohesive energy plot where there was a peak in the d series the cohesive energy actually decreases going from v to mn even though the number of valence electrons is increasing we can explain this effect by remembering that the d orbitals
