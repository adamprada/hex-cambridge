and magnetism before in chapter in the context of paramagnetic transition metal complexes it is worth recalling that this behavior is predicted in the energy vs distance diagram of the hydrogen atom from chapter at short interatomic distances or with strong overlap between atomic orbitals the spins of the electrons pair and a bond is formed unpairing the electrons becomes favorable at larger interatomic distances where the overlap between orbitals is poor with strong overlap between orbitals of neighboring atoms the bonding energy exceeds the pairing energy and electrons spinpair with weaker overlap bonding is weak and spins unpair resulting
