because of forbital contraction experimentally ceo ero and hoo are observed to be hydrophobic whereas main group and early transition metal oxides eg alo sio tio are quite hydrophilic late transition metal alloys although the bonding in the d series follows a normal volcano plot the situation is a bit more complex for alloys of re os ir pt and au there is strong overlap between the d orbitals but because these elements contain more than five delectrons per atom they cannot make as many bonds as d or d elements with halffilled dshells such as mo or w this
