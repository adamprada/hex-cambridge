refractory metal carbide the favorable combination of early and late transition metals has been interpreted as arising from a delectron acidbase interaction for example in hfpt hf is the acid with an electron configuration of sd while pt is the base with the electron configuration of sd they combine to create a stable salt product with a filled d electron configuration without promoting any electrons to higher orbitals the implication is that pt donates delectrons to the dacid zr or hf however electronic structure calculations on model compounds show that much of the bonding energy in zrpt and zrpt arises
