elements and alloys between cr and ni past ni the elements cu zn ga are no longer magnetic and they are very good electrical conductors implying that their valence electrons are highly delocalized we can understand this behavior by considering the overlap of s p and d orbitals all of which are close in energy the s and p have strong overlap and form a broad continuous band on the other hand the d electrons are contracted and form a relatively narrow band progressing from the early d elements sc ti v we begin to fill the d orbitals which
