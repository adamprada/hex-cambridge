d orbitals are even more contracted and the d band is thus more narrow but now it is completely filled and the fermi level is in the sp band the strong orbital overlap in these bands results in spin pairing and a high degree of electron delocalization consequently metals in this part of the periodic table cu ag are diamagnetic and are among the best electrical conductors at room temperature finally at ge the sp band is completely filled and the solid is a semiconductor progressive filling of the d and sp bands going across the periodic table from sc
