in the cooperative magnetic phenomena described below no headers in studying redox chemistry it is important to begin by learning to balance electrochemical reactions simple redox reactions for example h i hi can be balanced by inspection but for more complex reactions it is helpful to have a foolproof systematic method the ionelectron method allows one to balance redox reactions regardless of their complexity we illustrate this method with two examples example i is oxidized to io by mno which is reduced to mn how can this reaction be balanced in the ionelectron method we follow a series of four
