of ho i io h the left side has a net charge of and the right side has a net charge of step c balance the overall charge by adding electrons h e mno mn ho the left side has a charge of while the right side has a charge of they are balanced ho i io h e the left side has a charge of while the right side has a charge of they are balanced note we did not need to explicitly determine the oxidation states of mn or i to arrive at the correct number of electrons
