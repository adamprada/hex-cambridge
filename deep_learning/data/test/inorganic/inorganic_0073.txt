h h oh mno i io mn ho oh the h oh will become ho so the overall balanced reaction is ho mno i io mn oh again it is a good idea to check and make sure that all of the elements are balanced and that the charge is the same on both sides if this is not the case you need to find the error in one of the earlier steps example redox reaction of so and ho so ho so ho which elements are undergoing redox s and o step write out half reactions balancing the element
