is called the valence band bands will follow a trend as you go across a period in na the s band is full in mg the s band is full in al the s band is full and the p ban is full and so on the probability of finding an electron in the conduction band is shown by the equation the e in the equation stands for the change in energy or energy gap t stands for the temperature and r is a bonding constant that equation and this table below show how the bigger difference in energy is
