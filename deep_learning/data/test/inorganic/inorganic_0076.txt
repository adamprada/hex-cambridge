they overlap there is a continuous availability of electrons in these closely spaced orbitals b insulators in insulators the band gap between the valence band the the conduction band is so large that electrons cannot make the energy jump from the valence band to the conduction band c semiconductors semiconductors have a small energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band electrons can make the jump up to the conduction band but not with the same ease as they do in conductors there are two different kinds of semiconductors intrinsic and extrinsic i intrinsic semiconductors an intrinsic semiconductor
