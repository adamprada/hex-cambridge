equal the number of electrons jumped there are two different kinds of extrinsic semiconductors ptype positive charge doped and ntype negative charge doped problems how do you distinguish between a valence band and a conduction band is the energy gap between an insulator smaller or larger than the energy gap between a semiconductor what two methods bring conductivity to semiconductors you are more likely to find electrons in a conduction band if the energy gap is smallerlarger the property of being able to be drawn into a wire is called answers the valence band is the highest band with electrons
