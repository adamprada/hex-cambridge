take the quantum theory and apply it to solids in walter heitler and fritz london discovered bands very closely spaced orbitals with not much difference in energy in this image orbitals are represented by the black horizontal lines and they are being filled with an increasing number of electrons as their amount increases eventually as more orbitals are added the space in between them decreases to hardly anything and as a result a band is formed where the orbitals have been filled different metals will produce different combinations of filled and half filled bands sodiums bands are shown with the
