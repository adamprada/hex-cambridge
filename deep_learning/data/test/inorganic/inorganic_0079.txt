band is shown by the equation the e in the equation stands for the change in energy or energy gap t stands for the temperature and r is a bonding constant that equation and this table below show how the bigger difference in energy is or gap between the valence band and the conduction band the less likely electrons are to be found in the conduction band this is because they cannot be excited enough to make the jump up to the conduction band element ekjmol of energy gap of electronscm in conduction band insulator or conductor c diamond big
