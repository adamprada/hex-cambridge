between the valence band and the conduction band electrons can make the jump up to the conduction band but not with the same ease as they do in conductors there are two different kinds of semiconductors intrinsic and extrinsic i intrinsic semiconductors an intrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor in its pure state for every electron that jumps into the conduction band the missing electron will generate a hole that can move freely in the valence band the number of holes will equal the number of electrons that have jumped ii extrinsic semiconductors in extrinsic semiconductors the band gap is controlled
