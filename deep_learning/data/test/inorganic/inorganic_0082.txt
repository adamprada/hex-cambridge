orbital in contact with another half filled orbital will hybridize to form a more stable bonding orbital according to the valence bond theory the lone pair of one of the fluorine atoms should overlap to form a pi bond with the boron atom through a double bond in order to complete an octet on the boron atom figure but this does not occur there are two major reasons why there is no pi bond between any of the f atoms and b atoms electronegativity and separation of charge if one were to write out formal charges of the molecule without
