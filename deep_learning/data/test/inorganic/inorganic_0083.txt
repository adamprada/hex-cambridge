and consequently the boron atom would have a formal charge of although this still leaves the bf molecule to have an overall formal charge of the most stable form would be bf with no pi bonds because each of the atoms formal charge is the most stable state is to leave the boron with an empty p orbital the empty p orbital figure bf is a planar molecule because it does not have a lone pair which makes it have a trigonal planar geometry bf is considered a lewis acid because it accepts electrons at its empty p orbital examples
