labels of b atom and the lgos we now construct the mo diagram of bh noticed that the bonding formation only happens to atoms that have the same symmetry labels s orbital and lgo would contribute electron to give spin pairs electrons at the a energy level px and py orbitals would bond to the lgo and lgo which give spin pairs electrons at the e energy level figure mo diagram for the formation of bh there is a detailed explaination that performed in this video references pople john a approximate molecular orbital theory advanced chemistry new york mcgrawhill tx
