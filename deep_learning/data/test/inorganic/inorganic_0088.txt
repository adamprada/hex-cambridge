d orbitals in this bh what are symmetry labels that dorbitals have based on the character table explain why a has the lowest energy level in the mo diagram answers a because e is doubly degenerate molecule orbital bo a e e a has no node so it is stable and has lowest energy compare to e a oxidationb nitrogen fixationc photosynthesis many biological reactions are known to involve metal ions there are also metals recognized as essential elements although their roles in living organisms are not clear bioinorganic chemistry the study of the functions of metals in biological systems
