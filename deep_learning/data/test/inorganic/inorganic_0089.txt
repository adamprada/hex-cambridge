regulated by biopolymers such as proteins and selective reactions are performed examples of actions of metals other than by metalloenzymes include mg mgatp energy transfer nak ion pumping ca transfer of hormone functions muscle contraction nerve transfer blood coagulation are some of the important roles of metals a oxidation oxidation reactions in living systems are fundamental to life and many studies of these systems have been performed in particular the mechanisms of oxygen gas transportation by hemoglobin and monooxygen oxidation by the iron porphyrin compounds named p have been studied at length oxygen gas transportation which has been studied for
