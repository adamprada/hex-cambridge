globin protein dioxygen is transported in blood by being coordinated to ferrous ions in the hem iron unit the fe ii ion is pentacoordinate with four nitrogen atoms of porphyrin and a nitrogen atom of the polypeptide histidine and becomes hexacoordinate when a dioxygen coordinates to it the spin state of fe ii changes from high spin to low spin upon the coordination of dioxygen the high spin feii is above the plane of porphyrin because it is too large to fit in the available space when the feii ion becomes low spin upon dioxygen coordination the size of the
