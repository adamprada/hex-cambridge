energy reduces an ironsulfur complex and is finally used for reduction of carbon dioxide in subsequent dark reactions since charge separation by photochemical excitation is the most important first stage studies on photoinduced electron transfer are have been actively performed using various kinds of porphyrin compounds as models of chlorophylls psi which obtains oxidizing energy by electron transfer converts adp to atp figure chlorophyll a on the other hand the oxidized form of psii oxidizes water through a chain of redox reactions of oxo cluster complexes of manganese and generates oxygen since four electrons shift in the reduction of mniv
