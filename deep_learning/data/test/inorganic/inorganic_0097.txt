of na is ars there are only two valence electrons per unit cell that are shared among eight nana bonds this means that the nana bond order is in na metal a more realistic way to describe the bonding in metals is through band theory the evolution of energy bands in solids from simple mo theory chapter is illustrated at the right for a chain of six na atoms each of which has one s valence orbital and contributes one valence electron in general n atomic orbitals in this case the six na s orbitals will generate n molecular orbitals
