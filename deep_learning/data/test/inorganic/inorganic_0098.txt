can accommodate all six valence electrons adding more atoms to the chain makes more molecular orbitals of intermediate energy which eventually merge into a continuous band of orbitals for na the s band is always halffilled because each mo can accommodate two electrons in band theory the atom chain is extrapolated to a very large number on the order of atoms in a crystal so that the different combinations of bonding and antibonding orbitals create bands of possible energy states for the metal in the language of physics this approach of building the bands from discrete atomic orbitals is called
