is the momentum of the electron a vector quantity m is its mass and v is an average potential that the electron feels from the positive cores of the atoms this potential holds the valence electrons in the crystal but in the free electron model is essentially uniform across the crystal electron wavelength and wavenumber what are the consequences of this model for band theory for a hypothetical infinite chain ie a d crystal of na atoms the molecular orbitals at the bottom of the s band are fully bonding and the wavelength of electrons x the distance between nodes
