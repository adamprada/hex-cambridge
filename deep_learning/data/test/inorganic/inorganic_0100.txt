nodes if there are n atoms in a linear chain the wavelength of the nth orbital is given by λ nan where a is the distance between atoms at this point it is convenient to define the wavenumber of the electron as k which has units of inverse length and is inversely proportional to λ k is also directly proportional to the momentum p like p k is a vector quantity in a d crystal k can be either positive or negative corresponding to an electron moving to the left or right along the chain the most important property of
