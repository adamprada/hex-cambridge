wavelengths do not feel the individual atoms in the lattice and so they behave as if they are nearly free but confined to the crystal near the bottom of the band the electron energy increases parabolically with the number of nodes ke n since the momentum p is directly proportional to n because p is also directly proportional to k we can write this parabolic relationship is followed as long as the electron wavelength is long compared to the distance between atoms near the top of the band the wavelength becomes shorter and the electrons start to feel the positively
