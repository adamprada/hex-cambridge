in the middle of the band for a d crystal at low temperature all the mos below the fermi level ef are occupied and all the mos above it are empty while most of the time we will talk about d crystals that have their maximum dos near the middle of the energy band there are examples of quasid systems such as carbon nanotubes metallic carbon nanotubes have strong optical absorption bands that correspond to transitions between the two regions of high dos the van hove singularities near the bottom and top of the bands singlewalled carbon nanotubes with armchair
