electrons to completely fill a band and the next highest set of molecular orbitals is empty then it is a semiconductor or insulator in this case there is an energy gap between the filled and empty bands which are called the valence and conduction bands respectively although the distinction is somewhat arbitrary materials with a large gap ev are called insulators and those with smaller gaps are called semiconductors we will learn more about the properties of semiconductors in chapter why dont insulators conduct electricity the energy vs dos diagram below shows what happens when an electric field is applied
