can happen only when the fermi level cuts through a partially filled band with a semiconductor or insulator the valence band is filled and the conduction band is empty applying an electric field changes the energies of electrons traveling with and against the field but because the band is filled the same number are going in both directions and there is no net current flow e vs dos diagrams comparing the behavior of metals and insulators in an applied electric field note that in this picture all the molecular orbitals extend over the entire crystal the valence electrons are delocalized
