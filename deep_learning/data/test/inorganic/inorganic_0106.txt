some help from the knowledge gained during the quantum revolution in science in felix bloch had the idea to take the quantum theory and apply it to solids in walter heitler and fritz london discovered bands very closely spaced orbitals with not much difference in energyc the fermi leveld band theory of semiconductors no headers many layered dichalcogenides such as tis and zrs have the cdi structure in these compounds as we have noted above the metal ions are octahedrally coordinated by s interestingly the structures of mos and ws while they are also layered are different in these cases
