figure below compares the splitting of dorbital energies in the octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments the trigonal prismatic structure is stabilized in mos by filling the lowest energy band the dz the dz orbital which points vertically through the triangular top and bottom faces of the trigonal prism has the least interaction with the sulfide ligands and therefore the lowest energy the dxz and dyz orbitals which point at the ligands have the highest energy the dz orbital is lower in energy in this structure than the tg orbitals are in the octahedral structure of tis dorbital splittings and
