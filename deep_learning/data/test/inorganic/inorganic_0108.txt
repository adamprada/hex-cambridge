waals planes of these compounds are relatively unreactive which gives mos its good oxidative stability and enables its application as a high temperature lubricant atoms at the edges of the crystals are however more reactive and in fact are catalytic high surface area mos which has a high density of exposed edge planes is used as a hydrodesulfurization catalyst and is also of increasing interest as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of water to hydrogen layered metal dichalcogenides including mos ws and sns can form closed nanostructures that take the shape of multiwalled onions and multiwalled tubes these materials were
