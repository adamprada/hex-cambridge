in this section research areas in inorganic chemistry will be surveyed on the basis of the classification of the bonding modes of inorganic materials element elementary substances exist in various forms for example helium and other rare gas elements exist as singleatom molecules hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen as twoatom molecules carbon phosphorus and sulfur as several solid allotropes and sodium gold etc as bulk metals a simple substance of a metallic element is usually called bulk metal and the word metal may be used to mean a bulk metal and metal atom or metal ion define the state where every
