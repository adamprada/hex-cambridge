the valence requirements of the component atoms and form discrete molecules which are not bonded together the compounds of main group metals such as liquid tin tetrachloride sncl and solid aluminum trichloride alcl have definite molecular weights and do not form infinite polymers most of the molecular compounds of transition metals are metal complexes and organometallic compounds in which ligands are coordinated to metals these molecular compounds include not only mononuclear complexes with a metal center but also multinuclear complexes containing several metals or cluster complexes having metalmetal bonds the number of new compounds with a variety of bonding and
