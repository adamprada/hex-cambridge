bond forms between elements with close electronegativities however in many compounds there is contribution from both ionic and covalent bonds see section about bondings exercise give examples of solidstate inorganic compounds answer sodium chloride nacl silicon dioxide sio molybdenum disulfide mos the first step in the identification of a compound is to know its elemental composition unlike an organic compound it is sometimes difficult to decide the empirical formula of a solidstate inorganic compound from elemental analyses and to determine its structure by combining information from spectra compounds with similar compositions may have different coordination numbers around a central element
