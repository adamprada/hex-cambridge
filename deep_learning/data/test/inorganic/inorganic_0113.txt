methods for determining a crystal structure and the bonds between atoms can only be elucidated by using them polymorphism is the phenomenon in which different kinds of crystals of a solidstate compound are obtained in which the atomic arrangements are not the same changes between different polymorphous phases with variations in temperature andor pressure or phase transitions are an interesting and important problem in solidstate chemistry or physics we should keep in mind that in solidstate inorganic chemistry the elemental composition of a compound are not necessarily integers there are extensive groups of compounds called nonstoichiometric compounds in which the
