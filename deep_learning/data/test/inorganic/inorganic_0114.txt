changes of the composition of elements are not rare problem express the isotopes of hydrogen carbon and oxygen using the symbols of the elements with atomic and mass numbers and write the number of protons neutrons and electrons in parenthesis superheavy elements the last element in the ordinary periodic table is an actinoid element lawrencium lr z however elements z have already been synthesized in heavy ion reactions using nuclear accelerators these are d elements which come under the d transition elements from hafnium hf to iridium ir and it is likely that their electronic structures and chemical properties are
