and later pearson developed a scale of electronegativities based on the average of the electron affinity and ionization energy of the free a and b atoms which they correlated with thermochemical data and the pauling scale on the pauling scale the least electronegative elements are the alkali metals Ï‡ and the most electronegative are oxygen and fluorine at the upper right of the periodic table carbon and hydrogen have intermediate electronegativities and on the pauling scale respectively the general trend see table below is that electronegativities increase going up and to the right in the periodic table there are some
