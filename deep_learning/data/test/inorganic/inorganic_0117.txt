pauling electronegativities the polarity of bonds is determined by electronegativity differences as a guideline we define bonds as ionic if δχ polar if δχ nonpolar if δχ the polarity of bonds helps us understand noncovalent forces between molecules such as hydrogen bonding and dipoledipole interactions it also helps us interpret the reactivity of molecules for example the sih bond χsi χh is more hydridelike than the ch bond χc χh therefore silanes react with acids to make h whereas phosphines χp and hydrocarbons do not similarly electrophilic substitution reactions occur more readily on sih and ph compounds than they do
