ethylene cc double bond and acetylene cc triple bond should be and 책 respectively which are close to the experimental values of and 책 in a related form the pauling formula can be used to calculate bond lengths when the single bond length d is not available here n and m represent two different bond orders between the same kinds of atoms this tells for example that the difference in length between a triple and double bond dd should be log 책 some bond lengths and bond energies are anomalous for example the ff bond length in f is 책
