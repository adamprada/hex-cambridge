valence orbitals of the fluorine atoms are contracted by the high nuclear charge the cl atom with its larger ne ssp core in contrast has a normal single bond length å that is twice the covalent radius of the cl atom å a similar lone pair repulsion effect explains the anomalously long and weak nn and oo single bonds in hydrazine hnnh and hydrogen peroxide hooh which are both highly reactive molecules trends in covalent radii for pblock elements the covalent radius of f has been difficult to determine because of electron pair repulsion effects early reports shomaker and stevenson
