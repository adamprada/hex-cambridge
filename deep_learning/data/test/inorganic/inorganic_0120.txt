the expected trend of increasing bond strength with increasing electronegativity difference bonds between second row elements c n o f and f are however anomalously weak because of lone pair repulsion for this reason the sif bond is substantially stronger than the cf bond whereas the ch bond is much stronger than the sih bond the strong sif bond is the reason that hf etches glass to produce the sif anion and the strong ch bond is an important factor in the stability of hydrocarbons and other organic molecules average eh and ef bond enthalpies kjmol ch nh oh hf
