and chemical stability perfluorocarbons such as teflon polytetrafluoroethylene cfcfn ptfe are also highly hydrophobic the extraordinary hydrophobicity of perfluorocarbons arises from the fact that cf and cf groups are fatter than ch and ch groups dissolving them in water is therefore more disruptive to the hydrogen bonding network than is dissolving a hydrocarbon fabric treated with fluorosurfactant introductionimplications of born forcesreferencesproblemssolutions born forces are one type of force that acts upon atoms in an ionic lattice in simplest terms because ions have some finite size electronelectron and nucleusnucleus interactions occur and give rise to repulsion forces and electrostatic potential both
