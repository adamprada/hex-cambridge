and the forming of a bond is energetically favorable the negative value of avogadros number x times a madelung constant varies times the absolute value of the charge of the cation times the absolute value of the charge of the anion times the charge of an electron x c all over four times pi times the emissivity of space times the ion radius with is the repulsion coefficient and is the born exponent the second equation is the repulsive force it found by multiplying avogadros number x by a repulsion coefficient and dividing that by the ionic radius raised to
