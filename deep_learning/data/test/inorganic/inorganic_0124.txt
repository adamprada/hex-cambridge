find the units of lattice energy electrostatic potential and repulsion forces all energies are in units of kjmol looking at the equations for born forces and a periodic table what do you expect to have a higher lattice energy most negative enthalpy nacl lif or kcl looking at the equations for born forces and a periodic table what do you expect to have a higher lattice energy most negative enthalpy naoh alo or mgoh what lattice structure type rutile or cscl has the greater relative madelung constant you need not look in a table if you know the shapes of
