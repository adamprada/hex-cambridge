we ignored the van der waals attractive energy of the ions and we assumed that there was no covalent contribution to the bonding lets consider the lattice energy of table salt nacl to calculate the lattice energy we lump together the physical constants where ro is expressed in å now we can calculate the lattice energy for nacl using ro å as we can alternatively construct a bornhaber cycle for the formation of nacl from the elements and calculate the lattice energy as the missing term in the cycle s sublimation energy of nas ip ionization potential of nag d
