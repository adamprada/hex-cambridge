get away with neglecting the van der waals term this is because we used energy minimization to obtain the repulsion energy in the bornmayer equation if we underestimate the attractive energy of the crystal lattice the energy minimization criterion ensures that the repulsion energy is underestimated as well the two errors partially compensate so the overall error in the calculation is small we can do better by explicitly including the shortrange van der waals attractive energy between ions the table below shows results of more detailed lattice energy calculations for ionic fluorides in which the van der waals term is
