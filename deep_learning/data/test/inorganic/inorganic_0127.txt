agi should we interpret the good agreement with values calculated from the ionic model to mean that these compounds are ionic clearly this description is inappropriate for agi where the electronegativity difference δχ is only compare this value to for a ch bond which we typically view as nonpolar a drop of siver nitrate solution when added to a dilute hydrochloric acid solution results in the immediate formation of a white silver chloride precipitate this reaction is used as a qualitative test for the presence of halide ions in solutions the covalent bonding contribution to the lattice energies of agcl
