calculations based on the ionic model work well but they do not necessarily imply that the compounds are ionic no headers crystal lattices can be classified by their translational and rotational symmetry in threedimensional crytals these symmetry operations yield distinct lattice types which are called bravais lattices in these lattice diagrams shown below the dots represent lattice points which are places where the whole structure repeats by translation for example in the bodycentered cubic bcc structure of sodium metal which is discussed below we put one atom at the corner lattice points and another in the center of the unit
