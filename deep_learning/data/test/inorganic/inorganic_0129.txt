cell in which none of the edges are constrained to have equal lengths and none of the angles are ยบ in the monoclinic system there is one twofold rotation axis by convention the baxis which constrains two of the angles to be ยบ in the orthorhombic system there are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes along the three unit cell directions orthorhombic unit cells have three unequal unit cell edges that are mutually perpendicular tetragonal unit cells have a fourfold rotation axis which constrains all the angles to be ยบ and makes the a and b axes equivalent the rhombohedral system
