primitive p lattice points on the cell corners only sometimes called simple bodycentered i lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of the cell facecentered f lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each of the faces of the cell basecentered a b or c lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each face of one pair of parallel faces of the cell sometimes called endcentered not all combinations of the crystal systems and lattice centerings are unique there are
