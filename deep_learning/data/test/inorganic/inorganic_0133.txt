by taking a proton from the solvent water to generate oh acid dissociation base dissociation conjugate acids and bases one important consequence of these equilibria is that every acid ha has a conjugate base a and viceversa in the base dissociation equilibrium above the conjugate acid of base b is hb for a given acid or base these equilibria are linked by the water dissociation equilibrium for which the equilibrium constant kw is x at c it can be easily shown that the product of the acid and base dissociation constants ka and kb is kw strong and weak acids
