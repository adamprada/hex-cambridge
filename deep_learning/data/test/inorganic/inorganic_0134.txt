base its conjugate acid carbonic acid hco is a weak acid the acidbase equilibrium between carbonic acid and bicarbonate is important in maintaining blood ph example household ammonia is a solution of nh in water that ranges from about by weight lets calculate the percent ionization and the ph of the solution solution for a solution that is ammonia by weight assuming that the density is about the same as that of liquid water the analytical concentration of ammonia is gl gmol m the other thing we need to know to solve this problem is the base dissociation constant we
