exists in that form conjugate acids and bases a common misconception is that strong acids have weak conjugate bases and that weak acids have strong conjugate bases it is easy to see that this is incorrect by remembering that kakb kw our definition of a strong acid or base is that k ie that the substance dissociates completely our definition of a weak acid or base is k kw it follows that if ka strong then kb cannot be kw weak in fact strong acids such as hcl dissociate to produce spectator ions such as cl as conjugate bases whereas
