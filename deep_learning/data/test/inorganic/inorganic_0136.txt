neutral oxyacids hso hpo hno hclo etc can be classified as strong or weak following a simple rule first noted by linus pauling if the number of oxygen atoms exceeds the number of hydrogen atoms by two or more then the acid is strong otherwise it is weak for example hclo and hclo where the difference is and respectively are both strong acids hno and hclo are both weak because the difference is in both cases for weak acids the relative strength depends on this difference ie hclo is a stronger weak acid than hocl and on the electronegativity of
