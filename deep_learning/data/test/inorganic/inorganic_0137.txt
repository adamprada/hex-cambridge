example the three pkas of phosphoric acid are and amphoteric compounds some substances can act either as an acid and as a base an example is water ho molecules may either donate a hydrogen ion or accept one this property makes water an amphoteric solvent in the situation where an acid dissociates in solution water is acting as a base conversely water acts as an acid when bases dissociate the strongest acid we can make in ho is h aq and the strongest base we can make in ho is oh aq other examples of amphoteric compounds are oxides and
