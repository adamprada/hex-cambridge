sbo is amphoteric periodic table showing basic blue amphoteric green and acidic red oxides the metalnonmetal boundary is indicated by the gray staircase line solvent leveling solvent leveling is an effect that occurs when a strong acid is placed in a solvent such as but not limited to ho because strong acids donate their protons to the solvent the strongest possible acid that can exist is the conjugate acid of the solvent in aqueous solution this is ho this means that the strength of acids such as hcl and hbr cannot be differentiated in water as they both are dissociated
