a base varies depending on the solvent nonaqueous acidbase chemistry follows similar rules to those developed for acids and bases in water for example in liquid ammonia the solvent autodissociates in the reaction this equilibrium is analogous to the autodissociation of water but has a smaller equilibrium constant k it follows by analogy to water that nh is the strongest acid and nh is the strongest base that can exist in liquid ammonia because ammonia is a basic solvent it enhances the acidity and suppresses the basicity of substances dissolved in it for example the ammonium ion nh is a
