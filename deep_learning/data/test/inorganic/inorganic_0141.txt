under aqueous acidic conditions cannot be protonated magic acid is made by mixing fsoh and sbf their reaction generates the hsof cation which can protonate hydrocarbons at c fsohsbf converts methane into the tertiarybutyl carbocation a reaction that begins with the protonation of methane fluoroantimonic acid hsbf can produce solutions with h down to fluoroantimonic acid is made by combining hf and sbf in this system hf releases its proton h concomitant with the binding of f by antimony pentafluoride which as described below is a lewis acid the resulting anion sbf is both a weak nucleophile and an extraordinarily
