in understanding the reactions of organic molecules note that the order of acidities for hydrocarbons is alkynes alkenes aromatics alkanes this ordering has to do with the hybridization of the carbon atom that forms the carbanion the negatively charged lone pair of the carbanion is stabilized in orbitals that have high s character eg sp vs sp or sp this is because s orbitals have finite probability density at the nucleus and feel the positive nuclear charge thereby stabilizing the extra negative charge on carbon more than p orbitals resonance effects also stabilize carbanions thus cyclopentadiene is more acidic than
