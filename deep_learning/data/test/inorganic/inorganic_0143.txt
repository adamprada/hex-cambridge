molten koh flux according to the acidbase equilibrium it follows that in this very basic solvent water the conjugate acid of the solvent is the strongest acid that can exist the conjugate base of the solvent o is the strongest base this autodissociation equilibrium allows for the acidity of a flux to be easily tuned through the addition or boiling off of water a wet flux is more acidic and can dissolve metal oxides that contain the basic o anion conversely a dry flux is more basic and will cause oxides to precipitate molten hydroxide fluxes can thus be used
