definition encompasses the br√∏nstedlowry definition in that h is an electron pair acceptor when interacting with a base and a base is an electron pair donor in its interaction with h this is illustrated below for the protonation of ammonia boron trifluoride bf acts as a lewis acid when it combines with a basic ion or molecule that can donate an electron pair such a reaction is shown below cebf f bf here the acid is bf and the base is f this acidbase reaction allows boron which is electrondeficient in bf to complete its octet similarly alcl is a
