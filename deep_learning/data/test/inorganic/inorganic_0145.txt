molecules and the product is referred to as an adduct lewis acidity is the basis for coordination chemistry a topic we will discuss in more detail in chapter this is because coordination chemistry involves metal ions that are lewis acids which bond to ligands that are lewis bases determining the strength of metal ion lewis acids there are three determining factors in the lewis acid strength of a metal ion the higher positive charge on the metal the more acidic it is for example al and fe are good lewis acids and their salts make acidic solutions in water but
