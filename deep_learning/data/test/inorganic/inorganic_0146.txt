from a base they form an octahedral molecule or anion neither of the common fivecoordinate geometries trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal is efficient in terms of packing the lewis acidbase reaction forms an additional bond with a relatively small energetic penalty of stretching the existing bonds because f is a good lewis base and also a small anion it can form stable octahedral anions with both main group elements and transition metals for this reason tio and sio dissolve in hf but are unreactive with aqueous hcl and other strong acids lewis bases stabilize high oxidation states an interesting example
