decomposes spontaneously to mnf and fluorine gas this reaction teaches us something interesting and important about the connection between acidbase and redox chemistry acids tend to stabilize low oxidation states and bases stabilize high oxidation states we will see this again soon in chapter in the context of pourbaix diagrams mn is stable in the oxidation state in kmnf where it is surrounded by six basic f anions however the highest stable neutral fluoride of mn is mnf and mnf transiently formed from kmnf spontaneously decomposes to generate fluorine oxide is a better base than fluoride interestingly mn can lose
