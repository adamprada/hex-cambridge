not in any neutral fluoride or fluoroanion the oxidation state occurs in ruo and oso but not in any fluoride of ru or os mo diagram for nhp molecule and p ion mo diagram for nh we can now attempt the mo diagram for nh building on the result we obtained with triangular h notes on the mo diagram for ammonia viewed endon a porbital or an spx hybrid orbital looks just like an sorbital hence we can use the solutions we developed with sorbitals for h to set up the Ïƒ bonding and antibonding combinations of nitrogen sp orbitals
