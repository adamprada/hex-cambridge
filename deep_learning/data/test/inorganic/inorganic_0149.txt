orbital on n is nonbonding the dotted lines show the correlation between the basis orbitals of a and e symmetry and the molecular orbitals the result in the electron nh molecule is three nh bonds and one lone pair localized on n the same as the valence bond picture but much more work p molecule and p ion by analogy to nh we can construct the mo picture for one vertex of the p tetrahedron and then multiply the result by to get the bonding picture for the molecule an important difference is that there is relatively little sp hybridization
