mechanism of catalytic reactions were generally not very clear before the wilkinson catalyst the reppe process which oligomerize aceylenes or the zieglernatta catalysts that polymerize olefins and dienes had been discovered and detailed studies on homogeneous catalysis had been conducted from the viewpoint of the chemistry of complexes consequently catalytic reactions are now established as a cycle of a combination of a few elementary steps that occur on the metals of catalyst complexes coordination and dissociation there must be a process in which reactants such as olefins are activated and react with other reactants after being coordinated to the central
