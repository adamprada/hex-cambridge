the central metal they are regarded as formally anionic ligands after coordination therefore the oxidation number of the central metal increases after an addition reaction as it is an addition reaction accompanied by oxidation of the central metal it is called oxidative addition for example in the addition reaction of an alkyl halide to a tetracoordinate iridiumi complex irclco pph iridium becomes hexacoordinate and undergoes twoelectron oxidation from to since a neutral ri molecule is added there must be no change in the charge of the whole complex and if an alkyl and iodine are anions the oxidation number of
