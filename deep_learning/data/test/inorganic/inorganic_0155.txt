resultant complex appears as if a carbonyl or an olefin has inserted between the mr or mh bond this is called an insertion reaction reaction of a coordinated ligand this is the process in which a coordinated reactant reacts to form a product by coordinating to a metal the reactants take geometrically and electronically suitable conformations it is the basis of catalyst design to control these reaction conditions since a reaction is repeated while the complex used as a catalyst remains unchanged by forming a cycle of reactions the reactantscomplex ratio is very small coinciding with the definition of a
