liquid phases in contact with a solid material since adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface is the initial step a large surface area is required for good efficiency of catalysis polyphase systems which carry active catalysts on materials such as zeolites with small pores of molecular sizes and gamma alumina and silica gel with large surface area are often used previously solid state catalysis was explained as arising from a mysterious activation of reactants due to adsorption but it has become increasingly clear that catalysis is ascribable to surface chemical reactions namely the action of solid state catalysts depends
