to maintain major parts of reaction mechanisms are obscure even for such simple reactions as ammonia synthesis during the direct production of ammonia from dinitrogen and dihydrogen reactions occur using iron catalysts containing alkali metal or alkaline earth metal oxides as activators at high temperatures about c and under high pressures about atm prior to the epochmaking discovery of this process by f haber all nitrogen compounds came from natural resources the realization of this discovery has had an immeasurable influence upon chemical industries as ammonia is indispensable to the manufacture of fertilizers gunpowder and other inorganic compounds containing nitrogen
