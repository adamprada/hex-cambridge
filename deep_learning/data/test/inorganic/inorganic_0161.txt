in between this is also a general rule for cyclic molecules with even numbers of atoms this is the origin of the n rule for aromatics h has four valence electrons and by analogy butadiene has four πelectrons these electrons fill the lowest two mos in the linear form of the molecule corresponding to two conjugated πbonds in butadiene hcchchch in the cyclic form of the molecule the degenerate orbitals are singly occupied the molecule can break the degeneracy and lower its energy by distorting to a puckered rectangle this is a general rule for antiaromatic cyclic molecules n rule
