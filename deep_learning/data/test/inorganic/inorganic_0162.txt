orbitals then we make g and u combinations of the two atoms that we are adding at the ends by combining gs with gs and us with us we end up with the solutions for a string of atoms closing these orbitals into a loop gives us the π molecular orbitals of the benzene molecule the result is three π bonds as we expected benzene fits the n rule n and is therefore aromatic here we have used the isolobal analogy to construct mo diagrams for πbonded systems such as ethylene and benzene from combinations of sorbitals it raises the
