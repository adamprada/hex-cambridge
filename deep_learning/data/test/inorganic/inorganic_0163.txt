and rings of atoms in each case the g and u orbitals form a ladder of mos at the bottom rung of the ladder of an natom chain there are no nodes in the mo and we add one node for every rung until we get to the top where there are n nodes another way of saying this is that the wavelength of an electron in orbital x counting from the bottom xn is nax where a is the distance between atoms we will find in chapters and that we can learn a great deal about the electronic properties
