and can easily bond to more than two other atoms catenation is the bonding between the same chalcogen atoms and both simple substances and ions of chalcogens take a variety of structures the major isotopes of sulfur are s abundance s s and s and there are also six radioactive isotopes among these s i can be used for nmr since the isotope ratio of sulfurs from different locations differs the accuracy of the atomic weight is limited to because the electronegativity of sulfur is much smaller than that of oxygen and sulfur is a soft element the ionicity in
