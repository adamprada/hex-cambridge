the helix polymer of sulfur is an infinitely annular sulfur diatomic molecular s and triatomic molecular s exist in the gaseous phase when sulfur is heated it liquifies and becomes a rubberlike macromolecule on cooling the diversity of structures of catenated sulfur is also seen in the structures of the polysulfur cations or anions resulting from the redox reactions of the catenated species figure structures of s s and s selenium is believed to have six isotopes se is the most abundant and se with nuclear spin i is useful in nmr the accuracy of atomic weight of selenium is
