conductivity b polyatomic chalcogen cations and anions although it has long been recognized that solutions of chalcogen elements in sulfuric acid showed beautiful blue red and yellow colors the polycationic species that give rise to these colors s s s s s s or those of other chalcogen atoms have been isolated by the reaction with asf etc and their structures determined for example unlike neutral s s takes a cyclic structure that has a weak coupling interaction between two transannular sulfur atoms figure on the other hand alkali metal salts nas ks and alkaline earth metal salt bas a
