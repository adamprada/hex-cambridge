the other has a metal in an octahedral coordination environment mos is the most stable black compound among the molybdenum sulfides l pauling determined the structure of mos in the structure is constructed by laminating two sulfur layers between which a molybdenum layer is intercalated figure alternatively two sulfur layers are stacked and a molybdenum layer is inserted between them therefore the coordination environment of each molybdenum is a triangular prism of sulfur atoms since there is no bonding interaction between sulfur layers they can easily slide resulting in graphitelike lubricity mos is used as a solid lubricant added to
