structure of molybdenum atoms is similar to that of molybdenum dichloride mocl moclclcl the structural chemistry of these compounds has attracted as much attention as their physical properties figure structure of snmos in a bond a bonding orbital is a centrosymmetric g orbital whereas an antibonding orbital is a noncentrosymmetric u orbital definitionunderstanding character tables although the method of assigning a point group to a molecule depends on some knowledge of the symmetry elements the molecule has it does not require the consideration of all elements for example the molecule can be assigned the point group using the scheme in
