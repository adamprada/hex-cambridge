binding group which are called monodentate single tooth ligands ethylenediamine en is a bidentate ligand that forms a fivemembered ring in coordinating to a metal ion m consider the two complexation equilibria in aqueous solution between the cobalt ii ion coaq and ethylenediamine en on the one hand and ammonia nh on the other electronically the ammonia and en ligands are very similar since both bind through n and since the lewis base strengths of their nitrogen atoms are similar this means that Î´h must be very similar for the two reactions since six con bonds are formed in each
