δδs is about jmolk we can translate this into a ratio of equilibrium constants using kfenkfnh eδδgrt eδδsr e the bottom line is that the chelate effect is entropydriven it follows that the more binding groups a ligand contains the more positive the δs and the higher the kf will be for complex formation in this regard the hexadentate ligand ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta is an optimal ligand for making octahedral complexes because it has six binding groups in basic solutions where all four of the cooh groups are deprotonated the chelate effect of the edta ligand is approximately this
