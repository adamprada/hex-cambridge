is said to be preorganized for binding and there is little entropy penalty for wrapping it around the metal ion for example heme b is a tetradentate cyclic ligand which is strongly complexes transition metal ions including in biological systems fe heme b some other common chelating and cyclic ligands are shown below acetylacetonate acac right is an anionic bidentate ligand that coordinates metal ions through two oxygen atoms acac is a hard base so it prefers hard acid cations with divalent metal ions acac forms neutral volatile complexes such as cuacac and moacac that are useful for chemical vapor
