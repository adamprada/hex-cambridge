has used metal polypyridyl complexes to study electron transfer reactions that are implicated in the biological sensing and repair of damage in dna molecules crown ethers such as crown below center right are cyclic hard bases that can complex alkali metal cations crowns can selectively bind li na or k depending on the number of ethylene oxide units in the ring the chelating properties of crown ethers are mimetic of the natural antibiotic valinomycin below right which selectively transports k ions across bacterial cell membranes killing the bacterium by dissipating its membrane potential like crown ethers valinomycin is a cyclic
