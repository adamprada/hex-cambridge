symmetry there are some general rules of thumb that help determine whether a molecule is chiral or achiral this can be very useful because sometimes molecules can have relatively complicated structures and geometries that knowing whether or not they are chiral becomes a daunting task the goal as a result is to determine the point group of the molecule and the symmetry elements associated with it then inferring the chirality of the molecule using symmetry to determine chirality for a molecule to be chiral it must lack center of inversion and a plane of symmetry an improper rotation axis rotationreflection
