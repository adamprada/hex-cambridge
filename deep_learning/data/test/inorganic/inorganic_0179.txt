number of covalent bonds is sometimes five eg pcl or six eg sf and the central atom of these molecules shows hypervalency in this case because s and p electrons run short to form more than four electron covalent bonds it was once believed that d electrons were partly involved the present view is however that these hypervalent bonds use only s and p orbitals but that the bond orders are lower than those of single bonds the electrostatic bond between cations positive ion and anions negative ion such as in sodium chloride nacl is called an ionic bond since
