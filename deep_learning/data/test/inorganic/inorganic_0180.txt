conduction electrons originating from the valence electrons of metal atoms the bond due to the conduction electrons in a bulk metal is called the metallic bond generally chemical bonds can be assigned to either of the three kinds mentioned above but new compounds have been synthesized one after another which cannot always be classified by the simple center electron pair covalent bond they include electrondeficient bonds in boron hydrides coordinate bonds in transition metal complexes the metalmetal bonds in metal cluster compounds etc and new concepts have been introduced into bond theory to account for these new kinds of chemical
