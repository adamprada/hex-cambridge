in ice the structure of the double helix of dna deoxyribonucleic acid etc no headers many common inorganic crystals have structures that are related to cubic close packed facecentered cubic or hexagonal close packed sphere packings these packing lattices contain two types of sites or holes that the interstitial atoms fill and the coordination geometry of these sites is either tetrahedral or octahedral an interstitial atom filling a tetrahedral hole is coordinated to four packing atoms and an atom filling an octahedral hole is coordinated to six packing atoms in both the hexagonal close packed and cubic close packed lattices
