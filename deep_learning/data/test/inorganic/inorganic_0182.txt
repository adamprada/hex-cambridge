sites pink and eight tetrahedral sites blue in the nacl structure shown on the right the green spheres are the cl ions and the gray spheres are the na ions the octahedral holes in a facecentered cubic lattice can be found at fractional coordinates and there are four of these holes per cell and they are filled by the chloride ions the packing atoms na have coordinates and note that each of the na positions is related to a cl position by a translation of another way of stating this is that the structure consists of two interpenetrating fcc lattices
