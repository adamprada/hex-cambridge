when this structure was originally solved in by using xray diffraction by w l bragg his interpretation met resistance by chemists who thought that precise integer stoichiometries were a consequence of the valency of atoms in molecules the german chemist p pfeiffer noted in that the ordinary notion of valency didnt seem to apply and fourteen years later the influential chemist h e armstrong still found braggs proposed structure of sodium chloride more than repugnant to the common sense not chemical cricket nevertheless bragg and his father w h bragg persevered and used the thennew technique of xray diffraction to
