four na and four cl atoms per nacl unit cell it is because of this ratio that nacl has a stoichiometry the shaded green and gray bipyramidal structures in the nacl lattice show that the na ions are coordinated to six cl ions and vice versa the nacl structure can be alternatively drawn as a stacking of closepacked layer planes acbacbacba along the body diagonal of the unit cell here the uppercase letters represent the packing atoms and the lower case letters are the interstitial atoms this layered packing is illustrated below nacl structure a c b a c b
