in closepacked lattices the figure at the right shows some of the most common structures fluorite halite zincblende as well as a rather rare one libi that derive from the fcc lattice from the hcp lattice we can make the nias and wurzite structures which are the hexagonal relatives of nacl and zincblende respectively an alternative and very convenient way to represent inorganic crystal structures especially complex structures such as libi is to draw the unit cell in slices along one of the unit cell axes this kind of representation is shown at the left for the fcc lattice and
