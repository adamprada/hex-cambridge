if the salts contain a common cation or anion these salts contribute to the concentration of the common ion contributions from all salts must be included in the calculation of concentration of the common ion for example a solution containing sodium chloride and potassium chloride will have the following relationship consideration of charge balance or mass balance or both leads to the same conclusion common ions when and are dissolved in the same solution the ions are common to both salts in a system containing and the ions are common ions for example when is dissolved into a solution already
