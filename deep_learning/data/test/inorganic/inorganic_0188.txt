ch√¢teliers principle states that if an equilibrium becomes unbalanced the reaction will shift to restore the balance if a common ion is added to a weak acid or weak base equilibrium then the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants in this case the weak acid or base example consider the leadii ion concentration in this saturated solution of pbcl the balanced reaction is defining as the concentration of dissolved leadii chloride then these values can be substituted into the solubility product expression which can be solved for the concentration of leadii ions in the solution is x m consider what
