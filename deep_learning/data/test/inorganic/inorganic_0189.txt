proportion of the extra chloride ions can be converted into solid leadii chloride the leadii chloride becomes even less soluble and the concentration of leadii ions in the solution decreases this type of response occurs with any sparingly soluble substance it is less soluble in a solution which contains any ion which it has in common this is the common ion effect a simple example if an attempt is made to dissolve some leadii chloride in some m sodium chloride solution instead of in water what is the equilibrium concentration of the leadii ions this time as before define s
