ch√¢teliers principle forming more reactants this decreases the reaction quotient because the reaction is being pushed towards the left to reach equilibrium the equilibrium constant kb does not change the reaction is put out of balance or equilibrium at first when more hydroxide is added the quotient is greater than the equilibrium constant the reaction then shifts right causing the denominator to increase decreasing the reaction quotient and pulling towards equilibrium and causing q to decrease towards k common ion effect on solubility adding a common ion decreases solubility as the reaction shifts toward the left to relieve the stress
