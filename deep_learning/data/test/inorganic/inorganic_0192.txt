the overall reaction would be ss solving the equation for s gives s m the coefficient on cl is so it is assumed that twice as much cl is produced as pb hence the s the solubility equilibrium constant can be used to solve for the molarities of the ions at equilibrium the molarity of cl added would be m because na and cl are in a ration in the ionic salt nacl therefore the overall molarity of cl would be s with s referring to the contribution of the chloride ion from the dissociation of lead chloride notice that
