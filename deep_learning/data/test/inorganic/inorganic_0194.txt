the orbitals as forming a continuous band classically if the electrons in this band were free to be thermally excited we would expect them to have a specific heat of r per mole of electrons however experimentally we observe that cp is only about r per mole this suggests that only about of the electrons in the metal can be thermally excited at room temperature however essentially all of the valence electrons are free to move in the crystal and contribute to electrical conduction to understand this apparent paradox we need to recall that the electrons exist in quantized energy
