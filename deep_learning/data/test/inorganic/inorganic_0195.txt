energy ef of the band the mos have one node for every two atoms we can calculate the de broglie wavelength as twice the distance between nodes and thus λ a at the midpoint of the band where a is the interatomic spacing since a typical value of a is about å we obtain the de broglie wavelength λ å using the de broglie relation p hλ we can write where me is the mass of the electron and vf is the velocity of electrons with energy ef solving for we obtain experimental values of vf are x and x
