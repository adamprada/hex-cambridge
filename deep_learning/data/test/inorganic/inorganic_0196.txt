order to understand the great disparity between the fermi velocity and the drift velocity of electrons in metals we need to consider a picture for the scattering of electrons and their acceleration in an electric field as shown at the left if we apply a voltage across a metal eg a metal wire the electrons are subjected to an electric field e which is the voltage divided by the length of the wire this electric field exerts a force on the electron causing it to accelerate however the electron is frequently scattered mostly by phonons lattice vibrations each time the
