in cu metal at k the scattering time τ is about x s from this we can calculate the mean free path as the mean free path nm å is quite long compared to the interatomic spacing å to put it in perspective if the interatomic spacing were scaled to the length of a football m the mean free path would be over half the length of the football field m thus an electron travels a fairly long way between scattering events and scarcely notices the atomic structure of the metal in which it is traveling to summarize electrons are
