scattering time from f ma we obtain the acceleration a as and thus if we divide both sides of this equation by the magnitude of the electric field e we obtain the mobility μ μ has units of velocityfield cms vcm cmvs an important consequence of the calculation of vdrift is ohms law v ir from the equations above we can see that the drift velocity increases linearly with the applied electric field the drift velocity cms is proportional to the current i couls and the electric field e vcm is proportional to the voltage v here n is the
