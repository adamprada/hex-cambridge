the tight binding approximation we have actually seen linear combinations of atomic orbitals before when we constructed hybrid orbitals in chapter the basic rules we developed for hybridization also apply here orbitals are added with scalar coefficients c in such a way that the resulting orbitals are orthogonal and normalized the difference is that in the mo case the atomic orbitals come from different atoms the linear combination of atomic orbitals always gives back the same number of molecular orbitals so if we start with two atomic orbitals eg an s and a pz orbital as shown in fig we
