φ in principle we need to solve the schrödinger equation for all the orbitals in a molecule and then fill them up with pairs of electrons as we do for the orbitals in atoms in practice we are really interested only in the mos that derive from the valence orbitals of the constituent atoms because these are the orbitals that are involved in bonding we are especially interested in the frontier orbitals ie the highest occupied molecular orbital the homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital the lumo filled orbitals that are much lower in energy ie core orbitals do
