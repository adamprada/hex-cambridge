drops from the lumo to the homo of the molecule as an example of the lcaomo approach we can construct two mos ψ and ψ of the hcl molecule from two aos φand φ fig to make these two linear combinations we write and the coefficients c and c will be equal or nearly so when the two aos from which they are constructed are the same eg when two hydrogen s orbitals combine to make bonding and antibonding mos in h they will be unequal when there is an energy difference between the aos for example when a hydrogen
