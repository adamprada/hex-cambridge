orbital and the resulting mos leaving out the radial node recall that p orbitals have no radial nodes p orbitals have one as illustrated in fig p orbitals have two radial nodes and so on the mos we make by combining the aos have these nodes too figure nodal structure of p and p orbitals normalization we square the wave functions to get probabilities which are always positve or zero so if an electron is in orbital φ the probability of finding it at point xyz is the square of φxyz the total probability does not change when we combine
