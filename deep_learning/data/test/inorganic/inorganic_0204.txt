antibonding mos the energies of bonding and antibonding orbitals depend strongly on the distance between atoms this is illustrated in fig for the hydrogen molecule h at very long distances there is essentially no difference in energy between the inphase and outofphase combinations of h s orbitals as they get closer the inphase bonding combination drops in energy because electrons are shared between the two positively charged nuclei the energy reaches a minimum at the equilibrium bond distance Ã¥ and then rises again as the nuclei get closer together the antibonding combination has a node between the nuclei so its
