operator essentially α represents the ionization energy of an electron in atomic orbital φ or φ the energy difference between an electron in the aos and the mos is determined by the exchange integral β β is an important quantity because it tells us about the bonding energy of the molecule and also the difference in energy between bonding and antibonding orbitals calculating β is not straightforward for multielectron molecules because we cannot solve the schrödinger equation analytically for the wavefunctions we can however make some approximations to calculate the energies and wavefunctions numerically in the hückel approximation which can
