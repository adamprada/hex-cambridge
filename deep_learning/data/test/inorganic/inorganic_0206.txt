c and c for the hydrogen molecule by applying the normalization criterion and in the case where s we can eliminate the s terms and both coefficients become note that the bonding orbital in the mo diagram of h is stabilized by an energy βs and the antibonding orbital is destabilized by βs that is the antibonding orbital goes up in energy more than the bonding orbital goes down this means that h ψψ is energetically more stable than two h atoms but he with four electrons ψψ is unstable relative to two he atoms bond order in any mo
