the larger δα is the more φ character the bonding orbital has ie the more it resembles the cl pz orbital in this case this is consistent with the idea that hcl has a polar single bond the two electrons reside in a bonding molecular orbital that is primarily localized on the cl atom figure molecular orbital energy diagram for the hcl molecule the antibonding orbital empty has more hcharacter the bond order is again because there are two electrons in the bonding orbital and none in the antibonding orbital extreme case ionic bonding naf very large δα in this
