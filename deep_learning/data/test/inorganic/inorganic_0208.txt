generally the total number of mos equals the number of ao basis orbitals we showed the simplest case only two basis orbitals more accurate calculations use a much larger basis set more aos and solve for the matrix of cs that gives the lowest total energy using mathematically friendly approximations of the potential energy function that is part of the hamiltonian operator h more nodes higher energy mo bond order Â½ of bonding electrons of antibonding electrons bond polarity emerges in the mo picture as orbital character aos that are far apart in energy do not interact much when they
