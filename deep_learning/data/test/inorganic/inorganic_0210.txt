step is to determine how many delectrons the fe ion has the rule is to count all of irons valence electrons as delectrons iron is in group so group charge d or d structure of the octahedral ferricyanide anion because the overall charge of the complex is fe is in the oxidation state and its electron count is d the same procedure can be applied to any transition metal complex for example consider the complex cunh because ammonia is a neutral ligand cu is in the oxidation state copper ii in group of the periodic table has electrons in its
