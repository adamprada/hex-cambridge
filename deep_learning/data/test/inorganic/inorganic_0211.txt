predict that ti is d in the octahedral complex tiho but the electronic configuration of a free ti atom according to the aufbau principle is sd why is the ti ion d and not s similarly why do we assign mn as d rather than sd the short answer is that the metal s orbitals are higher in energy in a metal complex than they are in the free atom because they have antibonding character we will justify this statement with a mo diagram in section covalent bond classification cbc method although the electron counting rule we have developed above
