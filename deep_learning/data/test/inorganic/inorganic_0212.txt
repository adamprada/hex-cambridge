referred to as lxz notation was introduced in by m l h green in order to better describe the different kinds of metalligand bonds the molecular orbital pictures below summarize the difference between l x and z ligands of these l and x are the most common types ltype ligands are lewis bases that donate two electrons to the metal center regardless of the electron counting method being used these electrons can come from lone pairs pi or sigma donors the bonds formed between these ligands and the metal are dative covalent bonds which are also known as coordinate bonds
