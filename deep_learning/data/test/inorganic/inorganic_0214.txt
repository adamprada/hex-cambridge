has electrons in its coordination environment which is a particularly stable electron count for transition metal complexes no headers magnetism of transition metal complexescolors and spectra of transition metal complexes the splitting of the dorbitals into different energy levels in transition metal complexes has important consequences for their stability reactivity and magnetic properties let us first consider the simple case of the octahedral complexes mho where m ti v cr because the complexes are octahedral they all have the same energy level diagram the ti v and cr complexes have one two and three delectrons respectively which fill the degenerate
