have a high spin configuration tgeg or a low spin configuration tgeg in which two of the electrons are paired what are the energies of these two states high spin low spin where p is the pairing energy energy difference δo p the pairing energy p is the energy penalty for putting two electrons in the same orbital resulting from the electrostatic repulsion between electrons for d elements a typical value of p is about cm the important result here is that a complex will be low spin if δo p and high spin if δo p because δo depends
