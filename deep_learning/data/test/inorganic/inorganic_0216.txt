orbitals and electrons in the eg set dorbital energy diagrams for high and low spin co complexes d examples of high and low spin complexes coho contains a d metal ion with a weak field ligand this complex is known to be high spin from magnetic susceptibility measurements which detect three unpaired electrons per molecule its orbital occupancy is tgeg we can calculate the cfse as cocn is also an octahedral d complex but it contains cn a strong field ligand its orbital occupancy is tgeg and it therefore has one unpaired electron in this case the cfse is magnetism
