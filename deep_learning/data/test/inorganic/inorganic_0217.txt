field such compounds are attracted to a magnet ie they are drawn into the high field region of an inhomogeneous field the attractive force which can be measured with a guoy balance or a squid magnetometer is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility χ of the complex the effective magnetic moment of an ion µeff in the absence of spinorbit coupling is given by the sum of its spin and orbital moments in octahedral d metal complexes the orbital angular momentum is largely quenched by symmetry so we can approximate we can calculate µs from the number of unpaired electrons n
