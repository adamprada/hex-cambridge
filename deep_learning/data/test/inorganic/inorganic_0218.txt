show larger deviations from the spinonly formula than octahedral complexes of the same ion because quenching of the orbital contribution is less effective in the tetrahedral case summary of rules for high and low spin complexes d complexes can be high or low spin depending on the ligand d d d d d and d complexes always low spin because Î´o is large maximum cfse is for d and d cases eg cr ni with weak field ligands ho o f and for dd with strong field ligands fe ru os co rh ir irvingwilliams series for m complexes the
