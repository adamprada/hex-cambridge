have the highest cfse colors and spectra of transition metal complexes transition metal complexes often have beautiful colors because as noted above their dd transition energies can be in the visible part of the spectrum with octahedral complexes these colors are faint the transitions are weak because they violate the laporte selection rule according to this rule g g and u u transitions are forbidden in centrosymmetric complexes dorbitals have g gerade symmetry so dd transitions are laporteforbidden however octahedral complexes can absorb light when they momentarily distort away from centrosymmetry as the molecule vibrates spin flips are also forbidden
