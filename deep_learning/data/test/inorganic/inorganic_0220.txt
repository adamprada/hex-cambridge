for a d complex usually we are concerned only with the six of lowest energy in which both electrons occupy individual orbitals in the tg set and all their spins are aligned either up or down from left vho lilac vho green voho blue and voho yellow we can see how these microstates play a role in electronic spectra when we consider the dd transitions of the crnh ion this ion is d so each of the three tg orbitals contains one unpaired electron we expect to see a transition when one of the three electrons in the tg orbitals
