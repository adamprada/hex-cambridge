of the excited state orbitals have some zcomponent so the delectron density is piled up along the zaxis the energy of this transition is thus increased by electronelectron repulsion in the second case the excited state configuration is dyzdxzdxy and the delectrons are more symmetrically distributed around the metal this effect is responsible for a splitting of the dd bands by about cm we can show that all other possible transitions are equivalent to one of these two by symmetry and hence we see only two visible absorption bands for cr complexes no headers crystal field theory is one of
