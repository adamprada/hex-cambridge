electrostatic attraction between the metal and ligands which is inversely proportional to the distance between them the second term is the repulsion that arises from the pauli exclusion principle when a third electron is added to a filled orbital there is no place for this third electron to go except to a higher energy antibonding orbital this is the situation when a ligand lone pair approaches an occupied metal dorbital now let us consider the effect of these attractive and repulsive terms as the metal ion and ligands are brought together we do this in two steps first forming a
