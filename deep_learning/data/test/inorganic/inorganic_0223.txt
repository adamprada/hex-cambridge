in these orbitals rises because of the repulsive interaction with the ligand lone pairs the orbitals split into two energy levels when the ligands occupy the vertices of an octahedron but the average energy remains the same the energy difference between the eg and tg orbitals is given the symbol δo where the o stands for octahedral we will see that this splitting energy is sensitive to the degree of orbital overlap and thus depends on both the metal and the ligand relative to the midpoint energy the barycenter the tg orbitals are stabilized by δo and the eg orbitals
