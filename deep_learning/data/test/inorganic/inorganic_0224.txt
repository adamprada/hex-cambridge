to see that these three dorbitals must be degenerate by symmetry on the other hand the lobes of the dz and dxy orbitals the eg orbitals point directly along the bonding axes and have strong overlap with the ligand orbitals while it is less intuitively obvious these orbitals are also degenerate by symmetry and have antibonding character it is informative to compare the results of crystal field theory and molecular orbital theory also called ligand field theory in this context for an octahedral transition metal complex the energy level diagrams below make this comparison for the d octahedral ion tiho
