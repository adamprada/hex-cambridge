all three structures the coordination number of the metal atoms ie the number of equidistant nearest neighbors is rather high for bcc and for hcp and ccp we can contrast this with the low coordination numbers ie low valences like for o for n or for c found in nonmetals in the bcc structure the nearest neighbors are at the corners of a cube surrounding the metal atom in the center in the hcp and ccp structures the atoms pack like stacked cannonballs or billiard balls in layers with a sixcoordinate arrangement each atom also has six more nearest neighbors
