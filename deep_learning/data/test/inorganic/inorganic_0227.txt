periodic trends in structure and metallic behavior remember where we find the metallic elements in the periodic table everywhere except the upper right corner this means that as we go down a group in the pblock lets say group iva the carbon group or group va the nitrogen group the properties of the elements gradually change from nonmetals to metalloids to metals the carbon group nicely illustrates the transition starting at the top the element carbon has two stable allotropes graphite and diamond in each one the valence of carbon atoms is exactly satisfied by making four electron pair bonds
