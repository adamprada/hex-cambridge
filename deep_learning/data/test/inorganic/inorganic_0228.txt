they are hard like diamond like carbon each atom of si and ge satisfies its valence of four by making single bonds to four nearest neighbors the next element under germanium is tin sn tin has two allotropes one with the diamond structure and one with a slightly distorted bcc structure the latter has metallic properties metallic luster malleability and conductivity about times higher than si finally lead pb the element under sn has the ccp structure and also is metallic note the trends in coordination number and conducting properties element structure coord no conductivity c graphite diamond semimetal insulator
