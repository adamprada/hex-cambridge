the bonding in metals as a crystalline arrangement of positively charged cores with a sea of shared valence electrons gluing the structure together because the electrons are not localized in any particular bond between atoms they can move in an electric field which is why metals conduct electricity well another way to describe the bonding in metals is nondirectional that is an atoms nearest neighbors surround it in every direction rather than in a few particular directions like at the corners of a tetrahedron as we found for diamond nonmetals insulators and semiconductors on the other hand have directional bonding
