simpler diatomic mo picture on the right when the s and p aos are well separated in energy as they are for o f and ne the picture on the left results from mixing of the σs and σp mos which are close in energy for li be b c and n the effect of this mixing is to push the σs down in energy and the σpup to the point where the pπ orbitals are below the σp asymmetric diatomic molecules and ions such as co no and no also have the ordering of energy levels shown on the
