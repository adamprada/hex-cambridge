the p orbital this means that as we progress across the periodic table and also as we will see later when we move down the periodic table the energy difference between the s and p orbitals increases as the s and p energies become farther apart in energy there is less interaction between the orbitals ie less mixing a plot of orbital energies is shown below because of the very large energy difference between the s and sp orbitals we plot them on different energy scales with the s to the left and the sp to the right for elements
