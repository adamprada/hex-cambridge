data subsequently confirmed the presence of the paramagnetic o cation which see chapter has a bond order of this formulation implies that ptf was a strong enough oxidizing agent to oxidize molecular oxygen but just how strong an oxidizer is ptf its electron affinity could be estimated by using a bornhaber cycle filling in the lattice energy of optf by means of kapustinskiis formula the electron affinity ea for ptf can be calculated as ea kjmol to put it in perspective this is kjmol more exothermic than the electron affinity of atomic fluorine kj ptf was by far the strongest
