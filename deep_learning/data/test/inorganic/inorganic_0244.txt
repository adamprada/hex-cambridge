using the liverpool d visualization website httpwwwchemtubedcomsolidstatetablehtm determine the anion and cation coordination geometries in cadmium chloride and anatase describe the arrangement of octahedra in terms of whether they share edges faces etc in these structures count the number of atoms in the libi and reo unit cells and determine the coordination environments of each of the ions silicon germanium and many other semiconductors adopt the diamond or zincblende structure assuming that all the atoms are the same size calculate the volume fraction of the unit cell that is occupied by the atoms how does the filling fraction of diamond
