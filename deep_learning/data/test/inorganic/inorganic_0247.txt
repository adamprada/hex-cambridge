of electricity electrical transport properties simply put electricity is the movement of electrons through a material as electrons move through a material it comes into contact with atoms in the material collisions slow the electrons down each collision increases the resistivity of the material the easier the electrons continue through a material the fewer collisions that take place and the higher the conductivity when temperature increases the conductivity of metals usually decreases while the conductivity of semiconductors increases this of course assumes that the material is homogenous which is not always the case you can calculate resistivity using the following
