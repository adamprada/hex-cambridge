an electron colliding with every fifth atom and increases from a temperature of k to k what material will have a greater resistivity why answers to problems ej ρ jeρ vm ωm am evl vm vm evl vir eirl a x ωm vm ej ρ evl jia ρvlia vmam x m ωm ρ σ ρ σ ωm the material that has the greatest resistivity is the metal because as temperature increases metals are more likely to increase in resistivity and semiconductors usually decrease in resistivity as temperature increase contributors michael ford ucd and alexandra christman ucd halfcell potentials using the
