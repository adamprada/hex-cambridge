is spontaneous in the direction shown and has an overall standard free energy change Î´g of kj per mole of water produced when this reaction occurs electrochemically in the spontaneous direction eg in a hydrogenair fuel cell the two half cell reactions that occur are anode cathode here the anode is the negative electrode and the cathode is the positive electrode under conditions of very low current density where there are minimal resistive losses and kinetic overpotentials the potential difference we would measure between the two electrodes would be v in an electrolytic cell this reaction is run in reverse
