potentials as noted above the equilibrium voltage of an electrochemical cell is proportional to the free energy change of the reaction because electrochemical reactions can be broken up into two halfreactions it follows that the potentials of half reactions like free energies can be added and subtracted to give an overall value for the reaction if we take the standard hydrogen electrode as our reference ie if we assign it a value of zero volts we can measure all the other half cells against it and thus obtain the voltage of each one this allows us to rank redox couples
