change per electron dividing the free energy change by the number of electrons see below makes eo an intensive property like pressure temperature etc relationship between e and Î´g for systems that are in equilibrium where n is number of moles of electrons per mole of products and f is the faraday constant cmol here the o symbol indicates that the substances involved in the reaction are in their standard states for example for the water electrolysis reaction the standard states would be pure liquid water h at m concentration or more precisely at unit activity and o and hg
