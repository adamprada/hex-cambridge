state using the nernst equation example for the half reaction e v by definition what is e at ph and ph atm so h m example what is the potential of a fuel cell a galvanic ho cell operating at ph overall reaction in this reaction h is oxidized to h and o is reduced to ho according to our convention we write out and balance both halfcell reactions as reductions for convenience we do this in acid it is left as an exercise to the interested reader to try to work the problem in base half cell reactions toyota
