h and oho half cell potentials at ph e v like all standard potentials this is written as a reduction we need to reverse it and change the sign of eo since h is being oxidized e v and add the standard potential of the substance being reduced at the cathode e v the difference between the two standard half cell potentials is v ecell volts we now use the nernst equation to account for the fact that h is not in its standard state note that the value of ecell does not change with ph since both couples shift
