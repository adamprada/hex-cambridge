shown as dotted lines notice that the potential difference between them is always v the dark circles represent the standard potentials pourbaix diagram for water pourbaix diagrams are essentially electrochemical phase diagrams which plot regions of thermodynamic stability for redoxactive substances as in other kinds of phase diagrams the lines represent conditions under which two phases coexist in equilibrium the shaded area in the water pourbaix diagram represents the conditions of potential and ph where liquid water is stable relative to hydrogen or oxygen outside the shaded region water is thermodynamically unstable and is reduced to hg or oxidized to
