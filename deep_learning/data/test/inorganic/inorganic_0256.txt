a platinumblack electrode immersed in a strong acid solution of activity ah the potential is expressed as and by definition e in the standard state the hydrogen electrode in the standard state is called the standard hydrogen electrode or nhe although reduction potential is usually expressed with reference to the nhe standard the hydrogen electrode is inconvenient to handle therefore a saturated calomel sce or an ag agcl electrode is used as a reference electrode for everyday electrochemical measurements and experimental potentials are measured against these electrodes or converted into nhe values when the nhe value is set to the
