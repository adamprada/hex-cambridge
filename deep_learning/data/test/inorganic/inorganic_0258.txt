the e s of redox reactions can be calculated by combining e of these halfreactions if e of a redox reaction is positive is negative and the reaction occurs spontaneously consequently instead of the free energy change the difference in reduction potentials can be used to judge the thermodynamic spontaneity of a reaction the higher the reduction potential of a reagent the stronger its oxidation ability the positive or negative signs are based on the expedient of setting the reduction potential of a proton to and it should be understood that a positive sign does not necessarily mean oxidizing and
