nuclear charge that valence electrons feel is smaller than the integer charge ze for an atomic number z this reduction is expressed by the shielding constant and the net nuclear charge is called the effective nuclear charge zeff e the effective nuclear charge varies with different electron orbitals and distances from the nucleus b ionization energy ionization energy is defined as the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the atom in a gaseous phase g as shown in the following equation ionization energy is expressed in units of electron volt ev where ev kj mol the st ionization
