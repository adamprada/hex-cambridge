helium he the largest it is understandable that alkali metals generally have the lowest ionization energies because they are stabilized by removal of an s electron to attain the rare gas configuration rare gas elements have stable electronic structures and their ionization energies are the largest although the ionization energy increases almost monotonically from alkali metals to rare gases in each period there are reversals at several places such as nitrogen n and oxygen o and phosphorus p and sulfur s the st ionization energies are given in table table electronic parameters of atoms ev i st ionization energy ae
