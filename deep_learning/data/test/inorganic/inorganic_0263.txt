equation and denoted by ae heg table it may be regarded as the ionization enthalpy of an anion since halogen atoms achieve rare gas electron configurations if an electron is added to them their electron affinities are large d electronegativity electronegativity is one of the most fundamental atomic parameters which expresses numerically the tendency to attract electrons to atoms in a molecule it is very useful in explaining differences in bonding structure and reaction from the standpoint of atomic properties various schemes have been proposed to explain the theoretical basis of the power of electron attraction and studies are still
