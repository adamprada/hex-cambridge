the ab bond furthermore electronegativity was defined in such a way that the difference of the electronegativities of atoms a and b is proportional to the square root of the ionic character here the coefficient is so determined that the electronegativity of hydrogen h becomes when bond energies are expressed in kcal mol since pauling electronegativities increase the higher the oxidization states of an atom these values correspond to the highest oxidization number of each element the electronegativities calculated using recent values of bond energies are shown in table h li be na mg k ca sc ti v cr
