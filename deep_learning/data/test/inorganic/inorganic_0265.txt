values by using r for the covalent bond radius of atoms it turns out that elements with small covalent radii and large effective nuclear charges have large electronegativities table r mulliken defined electronegativity as the average of the ionization energy i and electron affinity ae as follows figure as ionization energy is the energy of electronic excitation from the homo and electron affinity the energy of electron addition to the lumo refer to section e in this definition electronegativity can also be called the average value of the energy levels of the homo and lumo those elements which are hard
