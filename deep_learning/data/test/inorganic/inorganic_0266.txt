and they should be used with considerable caution the electronegativities of the constituent atoms are fundamental to explaining the differences in bonding structure and reactions of compounds therefore theoretical chemists continue in their efforts firmly to extend the foundations of this parameter exercise describe the numerical tendency of electronegativities of the elements in the periodic table answer they increase toward the right and decrease down the table namely the electronegativity of alkali metal cs is the smallest and that of fluorine f is the largest e molecular orbitals the wave functions of electrons in an atom are called atomic orbitals
