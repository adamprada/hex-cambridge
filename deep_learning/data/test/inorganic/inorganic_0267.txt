to generate a molecular orbital which is the wave function of the electrons in the molecule the number of molecular orbitals is the sum of the atomic orbitals and these molecular orbitals are classified into bonding nonbonding or antibonding molecular orbitals by the extent of their participation in the bond between atoms the conditions of the formation of a bonding molecular orbital are as follows conditions of the formation of bonding molecular orbitals the lobes of the atomic orbitals of the constituent atoms are suitable for an overlap the positive or negative sign of the overlapping lobes is the same
