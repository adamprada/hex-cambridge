atomic orbitals the larger the energy difference of a bonding and an antibonding orbital the stronger the bond when there is no bonding or antibonding interaction between a and b the resultant molecular orbital is a nonbonding orbital electrons occupy the molecular orbitals in order of lowest to highest energy levels the highest occupied molecular orbital is called the homo and the lowest unoccupied one the lumo kenichi fukui nobel prize named these orbitals frontier orbitals two or more molecular orbitals of equal energy are called degenerate orbitals the symbol of a nondegenerate orbital is a or b a doubly
