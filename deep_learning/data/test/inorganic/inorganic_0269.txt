dd orbitals figure and pi bonds the overlap of pp pd and dd orbitals figure figure construction of molecular orbitals figure the molecular orbitals figure the molecular orbitals when the wave functions of two atoms are set to and a molecular orbital is a linear combination of the atomic orbitals lcao expressed as only the atomic orbitals of the valence electron shell are used in the simplest molecular orbital method construction of a molecular orbital is illustrated below for the simplest case of the twoatom molecules all the levels below the homo are occupied by electrons and the levels above
