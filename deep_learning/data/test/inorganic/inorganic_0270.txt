and from px and py the orbital energy levels for the molecules from li to n are ordered as and electrons occupy the levels sequentially from the bottom the example of an n molecule with ten valence electrons is shown in figure since the ordering of orbitals is somewhat different in o and f in which the orbital comes under that of the molecular orbital of the oxygen molecule o is illustrated in figure the th and th electrons among the valence electrons occupy the doubly degenerate orbital in the ground state and they have parallel spins under hunds rule
