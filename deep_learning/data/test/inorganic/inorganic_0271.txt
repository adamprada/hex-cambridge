in hydrogen fluoride hf are formed from the s orbital of hydrogen and the s and p orbitals of fluorine as shown in figure the bonding orbital has the s character of fluorine and the antibonding orbital the s character of hydrogen since hydrogen has only one s orbital the overlap with the p orbital of fluorine with character is not effective and the fluorine p orbital becomes a nonbonding orbital since hf has eight valence electrons this nonbonding orbital is the homo figure molecular orbitals of hf in carbon monoxide co carbon and oxygen have s and p orbitals
