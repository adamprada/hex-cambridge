is a half of the number of electrons in the bonding orbitals minus those of the antibonding orbitals for example in n or co it is equal to and is consistent with the lewis structure exercise why are the atomic orbitals of oxygen atom in the molecular orbital diagram of carbon monoxide co lower than those of carbon answer it is because the electronegativity of oxygen is larger than that of carbon problems using the pauling equation calculate the electronegativity of chlorine from the bond energies of the hydrogen molecule h kj mol chlorine molecule cl kj mol and hydrogen
