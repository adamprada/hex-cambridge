orbital these numbers are obtained from the solution of the schr√∂dinger equation for atoms in spherical coordinates n the principal quantum number tells you about the size of the orbital it is related to how far the electron is from the atom it is also related to the energy of the electron can be any positive integer number an orbital has radial nodes as well which describe a radius at which the probability of finding the electron is l azimuthal quantum number lt tells you about the angular momentum of the electron in the orbital it defines the shape of
