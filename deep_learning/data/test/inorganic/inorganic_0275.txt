particle which is only allowed to have equal to or pauli exclusion principle the pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions can share the same quantum state simultaneously an electron being a fermion obeys this principle so no two electrons in the same atom can have the same quantum numbers each orbital has space for electrons with values with opposite sign these electrons are considered spinpaired energies of the orbitals the energies of the orbitals depend solely on and so there are degenerate states that result from various values for example there are p orbitals all of which
