many electrons can have the quantum numbers and list the acceptable values for and for these values how many electrons can have the quantum numbers and which set of orbitals do the quantum numbers and describe how many radial and planar nodes do these orbitals have solutions there may be electrons with these quantum numbers one with and and the other with and this is not a permitted value of for since the greatest acceptable value is given by this represents the d orbitals they have planar orbitals and radial nodes contributors bryn ellison ligand field theorysix coordinate octahedral complexessquare
