formation the spherical negative electric field around a metal cation results in the total energy level being lower than that of a free cation because the electrostatic interactions the repulsive interaction between the electrons in the metal orbitals and the negative electric field destabilizes the system and compensates for the stabilization to some extent figure figure ligand positions in the cartesian coordinate with a metal ion at the origin let us assume that instead of a uniform spherical negative field the field is generated by six ligands coordinating octahedrally to a central metal the negative field of the ligands is
