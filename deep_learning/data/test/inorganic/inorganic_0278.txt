orbitals dxy dz than for the tg orbitals dxy dyz dxz and the eg orbitals are destabilized and the tg orbitals are stabilized to an equal extent in the following discussion only the energy difference between the tg and eg orbitals is essential and the average energy of these orbitals is taken as the zero of energy if the energy difference between the two eg and three tg orbitals is set to the energy level of the eg orbitals is and that of the tg orbitals is figure may also be expressed as dq in this case the energy level
