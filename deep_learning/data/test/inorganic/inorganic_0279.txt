an important parameter to explain some properties of dblock transition metal complexes a condition other than the orbital energy level is required to explain the filling of electrons being populated into the split tg and eg orbitals two electrons can occupy an orbital with antiparallel spins but a strong electrostatic repulsion occurs between two electrons in the same orbital this repulsive interaction is called pairing energy p when the number of d electrons is less than three the pairing energy is minimized by loading the electrons in the tg orbital with parallel spins namely the electron configurations arising are tg
