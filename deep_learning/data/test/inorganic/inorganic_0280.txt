weak field case or the high spin electron configuration a similar choice is required for d d and d octahedral complexes and in the strong field case tg tg or tgeg configurations are favoured whereas in the weak field case tgeg tgeg or tgeg configurations are favoured the ligand field splitting parameter is decided by the nature of the ligands and metal whereas the pairing energy p is almost constant and shows only a slight dependence on the identity of the metal square planar complexes complexes with four ligands in a plane containing the central metal are termed square planar
