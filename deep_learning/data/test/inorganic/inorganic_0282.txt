as the number of the ligands is of that in hexacoordinate octahedral complexes and overlap of the ligands with the orbitals is smaller and the ligand splitting is about a half of consequently only highspin electron configurations are known in tetrahedral complexes the ligand field splitting energies calculated by the above method are shown in table table ligand field stabilization energy lfse octahedral tetrahedral strong field ls weak field hs dn example n n n d ti d v d crv d cr mn d mn fe d fe co d co d ni d cu d cu jahnteller effect
