lower orbital and one electron the upper orbital the system gains energy of a half of the energy difference of two split orbitals therefore a tetragonal distortion in the z axis becomes favorable the conditions of electron fillingpauli principlehunds rule wave functions of electrons in an atom are called atomic orbitals an atomic orbital is expressed using three quantum numbers the principal quantum number n the azimuthal quantum number l and the magnetic quantum number m for a principal quantum number n there are n azimuthal quantum numbers l ranging from to n and each corresponds to the following orbitals
