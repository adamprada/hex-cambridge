ms the wave function which determines the orbital shape can be expressed as the product of a radial wavefunction r and an angular wave function y as follows r is a function of distance from the nucleus and y expresses the angular component of the orbital orbital shapes are shown in figure since the probability of the electrons existence is proportional to the square of the wave function an electron density map resembles that of a wave function the following conditions must be satisfied when each orbital is filled with electrons the conditions of electron filling pauli principle the number
