the sign of eelec is negative for the attractive interaction between a cation and an anion that is the closer oppositely charged ions approach each other the lower the potential energy closedshell repulsion when electrons in the closed shells of one ion overlap with those of another ion there is a repulsive force comes from the pauli exclusion principle a third electron cannot enter an orbital that already contains two electrons this force is short range and is typically modeled as falling off exponentially or with a high power of the distance r between atoms for example in the born
