curve at this distance the net force on each ion is zero electrostatic energy of a crystal lattice we can use these equations to calculate the lattice energy of a crystal by summing up the interactions between all pairs of ions because the closedshell repulsion force is short range this term is typically calculated only for interactions between neighboring ions however the coulomb force is long range and must be calculated over the entire crystal this problem was first solved in by erwin madelung a german physicist consider an ion in the nacl structure labeled o in the diagram at
