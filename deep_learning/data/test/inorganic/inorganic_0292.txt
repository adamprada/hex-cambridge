ion o as factoring out constants and the nearestneighbor bond distance ro we obtain where the sum in parentheses which is unitless slowly converges to a value of a generalizing this formula for any threedimensional ionic crystal we get a function where n is avogadros number because we are calculating energy per mole of ions and a is called the madelung constant the madelung constant depends only on the geometrical arrangement of the ions and so it varies between different types of crystal structures but within a given structure type it does not change thus mgo and nacl have the
