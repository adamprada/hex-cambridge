reduced madelung constant is obtained by normalizing the values to the number of ions in the formula unit it can be seen from the table that the reduced madelung constants are quite similar for different structures this makes it hard to determine on the basis of electrostatic energy calculations which structure will be most stable for a given compound it is interesting to note that the trend in reduced madelung constants roughly follows the trend in ionicity cf the mooserpearson diagram in section for example wurtzite has a slightly higher madelung constant than zincblende consistent with our earlier conclusion that
