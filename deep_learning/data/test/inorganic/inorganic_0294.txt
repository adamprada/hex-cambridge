z have opposite signs it represents the energy change for forming one mole of solid salt from one mole of the gaseous ions separated initially at an infinite distance lithium fluoride shown here as a large single crystal in a beaker of water is the only alkali halide that is not freely soluble in water the lattice energy of lif is the most negative of the alkali fluorides because li and f are both small ions and el is proportional to r no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project
