antiferromagnetism ferrimagnetism and paramagnetism lets begin by considering an individual atom in the bcc structure of iron metal fe is in group viiib of the periodic table so it has eight valence electrons the atom is promoted to the sd state in order to make bonds a localized picture of the delectrons for an individual iron atom might look like this since each unpaired electron has a spin moment of the total spin angular momentum s for this atom is in units of hÏ€ we can think of each fe atom in the solid as a little bar magnet with
