when the magnetic moments of the neighbors are unequal in this case the spin moments do not cancel and there is a net magnetization the ordering mechanism is like that of an antiferromagnetic solid but the magnetic properties resemble those of a ferromagnet ferrimagnetic ordering is most common in metal oxides as we will learn in chapter magnetization and susceptibility the magnetic susceptibility χ of a solid depends on the ordering of spins paramagnetic ferromagnetic antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic solids all have χ but the magnitude of their susceptibility varies with the kind of ordering and with temperature we will see
