molar susceptibility units cmmol typical values of χm compound type of magnetism χ at k cmmol sio diamagnetic x pt metal pauli paramagnetic x gdsoho paramagnetic x nife alloy ferromagnetic to correlate χ with the number of unpaired electrons in a compound we first correct for the small diamagnetic contribution of the core electrons susceptibility of paramagnets for a paramagnetic substance the inverse relationship between the magnetic susceptibility and t the absolute temperature is called curies law and the proportionality constant c is the curie constant note that c is not a constant in the usual sense because it depends
