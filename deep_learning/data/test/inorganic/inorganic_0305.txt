can be calculated from the number of unpaired electrons n two important points to note about this formula are the magnetic susceptibility is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature with a proportionality constant c curies law so far we are talking only about paramagnetic substances where there is no interaction between neighboring atoms number of unpaired electrons per atom determined from curie constants of transition metals and their alloys returning to the isolated fe atom with its three unpaired electrons we can measure the curie constant for iron metal above the temperature of its transition to a paramagnetic solid and
