solid paramagnetic substance order and the susceptibility deviates from simple curielaw behavior because the ordering depends on the shortrange exchange interaction this critical temperature varies widely metals and alloys in the d series tend to have high critical temperatures because the atoms are directly bonded to each other and the interaction is strong for example fe and co have critical temperatures also called the curie temperature tc for ferromagnetic substances of and k respectively the curie temperature is determined by the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction and by the number of unpaired electrons per atom the number of unpaired
