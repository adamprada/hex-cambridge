paramagnetic and obey the curieweiss law this is similar to the curie law except that the plot of χ vs t is shifted to a positive intercept tc on the temperature axis this reflects the fact that ferromagnetic materials in their paramagnetic state have a greater tendency for their spins to align in a magnetic field than an ordinary paramagnet in which the spins do not interact with each other ferrimagnets follow the same kind of ordering behavior typical plots of χ vs t and χ vs t for ferroferrimagnets are shown above and below plots of χ vs t
