antiferromagnet reflecting the tendency of spins in the paramagnetic state above tn to resist parallel ordering a plot of χ vs t intercepts the temperature axis at a negative temperature θ and the curieweiss law becomes ordering of spins below tc below tc the spins align spontaneously in ferro and ferrimagnets complex magnetization behavior is observed that depends on the history of the sample for example if a ferromagnetic material is cooled in the absence of an applied magnetic field it forms a mosaic structure of magnetic domains that each have internally aligned spins however neighboring domains tend to align
