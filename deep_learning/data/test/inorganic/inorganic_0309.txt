with magnetic domains made visible with a kerr microscope the domains are the light and dark stripes visible within each grain when a sample like this one is magnetized ie exposed to a strong magnetic field the domain walls move and the favorably aligned domains grow at the expense of those with the opposite orientation this transformation can be seen in real time in the kerr microscope the domain walls are typically hundreds of atoms wide so movement of a domain wall involves a cooperative tilting of spin orientation analogous to the wave in a sports stadium and is a
