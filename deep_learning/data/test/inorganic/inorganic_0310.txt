the case of a hard magnet can retain much of its magnetization if you have ever magnetized a nail or a paper clip by using a permanent magnet what you were doing was moving the walls of the magnetic domains inside the ferromagnet the object thereafter retains the memory of its magnetization however annealing a permanent magnet destroys the magnetization by returning the system to its lowest energy state in which all the magnetic domains cancel each other rotation of orientation and increase in size of magnetic domains in response to an externally applied magnetic field magnetic hysteresis cycling a
