direction and at a field hc the coercive field the magnetization of the sample is reduced to zero eventually the material reaches saturation in the opposite direction and when the field is removed again it has remanent magnetization br but in the opposite direction as the field continues to reverse the magnet follows the hysteresis loop as indicated by the arrows the area of colored region inside the loop is proportional to the magnetic work done in each cycle when the field cycles rapidly for example in the core of a transformer or in readwrite cycles of a magnetic disk
