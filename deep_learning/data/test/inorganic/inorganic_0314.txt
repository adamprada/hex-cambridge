the anions figure the frenkel defect within the nacl structure cc bysa vladvd via wikipedia the number of frenkel defects can be calculated using the equation where is the number of normally occupied positions is the number of available positions for the moving ion the of formation is the enthalpy formation of one frenkel defect and is the gas constant frenkel defects are intrinsic defects because the existence causes the gibbs energy of a crystal to decrease which means it is favorable to occur solids found with a frenkel defect the crystal lattices are relatively open and the coordination number
