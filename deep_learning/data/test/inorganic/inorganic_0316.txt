and bases also can act as flps one successful strategy is to mix sterically hindered triarylphosphines with triarylboranes small molecules such as co and ethylene can then form a bridge between the phosphine lewis base and borane lewis acid eg because flps behave at the same time as both nucleophiles and electrophiles they can effect the ringopening of cyclic ethers such as thf dihydrofuran coumaran and dioxane no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to develop the next generation of openaccess texts to
