two parameters radii and the electron attracting power of atoms or ions determine the bonding structure and reaction of elementary substances and compounds much effort has been devoted to finding numerical values for these two factors applicable to all materials it is hoped that the chemical properties of a known compound and of a still nonexistent new material can be predicted with a combination of suitable numerical values firstly geometrical factors will be described table atomic radii pm h li be b c n o f na mg al si p s cl k ca sc ti v cr mn
