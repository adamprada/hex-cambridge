from the distances between the atoms in ionic compounds by applying such methods to many ionic compounds ionic radii have been compiled in such a way that experimental and calculated values are generally consistent table even ionic compounds have some covalent contribution and it is not expected that calculated and experimental bond distances will agree exactly even if the ionic radius assigned to a standard ion is changed we can still compile a set of ionic radii that are consistent across many compounds other examples of the proposed radii of o ion are pm v m goldschmidt or pm j
