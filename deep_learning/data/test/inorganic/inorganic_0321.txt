the same period of the periodic table as the group of the element goes to the right and then increase again in the next period the lanthanide contraction is responsible for the th period d elements having almost the same atomic radii as those of the th period d ones in the periodic table the lanthanide elements are inserted before the d elements the atomic radii of lanthanide elements decrease noticeably as the effective nuclear charge increases because the screening effects of the f orbitals of lanthanide elements are weak due to their orbital shapes consequently the atomic radii of
