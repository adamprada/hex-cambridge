is lattice lattice enthalpy is indirectly calculated from the values of the enthalpy change at each stage using a bornhaber cycle figure namely a closed cycle is formed using enthalpy data standard enthalpy of formation of an ionic crystal from elements sublimation enthalpy of an elementary solid or atomization enthalpy Î·ion which is the sum of the ionization enthalpy of cation formation and electron acquisition enthalpy of anion formation lattice enthalpy is calculated using the relation that enthalpy change in a cycle is zero figure bornhaber cycle of kcl madelung constant the total coulomb potential energy that exists between the
