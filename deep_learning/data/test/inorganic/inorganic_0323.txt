becomes larger as the coordination number increases because the electrical charges have opposite signs the potential becomes negative indicating the stabilization that accompanies the formation of a crystal lattice from well dispersed gaseous phase ions although it is generally true that the lowest electrostatic potential leads to the most stable structure this is not strictly correct since there are also other interactions to consider table madelung constants structural type a rocksalt cesium chloride sphalerite wurtzite fluorite rutile the second largest factor that contributes to the lattice enthalpy is the van der waals force and dispersion forces or the london interaction
