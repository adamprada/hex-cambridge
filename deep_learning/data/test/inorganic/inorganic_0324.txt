when another layer of this dimensional arrangement is placed on top of the first the packing will be densest and the structure most energetically stable when the metal atoms are placed on top of the hollows b of the first layer when a rd layer is placed on top of the nd layer there are two possibilities namely the rd layer a overlaps with the st layer a or the rd layer c overlaps with neither a nor b the ababtype packing is called hexagonally closepacked hcp figure and the abcabctype is called cubic closepacked ccp figure in both cases
