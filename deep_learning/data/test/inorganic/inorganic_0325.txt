up layers other than the normal hcp and ccp and many examples are known figure different expressions of cubic closepacked figure different expressions of hexagonally closepacked the lattice with another ball at the center of a cubic lattice consisting of eight balls is the body centered cubic lattice bcc and some metals assume this mode of packing the ratio of space occupation in a bcc lattice is smaller than that of closepacked ones but the difference is not large although the central ball is formally coordinated it is essentially coordinated since there are a further six balls only more distant
