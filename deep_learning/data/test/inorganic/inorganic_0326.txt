halides oxides and sulfides metal cations and anions are aligned alternately and the solid is bound together mainly by electrostatic bonding many metal halides dissolve in polar solvents eg sodium chloride nacl dissolves in water whereas metal oxides and sulfides in which there is a significant contribution of covalent bonding are usually insoluble even in the most polar of solvents the fundamental structure of ionic crystals is that larger ions usually anions are closepacked and smaller ions usually cations enter into the octahedral or tetrahedral cavities between them ionic crystals are classified into several typical structures according to the kinds
