na ions agrees with the formula nacl figure rocksalt structure cesium chloride structure cesium chloride cscl is a typical example of the structure shown in figure there is a cs ion at the center and eight cl are located at the eight corners of the cube conversely even if a cl comes to the center and eight cs come to the corners the number of each ion in the unit lattice is the same thus this is referred to as the structure since there is one cs and one cl ion belonging to this unit lattice it coincides with the
