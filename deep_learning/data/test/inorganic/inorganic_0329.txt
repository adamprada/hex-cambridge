f is twice that of ca all the tetrahedral holes of ca arranged in ccp are occupied by f as shown in figure there are four ca and eight f ions and the number of ions is times the formula the antifluorite structure exchanges the cations and anions and is exemplified by potassium oxide ko etc figure fluorite structure exercise how many cations and anions are there in a unit lattice of zinc blende structure answer all four cations are included in a unit lattice the anions occupy the corners and faces and the number is x x radius ratio
