rx with the anions contacting each other and also with the cations depends on the coordination number in a partial structure consisting only of anions the anions form a coordination polyhedron around a cation the anionic radius rx is one half of the distance of the edge of the polyhedron and the distance from the cation center to an apex of the polyhedron is the sum of the anion and cation radii rx rm the coordination polyhedron of the cscl structure is a cube the nacl structure an octahedron and the zns structure a tetrahedron the distance from the center
