ratio is not simple for example halides of alkali metals adopt the nacl structures at normal temperatures except cesium chloride cscl cesium bromide csbr and cesium iodide csi it is not possible to assume structure types from the radius ratios even in the case of simple ionic compounds like alkali metal halides however the qualitative trend that smaller cations have smaller coordination numbers is generally correct figure the radius ratio rm rx of cations and anions variation of the solid structure expression many solidstate inorganic compounds have complicated threedimensional structures different structural illustrations for the same compound help our understanding
