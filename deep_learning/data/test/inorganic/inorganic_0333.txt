circular orbits surrounding the nucleus orbitals in addition to having different energy levels orbitals also have different shapes and orientations and each can be occupied by two electrons for each principal quantum number n there is one s orbital three p orbitals five d orbitals and seven f orbitals therefore an s orbital can hold two electrons a p orbital can hold six electrons a d orbital can hold ten electrons and an f orbital can hold electrons ground state electron configuration quantum numbers there are four quantum numbers n l ml and ms the principal quantum number n is
