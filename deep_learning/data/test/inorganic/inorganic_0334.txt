s with two electrons then the p with six electrons then the s with two electrons etc there are some exceptions to the aufbau principle this occurs mainly with electrons in the d orbital where extra stability is obtained from a half filled or fully filled d orbital therefore if there are electrons or electrons in the d orbital it will move one electron from the s orbital below it to fill the extra space example chromium crs electron configuration following the model would be s s p s p sd but instead it is s s p s p
