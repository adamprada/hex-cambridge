this can be referred to as the s block the p block the d block and the f block lanthanides and actinides meaning that in its ground state an element in a certain block will have its valence electrons in the s p d or f orbitals depending how to write ground state electron configurations basics electron configurations are written using the principal quantum number n followed by the orbital s p d or f with the total number of electrons written as a superscript example s for writing ground state electron configurations a few main steps should be followed
