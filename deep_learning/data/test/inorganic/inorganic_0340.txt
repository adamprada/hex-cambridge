figure structure of nacrypt alkali metals are also highly reactive to oxygen or halogens as alkali metals are very reducing they are used widely as reducing agents because of the high affinity of alkali metals to halogens they are important in organic and inorganic syntheses which produce alkali metal halides as the result of condensation and metathesis reactions although it is generally difficult to dissolve metals in solvents to make atomic dipersions alkali metals can be dispersed in liquid ammonia solutions amalgams and as cryptand figure naphthalene or benzophenone chco complexes ammonia boils at c but liquid ammonia can be
