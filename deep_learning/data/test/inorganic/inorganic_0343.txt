solid the electron affinity of chlorine kj mol is the largest and fluorine kj mol comes between chlorine and bromine kj mol the electronegativity of fluorine is the highest of all the halogens since halogens are produced as metal salts simple substances are manufactured by electrolysis fluorine only takes the oxidation number in its compounds although the oxidation number of other halogens can range from to astatine at has no stable nuclide and little is known about its chemical properties a manufacture of halogen fluorine has the highest reduction potential e v and the strongest oxidizing power among the halogen
