of nacl using an ion exchange process in this process chlorine gas is generated in an anodic cell containing brine and na moves through an ion exchange membrane to the cathodic cell where it pairs with oh to become an aqueous solution of naoh exercise why can chlorine be manufactured by electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride answer despite the higher reduction potential of chlorine v than that of oxygen v the reduction potential of oxygen can be raised overvoltage depending on the choice of electrode used for the electrolysis process bromine is obtained by the oxidation of
