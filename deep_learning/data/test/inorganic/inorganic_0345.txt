because of the small ionic radius of f high oxidation states are stabilized and hence low oxidation compounds like cuf are unknown in contrast with the compounds such as if and ptf pseudohalogens since the cyanide ion cn the azide ion n and the thiocyanate ion scn etc form compounds similar to those of halide ions they are called pseudohalide ions they form psudohalogen molecules such as cyanogene cn hydrogen cyanide hcn sodium thiocyanate nascn etc finetuning electronic and steric effects that are impossible with only halide ions make pseudohalogens useful also in transition metal complex chemistry polyhalogens besides the
