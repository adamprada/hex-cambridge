inorganic compound and is used in large quantities for the vulcanization of rubber etc d metal halides many metal halides are made by the combination of about metallic elements and four halogens table table since there are more than one oxidation state especially in transition metals several kinds of halides are known for each transition metal these halides are most important as starting materials of the preparation of metal compounds and the inorganic chemistry of metal compounds depends on metal halides there are molecular dimensional chain dimensional layer and dimensional halides but few of them are molecular in crystalline states
