a crystalline lattice is formed creating a solid solid state hydrogen and fluorine elemental hydrogen and elemental fluorine h and f respectively exist as gases at room temperature though the melting point of h is k c a temperature of k c is required for the solidification of h as the solid structure is formed the diatomic hydrogen molecules adopt a hexagonal close packing hcp structure fluorine exhibits similar behaviour the melting point of fluorine is k c at which point the diatomic fluorine adopts a cubic close packed crystalline arrangement ccp instead of a hexagonal close packed arrangement ability
