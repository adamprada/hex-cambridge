as hard or soft hard acidsbases hard acids and bases have a high charge positive for acids negative for bases to ionic radius ratio along with higher oxidation states hard acids are not very polarizable and have high charge densities thus metal ions with high positive charges and smaller ionic sizes tend to be hard acids early transition metal ions in the d series tend to be hard lewis acids hard bases are typically small anions and neutral molecules some examples of hard acids and bases include h o oh f fe and al soft acidsbases soft acids or bases
