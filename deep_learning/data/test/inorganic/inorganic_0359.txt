intermediate for example trimethylborane fe and pb cations are intermediate acids and pyridine and aniline are examples of intermediate bases an element can also change its hardsoft character depending on its oxidation state the most extreme example is hydrogen where h is a hard acid and h is a soft base ni as in the layered compound niooh is a hard acid but ni as in nico is a soft acid the figures below show hardsoft trends for acids left and bases right in the periodic table for bases the major hardsoft discontinuity is between the nd row nof and
