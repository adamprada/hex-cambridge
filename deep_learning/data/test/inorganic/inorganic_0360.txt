hard pb intermediate ag soft hg soft the softest metal ion in the periodic table is auaq it forms stable complexes with soft bases such as phosphines and cn but not with hard bases such as o or f the affinity of au for the soft base cn is high and the resulting aucn complex is so stable that gold which is normally very difficult to oxidize can be oxidized by oxygen in the air this reaction is used in gold mining to separate small flakes of au from large volumes of sand and other oxides ag is similarly dissolved
