cores where the field is switched rapidly permalloy an alloy consisting of about fe and ni is a soft magnet that has very high magnetic permeability Âµ ie a large maximum slope of the b vs h curve and a very narrow hysteresis loop some materials such as iron metal can exist as either hard or soft magnets whether bcc iron is a hard or soft magnet depends on the crystal grain size when crystal grains in iron are submicron size and comparable to the size of the magnetic domains then the magnetic domains are pinned by crystal grain boundaries
