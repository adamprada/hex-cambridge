cobalt ferrite cofeo are used in magnetic recording media where the high coercivity allows them to retain the magnetization state read as a logical or of a magnetic bit over long periods of time hard magnets are also used in disk drives refrigerator magnets electric motors and other applications drive motors for hybrid and electric vehicles such as the toyota prius use the hard magnet ndfeb also used to make strong refrigerator magnets and require kilogram pounds of neodymium a highresolution transmission electron microscope image of ndfeb is shown below and compared to the crystal structure with the unit cell
