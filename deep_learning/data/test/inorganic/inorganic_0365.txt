the contracted gaussian functions are composed from primitive gaussian functions to match slatertype orbitals stos the exponential parameters in the stos are optimized by calculations on small molecules using the nonlinear variational method and then those values are used with other molecules the problem is to calculate the electronic energy from and find the optimum coefficients for each molecular orbital in equation by using the self consistent field method and the linear variational method to minimize the energy as was described in the previous chapter for the case of atoms to obtain the total energy of the molecule we need
