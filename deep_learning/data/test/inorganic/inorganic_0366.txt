to get better and better energies the variational principle says an approximate energy is an upper bound to the exact energy so the lowest energy that we calculate is the most accurate at some point the improvements in the energy will be very slight this limiting energy is the lowest that can be obtained with a single determinant wavefunction this limit is called the hartreefock limit the energy is the hartreefock energy the molecular orbitals producing this limit are called hartreefock orbitals and the determinant is the hartreefock wavefunction exercise write a onesentence definition of the hartreefock wavefunction that captures
