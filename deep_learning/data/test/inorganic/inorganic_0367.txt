if both electrons are constrained to have the same spatial orbital eg and then the spin orbital is said to be restricted while unrestricted spin orbitals can provide a better description of the electrons twice as many spatial orbitals are needed so the demands of the calculation are much higher using unrestricted orbitals is particular beneficial when a molecule contains an odd number of electrons because there are more electrons in one spin state than in the other carbon dioxide now consider the results of a selfconsistent field calculation for carbon monoxide it is well known that carbon monoxide is
