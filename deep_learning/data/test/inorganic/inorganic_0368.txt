basis set used in the calculation consisted of functions the ls s px py and pz atomic orbitals of c and o ten molecular orbitals mos were defined as linear combinations of the ten atomic orbitals which are written as where identifies the mo and identifies the atomic orbital basis function the ground state wavefunction is written as the slater determinant of the five lowest energy molecular orbitals equation gives the energy of the ground state where the denominator accounts for the normalization requirement the coefficients in the linear combination are determined by the variational method to minimize the energy
