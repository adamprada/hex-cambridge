both the and are nonbonding orbitals since they are localized on a particular atom and do not directly determine the charge density between atoms this orbital is a bonding molecular orbital because the electrons are delocalized over c and o in a way that enhances the charge density between the atoms the means this is the third orbital this orbital also illustrates the concept of hybridization one can say the s and p orbitals on each atom are hybridized and the molecular orbital is formed from these hybrids although the calculation just obtains the linear combination of the four orbitals
