facing away from the carbon atom if we follow how this function varies along the internuclear axis we see that near carbon the function is positive whereas near oxygen it is negative or possibly small and positive this change means there must be a node between the two nuclei or at the oxygen nucleus because of the node the electron density between the two nuclei is low so the electrons in this orbital do not serve to shield the two positive nuclei from each other this orbital therefore is called an antibonding mo and the electrons assigned to it are
