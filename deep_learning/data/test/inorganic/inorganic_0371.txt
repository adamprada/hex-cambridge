atoms we conclude this is a nonbonding orbital with the nonbonding electrons on carbon this is not a bonding orbital because the electron density between the nuclei is lowered by hybridization it also is not an antibonding orbital because there is no node between the nuclei when carbon monoxide binds to fe in hemoglobin the bond is made between the c and the fe this bond involves the donation of the nonbonding electrons on c to empty d orbitals on fe thus mo theory allows us to understand why the c end of the molecule is involved in this electron
