according to this theory bond will form when an orbital of one atom occupy another atoms orbital known as overlap number of electrons in both orbital is adds up to no more than two just like forming a molecule with lewis dot structure bonds between atoms complete when two electrons share same orbital together bond strength depends on the the amount of overlap since electrons are attracted to nuclei of both atoms more electrons will pull more nuceli thus increase bond strength however two orbitals can not contian more than two atoms due to the maximum capacity it can hold
