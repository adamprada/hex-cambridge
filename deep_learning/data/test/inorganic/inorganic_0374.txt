with one of the nitrogens atoms three atomic p orbitals which were unhybridized because px orbital of c and n will form sigma bond this leaves with two n atom porbitals which form two mutually perpendicular pi bonds to the two atomic p orbitals on the c atom hcn thus has one single and one triple bond the latter consists of a sigma bond from the overlap of a c atom sp hybrid orbital with a n atom p orbital and two mutually perpendicular pi bonds are formed from parallel atomic p orbitals of carbon and nitrogen atoms references winter
