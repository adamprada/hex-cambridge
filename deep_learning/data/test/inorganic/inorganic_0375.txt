between c and n atoms valence bond thoery as wells as hybridization lewis dot structure can be used to get the basic idea of the structure because of the pi bonds and sigma bond formed by the hybridization of px py and pz between c and n atoms this p overlap makes the bond stronger and shorter therefore the bond between c and n is linear also based on the property of atoms to be on the position at smallest strichinderance as possible h atom will be as far away from c atom which will result in the linear structure
