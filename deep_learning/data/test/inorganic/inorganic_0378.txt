the octahedron is the preferred coordination geometry other possible coordination geometries exist for coordination number six such as trigonal prismatic coho coordination number higher coordination higher coordination numbers and above exist though they are less common coordination number seven coordinated atoms or molecules results in three main geometries pentagonal bipyramid capped octahedron capped trigonal prism coordination number eight coordinated atoms or molecules results in two main geometries square antiprism dodecahedron coordination number the only structure yet identified for coordination number systems is the tricrapt trigonal prism two examples of these structures are reh and tch with the representative geometry shown
