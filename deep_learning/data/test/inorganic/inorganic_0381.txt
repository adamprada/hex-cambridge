analogy this idea developed extensively by roald hoffmann at cornell university has been used to understand bonding and reactivity in organometallic compounds in the isolobal analogy symmetry principles as illustrated above in the analogy between h and ozone are used to construct mo diagrams of complex molecules containing dfrontier orbitals from simpler molecular fragments professor roald hoffmanns ideas about orbital symmetry have helped explain the bonding and reactivity of organic and organometallic molecules and also the structures and properties of extended solids the triiodide ion an analogous and seemingly more complicated case of center electron bonding is i each i
