to ozone or h counting orbitals we obtain lone pairs from the nonbonding s px and py orbitals as well as one bond and one lone pair from the pz orbital combinations above the total of nonbonding pairs and one bond accounts for the electrons in the ion the nonbonding pz pair is localized on the terminal i atoms giving each a formal charge this mo description is entirely consistent with the octet nobond resonance picture of i that we developed in chapter no headers topic hierarchy no headers topic hierarchy no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living
