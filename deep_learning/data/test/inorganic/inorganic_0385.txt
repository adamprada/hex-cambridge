carbon sp hybrid orbitals and four singly occupied hydrogen s orbitals to form electronpair bonds this uses of the valence electrons to form a total of five bonds four ch bonds and one cc bond b one singly occupied unhybridized pz orbital remains on each carbon atom to form a carboncarbon bond note by convention in planar molecules the axis perpendicular to the molecular plane is the zaxis cc bync ümit kaya the hückel approximation is used to determine the energies and shapes of the molecular orbitals in conjugated systems within the hückel approximation the covalent bonding in these hydrocarbones
