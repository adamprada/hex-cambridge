the bonds feel an electrostatic potential due to the entire bonding framework in the molecule ie it focuses only on the formation of bonds given that the bonding framework has already been formed conjugated systems a conjugated system has a region of overlapping porbitals bridging the interjacent single bonds that allow a delocalization of electrons across all the adjacent aligned porbitals these electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom but rather to a group of atoms ethylene before considering the h√ºckel treatment for ethylene it is beneficial to review the general bonding picture of the molecule bonding
