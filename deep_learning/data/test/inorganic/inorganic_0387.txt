atomic orbitals where and are coefficients of the expansion either describe will work and both are identical approaches since where are coefficients describing the hybridized orbital the bonding occurs via the mixing of the electrons in the hybrid orbitals on carbon and the electrons in the atomic orbitals of the four hydrogen atoms figure left resulting in the bonding framework the bonding framework results from the unhybridized orbitals figure right the independence of these two frameworks is demonstrated in the resulting molecular orbital diagram in figure h√ºckel theory is concerned only with describing the molecular orbitals and energies of the
