then where are the hamiltonian matrix elements see note below and are the overlap integrals if equation is multiplied by and integrated then both equations and can better represented in matrix notation or more simply as a product of matrices all diagonal hamiltonian integrals are called coulomb integrals and those of type are called resonance integrals both integrals are negative and the resonance integrals determines the strength of the bonding interactions the equations described by equation are called the secular equations and will also have the trivial solution of within linear algebra the secular equations in equation will also have
