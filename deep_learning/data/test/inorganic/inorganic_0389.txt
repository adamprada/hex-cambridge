molecule then more energies would be estimated by solving the secular determinant solving the secular determinant is simplified within h√ºckel method via the following four assumptions all overlap integrals are set equal to zero this is quite reasonable since the orbitals are directed perpendicular to the direction of their bonds figure this assumption is often call neglect of differential overlap ndo all resonance integrals between nonneighboring atoms are set equal to zero all resonance integrals between neighboring atoms are equal and set to all coulomb integrals are set equal to these assumptions are mathematically expressed as assumptions means that the
