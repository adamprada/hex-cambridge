to be or since is negative the two energies are ordered figure for for figure energies of ethylene with occupation cc bync Ã¼mit kaya to extract the coefficients attributed to these energies the corresponding values can be substituted back into the secular equations equation for the lower energy state this gives and the molecular orbitals attributed to this energy is then based off of equation where is the normalization constant for this molecular orbital this is the bonding molecular orbital for the higher energy molecular orbital and then this gives and the molecular orbitals attributed to this energy is then
