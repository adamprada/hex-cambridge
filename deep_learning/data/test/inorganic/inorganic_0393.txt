since the mass of deuterium and tritium is about twice and three times that of hydrogen respectively the physical properties of the isotopes and compounds containing them differ considerably some properties of the isotopes and water are listed in table when the eh bond in a hydrogen compound is converted into the ed by deuterium substitution the eh stretching frequency in an infrared spectrum is reduced to about which is useful for determining the position of the hydrogen atom it is sometimes possible to conclude that scission of the bond with a hydrogen is the ratedetermining step when the deuterium
