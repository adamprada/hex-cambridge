water c there are nuclearspin isomers in diatomic molecules of the nuclides whose spin is not zero especially in the case of a hydrogen molecule the difference of properties is significant spins of parahydrogen are antiparallel and the sum is leading to a singlet state spins of orthohydrogen are parallel and the sum is resulting in a triplet state since parahydrogen is in a lower energy state it is the stabler form at low temperatures the theoretical ratio of parahydrogen is at k but it decreases to about at room temperature since the ratio of orthohydrogen increases at higher temperatures
