binary hydrides form many molecular hydride complexes coordinated by stabilization ligands such as carbonyl co tertiaryphosphines pr or cyclopentadienyl ch refer to section typical hydrides of each class are given below saline hydrides lithium hydride lih is a colorless crystalline compound mp melting point c li and h form a lattice with a rock salt type structure quantitative evolution of hydrogen gas at the anode during the electrolysis of the fused salt suggests the existence of h water reacts vigorously with lithium hydride evolving hydrogen gas since it dissolves in ethers slightly the hydride is used as a reducing agent
