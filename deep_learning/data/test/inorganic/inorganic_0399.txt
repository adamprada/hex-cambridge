only at the end of the s that hydride was accepted as a ligand thousands of hydride complexes are known at present furthermore with the synthesis in the s of molecular hydrogen complexes the chemistry of transition metal hydrogen compounds took a new turn research on the homogeneous catalysis of hydrocarbons in which hydride or dihydrogen complexes participate is also progressing no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to develop the next generation of openaccess texts to improve postsecondary education at all levels
