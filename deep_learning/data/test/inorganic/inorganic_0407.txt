no headers crystalline solids the atoms molecules or ions pack together in an ordered arrangement such solids typically have flat surfaces with unique angles between faces and unique dimensional shape examples of crystalline solids include diamonds and quartz crystals amorphous solids no ordered structure to the particles of the solid no well defined faces angles or shapes often are mixtures of molecules which do not stack together well or large flexible molecules examples would include glass and rubber no headers the br√∏nsted theory encompasses any type of solvent that can donate and accept ions not just aqueous solutions the strength
