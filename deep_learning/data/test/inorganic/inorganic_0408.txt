ion nh is a weak acid in water ka x but it is a strong acid in ammonia similarly acetic acid is weak in water but strong in ammonia solvent leveling in fact makes chcooh and nhcl both strong acids in ammonia where they have equivalent acid strength strong acids that are leveled in water have different acid strengths in acidic solvents such as hf or anhydrous acetic acid for example acid dissociation of hx in acetic acid chcooh involves protonating the solvent to make its conjugate acid chcooh and the x anion because chcooh is a stronger acid that
