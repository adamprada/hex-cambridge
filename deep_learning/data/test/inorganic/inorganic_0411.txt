as what methodology is used by chemists to measure ionic radii and are there any nonexperimental ways to estimate the size of ionic radii will be answered in this module accordingly there are many ways to determine ionic radii introductionhardsphere modelperiodic trendsreferencesoutside linksproblemsanswers introduction in the past after an atom is ionized xray diffraction is used to measure how much the radius of the atom increased or decreased however scientists wanted to use another technique due to the fact that xray diffraction is difficult to distinguish a boundary between two ions as a result the hard sphere model can be
