ion then compared with the ion radii had done on xray diffraction internuclear distance d rcation ranion to calculate ion radii lande used ionic compound under solid state ex nacl this will minize the distribution of electrons find the radii of anion r atom find internuclear distance d between anion and cation use internuclear distance formula to find the r figure the hard sphere model can roughly determine the ion radii periodic trends as described earlier cations are smaller in size compared to their neutral atoms while anions are larger in sizecations are smaller than its neutral atoms because the
