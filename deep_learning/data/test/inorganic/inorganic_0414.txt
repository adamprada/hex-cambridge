data had not yet been developed once a trial structure was proposed it was relatively easy to calculate the diffraction pattern but it was difficult to go the other way from the diffraction pattern to the structure if nothing was known a priori about the arrangement of atoms in the unit cell it was and still is important to develop some guidelines for guessing the coordination numbers and bonding geometries of atoms in crystals the first such rules were proposed by linus pauling who considered how one might pack together oppositely charged spheres of different radii pauling proposed from geometric
