holes cations will find arrangements in which they can contact the largest number of anions if the cation can touch all of its nearest neighbor anions as shown at the right for a small cation in contact with larger anions then the fit is good if the cation is too small for a given site that coordination number will be unstable and it will prefer a lower coordination structure the table below gives the ranges of cationanion radius ratios that give the best fit for a given coordination geometry critical radius ratio this diagram is for coordination number six anions
