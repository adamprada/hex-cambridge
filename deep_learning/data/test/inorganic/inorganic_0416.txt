larger anion size we can build up a table of ionic radii by assuming that the bond length is the sum of the radii r r if the ions are in contact in the crystal consider for example the compounds mgx and mnx where x o s se all of these compounds crystallize in the nacl structure for the two larger anions s and se the unit cell dimensions are the same for both cations this suggests that the anions are in contact in these structures from geometric considerations the anion radius in this case is given by and thus
