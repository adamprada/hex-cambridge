depending on their coordination numbers and thus different radius ratios are calculated for ge with coordination numbers and and for zr with coordination numbers and for this series of oxides the model appears to work quite well the correct coordination number is predicted in all cases and borderline cases such as geo and zro are found in structures with different coordination numbers the model also correctly predicts the structures of bef sio type mgf rutile and caf fluorite what about the alkali halides nacl kbr lii csf etc all of them have the nacl structure except for cscl csbr and
