in addition to the radius ratio rule linus pauling developed other useful rules that are helpful in rationalizing and also predicting the structures of inorganic compounds paulings rules state that stable structures are locally electroneutral for example in the structure of the double perovskite srfemoo mo m fe mo octahedra share all their vertices and sr ions fill the cubooctahedral cavities that are flanked by eight mo octahedra each o ion is coordinated to one fe and one mo ion in order to achieve local electroneutrality and thus the feo and moo octahedra alternate in the structure cationcation repulsion should
