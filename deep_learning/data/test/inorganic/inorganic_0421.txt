valence electron off of its molecular orbital of the atom in its neutral state an equation to demonstrate it is shown below x g x g e example of ie of magnesium mgg mgg e i kjmol ie stands for the first ionization energy the energy the atom requires to expel the first electron from its orbital similarly the second ionization energy will be the energy needed to expel the second electron mgg mgg e i kjmol however ie of magnesium will be larger than that of ie because it is not energetically favorable to separate an electron from a
