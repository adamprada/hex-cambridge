lowest ie since only one electron occupies the valence shell of these atoms it will be more energetically favorable for them to lose the electron in order to achieve a full orbital shell however there are few exceptions the ie decreases when crossing from element in group to the element in group the group has halffilled electronic configuration ns np this type of configuration is very stable its hard to remove electron from valence shell therefore element in group requires greater value of ie than group another exception is that going from be group to b group the ie decreases
