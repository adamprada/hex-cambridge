most stable state with a full shell atoms like f will most likely gain an electron because when a free electron is added to the outer shell of fluorine it will have obtained a full shell generally atoms increasing across a period will increase in ea also exothermic vs endothermic process og e og ea kjmol og e og ea kjmol when an electron is added to an atom the energy change is exothermic because of the attraction of the electron to the nucleus however in the case of ea where the electron is added to an anion the repulsion
