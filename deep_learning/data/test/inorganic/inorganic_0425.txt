of iron alloy that is formed upon cooling from the fcc phase or from liquid iron alpha iron carbon steel pearlite or cast iron carbon is added about by weight to iron to make carbon steel which is a very hard material carbon is rather soluble in the fcc phase of iron but not in the bcc phase therefore when the ductile fcc phase cools and turns into bcc tempering the steel which means cooling it slowly enough so the fcc to bcc transformation can occur the iron can no longer dissolve the excess carbon the carbon forms layers or
