octahedral metal complexes by considering delectron configurations in which the eg orbital set contains one or three electrons the most common of these are high spin d eg crf low spin d egnanio and d eg cu if the complex can distort to break the symmetry then one of the formerly degenerate eg orbitals will go down in energy and the other will go up more electrons will occupy the lower orbital than the upper one resulting in an overall lowering of the electronic energy a similar distortion can occur in tetrahedral complexes when the t orbitals are partially filled
