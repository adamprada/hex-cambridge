the orbital and electronic degeneracies and lowering the overall energy the distortion normally takes the form of elongating the bonds to the ligands lying along the z axis but occasionally occurs as a shortening of these bonds instead the jahnteller theorem does not predict the direction of the distortion only the presence of an unstable geometry when such an elongation occurs the effect is to lower the electrostatic repulsion between the electronpair on the lewis basic ligand and any electrons in orbitals with a z component thus lowering the energy of the complex if the undistorted complex would be expected
