directly at the ligands so distortion can result in a large energetic stabilization strictly speaking the effect also occurs when there is a degeneracy due to the electrons in the tg orbitals ie configurations such as d or d both of which are triply degenerate in such cases however the effect is much less noticeable because there is a much smaller lowering of repulsion on taking ligands further away from the tg orbitals which do not point directly at the ligands see the table below the same is true in tetrahedral complexes eg manganate distortion is very subtle because there
