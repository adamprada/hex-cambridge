is readily apparent in the structures of many copperii complexes additional detailed information about the anisotropy of such complexes and the nature of the ligand binding can be obtained from the fine structure of the lowtemperature electron spin resonance spectra the cuii ion can also coordinate five water molecules in an elongated square pyramid with four cuoeq bonds x å and x å and a long cuoax bond å the four equatorial ligands are distorted from the mean equatorial plane by no headers from the discussion above it is clear that the lattice energy el of an ionic crystal can
