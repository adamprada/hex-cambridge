invariant structure an nacl cscl rutile fluorite kapustinskii noticed that the difference in ionic radii between m and m the monovalent vs divalent radius largely compensates for the differences in an between monovalent nacl cscl and divalent rutile caf structures he thus arrived at a lattice energy formula using an average madelung constant corrected to monovalent radii in the kapustinskii formula the lattice energy kjmol is given by here the sum of the monovalent radii is used in place of ro the bond distance in the bornmayer equation the beauty of this formula is that it requires no knowledge of
