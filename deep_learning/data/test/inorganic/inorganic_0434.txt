does form a stable isotope even the least abundant thulium tm and lutetium lu are as abundant as iodine because lanthanoids have very similar properties and are difficult to separate from one another they were not useful for basic research and application and hence they were regarded as rare elements since a liquidliquid solvent extraction method using tributylphosphine oxide became available in the s lanthanoid elements have been readily available and widely used not only for chemical research but also as materials in alloys catalysts lasers cathoderay tubes etc exercise what is the difference between lanthanoids and lanthanides answer fifteen
