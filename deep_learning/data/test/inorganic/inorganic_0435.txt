comparative low they are positive elements and readily assume trivalent ionic states most compounds of lanthano other than ce f eu f yb f are usually ln ones ln species are hard acids and since f electrons are buried deeply and not used for bonding they are hardly influenced by ligands there is a tendency for atomic and ionic radii to decrease with the increase of the atomic number and this phenomenon is called the lanthanide contraction this contraction is due to small shielding effects of f electrons which causes the atomic nucleus to draw outer shell electrons strongly with
