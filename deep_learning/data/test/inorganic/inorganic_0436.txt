to higher and lower oxidation states usually at one fixed ph pourbaix diagrams help understand phdependent equilibria which are often coupled to solubility equilibria and corrosion which will be talked about more later manganese nodules on the sea floor contain mn in oxidation states and latimer diagrams latimer diagrams are the oldest and most compact way to represent electrochemical equilibria for substances that have multiple oxidation states electrochemical potential values are written for successive redox reactions from highest to lowest oxidation state typically under standard conditions in either strong acid h m ph or strong base oh m ph the
