reaction e v and the entry connecting mn and mn represents the reaction e v we can also calculate values for multielectron reactions by first adding Î´gnfe values and then dividing by the total number of electrons for example for the electron reduction of mno to mn we write and for the threeelectron reduction of mnoaq to mnos remember to divide by the number of electrons involved in the oxidation number change and for the above equations thermodynamically stable and unstable oxidation states an unstable species on a latimer diagram will have a lower standard potential to the left than
