in a frost diagram we plot Î´gf ne vs oxidation number the zero oxidation state is assigned a ne value of zero stable and unstable oxidation states can be easily identified in the plot unstable compounds are higher on the plot than the line connecting their neighbors note that this is simply a graphical representation of what we did with the latimer diagram to determine which oxidation states were stable and unstable the standard potential for any electrochemical reaction is given by the slope of the line connecting the two species on a frost diagram for example the line connecting
