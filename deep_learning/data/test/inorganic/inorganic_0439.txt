lets consider a bornhaber cycle for dissolving a salt in water we can imagine this as the sum of two processes the vaporization of the salt to produce gaseous ions characterized by the lattice enthalpy and the hydration of those ions to produce the solution the enthalpy change for the overall process is the sum of those two steps we know that the entropy change for dissolution of a solid is positive so the solubility depends on the enthalpy change for the overall process here we need to consider the trends in both the lattice energy el and the hydration
