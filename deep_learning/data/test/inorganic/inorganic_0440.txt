epsom salts are soluble whereas the lower hydration energy of ba in baso makes that salt insoluble ksp left el diagram for sulfate salts the large so ion is sizemismatched to small cations such as mg which have large hydration energies resulting soluble salts with larger cations such as ba which have lower eh the lattice energy exceeds the solvation enthalpy and the salts are insoluble right in the case of small anions such as f and oh the lattice energy dominates with small cations such as transition metal ions tmn mg and li anioncation size mismatch occurs with larger
