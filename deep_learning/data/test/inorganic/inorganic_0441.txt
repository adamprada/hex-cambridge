two ions contributes to the low solubility of baso in water combining all our conclusions about solubility we note the following trends increasing size mismatch between the anion and cation leads to greater solubility so csf and lii are the most soluble alkali halides increasing covalency leads to lower solubility in the salts due to larger el for example agf agcl agbr and agi exhibit progressively lower solubility because of increasing covalency increasing the charge on the anion lowers the solubility because the increase in el is large relative to the increase in eh small polyvalent cations having large eh
