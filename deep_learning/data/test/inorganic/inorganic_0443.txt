idea of lattice energy as well as one process that allows us to calculate it the bornhaber cycle in order to use the bornhaber cycle there are several concepts that we must understand first lattice energy lattice energy is a type of potential energy that may be defined in two ways in one definition the lattice energy is the energy required to break apart an ionic solid and convert its component atoms into gaseous ions this definition causes the value for the lattice energy to always be positive since this will always be an endothermic reaction the other definition says
