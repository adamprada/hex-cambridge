highly favorable change in the enthalpy of the system a lot of energy is released as the oppositely charged ions interact it is this that causes ionic solids to have such high melting and boiling points some require such high temperatures that they decompose before they can reach a melting andor boiling point bornhaber cycle there are several important concept to understand before the bornhaber cycle can be applied to determine the lattice energy of an ionic solid ionization energy electron affinity dissociation energy sublimation energy heat of formation and hesss law ionization energy is the energy required to remove
