in most tables therefore when used in calculating the lattice energy we must remember to subtract the electron affinity not add it in general electron affinity increases from left to right across the periodic table and decreases from top to bottom dissociation energy is the energy required to break apart a compound the dissociation of a compound is always an endothermic process meaning it will always require an input of energy therefore the change in energy is always positive the magnitude of the dissociation energy depends on the electronegativity of the atoms involved sublimation energy is the energy required to
