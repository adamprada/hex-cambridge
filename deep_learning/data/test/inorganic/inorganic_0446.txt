cycle is essentially hesss law applied to an ionic solid using the bornhaber cycle the values used in the bornhaber cycle are all predetermined changes in enthalpy for the processes described in the section above hess law allows us to add or subtract these values which allows us to determine the lattice energy step determine the energy of the metal and nonmetal in their elemental forms elements in their natural state have an energy level of zero subtract from this the heat of formation of the ionic solid that would be formed from combining these elements in the appropriate ration
