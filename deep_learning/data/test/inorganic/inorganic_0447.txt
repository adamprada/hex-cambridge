elemental state the energy required to change cl into cl atoms must be added to the value obtained in step step both the metal and nonmetal now need to be changed into their ionic forms as they would exist in the ionic solid to do this the ionization energy of the metal will be added to the value from step next the electron affinity of the nonmetal will be subtracted from the previous value it is subtracted because it is a release of energy associated with the addition of an electron this is a common error due to confusion caused
