this general equation the electron affinity is added however when plugging in a value determine whether energy is released exothermic reaction or absorbed endothermic reaction for each electron affinity if energy is released put a negative sign in front of the value if energy is absorbed the value should be positive rearrangement to solve for lattice energy gives the equation lattice energy heat of formation heat of atomization dissociation energy sum of ionization energies sum of electron affinities references cheetham ak and p day solid state chemistry oxford clarendon press jenkins h donald b thermodynamics of the relationship between lattice
