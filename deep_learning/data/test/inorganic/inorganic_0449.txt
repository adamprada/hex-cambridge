of the following has the greatest lattice energy nacl cacl alcl kcl solutions lattice energy the difference in energy between the expected experimental value for the energy of the ionic solid and the actual value observed more specifically this is the energy gap between the energy of the separate gaseous ions and the energy of the ionic solid ionization energy the energy change associated with the removal of an electron from a neutral atom or ion electron affinity the release of energy associated with the addition of an electron to a neutral atom or ion hess law states that the
