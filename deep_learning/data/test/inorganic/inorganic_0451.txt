is to say that the mx octahedra each share six edges in the mx sheets polyhedral drawing of one layer of the cdcl or cdi structure showing edgesharing mx octahedra because these structures place the packing atoms the anions in direct van der waals contact they are most stable for relatively covalent compounds otherwise the electrostatic repulsion between contacting anions would destabilize the structure energetically more ionic mx compounds tend to adopt the fluorite caf or rutile tio structures which are not layered despite the fact that these two structure types are the same at the level of nearest and
