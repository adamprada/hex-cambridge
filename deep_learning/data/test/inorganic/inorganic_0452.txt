easily for example graphite mos and talc a silicate are layered compounds that are used widely as lubricants and lubricant additives an important reaction of layered compounds is intercalation in intercalation reactions guest molecules and ions enter the galleries that separate the sheets usually with expansion of the lattice along the stacking axis this reaction is typically reversible if it does not perturb the bonding within the sheets often the driving force for intercalation is a redox reaction ie electron transfer between the host and guest for example lithium metal reacts with tis mos and graphite to produce litis lixmos
