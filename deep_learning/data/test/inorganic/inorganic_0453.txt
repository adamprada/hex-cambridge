material is typically graphite which is intercalated by lithium to make lic several different oxides and phosphates containing redox active transition metal ions mn fe co ni are used as the positive electrode materials oxidative or reductive intercalation involves the placement of anions or cations between sheets lithium ion batteries based on coo were first described in by john b goodenoughs research group at oxford in batteries based on coo which has the cdi structure the positive electrode halfreaction is the negative electrode half reaction is the battery is fully charged when the positive electrode is in the coo form
