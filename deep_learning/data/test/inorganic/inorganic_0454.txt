based on coo have poor thermal stability safer materials include lithium iron phosphate lifepo and limo m a mixture of co mn and ni these batteries are used widely in laptop computers portable electronics cellular telephones cordless tools and electric and hybrid vehicles a similar intercalation reaction occurs in nickelcadmium batteries and nickelmetal hydride batteries except in this case the reaction involves the movement of protons in and out of the nioh lattice which has the cdi structure there are many layered compounds that cannot be intercalated by redox reactions typically because some other stable product is formed for example
