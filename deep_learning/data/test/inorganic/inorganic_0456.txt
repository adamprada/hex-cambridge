take a few short steps make sure to have a paper and pencil handy because you will be drawing these molecules as well as doing some simple math for this module we will use boron trifluoride as our example first you write the the formula using atomic symbols bf the next step requires you to pick the least electronegative atom to be your central atom in this case boron b will be our central atom next you must sum of the total amount of valence electrons in the outer most orbital of each atom boron contains valence electrons while the
