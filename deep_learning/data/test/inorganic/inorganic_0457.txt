central atom and place the three fluorine atoms a small distance away from it the fluorine molecules should be an equal distance away from each other next you must draw a short line connecting the boron atom to each of the fluorine atom these short lines each represent electrons that are being shared between the two bonded atoms because we have lines in this diagram it means that we have used up of our original electrons leaving us with electrons left these electrons will be used to fill the octets of the atoms surrounding the central atom these electrons will
