pairs on it be can also conclude that bf has a trigonal planar geometry with sp hybridization bf is only one of the many simple lewis structures there are others that require a little bit more time in creating because they contain a little bit more criteria to complete it some of the more complex structures may contain charges as well as double or triple bonds there are also many molecules that break the octet rule and can form a total of or bonds to the central atom formal charges when drawing lewis structures you need to check the structures
