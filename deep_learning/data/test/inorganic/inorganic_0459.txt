create the structure though the steps that were given above the only additional step required is to put your final structure in brackets with the charge of the molecule outside of the brackets triiodide can be seen below multiple bonds in lewis strutures in the case of co when it comes time to create a lewis structure it seems as though you don not have enough electrons to complete the octets of all the atoms when you run into this problem it usually means that the molecule will contain a double or triple bond there are valence electrons in a
