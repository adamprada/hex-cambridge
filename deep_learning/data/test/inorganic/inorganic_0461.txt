labile meaning that it can exchange its ligands rapidly for example the exchange between a c labeled cn ion and a bound cn ligand occurs on the timescale of tens of milliseconds conversely a compound can be thermodynamically unstable but kinetically inert meaning that it takes a relatively long time to react for example the conh ion is unstable in acid but its hydrolysis reaction with concentrated hcl takes about one week to go to completion at room temperature henry taube who studied the mechanisms of ligand exchange reactions in simple test tube experiments classified transition metal complexes as labile
