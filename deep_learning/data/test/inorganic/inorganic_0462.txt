transfer and ligand exchange reactions of transition metal complexes crystal field stabilization energy and ligand exchange rates lets consider a very commmon and simple ligand exchange reaction which is the substitution of one water molecule for another in an octahedral mhon complex since the products except for the label are the same as the reactants we know that Î´g and keq for this reaction the progress of the reaction can be monitored by nmr by using isotopically labeled water typically containing o or o the most striking thing about this otherwise boring reaction is the vast difference in rate constants
