penalty for distorting the complex away from octahedral symmetry to make for example a or coordinate intermediate is particularly high this activation energy for ligand substitution is lower for cr and cu which already have electrons in antibonding eg orbitals based on the rules we developed for calculating the cfse of transition metal complexes we can now predict the trends in ligand substitution rates octahedral complexes with d and dlow spin configurations such as cr d co d rh d ru d and os d tend to be substitutioninert because of their high cfse square planar d complexes especially those
