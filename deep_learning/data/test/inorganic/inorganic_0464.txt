mn in these cases the cfse is zero and the energetic cost of breaking octahedral symmetry is relatively low for pblock elements faster exchange occurs with larger ions eg ba ca and ga al because lewis acid strength decreases with increasing ion size the cu ion d as a jahnteller ion is already distorted away from octahedral symmetry and is therefore quite labile exchanging water ligands at a rate of about s ligand substitution mechanisms for an mln complex undergoing ligand substitution there are essentially three different reaction mechanisms in the dissociative mechanism a mln complex first loses a ligand
