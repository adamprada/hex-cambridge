the case of an octahedral complex this reaction would be first order in ml and zero order in y but only if the highest energy transition state is the one that precedes the formation of the ml intermediate if the two transition states are close in energy as in the case of the animation at the right then the rate law becomes more complicated in this case we can simplify the problem by assuming a low steadystate concentration of the mln intermediate the resulting rate law is which reduces to the simpler firstorder rate law when ky kl because the
