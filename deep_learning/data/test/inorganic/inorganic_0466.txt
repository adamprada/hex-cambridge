the selectivity of the reaction depends not only on the nature of the metal catalyst but also on the molecule that is involved in the catalytic cycle berry pseudorotation mechanism examples of associative mechanisms are commonly found in the chemistry of d square planar metal complexes eg vaskas complex irclcopch and tetrachloroplatinateii these compounds ml bind the incoming substituting ligand y to form pentacoordinate intermediates mly which in a subsequent step dissociate one of their ligands although the incoming ligand is initially bound at an equatorial site the berry pseudorotation provides a low energy pathway for all ligands to sample
