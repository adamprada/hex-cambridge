of certain ligand substitution reactions the trans effect refers to the labilization making more reactive of ligands that are trans to certain other ligands the latter being referred to as transdirecting ligands the labilization of trans ligands is attributed to electronic effects and is most notable in square planar complexes but it can also be observed with octahedral complexes the cis effect is most often observed in octahedral complexes in addition to the kinetic trans effect trans ligands also have an influence on the ground state of the molecule the most notable ones being bond lengths and stability some authors
