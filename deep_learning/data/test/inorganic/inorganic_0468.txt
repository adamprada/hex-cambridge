be poor transdirecting ligands whereas strong field ligands are strongly transdirecting the classic example of the trans effect is the synthesis of cisplatin and its trans isomer starting from ptcl the first nh ligand is added to any of the four equivalent positions at random however since cl has a greater trans effect than nh the second nh is added trans to a cl and therefore cis to the first nh if on the other hand one starts from ptnh the trans product is obtained instead the trans effect in square complexes can be explained in terms of the associative
