is eliminated the interchange mechanism is similar to the associative and dissociative pathways except that no distinct mlny or mln intermediate is formed this concerted mechanism can be thought of as analogous to nucleophilic substitution via the sn pathway at a tetrahedral carbon atom in organic chemistry the interchange mechanism is further classified as associative ia or dissociative id depending on the relative importance of my and ml bonding in the transition state if the transition state is characterized by the formation of a strong my bond then the mechanism is ia conversely if weakening of the ml bond is
