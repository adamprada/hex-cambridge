to form a solid the positive ions experience both attraction and repulsion from ions of opposite charge and ions of the same charge the madelung constant is a property of the crystal structure and depends on the lattice parameters anioncation distances and molecular volume of the crystal d crystal before considering a threedimensional crystal lattice we shall discuss the calculation of the energetics of a linear chain of ions of alternate signs figure figure a hypothetical onedimensional lattice let us select the positive sodium ion in the middle at as a reference and let be the shortest distance between adjacent
