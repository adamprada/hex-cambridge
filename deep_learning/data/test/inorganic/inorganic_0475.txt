does present greater difficulty and it is not possible to sum the series conveniently as in the case of onedimensional lattice as an example let us consider the the crystal in the following discussion assume be the distance between and ions the nearest neighbors of are six ions at a distance r ions at a distance r eight ions at r six ions at r ions at r and so on thus the electrostatic potential of a single ion in a crystal by approximating the ions by point charges of the surrounding ions for nacl is a poorly converging series
