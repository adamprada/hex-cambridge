wurtzite hexagonal tio rutile tetragonal rutile bsio hexagonal alo rhombohedral corundum a is the number of anions coordinated to cation and c is the numbers of cations coordinated to anion there are other factors to consider for the evaluation of lattice energy and the treatment by max born and alfred lande led to the formula for the evaluation of lattice energy for a mole of crystalline solid the bornland√© equation equation is a means of calculating the lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound and derived from the electrostatic potential of the ionic lattice and a repulsive potential energy term
