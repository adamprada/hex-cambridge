given by much more should be considered in order to evaluate the lattice energy accurately but the above calculation leads you to a good start when methods to evaluate the energy of crystallization or lattice energy lead to reliable values these values can be used in the bornhable cycle to evaluate other chemical properties for example the electron affinity which is really difficult to determine directly by experiment a boronb carbongraphitediamondfullerenec silicond nitrogene phosphorusphosphorus compounds as ligands a boron refined elemental boron is a black solid with a metallic luster the unit cell of crystalline boron contains or boron atoms
