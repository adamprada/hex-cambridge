many chemists preferred an ethanelike structure hbbh by analogy with hydrocarbons however h c longuethiggins proposed the concept of the electrondeficient center electron bond ce bond and it was proven by electron diffraction in that the structure was correct figure figure structure of diborane it has been elucidated by electron diffraction single crystal xray structure analysis infrared spectroscopy etc that boranes contain center electron bonds ce bond bhb and besides the usual center electron covalent bonds ce bond bh and bb such structures can be treated satisfactorily by molecular orbital theory boranes are classified into closo nido arachno etc according
