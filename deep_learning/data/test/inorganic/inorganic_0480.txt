skeletons are also built by bb bbb and bhb bonds and these are called arachno type boranes the structures of typical boranes are shown in figure figure structures of boranes not only diborane but also higher boranes are electrondeficient compounds that are difficult to explain using lewis electronic structure based on simple center electron covalent bonds exercise why is diborane called an electron deficient compound answer it is because there are only valence electrons of boron and hydrogen atoms although electrons are necessary to assign two electrons each to eight bh bonds k wade summarized the relation of the number
