these compounds b carbon graphite diamond fullerene and amorphous carbon are carbon allotropes usually a carbon atom forms four bonds using four valence electrons graphite graphite is structured as layers of honeycombshaped membered rings of carbon atoms that look like condensed benzene rings without any hydrogen atoms figure the carboncarbon distance between inlayer carbon atoms is pm and the bonds have double bond character analogous to aromatic compounds since the distance between layers is pm and the layers are held together by comparatively weak van der waals forces they slide when subjected to an applied force this is the origin
