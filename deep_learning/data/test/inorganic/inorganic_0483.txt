the earths crust after oxygen most of this silicon exists as a component of silicate rocks and the element is not found as a simple substance therefore silicon is produced by the reduction of quartz and sand with highgrade carbon using electric arc furnaces highergrade silicon is obtained by hydrogen reduction of sihcl which is produced by the hydrochlorination of low purity silicon followed by rectification the silicon used for semiconductor devices is further refined by the crystal czochralski or zone melting methods the crystal mp o c has a metallic luster and the diamond type structure there are three
