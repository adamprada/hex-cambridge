ligands tertiary phosphines pr and phosphites por are very important ligands in transition metal complex chemistry especially triphenylphosphine pch triethyl phosphine pch and their derivatives are useful ligands in many complexes because it is possible to control precisely their electronic and steric properties by modifying substituents refer to section c although they are basically sigma donors they can exhibit some pi accepting character by changing the substituents into electron accepting ph phenyl or cl f etc the order of the electronaccepting character estimated from the co stretching vibrations and c nmr chemical shifts of the phosphine or phosphitesubstituted metal carbonyl
