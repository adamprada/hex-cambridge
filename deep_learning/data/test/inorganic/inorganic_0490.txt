metallic atoms it is the size of a metallic atom however the actually measurement of the radius is very vague because electrons dont stay at one point they orbits around contributors and attributions molecular orbitals mo are constructed from atomic orbitals in o and f there is a crossover of the sigma and the pi ortbials the relative energies of the sigma orbitals drop below that of the pi orbitals information from the mo diagram justify os stability and show that its bonding order is the lumo lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and homo highest occupied molecular orbital of difluorides mo
