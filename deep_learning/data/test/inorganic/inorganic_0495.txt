need to give the and coordinates of each of its atoms ie which is a total of numbers however we note that the molecule looks the same no matter where in space it is located this is called translational invariance and it implies that we can give only the coordinates of one of the atoms relative to the other which is equivalent to giving the vector difference between and or viceversa which we will call the vector which is only numbers this is the same as arbitrarily placing atom a at the origin of our coordinate system we also note
