diatomic in spite of this simplification it is often necessary to specify all of the coordinates of the atoms in a molecule molecular modeling packages which are becoming increasingly important in chemical research require a full set of coordinates for each atom as input similarly molecular data banks such as the protein data bank pdb will give molecular structures as files of and coordinates thus being able to determine a set of coordinates given only bond lengths and bond angles and conversely being able to determine bond lengths and angles from a set of coordinates is an extremely important skill
