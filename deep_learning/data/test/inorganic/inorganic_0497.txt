xaxis a distance away from will be clearly this set of coordinates reproduces the correct bond length thus for the molecule whose bond length is r stackrelcirca a set of coordinates could be in this is just one possibility we could have chosen either atom to be at the origin or anywhere else in space for that matter and chosen the bond to lie along any axis or not along any particular axis as we choose so long as the correct bond length is reproduced example water the geometry of water is bent we will see how to determine this
