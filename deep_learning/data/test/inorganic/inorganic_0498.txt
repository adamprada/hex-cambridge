of the angle as can be shown using simple trigonometry to verify that the bond lengths are correctly reproduced we compute the magnitudes of the vector differences and in order to verify that the bond angle is correct we note that the angle between two vectors and is given by the formula where is the dot product of and defined to be thus the angle is given by periodic trends in bond lengths and bond energies within a group of the periodic table bond lengths tend to increase with increasing atomic number consider the group elements which corresponds to an
