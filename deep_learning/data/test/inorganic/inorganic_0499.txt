bond lengths increase with increasing there is a corresponding decrease in the bond dissociation energy bonds are an exception to the the rule of constancy of bond lengths across different molecules because bonds can be single double or triple bonds some differences can occur for example consider the bond in the molecules ethane ethylene and acetylene the greater the bond order ie number of shared electron pairs the greater the dissociation energy the same will be true for any kind of bond that can come in such different flavors eg bonds bonds bonds bonds etc polar covalent bonds most real
