pauling came up with another method that forms the basis of our understanding of electronegativity today paulings method recall the mullikens method was based on the arithmetic average of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity both of these energies are properties of individual atoms hence this method is appealing in its simplicity however there is no information about bonding in the mulliken method paulings method includes such information and hence is a more effective approach to see how the pauling method works consider a diatomic which is polar covalent let and be the dissociation energies of the diatomics
