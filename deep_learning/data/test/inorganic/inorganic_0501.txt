input information he was able to generate a table of atomic electronegativities that are still used today table a to use the electronegativities to estimate degree of ionic character simply compute the absolute value of the difference for the two atoms in the bond as an example consider again the hydrogen halides as the electronegativity difference decreases so does the ionic character of the bond hence its covalent character increases electric dipole moment in a nearly perfect ionic bond such as where electron transfer is almost complete representing the molecule as is a very good approximation since the charge on
