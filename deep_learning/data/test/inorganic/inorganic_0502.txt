is a quantity that can be measured experimentally the electric dipole moment of an assembly of charges having positions is defined to be thus for a diatomic with charges and on atoms and respectively the dipole moment according to the definition would be hence the magnitude of the dipole moment is where is the bond length as an example consider which has a partial charge on of which means and a bond length of thus the magnitude of the dipole moment is thus the units of the dipole moment are coulomb meters however as this example makes clear this is
