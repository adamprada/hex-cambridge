heart of a widely used experimental method for probing the vibrational dynamics of a system if a system is exposed to a monochromatic electromagnetic field from a laser then the electric dipole moment couples to the electric field component in such a way that the energy is in general the electric field is a function of space and time having the general wave form where is the frequency of the field with the speed of light and the wavelength and is called the wave vector and the direction of is the direction of wave propagation this will be covered in
