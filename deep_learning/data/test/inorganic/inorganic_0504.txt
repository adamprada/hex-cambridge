modes have their characteristic frequency etc what one seeks in this experiment is a report of the natural frequencies in the system since from such a report one can often tell one local chemical environment from another by sweeping through a range of frequencies the coupling of the field to the dipole moment suggests that the local charge distribution will respond to the oscillations of the field at the field frequency thus if the field frequency is tuned to be that of a bond stretch the charge distribution in the bond will be stimulated and report on the frequency of
