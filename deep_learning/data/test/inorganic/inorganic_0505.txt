peaks in the spectra occur at particular vibrational frequencies in the system the water spectrum shows very distinct bands while the spectrum of the koh solutions shows both bands and continuum regions the latter arise from the fact that protons can be transferred from water to hydroxide as the proton moves across a hydrogen bond between water and the hydroxide ion the vibrations in the bond sweep through a range of frequencies as the proton is transferred giving rise to the continuum this feature in the infrared spectra of solutions of strong acids and bases is known as zundel polarization
