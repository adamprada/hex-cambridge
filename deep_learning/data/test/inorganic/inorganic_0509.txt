the homonuclear diatomics such as o n cl have the same atomic orbital energies so the orbital interaction between them is very strong on the other hand in the heteronuclear diatomic co hf the atomic orbitals lie at different energy the orbital interaction depends on how close their energy difference is orbital size is another factor that affects the strength of orbital interactions due to the overlap region of orbitals the orbitals with different sizes have weaker interactions than the same size orbitals the result of a weaker bond can be explained by the weaker overlap between orbitals this is
