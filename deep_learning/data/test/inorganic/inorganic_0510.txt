inphase increasing the intensity of the light and other one is outofphase decreasing the intensity of the light similarly electron waves interaction has two types inphase and outofphase inphase interaction increases the intensity of negative charge on the other hand decreasing the intensity of the negative charge results from the out of phase interaction the orbital phase is presented by a plus or minus sign when the two same sign orbitals overlap to form a molecular orbital the electron density will occupy at the region between two nuclei this negative charge intensity of electrons will increase in the inphase interaction
