orbital h is the most stable because it has the highest bond order in comparison with the bond orders of h and h theoretically it would not be possible to form a molecule from two hydrides because the antibonding and bonding orbitals would cancel each other out so the bond order is zero because the antibonding ortibal is filled it destabilizes the structure making the molecule h very nonstable bond order no bond formation thus this molecule doesnt exist no headers significancereferences a method for estimating electronegativity was developed by robert mulliken nobel prize in chemistry who noticed that elements
