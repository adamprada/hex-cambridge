of an atom to attract electrons as this definition is not dependent on an arbitrary relative scale it has also been termed absolute electronegativity using our definition of electron affinity we can write mullikens original expression for electronegativity as followsmullikens definition used the magnitude of the ionization energy and the electron affinity by definition the magnitude of a quantity is a positive number our definition of electron affinity produces negative values for the electron affinity for most elements so vertical lines indicating absolute value are needed in equation to make sure that we are adding two positive numbers in the
