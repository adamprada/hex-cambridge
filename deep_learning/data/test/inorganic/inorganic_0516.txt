linear transformation to transform these absolute values into values that resemble the more familiar pauling values for ionization energies and electron affinities in electronvolts and for energies in kjmol the mulliken electronegativity can only be calculated for an element for which the electron affinity is known fiftyseven elements as of the mulliken electronegativity of an atom is sometimes said to be the negative of the chemical potential by inserting the energetic definitions of the ionization potential and electron affinity into the mulliken electronegativity it is possible to show that the mulliken chemical potential is a finite difference approximation of the
