the mulliken and pauling definitions however the conclusions are likely to apply to atoms in molecules as well significance despite being developed from a very different set of principles than pauling electronegativity which is based on bond dissociation energies there is a good correlation between mullikin and pauling electronegativities for the atoms as shown in the plot below although pauling electronegativities are usually what are found in textbooks the mullikin electronegativity more intuitively corresponds to the ability of an atom to draw electrons toward itself in bonding and is probably a better indicator of that property however because of the
