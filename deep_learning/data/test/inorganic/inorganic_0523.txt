of hydrogen it is very rare on the earth because it is lighter than air helium originated from solar nuclear reactions and was locked up in the earths crust it is extracted as a byproduct of natural gas from specific areas especially in north america since helium has the lowest boiling point k of all the substances it is important for lowtemperature science and superconductivity engineering moreover its lightness is utilized in airships etc since argon is separated in large quantities when nitrogen and oxygen are produced from liquid air it is widely used in metallurgy and in industries and
