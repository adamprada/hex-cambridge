comparatively simple it is not easy to isolate pure compounds especially xef hydrolysis of the fluorides forms oxides xeo is a very explosive compound although it is stable in aqueous solution these solutions are very oxidizing tetroxide xeo is the most volatile xenon compound mxef m is rb and cs are very stable and do not decompose even when heated at c thus xenon forms divalent to octavalent compounds fluorides can also be used as fluorinating reagents although it is known that krypton and radon also form compounds the compounds of krypton and radon are rarely studied as both their
