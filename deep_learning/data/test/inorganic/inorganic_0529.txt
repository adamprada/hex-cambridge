and d d complexes with any ligands examples of such d complexes are nicn the anticancer drug cisplatin cisptnhcl pdho and aucl at the d electron count the lowest four orbitals are filled and the highest orbital the dxy is empty resulting in a large cfse these complexes are diamagnetic and tend to be quite stable with weak field ligands d complexes are octahedral and paramagnetic eg niho which has two unpaired electrons in the eg orbitals square planar complexes in catalysis square planar d complexes can be oxidized by two electrons to become octahedral low spin d complexes which
