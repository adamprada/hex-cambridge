by inserting the olefin into the metalhydrogen bond a process called migratory insertion finally the complex returns to the square planar geometry by eliminating the hydrogenated olefin reductive elimination wilkinsons catalyst is highly active and is widely used for homogeneous hydrogenation hydroboration and hydrosilation reactions with chiral phosphine ligands the catalyst can hydrogenate prochiral olefins to give enantiomerically pure products sir geoffrey wilkinson an inorganic chemist at imperial college london developed wilkinsons catalyst in earlier as an assistant professor at harvard university he had elucidated the sandwich structure of ferrocene which had been discovered a few years before but not
