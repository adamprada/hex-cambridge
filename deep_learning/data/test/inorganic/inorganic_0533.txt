comprehension of geometry is required to be able to imagine molecules in d as well as having basic background knowledge of the concept of bonding pairs and lone pairs this allows one to recognize and see the difference in the molecular design for each individual molecule we will begin by describing the design of an octahedral and then continue on to the next two molecules an octahedral is best described as a central atom symmetrically arranged by six other atoms what makes this molecule different from other species is the fact that it is surrounded by six either the same
