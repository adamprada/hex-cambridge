other and from the atom directly across and opposite from it the reson for the spacing is due to the molecule arranging itself in the most stable form possible limiting the bondpair to bondpair interaction here is basic but clear example of what an octahedral looks like octahedral bond pairs and electron pairs the next molecule that we will examine is known as a square pyramidal this molecule has a lot of the same characteristics as that of an octahedral in the sense it consist of a central atom that is still symmetrically surrounded by six other atoms what makes
