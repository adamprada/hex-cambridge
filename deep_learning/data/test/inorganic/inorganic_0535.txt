to visualize the x y and z coordinate plane again but this time remove what would be considered the negative y coordinate axis and put a pair of lone pair electrons in its place the molecule is still considered apart of the octahedral species because it still satisfies the atom requirement but in terms of its shape the electrons effect the shape this allows it to have its new shape if you actually exclude those electrons and lay the molecule on the surface you can see that it looks like a three dimensional pyramid with a square base again all
