of electrons that are replacing the position of two atoms to visualize what this molecule looks like we refer back to the x y and z coordinate system the only difference is this time we are taking away the entire y coordinate and replacing it with electrons on what would be the positive y coordinate axis as well as placing a pair of electrons in what would be considered the negative y coordinate axis the reason for this arrangement goes back to having the molecule arrange itself in the most stable form possible limiting interactions between bondpair to bondpair bondpair
