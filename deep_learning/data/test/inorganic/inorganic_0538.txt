and electronpair interaction as long as these conditions can be met it is possible for the structure to not only exist but remain stable this again goes back to satisfying the conditions of keeping the molecule as stable as possible by limiting lonepair to lone pair interaction as well as same sign interaction because electrons hold the same kind of charge they can not be near eachother due to same charge repulsion and so they need to be as far away as possible from eachother so that the molecule may be stable molecules that would fall into the category of
