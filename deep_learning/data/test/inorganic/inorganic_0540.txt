n l ml ms that means that in the parallel case the pauli principle prevents the electrons from ever visiting each others orbitals in the antiparallel case they are free to come and go because they have different ms quantum numbers however having two electrons in the same orbital is energetically unfavorable because like charges repel thus the parallel arrangement thanks to the pauli principle has lower energy for o valence electrons we get the mo energy diagram below the shapes of the molecular orbitals are shown at the right this energy ordering of mos correctly predicts two unpaired electrons
