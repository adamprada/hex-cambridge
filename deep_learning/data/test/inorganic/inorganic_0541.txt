case of centrosymmetric molecules refer to their symmetry with respect to inversion gerade g orbitals are symmetric meaning that inversion through the center leaves the orbital unchanged ungerade u means that the sign of the orbital is reversed by the inversion operation because g and u orbitals have different symmetries they have zero overlap with each other as we will see below factoring orbitals according to g and u symmetry simplifies the task of constructing molecular orbitals in more complicated molecules such as butadiene and benzene the orbital shapes shown above were computed using a oneelectron model of the molecule
