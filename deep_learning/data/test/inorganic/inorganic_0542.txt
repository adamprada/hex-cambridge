since c has a net bond order of two it reacts rapidly as it cools from the gas phase to make other forms of carbon such as fullerenes graphite and diamond all of which have four bonds for every two carbon atoms no headers the mo picture for a molecule gets complicated when many valence aos are involved we can simplify the problem enormously by noting without proof here that orbitals of different symmetry with respect to the molecule do not interact the symmetry operations of a molecule which can include rotations mirror planes inversion centers etc and the symmetry
