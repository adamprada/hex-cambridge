see from this figure that the h s orbital is unchanged by a rotation about the bond axis however the same rotation inverts the sign of the cl pywavefunction because these two orbitals have different symmetries the cl py orbital is nonbonding and doesnt interact with the h s the same is true of the cl pxorbital the px and py orbitals have π symmetry nodal plane containing the bonding axis and are labeled πnb in the mo energy level diagram fig in contrast the h s and cl pz orbitals both have σ symmetry which is also the symmetry
