cl s orbital is thus affected only slightly by forming the molecule the pairs of electrons in the πnb and σnb orbitals are therefore nonbonding figure energy level diagram of the hcl molecule showing mos derived from the valence aos note that the mo result in fig bond and three pairs of nonbonding electrons is the same as we would get from valence bond theory for hcl the nonbonding orbitals are localized on the cl atom just as we would surmise from the valence bond picture in order to differentiate it from the σ bonding orbital the σ antibonding orbital
