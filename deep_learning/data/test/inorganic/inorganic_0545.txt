techniques of structural analyses available at the time the discovery of ferrocene fech in was epochmaking for the chemistry of this field the very unique bonding mode of this complex became clear by means of single crystal xray structural analysis nmr spectra infrared spectra etc and served as a starting point for subsequent developments in the field it was a major discovery that ferrocene exhibited very high thermal stability in spite of the general view that the transition metalcarbon bonds were very unstable it was also clearly demonstrated that the compound had a sandwich structure in which the five carbon
