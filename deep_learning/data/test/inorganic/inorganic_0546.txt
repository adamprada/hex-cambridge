but cn complexes etc with no organometallic character are usually excluded from organometallic compounds metal carbonyl compounds are organometallic in various aspects of their bonding structure and reactions and they are a good model system for understanding of the essence of transition metal organometallic chemistry a metal carbonyl compounds binary metal carbonyl compounds that consist only of a metal and co ligands are usually prepared by the direct reaction of the powder of a highly reactive metal and carbon monoxide or by the reduction of a metal salt to zero valance followed by reaction with highpressure carbon monoxide however tetracarbonylnickel
