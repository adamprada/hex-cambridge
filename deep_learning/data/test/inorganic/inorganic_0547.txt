oriented along the direction of the metalcarbon axis binuclear metal carbonyl mnco has an mnmn bond joining two square pyramidal mnco parts in feco two feco subunits are bridged by three co ligands and in coco two coco subunits are connected by both three co bridges and a coco bond there are a number of cluster metal carbonyl compounds with metalmetal bonds joining three or more metals and terminal co co a bridge between two metals and co a bridge capping three metals are coordinated to the metal frames refer to section f many cluster carbonyls are formed by a
