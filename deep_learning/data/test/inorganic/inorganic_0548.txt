such bonding was possible let alone stable at all the belief that normal coordination bonds were formed by the donation of electrons from highly basic ligands to a metal formed the basis of the coordination theory of a werner because the basicity of carbon monoxide is very low and transition metalcarbon bonds are generally not very stable a suitable explanation for the stability of metal carbonyl compounds was sought if the shape and symmetry of the metal d orbital and of the co antibonding orbital for the carbonoxygen bond are suitable for overlap a bonding interaction between the metal and
