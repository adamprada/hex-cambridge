because carbonyl frequencies are easily detectable the lowering of the oxidation state of a metal by the flow of negative charge from its coordinated ligands is reflected in the reduction of the co stretching frequencies b hydrocarbon complexes an organometallic compound is one which has metalcarbon bonds and between one and eight carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon ligand bond to a metal hapticity describes the number of atoms in a ligand that have direct coordinative interaction with the metal and the number is added to an example is pentahaptocyclopentadienyl table a ligand that donates an odd number of electrons to
