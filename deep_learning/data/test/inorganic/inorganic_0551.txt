is gradually accepted that a major cause of the instability of alkyl complexes is the low activation energy of their decomposition rather than a low mc bond energy the most general decomposition path is elimination namely the bonding interaction of a hydrocarbon ligand with the central transition metal tends to result in the formation of a metal hydride and an olefin such an interaction is called an agostic interaction although an alkyl and an aryl ligand are electron ligands they are regarded as anions when the oxidation number of the metal is counted the hydride ligand h resembles the alkyl
