cpreh yellow mp cpos white mp the cyclopentadienyl ligand is a electron and formally anionic ligand if only one of the five carbon atoms is bonded to a metal it is a electron ligand like an alkyl group it becomes a electron ligand in rare cases and coordinates to a metal as a allyl system that extends over carbon atoms the cp group of ferrocene has reactivity analogous to that of aromatic compounds since the cp group has played a significant role as a stabilizing ligand to realize the preparation of new compounds with new metalligand bonding modes it can
