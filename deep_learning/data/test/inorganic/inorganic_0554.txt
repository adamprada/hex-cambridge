the metal and olefin is stabilized by the contribution of dp back donation an olefin is a electron ligand and there are many olefin complexes in which the central metal is in a relatively low oxidation state dienes or trienes with two or more double bonds coordinate to a metal as electron or electron ligands fecoch and nicod in which a butadiene or cyclooctadienes cod are coordinated to the metal are well known examples since cyclooctadienes are easily eliminated from nicod it is conveniently used for generating atomic zero valent nickel this complex is sometimes called naked nickel figure backdonation
