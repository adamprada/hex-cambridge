of a compound since both the metal and organic moieties are involved in organometallic compounds counting the number of electrons becomes complicated hydrocarbyl ligands are classified as either neutral molecules coordinating to the metal or radicals bonding to the metal and the radicals such as alkyls and cyclopentadienyl are generally called anionic ligands transfer of one electron from the metal to the radical ligand makes the ligand formally anionic however it is less confusing to consider that both the metal and the ligands are neutral when counting the number of valence electrons the numbers of donor electrons in typical carbon
