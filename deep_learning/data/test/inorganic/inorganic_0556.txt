the monomeric parts of mnco coco or fechco have only electrons and the extra electron comes from the partner metal by forming a metalmetal bond unlike the electron rule in main group compounds applicability of the electron rule is limited that is to say it is a sufficient condition but compounds with high thermal stability are not necessarily electron compounds although there are many group chromium group through group cobalt group organometallic compounds with carbonyl or cyclopentadienyl ligands that satisfy the electron rule many compounds of the early transition metals group and group nickel group fail to conform to this
