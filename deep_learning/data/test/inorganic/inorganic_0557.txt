tertiary phosphines px are very useful as stabilization ligands in transition metal complexes and they coordinate to the metals in relatively high to low oxidation states phosphines are frequently used as carbonyl or cyclopentadienyl ligands in the chemistry of organometallic complexes px are lewis bases and coordinate to the metal using the lone pair on phosphorus and show acidity when carrying substituents x including ph cl or f that have strong electron accepting properties the electronic flexibility of px is the reason it forms so many complexes generally the Ï€acidity becomes smaller in the order pf pcl pph pr triphenylphosphine
