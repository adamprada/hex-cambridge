coordination sites as well as those of monodentate phosphines have been prepared and they are used also as stabilization ligands in hydride alkyl dinitrogen and dihydrogen complexes the complexes of rhodium or ruthenium in which optically active phosphines are coordinated are excellent catalysts for asymmetric synthesis no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to develop the next generation of openaccess texts to improve postsecondary education at all levels of higher learning the libretexts approach is highly collaborative where an open access textbook environment
