smaller electronegativity has a positive charge since electrical charges do not differ in the case of a molecule composed of the same atoms the oxidation number of the atoms is the quotient of the net electrical charge divided by the number of atoms in the case of a compound or an ion consisting of different atoms the atoms with larger electronegativity can be considered as anions and those with smaller electronegativity as cations for example nitrogen is valent in n oxygen is in o nitrogen is and oxygen in no but nitrogen is and hydrogen in nh that is the
