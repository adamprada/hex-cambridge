of oxygen and reduction is the reverse of oxidation the present definition of reduction is a reaction which gives an electron and oxidation is the reaction which takes an electron therefore a reagent which gives an electron is a reductant and one which takes an electron is an oxidant as a result of a redox reaction a reductant is oxidized and an oxidant is reduced for example in the reaction of molybdenum metal and chlorine gas to form molybdenum pentachloride molybdenum is a reductant and changes its oxidation state from to and chlorine is an oxidant and changes its oxidation
