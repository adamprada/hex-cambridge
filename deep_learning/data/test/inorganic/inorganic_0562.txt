the series of the oxides and hydrides of nitrogen in acidic solution as an example in a basic solution the series becomes the additivity of the state function g is used in order to calculate the standard reduction potential between remote oxidation states where the free energy change and electric potential between adjacent states are respectively and the number of transferred electrons n n namely for example in the reduction of no to hno two electrons are transferred to form hno via no and the potential becomes exercise calculate the reduction potential of the reduction of no to no in
