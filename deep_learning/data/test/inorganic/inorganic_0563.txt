an electron to the lumo however various factors such as solvent effects should be taken into consideration during quantitative discussions of redox processes no headers the simplest possible chemical reaction involves the transfer of one or more electrons between two atoms in the simple reaction we assume that sodium transfers an electron to chlorine creating the sodium ion and the chloride ion we can write the two steps of this reaction as and the first of these steps involves the loss of an electron and is called an oxidation reaction while the second step involves the gain of an electron
