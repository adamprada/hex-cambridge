acid for several minutes wed easily observe that the zinc is being dissolved while a gas is being liberated this process is illustrated below the reaction taking place here is obviously in this reaction the hydrogen ions are being reduced while the zinc is being oxidized a similar reaction may be observed if we place a zinc bar into a solution containing copper sulfate here the reaction is again the zinc is being oxidized while the copper is being reduced unlike the case of zinc in acid the reaction will only continue until the copper has formed a film on
