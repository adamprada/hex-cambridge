multiple multiply all of the coefficients in the halfreaction by this same number add the two halfreactions write one equation with all the reactants from the halfreactions on the left and all the products on the right the order in which you write the particles in the combined equation does not matter simplify the equation cancel things that are found on both sides of the equation as you did in net ionic equations rewrite the final balanced equation check to see that electrons elements and total charge are balanced there should be no electrons in the equation at this time
