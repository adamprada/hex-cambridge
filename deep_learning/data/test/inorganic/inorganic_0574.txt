sharing the corner oxygen atoms they are classified by the number of cornersharing oxygen atoms in the sio tetrahedra as this determines their composition and structure when the sio tetrahedra connect by corner sharing the structures of the polymeric compounds become a chain a ring a layer or dimensional depending on the connection modes of adjacent units fractional expression is adopted in order to show the bridging modes namely the numerator in the fraction is the number of bridging oxygens and the denominator is meaning that one oxygen atom is shared by two tetrahedra the empirical formulae are as follows
