they are called aluminosilicates aluminum atoms replace the silicon atoms in the tetrahedral sites or occupy the octahedral cavities of oxygen atoms making the structures more complicated the substitution of a tetravalent silicon by a trivalent aluminum causes a shortage of charge which is compensated by occlusion of extra cations such as h na ca etc feldspars are a typical aluminosilicate mineral and kalsio orthoclase and naalsio albite are also known well feldspars take dimensional structures in which all the corners of the sio and alo tetrahedra are shared on the other hand dimensional layers are formed if alsio units
