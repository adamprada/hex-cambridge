and tunnels of various sizes the structures are composites of the basic structural units of tetrahedral mo as shown in figure the basic units are cubes with condensed mo hexagonal prisms with condensed mo and truncated octahedra with condensed mo figure structure of zeolite a silicon or aluminum atoms are located on the corners of the polyhedra and the bridging oxygen atoms on the middle of each edge it should be noted that this expression is different from the polyhedron model of oxides when these polyhdra are bonded various kinds of zeolite structures are formed for example the truncated octahedra
