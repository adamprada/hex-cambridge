zeolites are used in large quantities as softeners of hard water as zeolites dehydrated by heating absorb water efficiently they are also used as desiccants of solvents or gases zeolites are sometimes called molecular sieves since the sizes of holes and tunnels change with the kinds of zeolites and it is possible to segregate organic molecules according to their sizes zeolites can fix the directions of more than two molecules in their cavities and can be used as catalysts for selective reactions for example synthetic zeolite zsm is useful as a catalyst to convert methanol to gasoline this zeolite is
