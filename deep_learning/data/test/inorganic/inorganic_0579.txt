antibonding orbital is easily removed and no becomes no nitrosonium which is isoelectronic with co since an electron is lost from the antibonding orbital the no bond becomes stronger the compounds nobf and nohso containing this cation are used as electron oxidants although no is paramagnetic as a monomer in the gas phase dimerization in the ondensed phase leads to diamagnetism it is unique as a ligand of transition metal complexes and forms complexes like fecono in which no is a neutral electron ligand although mno is straight in these kind of complexes the mno angle bends to in conhno
