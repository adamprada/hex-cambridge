and hyponitrous acid hno nitric acid hno is one of the most important acids in the chemical industry along with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid nitric acid is produced industrially by the ostwald process which is the oxidation reaction of ammonia in which the oxidation number of nitrogen increases from to because the gibbs energy of the direct conversion of dinitrogen to the intermediate no is positive and therefore the reaction is unfavorable thermodynamically dinitrogen is firstly reduced to ammonia and this is then oxidized to no nitric acid hno commercial nitric acid is a ca aqueous solution and vacuum
