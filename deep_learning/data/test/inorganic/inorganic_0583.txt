hso respectively phosphorus pentoxide forms orthophosphoric acid hpo when reacted with sufficient water but if insufficient water is used various kinds of condensed phosphoric acids are produced depending on the quantity of reacting water phosphorus trioxide po is a molecular oxide and its tetrahedral structure results from the removal of only the terminal oxygen atoms from phosphorus pentoxide each phosphorus is tricoordinate this compound is formed when white phosphorus is oxidized at low temperatures in insufficient oxygen the oxides with compositions intermediate between phosphorus pentoxide and trioxide have to terminal oxygen atoms and their structures have been analyzed although arsenic
