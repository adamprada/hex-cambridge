molecules condense by the removal of an ho molecule pyrophosphoric acid hpo is formed phosphonic acid hpo this acid is also called phosphorous acid and has h in place of one of the oh groups of orthophosphoric acid since there are only two oh groups it is a dibasic acid phosphinic acid hpo it is also called hypophosphorous acid and two of the oh groups in orthophosphoric acid are replaced by h atoms the remaining one oh group shows monobasic acidity if the po tetrahedra in the above phosphorus acids bind by o bridges many condensed phosphoric acids form adenosine
