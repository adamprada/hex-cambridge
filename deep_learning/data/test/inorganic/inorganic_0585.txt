transition metals it is a nonaqueous solvent similar to liquid ammonia and is used for special reactions or as a solvent for special nmr measurements sulfur trioxide so it is produced by catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide and used for manufacturing sulfuric acid the usual commercial reagent is a liquid bp c the gaseous phase monomer is a planar molecule it is in equilibrium with a ring trimer so so in the gaseous or liquid phase in the presence of a minute amount of water so changes to so which is a crystalline high polymer with a helical structure so
