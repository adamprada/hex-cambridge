dissolves in water with the generation of a large amount of heat to give strongly acidic solutions thiosulfuric acid hso although it is generated if thiosulfate is acidified the free acid is unstable the so ion is derived from the replacement of one of the oxygen atoms of so by sulfur and is mildly reducing sulfurous acid hso the salt is very stable although the free acid has not been isolated the so ion that has pyramidal cv symmetry is a reducing agent in dithionic acid hso and the dithionite ion so the oxidation number of sulfer is and one
