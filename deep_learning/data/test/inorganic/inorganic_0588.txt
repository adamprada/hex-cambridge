radius the trend for electronegativity is to increase as you move from left to right and bottom to top across the periodic table this means that the most electronegative atom is fluorine and the least electronegative is francium there are a few different types of electronegativity which differ only in their definitions and the system by which they assign values for electronegativity for example there is mulliken electronegativity which is defined as the average of the ionization energy and electron affinity of an atom which as we will see differs slightly from paulings definition of electronegativity pauling electronegativity linus pauling
