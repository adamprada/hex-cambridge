energy and therefore the δ bond energies would be zero if the electronegativities of these atoms are not the same we would see a polar molecule where one atom would start to pull electron density toward itself causing it to become partially negative by doing some careful experiments and calculations pauling came up with a slightly more sophisticated equation for the relative electronegativities of two atoms in a molecule enx eny δ in that equation the factor is simply a conversion factor between kj and ev to keep the units consistent with bond energies by assigning a value of to
