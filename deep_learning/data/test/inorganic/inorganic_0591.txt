what youd expect the charge to be from a certain number of protons but minus a certain amount of charge from other electrons slaters rules allow you to estimate the effective nuclear charge from the real number of protons in the nucleus and the effective shielding of electrons in each orbital shell eg to compare the effective nuclear charge and shielding d and s in transition metals slaters rules are fairly simple and produce fairly accurate predictions of things like the electron configurations and ionization energies slaters rules step write the electron configuration of the atom in the following form
