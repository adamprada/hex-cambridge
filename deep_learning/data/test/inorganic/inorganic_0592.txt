lower groups shield these rules are summarized in figure and table figure graphical depiction of slaters rules with shielding constants indicated cc bync Ã¼mit kaya shielding happens when electrons in lower valence shells or the same valence shell provide a repulsive force to valence electrons thereby negating some of the attractive force from the positive nucleus electrons really close to the atom n or lower pretty much just look like protons so they completely negate as electrons get closer to the electron of interest some more complex interactions happen that reduce this shielding table slaters rules for calculating shieldings group
