found by totaling the screening by all electrons except the one in question where is the number of electrons in a specific shell and subshell and is the shielding of the electrons subject to slaters rules table electrons of nitrogen atoms what is the shielding constant experienced by a p electron in the nitrogen atom given nitrogen n asked for the shielding constant for a p electron equation ref strategy determine the electron configuration of nitrogen then write it in the appropriate form use the appropriate slater rules table to calculate the shielding constant for the electron step a n
