then substitute the shielding constant obtained using equation to calculate an estimate of for the corresponding atomic electron example the effective charge of p electrons of boron atoms what is the effective nuclear charge experienced by a valence p electron in boron given boron b asked for for a valence p electron strategy determine the electron configuration of boron and identify the electron of interest use the appropriate slater rule to calculate the shielding constant for the electron use the periodic table to determine the actual nuclear charge for boron determine the effective nuclear constant solution step a b s
