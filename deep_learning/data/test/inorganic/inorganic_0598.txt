overlap of porbitals in the mo diagrams of secondrow diatomics bo it is important to remember that πbonds are weaker than σ bonds made from the same aos and are especially weak if they involve elements beyond the second row example ethylene stable molecule doesnt polymerize without a catalyst silylene never isolated spontaneously polymerizes calculations indicate kjmol stability in the gas phase relative to singlybonded triplet hsisih the large ne core of si atoms inhibits sideways overlap of p orbitals weak πbond other examples p vs n p cannot make πbonds with itself so it forms a tetrahedral molecule with
