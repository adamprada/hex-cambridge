radiation ups is a powerful technique to exam molecular electron structure since we are interested in the molecular orbitals from polyatomic molecules especially the valence orbitals and is the topic of this module figure diagram of a basic typical pes instrument used in ups where the radiation source is an uv light source when the sample is irradiated the released photoelectrons pass through the lens system which slows them down before they enter the energy analyzer the analyzer shown is a spherical deflection analyzer which the photoelectrons pass through before they are collected at the collector slit cc bync Ã¼mit
