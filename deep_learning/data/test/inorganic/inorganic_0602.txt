then requires that after using equation since the free electrons energy is present solely as kinetic energy ie there is no internal energy in a free electron equation can then be rearranged to give the following expression for the ke of the photoelectron the final term in brackets represents the difference in energy between the ionized and neutral species and is generally called the vertical ionization energy of the ejected electron this then leads to the following commonly quoted equations or the vertical ionization energy is a direct measure of the energy required to just remove the electron concerned from
