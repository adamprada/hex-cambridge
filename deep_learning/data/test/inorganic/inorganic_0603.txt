and ionic and covalent bond energies ionization energies are closely related to the concepts of electronegativity electronrichness and the general reactivity of molecules the energies and other characteristic features of the ionization bands observed in photoelectron spectroscopy provide some of the molecular orbitals detailed and specific quantitative information regarding the electronic structure and bonding in molecules figure vertical ionization process for molecular hydrogen cc bync Ã¼mit kaya ionization is explicitly defined in terms of transitions between the ground state of a molecule and ion states as shown in equation and as illustrated in the figure nonetheless the information obtained from
