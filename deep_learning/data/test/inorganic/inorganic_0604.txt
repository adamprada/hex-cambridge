from that orbital figure provided the distributions of the remaining electrons do not change ie frozen there are many limitations to koopmans theorem but in a first order approximation each ionization of a molecule can be considered as removal of an electron from an individual orbital the ionization energies can then be considered as measures of orbital stabilities and shifts can be interpreted in terms of orbital stabilizations or destabilizations due to electron distributions and bonding koopmans theorem is implicated whenever an orbital picture is involved but is not necessary when the focus is on the total electronic states of
