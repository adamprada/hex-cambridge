degree of vibrational excitation of the cations in general the following two types of ionization energies are considered figure adiabatic ionization energy corresponds to the ionization energy associated with this transition adiabatic ionization energy that is the minimum energy required to eject an electron from a molecule in its ground vibrational state and transform it into a cation in the lowest vibrational level of an electronic state x of the cation vertical ionization energy corresponds to the ionization energy associated with this transition where the value n of the vibrational quantum number v corresponds to the vibrational level whose wavefunction
