energy in which case the ion is in its lowest energy relaxed geometry mostly the former though this is illustrated in the figure for a diatomic the only geometry change possible is the bond length the figure shows an ion with a slightly longer bond length than the neutral the harmonic potential energy surfaces are shown in green neutral and red ion with vibrational energy levels the vertical ionzation energy is always greater than the adiabatic ionzation energy differing ionization energies you have been exposed to three metrics of ionization energies already which are similar but with distinct differences the
