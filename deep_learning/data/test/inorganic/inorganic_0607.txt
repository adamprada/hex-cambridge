energy needed to remove an electron from a bulk solid to a point in the vacuum example molecular hydrogen as you remember the molecular orbital description of hydrogen involves two atomic orbitals generating a bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals the two electrons that are responsible for the bond are occupied in the mo diagram and pes spectrum of cc bync ümit kaya the pes spectrum has a single band that corresponds to the ionization of a σg electron the multiple peaks are due to electrons ejecting from a range of stimulated vibrational energy levels when extensive vibrational structure is resolved
