by bonding and these form the π molecular orbitals the π orbitals are nonbonding they are not affected energetically by the interaction between the atoms and are hence neither bonding nor antibonding the σ orbital is weakly bonding and largely cl p the σ orbital is antibonding and primarily of h s character figure shows the analogous mo diagram and photoelectron spectrum for the spectrum has two bands corresponding to nonbonding p or molecular orbitals with negligible vibrational structure and the s bonding molecular orbital vibrational structure figure photoelectron spectrum cc bync ümit kaya the higher energy more stabilized core
