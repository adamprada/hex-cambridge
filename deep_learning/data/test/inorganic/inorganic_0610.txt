form the ion in its ground state the energy of the secondhighest molecular orbitals refers to the ion in the excited state figure mo diagram for water cc bync Ã¼mit kaya the hartreefock orbital energies with sign changed of these orbitals are tablulated below and compared to the experimental ionization energies molecular orbital hartreefock orbital energies ev experimental ionization energies ev a b a b as explained above the deviations between orbital energy and ionization energy is small and due to the effects of orbital relaxation as well as differences in electron correlation energy between the molecular and the various
