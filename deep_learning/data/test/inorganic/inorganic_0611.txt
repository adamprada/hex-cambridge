spectra on this pagehis spectrum does not go to high enough energy to show the deep molecular orbital if water was formed two identical oh bonds and two lone pairs on the oxygen atom line valence bond theory predicts then the pes in figure would have two degenerate peaks one for the two bonds and one for the two lone pairs the photoelectron spectrum clearly shows three peaks in the positions expected for the molecular orbitals in figure if the molecular orbitals in figure represent the real electronic structure how do we view the bonding these molecular orbitals are delocalized
