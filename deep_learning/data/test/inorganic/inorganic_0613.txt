in the range of about to ohms a typical semiconductor is a superhigh grade silicon that is manufactured on a large scale and is widely used for information processing devices such as computers and energy conversion devices such as solar cells vlsi very largescale integrated circuits are printed on wafers made from almost defectless silicon single crystals with diameters of no less than cm prepared from polycrystalline silicon by the czochralski method memory chips with a very high degree of integration as well as highly efficient computer chips have recently been realized in a short periodic table silicon is a
