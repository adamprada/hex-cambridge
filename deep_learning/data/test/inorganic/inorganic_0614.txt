trimethyl gallium gach and trimethylarsenic asch whichpreviously found little application are now used industrially exercise what compounds other than the examples given are suitable as semiconductors answer zno cds pbs gap and insb superconductivity is a phenomenon of zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature tc and was discovered in by kamerlingh onnes nobel prize for physics who succeeded in liquefying helium during his experiments to measure the electrical resistance of mercury at ultra low temperatures about of the elements such as nb tc k in sn and pb behave as superconductors and more than alloys and intermetallic compounds are
