either it is difficult to ake plication because com m them into wires or only small single crystals are obtained it will take considerable time before some of them find practical use therefore mainly nbti wires are used as the superconducting magnets of analytical nmr medical mri magnetic resonance imaging instrument or maglev trains etc efforts are concentrated on discovering materials that have suitable mechanical and other properties by cooperation between inorganic chemistry and solidstate physics various metal oxides are used as thermistors temperature sensitive resistance device varistors nonlinear resistance device capacitors etc for example batio with a perovskite structure
