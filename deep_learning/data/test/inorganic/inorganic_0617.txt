fe ni and al as their main constituents ferrite magnets composed of solid solutions of cofeo and feo cobaltrare earth magnets such as smco and nbfeb magnets were especially significant achievements since soft magnetic materials are strongly magnetized in weak magnetic fields they are most suitable for use as core materials in transformers hard magnetic properties are necessary for the stable maintenance of information whereas soft magnetic properties are required for recording and overwriting information in magnetic recording materials such as magnetic tapes floppy disks and hard disks although feo is a typical magnetic powder used for these purposes co
