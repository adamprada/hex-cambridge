properties mainly inorganic substances are used as materials for optical applications the optical fiber in particular has been used for optical communications on a large scale and has had a major social influence in information communication a necessary property of good optical glass materials is the transmission of information to distant places with little optical loss silica fibers are manufactured by lengthening silica glass rods produced from silica grains the silica is made from ultra pure sicl which is oxidized in the vapor phase by an oxyhydrogen flame as the optical loss along fibers obtained by this method has already
