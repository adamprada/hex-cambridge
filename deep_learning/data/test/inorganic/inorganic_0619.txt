as a catalyst describe differences between ammonia synthesis by the harberbosch process and biological nitrogen fixation reactions a type intermetallic compounds such as nbsn are cubic crystals with the ab composition consider how to locate each atom in such a unit cell structurefunction correlation since all the naturally occurring elements have been discovered various bonding modes are established and the structures of compounds can be readily determined studies of the chemical properties of inorganic compounds will give way to studies of reactions and physical properties the synthesis of new compounds and the elucidation of structurefunction correlations will be the foundations
