problems confronting the next generation of inorganic chemists are extensive and novel solutions can be anticipated no headers hydrofluoric acid is difficult to work with because is corrodes glass and silica giving gaseous or the so it must be stored in ptfe or dry cu or monel metali liquid range to k relative permittivity at k at k liquid hf undergoes selfionization kself x at k dihydridofluorine ion difluorohydrogenate ion large electronegativity difference between h xp and f xp results in the presence of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the liquid hydrogen bonded molecules molecules on average in liquid phase
