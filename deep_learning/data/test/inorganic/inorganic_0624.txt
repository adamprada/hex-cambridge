bonding can be thought of as atomic orbitals being in phase constructive and antibonding as being out of phase destructive mo diagrams are graphical representations of orbital interactions based on symmetry compatability mo diagrams are based on individual atom electron configurations for example bssp boron has three valence electrons highest nprinciple quantum number in ns or np and core electrons diatomic boron b has an mo diagram httpwwwmetasynthesiscomwebbookdiatomicsdiatomicshtml notice that each individual b atom has valencen electrons when combined to form molecular orbitals the bond order is bobondinganti carbon dioxide mo diagram the carbon dioxide mo diagram is based on
