of rotation σ the mirror plane the mirror plane can be described as a plane which produces a reflection of part of a molecule that is unnoticeable and can be labeled as either σh σv σd i the inversion center a molecule has a center of inversion if when inverted the molecule is unchanged see the section on symmetry elements for a more thorough explanation of each each point group is associated with a specific combination of symmetry elements each point group has its own combination of symmetry elements listed below are some of the many point groups and their
