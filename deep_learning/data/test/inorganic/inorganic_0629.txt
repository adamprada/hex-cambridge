to allotropy but they should not be confused polymorphism describes molecules while allotropy is used to describe atoms polymorphism has many uses whether it was in pharmaceutical explosives or even food this process was discovered by eilhard mitscherlich in kinetic vs thermodynamic stability when discussing the concept of stability it is necessary to distinguish between thermodynamic and kinetic stability here b is at lower energy than a so that Î´g is negative the reaction should therefore proceed spontaneously and b is the more thermodynamically stable species the reaction as shown though has a barrier to the progress of the reaction
