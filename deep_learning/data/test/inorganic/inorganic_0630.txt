on the samples being kinetically stable ie inert in the lecture on chelation and stability we concentrate on thermodynamic stability and look at the changes in free energy enthalpy and entropy during the reaction when we consider thermodynamic stability we need to be familiar with formulae δg rt lnk or alternatively δg rt logk δg δh tδs the first relates the free energy to the stability constant and the second shows the breakdown into the component enthalpy and entropy terms no headers no headers pourbaix diagrams plot electrochemical stability for different redox states of an element as a function of
