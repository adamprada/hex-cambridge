fe regions represents the reaction which has a standard potential of v while we could use standard potentials for all these lines in practice pourbaix diagrams are usually plotted for lower ion concentrations often mm that are more relevant to corrosion and electrochemical experiments example iron pourbaix diagram areas in the pourbaix diagram mark regions where a single species feaq feos etc is stable more stable species tend to occupy larger areas lines mark places where two species exist in equilibrium pure redox reactions are horizontal lines these reactions are not phdependent pure acidbase reactions are vertical lines these do
