below the h line water is unstable relative to hydrogen gas and above the o line water is unstable with respect to oxygen for active metals such as fe the region where the pure element is stable is typically below the h line this means that iron metal is unstable in contact with water undergoing reactions in acid in base iron and most other metals are also thermodynamically unstable in airsaturated water where the potential of the solution is close to the o line in the pourbaix diagram here the spontaneous reactions are in acid cefes o feos in base
