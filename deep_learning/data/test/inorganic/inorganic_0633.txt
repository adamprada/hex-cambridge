in parts of the pourbaix diagram where the element is oxidized to a soluble ionic product such as feaq or alaq however solids such as feo and especially alo form a protective coating on the metal that greatly impedes the corrosion reaction this phenomenon is called passivation draw a vertical line through the iron pourbaix diagram at the ph of tap water about and you will discover something interesting at slightly acidic ph iron is quite unstable with respect to corrosion by the reaction but only in water that contains relatively little oxygen ie in solutions where the potential is
