represent conditions under which oxidation of iron produces soluble and insoluble products respectively in the yellow part of the diagram an active metal such as iron can be protected by a second mechanism which is to bias it so that its potential is below the oxidation potential of the metal this cathodic protection strategy is most frequently carried out by connecting a more active metal such as mg or zn to the iron or steel object eg the hull of a ship or an underground gas pipeline that is being protected the active metal which must be higher than fe
