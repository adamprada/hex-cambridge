an anoxic environment such as mud or soil the potential of the solution is close to the h line in the pourbaix diagram where fe can corrode to fe aq another part of the iron object is in the air or near the surface where water is well oxygenated at that surface oxygen can be reduced to water o h e ho the conductive iron object completes the circuit carrying electrons from the anode where fe is oxidized to the cathode where o is reduced corrosion by differential aeration can be rapid because soluble ions are produced and the reaction
