diamond silicates iron brass and water in the context of modern chemical theories to understand why they have the special properties they do history coordination compounds or complexes are molecules and extended solids that contain bonds between a transition metal ion and one or more ligands in forming these coordinate covalent bonds the metal ions act as lewis acids and the ligands act as lewis bases typically the ligand has a lone pair of electrons and the bond is formed by overlap of the molecular orbital containing this electron pair with the dorbitals of the metal ion ligands that are
