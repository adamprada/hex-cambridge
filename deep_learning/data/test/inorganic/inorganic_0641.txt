indicate that the electron pair belongs to the ligand x in counting electrons on the metal described below the convention is to assign both electrons in the dative bond to the ligand although in reality the bonds are typically polar covalent and electrons are shared between the metal and the ligand znobdc also called mof is a metalorganic framework in which benzenedicarboxylate bdc anions bridge between cationic zno clusters the rigid framework contains large voids represented by orange spheres mofs can be made from many different transition metal ions and bridging ligands and are being developed for practical applications in
