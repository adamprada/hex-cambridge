cl like organic compounds transition metal complexes can vary widely in size shape charge and stability we will see that bonds formed from the dorbitals of the metal largely control these properties alfred werner was a swiss chemist who received the nobel prize in for elucidating the bonding in coordination compounds no headers in chapter we learned all about crystal structures of ionic compounds a good question to ask is what makes a compound choose a particular structure in addressing this question we will learn about the forces that hold crystals together and the relative energies of different structures this
