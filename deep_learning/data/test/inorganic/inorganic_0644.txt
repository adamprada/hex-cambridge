we graduate from simple metal structures based on sphere packings to more complex structures we find that this is still true in this chapter we will try to systematize the structures of inorganic solids metal oxides halides sulfides and related compounds and develop some rules for which structures to expect based on electronegativity differences hardsoft acidbase rules and other periodic trends we will see that many of these structures are related to the sphere packings that we learned about in chapter the morphology of twinned crystals of iron pyrite fes is related to the underlying cubic symmetry of the unit
