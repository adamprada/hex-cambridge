with some atoms missing no headers in the chemistry of molecular compounds we are accustomed to the idea that properties depend strongly on structure for example we can rationalize the polarity of the water molecule based on its shape we also know that two molecules with the same composition eg ethanol and dimethyl ether have very different properties based on the bonding arrangements of atoms it should come as no surprise that the properties of extended solids are also connected to their structures and so to understand what they do we should begin with their crystal structures most of the
