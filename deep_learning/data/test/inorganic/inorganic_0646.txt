which was useful for predicting the shapes of molecules bond strengths etc it fails to describe some bonding situations accurately because it ignores the wave nature of the electrons molecular orbital mo theory has the potential to be more quantitative with it we can also get a picture of where the electrons are in the molecule as shown in the image at the right this can help us understand patterns of bonding and reactivity that are otherwise difficult to explain although mo theory in principle gives us a way to calculate the energies and wavefunctions of electrons in molecules very
