we will find that these are increasingly challenging with mo theory the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the carbon monoxide molecule is a Ï€ antibonding orbital that derives from the p orbitals of carbon left and oxygen right no headers in redox reactions one element or compound is reduced gains electrons and another is oxidized loses electrons in terms of everyday life redox reactions occur all of the time around us for example the metabolism of sugars to co which stores energy in the form of atp is a redox reaction another example of redox is fire or combustion such
