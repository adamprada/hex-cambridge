main group elements n halogens o s also have multiple oxidation states and important redox chemistry many inorganic compounds catalyze redox reactions which are especially useful in industrial and biological applications energy conversion and storage technologies solar water splitting batteries electrolyzers fuel cells rely on inorganic redox reactions and catalysis electrochemistry provides a way to measure equilibrium constants for dissolutionprecipitation complexation and other reactions reaction mechanisms in organometallic chemistry oxidative addition reductive elimination involve changes in the oxidation states of metals not all oxidizers and reducers are created equal the electrochemical series ranks substances according to their oxidizing and reducing
