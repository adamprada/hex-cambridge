the analogous complex with another monodentate neutral ligand l til is orange how many of the following statements are true explain briefly a l is a stronger field ligand than ho b til is a highspin complex c til absorbs yellow and red light d both complexes have two d electrons associated with the metal oh and cn are both brønsted bases and both can form complexes with metal ions explain how oh can be a much stronger brønsted base than cn and at the same time much lower in the spectrochemical series a solution of niho is faint green
