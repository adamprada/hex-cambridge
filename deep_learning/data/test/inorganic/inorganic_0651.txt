complex and the crystal field energy level diagram that explains each what value of the magnetic moment in units of Î¼b would you expect for the paramagnetic complex one of the simplest reactions a coordination complex can do is ligand exchange for example metal aquo complexes can exchange a coordinated water molecule with a free solvent water molecule and the rate of the reaction can be measured by isotope labeling nmr and other techniques interestingly these rates vary widely for water exchange with different metal ions over a range of orders of magnitude as shown in the figure below for
