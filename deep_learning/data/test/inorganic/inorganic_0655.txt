is transparent in the visible electromagnetic spectrum thus aquatic plants can live in water because sunlight can reach them infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrogenoxygen or oh bonds since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge whereas the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges as a result water is a polar molecule with an electrical dipole moment water can form an unusually large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds four for a molecule of its size these factors lead to strong
