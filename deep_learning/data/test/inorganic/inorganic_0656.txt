can reach temperatures of hundreds of degrees and remain liquid water has a high specific heat capacity j kg k as well as a high heat of vaporization kj mol both result from the extensive hydrogen bonding between its molecules these two unusual properties allow water to moderate earths climate by buffering large fluctuations in temperature solid ice has a density of kg m the maximum density of liquid water occurs at c where it is kg m elements that are more electropositive than hydrogen such as lithium sodium calcium potassium and caesium displace hydrogen from water forming hydroxides since
