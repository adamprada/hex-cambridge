has the anomalous property of becoming less dense when it is cooled to its solid form ice when liquid water is cooled it initially contracts as expected until a temperature of c is reached c after that it expands slightly until it reaches the freezing point and then when it freezes it expands by approximately just above the freezing point the water molecules begin to locally arrange into icelike structures with an extended hydrogen bonded network this creates some openness in the liquid water accounting for the decrease in its density this is in opposition to the usual tendency for
