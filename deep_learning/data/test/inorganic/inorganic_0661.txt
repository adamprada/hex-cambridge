reactions of complexes are classified into the substitution reaction of ligands the conversion reaction of ligands and the redox reaction of the central metal the substitution and redox reactions in particular have been studied in detail a ligand substitution reaction ligand substitution reactions of complexes are very important for the preparation of various kinds of derivatives the detailed conditions which complexes and ligands fulfill have been studied in order to understand their stereochemistry and attain practical rates of substitution reactions as with other types of chemical reactions we require an understanding of both equilibrium and reaction rates formation constant the
