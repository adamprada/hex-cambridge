on the other hand an understanding of the effect of the leaving ligand x and the entering ligand y on the substitution rate and on the intermediate species formed are essential to elucidate the reaction chemistry of metal complexes it is especially useful to summarize the electronic structure of the central metals the stereochemistry of complexes and the correlation between the parameters representing their steric properties and the reaction rate generally reaction mechanisms can be classified into associative interchange and dissociative mechanisms according to the differences in the intermediate state figure figure the stability of the intermediate of ligand substitution
