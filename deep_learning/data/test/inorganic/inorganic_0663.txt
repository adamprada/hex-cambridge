thermodynamic measurements of the reaction indicate the activation entropy s to be negative the intermediate species in the case of the associative mechanism in hexacoordinate complexes are heptacoordinate complexes interchange mechanism when the life of an intermediate state is very short the reaction proceeds by the interchange mechanism as the coordination of y and elimination of x are considered to occur simultaneously dissociative mechanism a substitution reaction that is highly sensitive to the identity of the leaving ligand x and practically insensitive to the identity of the entering ligand y assumes the dissociative mechanism in which the coordination number decreases
