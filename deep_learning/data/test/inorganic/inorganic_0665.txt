group metal ions zn cd hg group metal ions al ga in and group metal ions sc y rapid water ligand exchange takes place by a dissociative mechanism on the other hand the exchange rates of m ii ions in d block transition metal ions is medium s and that of m iii ions are lower still the rates of d cr and d co are notably slow s and their complexes are termed inert there has been a great deal of study of ligandexchange reactions the exchange rates are smaller the larger the ligand field stabilization energy therefore the
