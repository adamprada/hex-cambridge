structure of a complex can be distorted remarkably or the compound may even decompose the reactions of a metal compound with various reducing or oxidizing agents are also very important from the viewpoint of synthetic chemistry especially reduction reactions are used in the preparation of organometallic compounds such as metal carbonyls or cluster compounds meanwhile the study of electron transfer between complexes especially the redox reactions of transition metal complexes has developed taube won the nobel prize for the study of electron transfer reactions in transition metal complexes classifying such reactions into two mechanisms the mechanism of electron transfer in
