trivalent oxidation state are formed this kind of reaction is a redox reaction via the innersphere mechanism the anions other than halogens suitable for such bridge formation are scn n cn etc outersphere mechanism when fephen phen is orthophenanthroline is reduced by fecn no ligand bridge forms between the metals and an electron moves from the homo of feii to the lumo of feiii in a very short and direct contact between the two complexes as the result of the electron transfer fephen and fecn form this kind of reaction is a redox one via the outersphere mechanism and is
