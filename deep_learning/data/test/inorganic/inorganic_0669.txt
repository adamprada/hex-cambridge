complexes containing cyclopentadienyl and carbonyl ligands that satisfy the electron rule devise a method of selective syntheses of cisptclnh and transptclnh using the trans effect how can it be proven that the reduction reaction of coclnh by croh proceeds by the innersphere electron transfer mechanism contributors recrystallization is used to purify solids usually this method works best when there is only a small amount of impurity in the solid the method involves addition of a cold solvent to the material the mixture that results is heated until the solids dissolve the mixture is slowly cooled again until a pure solid
