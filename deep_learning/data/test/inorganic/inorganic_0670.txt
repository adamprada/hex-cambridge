will dissolve in ml while sodium oleate found in some soaps has a different solubility in cold water g per ml that difference can be exploited to separate these two compounds stop and think suppose you were trying to go into the soap business maybe you find you can easily produce a mixture of equal parts weightweight of sodium chloride and sodium oleate describe how you could get pure sodium oleate look at the structures of sodium chloride and sodium oleate can you qualitatively explain the difference between their solubilities in water its possible that a mixture of sodium chloride
