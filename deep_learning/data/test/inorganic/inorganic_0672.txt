comes out of solution again so that you can filter it out this switch exists it is found on the front of your hot plate in the organic lab solubility is temperaturedependent for example the solubility of sodium chloride is different in cold water g per ml at c than in hot water g per ml at c its possible that in the right amount of hot water all the sodium oleate and all the sodium chloride dissolves if the resulting solution is cooled to room temperature the sodium oleate is no longer soluble the sodium oleate forms a solid
