the standard halfcell potential of the fecn couple and comparing it to that of the fecouple e v e v ironiii is harder to reduce ie e is less positive when it is complexed to this implies that the equilibrium constant for complexation reaction equation ref should be smaller than that for reaction equation ref how much smaller we can calculate the ratio of equilibrium constants by adding and subtracting reactions the equilibrium constant for this reaction is the product of the two reactions we added ie k kk but we can make the same overall reaction by combining reactions
