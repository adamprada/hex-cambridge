reference electrode that value is then compared to the standard potential of the agag couple subtracting the second reaction from the first one we obtain and again using nfe rtlnk we obtain k ksp x m because the solubility of the silver halides is so low this would be a very difficult number to measure by other methods eg by measuring the concentration of ag spectroscopically or by gravimetry in practice almost all ksp values involving electroactive substances are measured potentiometrically acidbase equilibria many electrochemical reactions involve h or oh for these reactions the halfcell potentials are phdependent example recall
