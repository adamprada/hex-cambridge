top cancels with the bottom one the introduction of using relative mass to a great extend makes scientists calculate mass of large molecules much more convenient way to calculate relative atomic mass ar for standard atoms in order to calculate ar first of all is to calculate the of carbon xx kg then compare this value with any other atom which needs to be calculated and the obtained ratio is relative atomic mass for that atom for example for the oxygen atom its rest mass is x divide it by x xx and the answer will approximately be that is
