assumed to be the lowest n m electron mass x kg l size of the box if we approximate the size of the electron box as Ã¥ x m we obtain this extra kinetic energy makes the nae salt unstable relative to the electrondelocalized metal sodium owes its metallic properties to the resonance stabilization of its delocalized valence electrons the calculation is not very accurate because the electron kinetic energy is not zero in the metal and because the box size is not so well defined however it does illustrate that electron delocalization has a substantial effect in thermodynamically stabilizing
