high pressure electride phases defy the general rule which we will encounter in chapter that insulators transform to metals at sufficiently high density they illustrate how the stable structure of an element can depend on the tradeoff between the lattice energy of an ionic electride structure and the resonance energy of an electrondelocalized metal crystal structure of can with d electron layers shown schematically in blue in addition to the saltlike electrides that are formed by complexing alkali metals with crown ether ligands there are a number of recently discovered solid state nitrides and oxides such as can and caalo
