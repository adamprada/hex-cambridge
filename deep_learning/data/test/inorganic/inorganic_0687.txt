ions in the crystals are occupying interstitials they inherently become create interstitials by the simplest definition the schottky defect is defined by type one while type two defects are known as the frenkel defect the schottky defect is often visually demonstrated using the following layout of anions and cations vacant vacant figure the positive symbols represents cations ie na and the negative symbol represents anions ie cl in addition this layout is applicable only for ionic crystal compounds of the formula mxlayout for ionic crystals with formula mx and mx will be discussed laterwhere m is metal and x is
