where is the enthalpy of defect formation is the gas constant is the absolute temperature in k and n can be calculated by from equation it is also possible to calculate the fraction of vacant sites by using the equation schottky defects for and as mentioned earlier a schottky defect will always result a crystal structure in equilibriumwhere no crystal is going to be too positive or too negative thus in the case of mx one schottky defect equals one cation and two anion vacancy mx one schottky defect equals two cation and three anion vacancy references housecroft catherine inorganic
