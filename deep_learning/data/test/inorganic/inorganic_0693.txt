its number of protons its mass and its size the size of the atoms is determined by the size of their orbitals the larger the quantum number n is the larger the orbital is which increases the size of the atom introduction each atom has different number of orbitals these orbitals differ in size depending on where they are on the periodic table the size of the orbitals determines the atomic radius for each atom as you go down a group the quantum number n increases meaning that the size of the orbital and the atomic radius increases as well
