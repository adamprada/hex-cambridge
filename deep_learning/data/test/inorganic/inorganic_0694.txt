of the quantum number n the size of the orbital and the atomic radii decreases as you go across a period from left to right this is due to the fact that as you go from left to right across a period the number of protons increase as well as the number of electrons the more electrons there are the closer they are to the nucleus due to the stronger interactions between them which decreases the size of the orbital and the atomic radius figure general trend of how the radius change within the periodic table cations and anions the
