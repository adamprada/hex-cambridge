unit is called a unit cell many metals adopt close packed structures ie cubic close packed face centred cubic and hexagonal close packed structures a simple model for both of these is to assume that the metal atoms are spherical and are packed together in the most efficient way close packing or closest packing for closest packing every atom has equidistant nearest neighbours and therefore a coordination number of if the close packed structures are considered as being built of layers of spheres then the difference between hexagonal close packing and cubic close packed is how each layer is positioned
