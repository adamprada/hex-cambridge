cubic unit cell is compressed along one fold axis the structure becomes cubic close packed face centred cubic cubic hexagonal and bodycentred packing cubic close packing ccp packing efficiency cn hexagonal close packing hcp packing efficiency cn bodycentred cubic packing bcc packing efficiency cn trends in melting point melting points are chosen as a simple measure of the stability or strength of the metallic lattice some simple trends can be noted the transition metals have generally higher melting points than the others in the alkali metals group and alkaline earth metals group the melting point decreases as atomic number increases
