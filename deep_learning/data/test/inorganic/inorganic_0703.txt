metals in liquid ammonia is indicated by the intense color of the solution and its electrical conductivity solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia are intensely colored and good conductors of electricity due to the presence of solvated electrons e nh which are not attached to single atoms a solvated electron is loosely associated with a cavity in the ammonia solvent that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds alkali metalliquid ammonia solutions of about m or less are deep blue figure and conduct electricity about times better than an aqueous nacl solution because of the high mobility of the solvated electrons
