orbital overlap referring to the molecular orbital diagram above we see that the splitting between delectron levels reflects the antibonding interaction between the eg metal orbitals and the ligands thus we expect ligand field strength to correlate with metalligand orbital overlap ligands that bind through very electronegative atoms such as o and halogens are thus expected to be weak field and ligands that bind through c or p are typically strong field ligands that bind through n are intermediate in strength another way to put this is that hard bases tend to be weak field ligands and soft bases are
