the coho cations and no anions crystallize to make a salt when the complex is dissolved in water coii retains its coordination shell of six water molecules and the solution has the same red color as the crystal energy units energy can be calculated in a number of ways and it is useful to try to relate the splitting energy δo to more familiar quantities like bond energies here ν is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation h is plancks constant x js and c is the speed of light is called the wavenumber and is the inverse of the
