that δo varies widely for transition metal complexes from nearinfrared to ultraviolet wavelengths thus the energy difference between the tg and eg orbitals can range between the energy of a rather weak to a rather strong covalent bond δo depends on both the metal and the ligand we can learn something about trends in δo by comparing a series of d metal complexes complex δo cm coho coho cocn rhho rhcn important trends in δo co complexes have larger δo than co complexes with the same ligand this reflects the electrostatic nature of the crystal field splitting rh complexes have
