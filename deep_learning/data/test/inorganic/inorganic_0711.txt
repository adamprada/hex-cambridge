in the triads corhir or feruos we always find d d d this trend reflects the spatial extent of the dorbitals and thus their overlap with ligand orbitals the d orbitals are smaller and they are less effective in bonding than the d or d the d and d orbitals are similar to each other because of the lanthanide contraction at the beginning of the d series between ba and hf are the fourteen lanthanide elements la lu although the valence orbitals of the d elements are in a higher principal quantum shell than those of the d elements the
