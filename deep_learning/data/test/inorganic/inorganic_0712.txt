microscopy in contrast the highest binary oxide of iron is feo colors of transition metal complexes a simple qualitative way to see the relative crystal field splitting energy Î´o is to observe the color of a transition metal complex the higher the energy of the absorbed photon the larger the energy gap however the color a complex absorbs is complementary to the color it appears ie the color of light it reflects which is opposite the absorbed color on the color wheel complementary colors are across the color wheel from each other examples all d co complexes coho looks purple
