them appear yellow however there are complexes such as rhcn that appear colorless because their dd transitions are in the ultraviolet other complexes such as mnho are weakly colored because their dd transitions involve a change in the spin state of the complex introductionreferencesproblemscontributors introduction the term sp hybridization refers to the mixing character of one sorbital and three porbitals to create four hybrid orbitals with similar characteristics in order for an atom to be sp hybridized it must have an s orbital and three p orbitals from wave function to the visual representation four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals resulting
