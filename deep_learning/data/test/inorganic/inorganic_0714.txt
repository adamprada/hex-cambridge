sp hybrid orbitals around the central atom because of the tetrahedral molecular geometry the calculate bond angles between and and and and and and and approximately equal o figure the energy level and election population all four sp hybrid orbitals are delocalizedthey occupy the same energy level however they are higher in energy than the s orbital and lower in energy than the p orbital figure just like any other atomic orbital each sp hybrid orbital can house elections scharacter and the stability of the anion each sp orbital has part of scharacter to parts of pcharacter in other words
