structures which are derived from closepacked lattices that are particularly important because of the material properties of their compounds these are the spinel structure on which ferrites and other magnetic oxides are based the perovskite structure which is adopted by ferroelectric and superconducting oxides and the rutile structure which is a common binary structure adopted by oxides and fluorides the spinel structure is formulated mmx where m and m are tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated cations respectively and x is an anion typically o or f the structure is named after the mineral mgalo and oxide spinels have the general formula
