switch places inverse spinels are thus formulated babo where the ab ions in parentheses occupy octahedral sites and the other b ions are on tetrahedral sites there are also mixed spinels which are intermediate between the normal and inverse spinel structure some spinel and inverse spinel ab combinations are ab eg mgalo normal spinel ab eg pbo pbiipbiipbivo inverse spinel ab eg nawo normal spinel many magnetic oxides such as feo and cofeo are spinels normal vs inverse spinel structure for transition metal oxide spinels the choice of the normal vs inverse spinel structure is driven primarily by the crystal
