is d comparing the tetrahedral and high spin octahedral diagrams we find that the cfse in an octahedral field of o ions is in the tetrahedral field the cfse is since δo is about times larger than δt the octahedral arrangement has a larger cfse and is preferred for fe dorbital energy diagram for fe in contrast it is easy to show that fe which is d would have a cfse of zero in either the octahedral or tetrahedral geometry this means that fe has a preference for the octahedral site but fe has no preference consequently we place fe
