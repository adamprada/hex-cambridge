the tetrahedral site than fe d and both ions have zero cfse mgfeo and mnfeo in which all ions have zero cfse and no site preference are mixed spinels chromite spinels miicro are always normal spinels because the d cr ion has a strong preference for the octahedral site examples of normal and inverse spinel structures mgalo is a normal spinel since both mg and al are nontransition metal ions and thus cfse the more highly charged al ion prefers the octahedral site where it is surrounded by six negatively charged oxygen atoms mno is a normal spinel since the
