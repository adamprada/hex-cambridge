spinel since fe is high spin d ion with on an octahedral site and cr is a d ion with cfse δo δo hence it is more energetically favorable for cr to occupy both of the octahedral sites coo is a normal spinel even in the presence of weak field oxo ligands co is a low spin d ion with very high cfse on the octahedral sites because of the high charge and small size of the co ion hence the co ions occupy both octahedral sites and co occupies the tetrahedral site magnetism of ferrite spinels ferrite spinels are
