metal ions it can mediate the coupling of spins by superexchange as shown at the right the coupling can be antiferromagnetic as shown or ferromagnetic depending on the orbital filling and the symmetry of the orbitals involved the goodenoughkanamori rules predict the local magnetic ordering ferromagnetic vs antiferromagnetic that results from superexchange coupling of the electron spins of transition metal ions for ferrites the strongest coupling is between ions on neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral sites and the ordering of spins between these two sites is reliably antiferromagnetic because all the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in a spinel or inverse spinel
