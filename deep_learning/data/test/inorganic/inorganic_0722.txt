down however the four unpaired electrons on the fe ions are all aligned the same way in the crystal so the compound is ferrimagnetic perovskites are ternary oxides of general formula abo more generally the perovskite formula is abx where the anion x can be o n or halogen the a ions are typically large ions such as sr ba rb or a lanthanide ion and the b ions are smaller transition metal ions such as ti nb ru etc the mineral after which the structure is named has the formula catio the perovskite structure has simple cubic symmetry but
