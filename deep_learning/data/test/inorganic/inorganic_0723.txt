that the octahedra share all their vertices but do not share any octahedral edges this makes the reo and perovskite structures flexible like threedimensional wine racks in that the octahedra can rotate and tilt cooperatively eight such octahedra surround a large cuboctahedral cavity which is the site of the a ions in the perovskite structure cations in these sites are coordinated by oxide ions as expected from the relationship between the perovskite and fcc lattices polyhedral representation of the reo structure showing the large cuboctahedral cavity that is surrounded by oxygen atoms because the asite is empty in the reo
