band levels by red light because the electrochemical intercalationdeintercalation process is powered by a solar cell the tint of the windows can adjust automatically to the level of sunlight ferroelectric perovskites the flexibility of the network of cornersharing bo octahedra is also very important in ferroelectric oxides that have the perovskite structure in some perovsites with small bsite cations such as ti and nb the cation is too small to fit symmetrically in the bo octahedron the octahedron distorts allowing the cation to move offcenter these distortions can be tetragonal as in the example shown at the right rhombohedral or
