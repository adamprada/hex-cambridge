electric polarization of a ferroelectric can be switched with a coercive field and hysteresis loop of polarization vs field resembles that of a ferromagnet above tc the crystal is paraelectric and has a high dielectric permittivity ferroelectric and paraelectric oxides along with piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics have a wide variety of applications as switches actuators transducers and dielectrics for capacitors ferroelectric capacitors are important in memory devices fram and in the tuning circuits of cellular telephones multiferroics which are materials that are simultaneously ferroelectric and ferromagnetic are rare and are being now intensively researched because of their potential applications in electrically
