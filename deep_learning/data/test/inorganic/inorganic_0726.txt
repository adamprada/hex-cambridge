must be grown as very pure single crystals at high temperatures for use in solar cells because of their high carrier mobility some lead halide perovskites are also electroluminescent and are of interest as inexpensive materials for lightemitting diodes leds tin and lead halide perovskites were first studied in the s as materials for thin film electronics and more recently as light absorbers in dyesensitized solar cells soon after the results on dyesensitized perovskite cells were reported it was discovered that halide perovskites could also be used in thin film solid state solar cells the structures of these solar cells
