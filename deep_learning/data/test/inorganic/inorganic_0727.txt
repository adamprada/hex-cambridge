d in the thinfilm architecture despite their very impressive efficiency perovskite solar cells are stable for relatively short periods of time and are sensitive to air and moisture current research is focused on understanding the degradation mechanisms of these solar cells and improving their stability under operating conditions the rutile structure is an important mx x o f structure it is a structure in which the cations are octahedrally coordinated by anions and as such is intermediate in polarity between the caf and sio structures the mineral rutile is one of the polymorphs of tio the others anatase and brookite
