conductivity view down the tetragonal caxis of the rutile lattice showing edgesharing mo octahedra rutile tio because of its high refractive index is the base pigment for white paint it is a wide bandgap semiconductor that has also been extensively researched as an electrode for water splitting solar cells and as a photocatalyst primarily as the anatase polymorph for degradation of pollutants in air and water selfcleaning glass exploits the photocatalytic properties of a thin film of tio to remove oily substances from the glass surface and improve the wetting properties of the glass no headers welcome to the chemistry
