ligands which relate to the energy of complex formation the chelate effect which is an entropic contributor to complex stability hardsoft interactions hard acids are typically small high charge density cations that are weakly polarizable such as h li na be mg al ti and cr electropositive metals in high oxidation states are typically hard acids these elements are predominantly found in oxide minerals because o is a hard base some hard bases include ho oh o f no cl and nh the hard acidbase interaction is primarily electrostatic complexes of hard acids with hard bases are stable because of
