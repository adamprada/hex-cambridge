like is nicely illustrated in the properties of the copper halides cuf unstable cui stable cuf stable cui unstable the compounds cuf and cui have never been isolated and are thermodynamically unstable to disproportionation we will learn more about quantifying the energetics of these compounds in chapter no headers lattice energies in addition to guiding the discovery of unknown compounds are useful in explaining the absence ie the thermodynamic instability of nonexistent compounds for example cuf and auf are unknown compounds whereas cuf auf and auf are stable in contrast agf is a known stable compound from the born haber
