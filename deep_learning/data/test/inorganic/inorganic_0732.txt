the large difference in el values kj in the case of copper fluorides drives their disproportionation reactions note that when we use the kapustinskii equation we calculate that el for cuf is approximately three times that of cuf we use the same univalent radii in both calculations but cu has a charge in cuf doubling the lattice energy relative to cuf and contains as many ions the product zzn is thus three times larger for cuf the difference in el values will thus increase as el for the monovalent salt increases we know that fluorides having a small anion radius
