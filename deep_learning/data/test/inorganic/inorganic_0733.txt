and not with the electronegativity of the anion coincidentally f and o are electronegative elements but it is really their small size that has consequences for the lattice energy and their stabilization of higher oxidation states cuprous iodide cui is a crystalline compound used in organic synthesis and cloud seeding this compound can be made in the laboratory by reacting soluble cu salts with a solution of sodium or potassium iodide because cui is thermodynamicaly unstable the reaction liberates i and a cui precipitate forms remember that the hardsoft acidbase rules could be interpreted in terms of the dominance of
