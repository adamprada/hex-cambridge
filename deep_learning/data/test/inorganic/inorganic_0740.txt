going to discuss the structure of the molecule cesium chloride which is a white hydroscopic solid with a mass of gmol cesium chloride is a type of unit cell that is commonly mistaken as bodycentered cubic this misconception is easy to make since there is a center atom in the unit cell but cscl is really a nonclosed packed structure type introduction cscl has a boiling point of degrees celsius a melting point of degrees celsius and is very soluble in water for the most part this molecule is stable but is not compatible with strong oxidizing agents and strong
