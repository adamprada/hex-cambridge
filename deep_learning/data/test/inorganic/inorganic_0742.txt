calcium fluoride is quasilinearreferences calcium fluoride is a solid and forms a cube like structure that is centralized around the calcium molecules the crystal lattice structure that calcium fluoride is also known as the fluorite structure figure where the ca ions are eightcoordinate being centered in a cube of eight f ions each f is coordinated to four ca in the shape of a tetrahedron figure fluorite unit cell public domain benjahbmm via wikipedia calcium fluoride is quasilinear when calcium fluoride is in a single molecule it forms a quasilinear structure quasilinear means the molecule resonates between a linear shape
