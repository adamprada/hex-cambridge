ion is located at the center of the octahedra and has fold coordination with the oxygen and the titanium ions are located at the corners and has sixfold coordination with oxygen a the orthorhombic configuration which is the most common configuration in perovskite materials has lattice constants of a b and c angstroms one orthorhombic unit cell contains four as which are the calciums for example four bs and os for the case of catio using the lattice constants and the number of atoms per cell listed previously the density of orthorhombic catio is gcm a sample calculation is provided
