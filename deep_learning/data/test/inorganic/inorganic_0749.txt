it has stoichiometry ratio of nacl with a molar mass of gmol compounds with the sodium chloride structure include alikali halides and metal oxides and transitionmetal compounds an important role to many important applications is structure and dynamics of water some applications include crystallization of proteins and conformational behavior of peptides and nucleic acids structure figure shows how the na and cl ions occupy the space the smaller ions are the na with has an atomic radius of pm and the larger ions are the cl with an atomic radium of pm since nacl are one to one ratio as
