site which are used to determine the number of na ions and cl ions in the unit cell of nacl when counting the number of ions a corner site would be shared by other unit cells therefore corner would be of an ion a similar occurrence happens with the face site and the edge sites for a face site it is shared by other unit cell and for an edge site the ion is shared by other unit cells is a face centered cubic unit cell which has four cations and four anions this can be shown by counting the
