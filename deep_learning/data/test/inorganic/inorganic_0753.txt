transition elements are metallic elements that have incomplete d or f shells in the neutral or cationic states they are called also transition metals and make up of the elements these transition metals are classified into the dblock metals which consist of d elements from sc to cu d elements from y to ag and d elements from hf to au and fblock metals which consist of lanthanoid elements from la to lu and actinoid elements from ac to lr although sc and y belong to the dblock their properties are similar to those of lanthanoids the chemistry of dblock
