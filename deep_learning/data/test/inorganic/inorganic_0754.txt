whereas transition metals from the second and third series may be to coordinate cerium ce radius pm lutetium lu radius pm fall between la and hf and because of the lanthanide contraction metallic radii of the second and third series transition metals show little variation higher oxidation states in the second and third series transition metals are considerably more stable than those in the first series transition metals examples include tungsten hexachloride wcl osmium tetroxide oso and platinum hexafluoride ptf compounds of the first series transition metals in higher oxidation states are strong oxidants and thus are readily reduced on
