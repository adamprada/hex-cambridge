are formed much more easily in the d and d metals than in the d ones magnetic moments of the first series transition metal compounds can be explained in terms of spinonly values cf chapter d but it is difficult to account for the magnetic moments of the second and third series compounds unless complex factors such as spinorbital interactions are taken into account thus it is necessary to acknowledge and understand the significant differences in chemical properties that exist between metals of the first and later series metal compounds even for elements in the same group properties of the
