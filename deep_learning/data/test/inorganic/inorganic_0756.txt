to the right of the periodic table are soft and have a high affinity toward sulfur or selenium the dblock transition metals have s p and d orbitals and those with n electrons in the d orbitals are termed ions with a dn configuration for example ti is a d ion and co a d ion the number of electrons occupying the orbitals split by the ligand field cf a is denoted by a superscript on the orbital symbol for example an ion with electrons in tg and electrons in eg is described as tgeg ligands compounds of metal ions
