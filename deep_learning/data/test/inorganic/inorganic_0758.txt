known for the late transition metals three coordinate complexes although fensime is one example very few coordinate complexes are known four coordinate complexes when four ligands coordinate to a metal tetrahedral td coordination is the least congested geometry although a number of square planar dh complexes are known cobr nico cupy aucl are all examples of tetrahedral complexes there are a few known examples of square planar complexes with identical ligands such as nicn or pdcl in the case of mixed ligand complexes a number of square planar complexes of d ions rh ir pd pt and au have been
