of coordinate complexes previously coordinate complexes were rare but the number of new complexes with this coordination is increasing the energy difference between the two coordination modes is not large and structural transformation readily occurs for example the molecular structure and infrared spectrum of feco are consistent with a trigonal bipyramid structure but the c nmr spectrum shows only one signal at the possible lowest temperature which indicates that the axial and equatorial carbonyl ligands are fluxional in the nmr time scale s structural transformation takes place via a square pyramid structure and the mechanism is well known as berrys
