figure are possible the octahedral structure shows tetragonal dh rhombic dh or trigonal dh distortions caused by electronic or steric effects the tetragonal distortion of cunh by an electronic factor is a typical example of the jahnteller effect refer to a figure geometrical isomers of coordination six ligating atoms can assume trigonal prism coordination although this coordination is seen in zrch or resccf few metal complexes with this coordination structure are known because octahedral coordination is sterically less strained this notwithstanding it has long been known that the bonding mode of sulfur atoms around a metal is trigonal prism in
