ca and linear c anions caco calcite limestone marble ca and triangular co the rhombohedral unit cell of the calcite crystal structure the hexagonal caxis is shown the calcite caco crystal structure is shown above triangular co ions fill octahedral holes between the ca ions black spheres in a distorted nacl lattice as in nacl each ion is coordinated by six of the other kind from this image we can see why the caco structure has a lower symmetry than that of nacl the fourfold rotation symmetry of the nacl unit cell is lost when the spherical cl ions are
