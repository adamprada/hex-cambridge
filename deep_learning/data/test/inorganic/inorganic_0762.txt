shown in the center of the figure this is the structure adopted by nias and many other transition metal sulfides phosphides and arsenides the cations are shown in gray while the anions are light blue in the figure at the right the cations are in octahedral coordination so each cation is coordinated to six anions the anions are also coordinated to six cations but they occupy trigonal prismatic sites in terms of layer stacking the nias structure is acbcacbc where the a and b sites the hcp lattice are occupied by the as atoms and the c sites which are
