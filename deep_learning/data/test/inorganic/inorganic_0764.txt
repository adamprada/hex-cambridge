number of atoms in a single unit cell of zn and s is the same it is consistent with the formula zns the ionic radius for zn is pm and for s is pm therefore the ratio between cationic and anionic radii in zinc blend is pm pm this suggests a tetrahedral ion arrangement and four nearest neighbors from standard crystal structure prediction tables therefore four sulfur atoms surround each zinc atom and four zinc atoms surround each sulfur atom the coordination number the number of of electron pairs donated to a metal by its ligands for both zinc an
