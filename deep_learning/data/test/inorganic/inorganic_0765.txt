since ccp structures are more dense than hcp structures so a conversion from sphalerite to wurtzite occurs naturally over time at a rate similar to that of diamond to graphite the sphalerite structure is favored at k by kjmol but at k the transition to wurtzite occurs wurtzite wurtzite has a hexagonal closest packing structure hcp which is characterized by ions in the corners of each unit that create a hexagonal prism seen in fig as discussed previously zincblende slowly transforms to wurtzite due to thermodynamic stability fig hcp structure of wurtzite creator alexander mann date licensed under the creative
