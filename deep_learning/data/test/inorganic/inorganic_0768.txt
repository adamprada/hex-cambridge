of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms figure different atomic mechanisms of alloy formation showing pure metal substitutional and interstitial structures cco hbf via wikipedia why substitutional alloys occur bonding the bonding between two metals is best described as a combination of metallic electron sharing and covalent bonding one cant occur without the other and the proportion of one to the other changes depending on the constituents involved metals share there electrons throughout there structure this flow of electrons is the reason behind many of the characteristics associated with metals including their ability to act
