portion of the common alloys as the similarities between the electron structure of the metals involved in the alloy increase the metallic characteristics of the alloy decrease pure metals are useful but their applications are often limited to each individual metals properties alloys allow metal mixtures that have increased resistance to oxidation increased strength conductivity and melting point essentially any property can be manipulated by adjusting alloy concentrations an example could be brass door fixtures they are strong and resist corrosion better then pure zinc or copper the two major metals that constitute a brass alloy the combination also has
