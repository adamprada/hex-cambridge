large amounts of zinc and arsenic as well as lots of impurities these many substitutional alloys allowed for stronger tools and weapons they allowed for increased productivity in the workshop as well as on the battlefield the need for raw materials like tin and copper for the production of bronze also spurred an increase in trade since their ores are rarely found together the current chemical understanding of substitutional alloys would not be so in depth if it werent for the usefulness of the alloys to humans summary an alloy is a mixture of metals that has bulk metallic properties
