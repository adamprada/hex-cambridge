elements is the inversion center i which results from a c rotation followed by a reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis h note that an inversion center is a special case of an improper rotation axis because it results when in the first equation that is in fact any symmetry operation can be carried out multiple time in a row for example when bh is rotated twice by the twostep operation can be symboled by when the c operation is performed a third time the molecule returns to its original configuration ie in general no headers no headers
