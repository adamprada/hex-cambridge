hsbf can produce solutions with h down to fluoroantimonic acid is made by combining hf and sbf in this system hf releases its proton h concomitant with the binding of f by antimony pentafluoride which as described below is a lewis acid the resulting anion sbf is both a weak nucleophile and an extraordinarily weak base superacids are useful in reactions such as the isomerization of alkanes industrially anhydrous acidexchanged zeolites which are superacid catalysts are used on a massive scale to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil to gasoline superbases such as lithium diethylamide linet alkyllithium compounds
