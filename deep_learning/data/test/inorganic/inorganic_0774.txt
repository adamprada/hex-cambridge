in orbitals that have high s character eg sp vs sp or sp this is because s orbitals have finite probability density at the nucleus and feel the positive nuclear charge thereby stabilizing the extra negative charge on carbon more than p orbitals resonance effects also stabilize carbanions thus cyclopentadiene is more acidic than even an alkyne because the negative charge is delocalized over the entire aromatic ch ring when the ch is deprotonated table carbon acid acidities in pka in dmso reference acids in bold name formula structural formula pka methane ch propene ch benzene ch acetylene ch cyclopentadiene
