example the symmetry operation is the rotation and the symmetry element is the axis of rotation there are five types of symmetry operations including identity reflection inversion proper rotation and improper rotation the improper rotation is the sum of a rotation followed by a reflection the symmetry elements that correspond to the five types of symmetry operations are listed in table table table of elements and operations element operation symbol identity identity e proper axis rotation by no cn symmetry plane reflection in the plane Ïƒ inversion center inversion of a point at xyz to xyz i improper axis rotation
