axis principle axis the principle axis of a molecule is the highest order proper rotation axis for example if a molecule had c and c axes the c is the principle axis reflection and symmetry planes σ symmetry planes are mirror planes within the molecule a reflection operation occurs with respect to a plane of symmetry there are three classes of symmetry elements σh horizontal horizontal planes are perpendicular to principal axis σv vertical vertical planes are parallel to the principal axis σd dihedral dihedral planes are parallel to the principle axis and bisecting two c axes inversion and inversion
