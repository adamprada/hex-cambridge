oxoanions such as feo which exists as discrete anions in the salts nafeo and srfeo and in the neutral oxides ruo and oso the metal carbonyl complexes nico and coco are also tetrahedral the splitting of the dorbitals in a tetrahedral crystal field can be understood by connecting the vertices of a tetrahedron to form a cube as shown in the picture at the left the tetrahedral ml bonds lie along the body diagonals of the cube the dz and dxy orbitals point along the cartesian axes ie towards the faces of the cube and have the least contact with
