compared to the pairing energy and their tetrahedral complexes are always high spin note that we have dropped the g subscript because the tetrahedron does not have a center of symmetry tetrahedral complexes often have vibrant colors because they lack the center of symmetry that forbids a dd transition because the low energy transition is allowed these complexes typically absorb in the visible range and have extinction coefficients that are orders of magnitude higher than the those of the corresponding octahedral complexes an illustration of this effect can be seen in drierite which contains particles of colorless anhydrous calcium sulfate
