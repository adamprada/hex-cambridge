the left the packing atom in fluorite is ca and the structure is composed of three interpenetrating fcc lattices it should be noted that the ca ion gray spheres as a packing atom defies our rule that anions are larger than cations and therefore must be the packing atoms the fluorite structure is common for ionic mx mgf zro etc and mx compounds lio in contrast the hcp relative of the fluorite structure is quite rare because of unfavorable close contacts between likecharged ions the fluorite caf crystal structure showing the coordination environments of the ca and f atoms in
