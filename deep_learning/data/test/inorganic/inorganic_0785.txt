in the chair conformation unlike zincblende however the rings joining these planes contain sixmembered boat rings the boat aligns the anions so that they are directly above the cations in the structure a less favorable situation sterically but a more favorable one in terms of electrostatics as a result the wurtzite structure tends to favor more polar or ionic compounds eg zno nhf than the zincblende structure as with zincblende both ions are in tetrahedral coordination and there are typically eight valence electrons in the mx compound examples of compounds with this structure include beo zno mns cdse mgte aln
