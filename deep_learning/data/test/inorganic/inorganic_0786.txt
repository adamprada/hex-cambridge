or elongation of the lattice along this direction for this reason crystals of compounds in the wurtzite structure are typically piezoelectric some compounds are diamorphic and can have either the zincblende or wurtzite structure examples of these compounds that have intermediate polarities include cds and zns sio exists in polymorphs crystobalite and tridymite that resemble zincblende and wurtzite with o atoms midway between each of the si atoms the zincblende and wurtzite structures have efficient packing arrangements for tetrahedrally bonded networks and are commonly found in compounds that have tetrahedral bonding water for example has a tetrahedral hydrogen bonding network
