most stable polymorph of ice which is obtained upon freezing at atmosphere pressure this polymorph icei has a hcp wurtzitetype structure looking at the structure shown at the right we see that there are irregular arrangements of the oho bonds in the structure hydrogen bonding enforces the tetrahedral coordination of each water molecule resulting in a relatively open structure that is less dense than liquid water for this reason ice floats in water no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to develop the
