avogadros constant is the madelung constant a constant that varies for different structures is the charge of an electron c is the cation charge is the anion charge is the permittivity of free space the second equation is the repulsive interaction with is the repulsion coefficient and is the born exponent typically ranges between that is used to measure how much a solid compresses these equations combine to form with is the closest ion distance calculate lattice energy lattice energy based on the equation from above is dependent on multiple factors we see that the charge of ions is proportional
