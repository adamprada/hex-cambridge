the al gives the compound a negative charge the compound has large electrostatic attraction the bigger the electrostatic attraction the greater the lattice energy kjmol again this value is found in a table of constants no headers topic hierarchy no headers the classification of lewis acids and bases as hard and soft is a useful qualitative approach to rationalize their behavior the ecw model is a more quantitative model that describes and predicts the strength of lewis acid lewis base interactions the strength of the acidbase interaction is measured as the enthalpy of adduct formation h each acid is characterized
