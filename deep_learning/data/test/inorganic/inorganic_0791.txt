of strength of the bond between the acid and the base both in the gas phase and in weakly solvating media the w term represents a constant energy for cleavage of a dimeric acid or base for example the enthalpy of cleavage of rhcocl by base b involves two steps the first step is cleavage of the dimer which is w the second step is the binding of b to the rhclco monomer in another case w is the enthalpy needed to cleave the internal hydrogen bonding of the hbonding acid cfcoh the calculation of the enthalpy of adduct formation
