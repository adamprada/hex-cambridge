attainable steric effects have also been identified with chsncl and with cuhfacac when π bonding contributes to the measured enthalpy the enthalpy calculated from the e and c parameters will be less than the measured enthalpy and the difference provides a measure of the extent of the π bonding contribution a graphical presentation of this model clearly shows that there is no single ranking order of lewis acid or lewis base strengths a point often overlooked and emphasizes that the magnitude of acid and base interactions requires two parameters e c to account for the interactions a cramerbopp plotusing the
