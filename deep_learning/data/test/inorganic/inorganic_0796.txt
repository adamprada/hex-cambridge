hydrogen atom in its ground state is about x cm in order to provide the ground states of the hydrogen atom we need to solve the schrödinger equation the wavefunction of the ground state of hydrogen a hydrogen atoms ground state wavefunction is a spherically symmetric distribution in the nucleus in which the largest at the center and reduces exponentially at larger distance the function is known as the s atomic orbital hydrogen has more than one ground state exists in which is said to be degenerate the ground state wavefunction is ψsrπaera since the probability density is ψsr therefore
