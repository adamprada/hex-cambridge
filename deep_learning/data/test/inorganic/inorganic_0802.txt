to do this using localized electron centre lewis type bonds as usual molecular orbital theory comes to the rescue but the b cage alone is a rather complex system to use as an example the topic of the boranes boron hydrides to be covered later might help shed some light on how the molecular orbitals might be set up the allotropes of crystalline boron are the most complex of the structures of the elements and their study has been futher complicated by the presence of small but stoichiometric amounts of carbon or nitrogen leading to some false ones the basic
