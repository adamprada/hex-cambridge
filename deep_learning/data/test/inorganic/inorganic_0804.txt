fig figure shows the distribution of these structures metals are sometimes described as a regular array of cations immersed in a sea of valence electrons which are completely delocalized and free to roam through the entire mass a simplified theoretical picture of this follows in the molecule li the bond results from overlap of the s orbitals each of which contains electrons the diagram below shows several representations of this the part of the diagram on the left shows the energy levels at the observed internuclear distance marked with a vertical dotted line on the right hand diagram a crude
