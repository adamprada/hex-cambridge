because lithium has the s valence shell configuration only half of this band will be filled and electrons can easily move into the empty orbitals accounting for the metallic conduction observed the occupied levelsorbitals are shown by the shaded area in the diagram below the situation described above is not real real crystals are threedimensional and in addition to the molecular orbitals formed by the atomic sorbitals there will be another set formed by overlap of the atomic porbitals the text figures and are a more realistic representation cohesive energies of the metals see figure note that the main group
