for example as ho covalent compounds are the normal situation when combined with very electropositive elements eg na k ca it behaves as h hydride ion and is a very powerful reducing agent helium s and the noble gases nsnp the energy necessary to make a valence state is not compensated by bond formation above krypton which forms a few flourides the rest of the group have fairly extensive chemistry with fluorine chlorine and oxygen the first noble gas compound originally thought to be xeptf by analogy with optf was made by bartlett in prior to that they had been
