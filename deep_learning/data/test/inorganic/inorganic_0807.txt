number can be increased is limited by negative charge buildup on the acceptor li be and b also tend to be involved in molecules featuring centre e bonding as a way to reduce their electron deficiency n o and perhaps f compounds can be lewis bases because of the available electon pairs on these atoms the sharing of more than one pair is opposed by positive charge buildup on the donor atom and sometimes steric factors li exists in rather few compounds because of its small size covalent and multicenter bonding is common eg the lithium alkyls be would be
