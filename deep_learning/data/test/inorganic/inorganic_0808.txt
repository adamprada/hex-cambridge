are cationic covalency dominates the chemistry of these elements there are compounds containing anions eg c acetylide and n which is a major product when mg burns in air the chemistry of o and f is dominated by anion formation and covalency remember o is too strong a base to exist in water though solid compounds are known fluoride f is only a weak base and so known in solids and aqueous solution c n and o commonly participate in multiple bonding by the use of porbitals n is a rather unreactive molecule because of the great strength of the
