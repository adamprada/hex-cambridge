from special sterically encumbered cases there are few compounds containing sisi pp or ss bonds an example of an exception is chcppcch ppppbonding is not stable with respect to addition reactions a kinetic effect multiple bonding that does occur usually involves a first short period element such as oxygen or nitrogen examples include clpo so or clo such molecules may contain ppdpbonding and the octet rule is often violated on the other hand there is no analogue in silicon chemistry of oco sio is a network solid although the siosi groupings are linear which does hint and pinteractions the dobitals
