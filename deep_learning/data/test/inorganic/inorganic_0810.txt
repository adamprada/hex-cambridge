and indicating again how the top member of each group differs the following is list of key properties appropriate for comparisions metallic character properties of the oxides ionic vs covalent acidic vs basic properties of the halides ionic vs molecular ease of hydrolysis general trends in electrovalence and covalence trends in structure coordination numbers for discrete species aggregation in the solid state to increase coordination number properties of the hydrides tendency to catenate the relative importance of pppp vs ppdp vs dpdp bonding the general strength of covalent bonding the relative importance of the lower valent states vs the hight
