going down the group group iib metals zn cd and hg have two selectrons outside filled dsubshells in zn and cd the delectrons do a somewhat poorer screening job than the closed shells of the group iia so that the ions which are more polarizing are more inclined to form complex ions with nh halides and cn mercuric ion hg where the fsubshell also has been filled is quite different in that it is even more inclined to form complexes the oxidation potential for mercury is positive whereas the others are all negative which means that mercury metal is rather
