carbon in carbenes is very reactive and it comes in both singlet and triplet forms silicon has virtually no chemistry in this state for the rest of the group the ii state becomes successively more stable going down the group the inert pair is usually stereoactive in both molecular and solid state aggregated compounds the mii compounds can never be considered truly ionic the trend is probably associated with decreasing covalent bond strengths compared to the energy needed to obtain the valence state because the ionization potential differences are small gecl cl gecl rapid at oc sncl cl sncl slow
