calculated by defining the standard enthalpy of formation of simple substances to be zero namely entropy entropy is a state function and is a criterion determining whether one state can be reached spontaneously from another state the nd law of thermodynamics states that the entropy s of an isolated system increases upon a spontaneous change namely a thermodynamically irreversible process produces entropy entropy is related to the disorder of a system in statistical themodynamics as follows k is the boltzmann constant and w is the number of the arrangements of atoms or molecules of the system with the same energy
