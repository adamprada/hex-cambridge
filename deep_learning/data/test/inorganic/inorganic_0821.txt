two water molecules and the eigen cation ho formed from a hydronium ion and three water molecules the hydron itself is crucial in the more general br√∏nstedlowry acidbase theory which extends the concept of acidbase chemistry beyond aqueous solutions both of these complexes represent ideal structures in a more general hydrogen bonded network defect a freezingpoint depression study determined that the mean hydration ion in cold water is on average approximately hoho where each hydronium ion is solvated by water molecules some hydration structures are quite large the hoho magic ion number structure called magic because of its increased stability
