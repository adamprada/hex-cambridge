pairs on the central atom in the molecule and add the number of bonded atoms aka bonding domains this number the steric number defines the electronic shape of the molecule by minimizing repulsion for example a steric number of three gives a trigonal planar electronic shape the angles between electron domains are determined primarily by the electronic geometry eg for a steric number of which implies that the electronic shape is a tetrahedron these angles are adjusted by the hierarchy of repulsions lone pair lone pair lone pair bond bond bond the molecular geometry is deduced from the electronic geometry
