in which the f atoms occupy axial sites resulting in linear molecule one in which the f atoms occupy one equatorial and one axial site resulting in a bond angle and one in which the f atoms are both on equatorial sites with a fxef bond angle of the observed geometry of xef is linear which can be rationalized by considering the orbitals that are used to make bonds or lone pairs in the axial and equatorial positions there are four available orbitals s px py and pz if we choose the zaxis as the axial direction we can see
