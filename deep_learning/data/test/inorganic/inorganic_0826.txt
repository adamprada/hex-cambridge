prefer the equatorial sites in the trigonal bipyramidal geometry electronegative ligands such as f will always go to the axial sites in the case of the brf anion which is isoelectronic with xef in the table the electronic geometry is octahedral and there are two possible isomers in which the two lone pairs are cis or trans to each other in this case lone pair lone pair repulsion dominates and we obtain the trans arrangement of lone pairs giving a square planar molecular geometry orbital hybridization the observation of molecules in the various electronic shapes shown above is at first
