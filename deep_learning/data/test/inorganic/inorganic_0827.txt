the atomic orbitals ψ represent solutions to the schrödinger wave equation here e is the energy of an electron in the orbital and is the hamiltonian operator by analogy with classical mechanics the hamiltonian is commonly expressed as the sum of operators corresponding to the kinetic and potential energies of a system in the form where is the potential energy and is the kinetic energy operator in which m is the mass of the particle and the momentum operator is here is hπ where h is plancks constant and the laplacian operator is although this is not the technical definition
