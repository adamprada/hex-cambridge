body reduced mass of the nucleus of mass mn and the electron of mass me to a good approximation µ me erwin schrödinger as a young scientist this is the equation that erwin schrödinger famously derived in to solve for the energies and shapes of the s p d and f atomic orbitals in hydrogenlike atoms it was a huge conceptual leap for both physics and chemistry because it not only explained the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom but also provided the theoretical basis for the octet rule and the arrangement of elements in the periodic table the
