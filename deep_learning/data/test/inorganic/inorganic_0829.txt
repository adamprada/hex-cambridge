total energy e is the sum of the kinetic energy ke and the potential energy pe these three quantities are represented mathematically as operators in the equation on the left side of the equation the total energy operator e is a scalar that is multiplied by the wavefunction ψ ψ is a function of the spatial coordinates xyz and is related to the probability that the electron is at that point in space the first term on the right side of the equation represents the kinetic energy ke the kinetic energy operator is proportional to the laplacian operator which takes
