equation although ψ is a function of the coordinates e is not so an electron in a pz orbital has the same total energy e pe ke no matter where it is in space these e values and their associated wavefunctions ψ are catalogued according to their quantum numbers n l and ml that is there are many solutions to the differential equation and each solution ψxyz and e has a unique set of quantum numbers some sets of orbitals are degenerate meaning that they have the same energy eg px py and pz the solutions ψxyz to the schrödinger
