the spatial coordinates from to is the solutions to the schrödinger equation are orthogonal meaning that the product of any two integrated over all space is zero for example the product of the s and px orbitals integrated over the spatial coordinates from to is zero the shapes of the first five atomic orbitals s s px py and pz the colors denote the sign of the wave function orbital hybridization involves making linear combinations of the atomic orbitals that are solutions to the schrödinger equation mathematically this is justified by recognizing that the schrödinger equation is a linear differential
