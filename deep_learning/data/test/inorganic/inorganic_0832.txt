we make two linear combinations of the s and pz orbitals assigning z as the axis of the bef bond here we have simply added and subtracted the s and pz orbitals we leave it as an exercise for the interested student to show that both orbitals are normalized ie and orthogonal ie what this means physically is explained in the figure below by combining the s and pz orbitals we have created two new orbitals with large lobes high electron probability pointing along the zaxis these two orbitals are degenerate and have an energy that is halfway between the
