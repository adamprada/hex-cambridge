energy ie the energy released by combining a be atom in its ground state with two f atoms is the difference between the bonding and promotion energies we can similarly construct sp hybrids eg for the bf molecule or the no anion from one s and two p atomic orbitals taking the plane of the molecule as the xy plane we obtain three hybrid orbitals at to each other the three hybrids are these orbitals are again degenerate and their energy is the weighted average of the energies of the s px and py atomic orbitals finally to make a
