the shape that best minimizes electron pair repulsions interestingly however the bond angles in ph hs and hse are close to suggesting that p s and se primarily use their porbitals in bonding to h in these molecules this is consistent with the fact that the energy difference between s and p orbitals stays roughly constant going down the periodic table but the bond energy decreases as the valence electrons get farther away from the nucleus in compounds of elements in the rd th and th rows of the periodic table there thus is a decreasing tendency to use sp
