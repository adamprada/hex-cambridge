mno with elemental alkali metal m it is curious that these normal valent compounds do not form by direct reaction of the metal with oxygen sodium metal is oxided in air to sodium peroxide nao because the alkali metals are all very electropositive χ and oxygen is very electronegative χ we expect all the compounds we make by combining them to be reliably ionic consistent with this picture we find that lio along with nao ko and rbo adopts the antifluorite structure coordination see problem which we expect to find with relatively ionic mx compounds strangely however cso crystallizes in
