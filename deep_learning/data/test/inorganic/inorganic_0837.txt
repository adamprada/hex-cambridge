large k ions surround each o ion in the structure the cations are essentially in contact indeed the metaloxygen bonds are stretched in nao ko and rbo relative to mo bonds with the same bond order in other structures the situation is so extreme for cso that it finds an electrostatically unfavorable structure in which the coordination is lowered to this packing problem is relieved somewhat in the peroxides where the coordination is still but the anion is larger and especially in the superoxides where the cationanion ratio is and the coordination is thus the larger alkali ions k rb
