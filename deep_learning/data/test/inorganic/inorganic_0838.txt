of mo we will need the heats of formation of mg and og which are available from tabulated values and el which we can calculate from kapustinskiis equation similarly we can write for the formation of the alkali peroxides reaction reaction δh overall and for the superoxides reaction δh overall for the gaseous anions and cations we have the following heats of formation and ionic radii cn ion δhf kj ionic radius å li na k rb cs o o o now using kapustinskiis equation we can calculate the lattice energies for each compound these have been converted to lattice
