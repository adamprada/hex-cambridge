the heats of formation per mole of metal of each of the oxides metal δhfmo δhfmo δhfmo li kj kj kj na k rb cs we can see that for li the formation of lio is favored over lio or lio because of the very favorable lattice energy of lio as the lattice energy becomes less negative with increasing cation size the peroxide becomes the most stable at na for the heavier alkalis mo becomes quite unstable and the superoxides mo are the most stable this is consistent with our observations of the chemistry of the group i oxides metalair
