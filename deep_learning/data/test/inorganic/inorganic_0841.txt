age of mössbauer graduated and also showed experimental evidence for recoilless resonant absorption in the nucleus later to be called the mössbauer effectin mössbauer was awarded the nobel prize in physics and under the urging of richard feynman accepted the position of professor of physics at the california institute of technology mössbauer effect the recoil energy associated with absorption or emission of a photon can be described by the conservation of momentumin it we find that the recoil energy depends inversely on the mass of the system for a gas the mass of the single nucleus is small compared to
