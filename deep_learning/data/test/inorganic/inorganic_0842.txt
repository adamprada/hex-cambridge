so for our case this is the speed of light is the velocity of the observer is the velocity of the source which is positive when heading away from the observer and is the initial frequency in the case where the source is moving toward a stationary observer the perceived frequency is higherfor the opposite situation where the source travels away from the observer frequencies recorded at the observer will be of lower compared to the initial wave the energy of a photon is related to the product of plancks constant and the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation thus for
