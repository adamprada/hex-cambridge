lorentzian distribution mössbauer isotopes by far the most common isotopes studied using mössbauer spectroscopy is fe but many other isotopes have also displayed a mössbauer spectrum two criteria for functionality are the excited state is of very low energy resulting in a small change in energy between ground and excited state this is because gamma rays at higher energy are not absorbed in a recoil free manner meaning resonance only occurs for gamma rays of low energy the resolution of mössbauer spectroscopy depends upon the lifetime of the excited state the longer the excited state lasts the better the image
