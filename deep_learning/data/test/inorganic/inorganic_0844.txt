identical atoms play the role of source and absorber thus the radius of the source rs is different that of the absorber ra and the same holds that the electron density of each species is different the coulombic interactions affects the ground and excited state differently leading to a energy difference that is not the same for the two speciesthis is best illustrated with the equation where delta represents the change in energy necessary to excite the absorber which is seen as a shift from the doppler speed to v the isomer shift depends directly on the selectrons and can
