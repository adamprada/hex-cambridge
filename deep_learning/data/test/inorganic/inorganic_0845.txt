between the doublets is thus the energy diagram and corresponding spectrum can be seen as magnetic splitting magnetic splitting of seen in m√∂ssbauer spectroscopy can be seen because the nuclear spin moment undergoes dipolar interactions with the magnetic field where is the nuclear gfactor and is the nuclear magneton in the absence of quadrupole interactions the hamiltonian splits into equally spaced energy levels of the allowed gamma stimulated transitions of nuclear excitation follows the magnetic dipole transition selection rule is the magnetic quantum number and the direction of defines the nuclear quantization axis if we assume and are isotropic direction
