equivalent edge points in auguste bravais proved that crystals could be split into fourteen unit cells although there are several types of unit cells found in cubic lattices we will be discussing the basic ones simple cubic bodycentered cubic and facecentered cubic if any atom recrystalizes it will eventually become the original lattice crystallization refers the purification processes of molecular or structures introduction the unit cell contains seven crystal systems and fourteen crystal lattices these unit cells are given types and titles of symmetries but we will be focusing on cubic unit cells one of the most commonly known unit
