make it easier for metals ions or molecules to be found within the crystalline structure this phenomena is rare due to the low packing of density but the closed packed directions give the cube shape since the edges of each unit cell are equidistant each unit cell is identical in order to be labeled as a simple cubic unit cell each eight cornered same particle must at each of the eight corners this unit cell only contains one atom its packing efficiency is about to packing efficiency we multiply eight corners by oneeighth for only oneeighth of the atom is
