this type of unit cell is more common than that of the simple cubic unit cell due to tightly packed atoms its packing efficiency is about compared to the simple cubic unit cells this unit cells contains two atoms to determine this we multiply the previous eight corners by oneeighth and add one for the additional lattice point in the center corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell additional lattice point atoms to calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows some examples of bccs are iron chromium and potassium it
