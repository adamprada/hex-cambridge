touch one another along the face diagonals all atoms are identical this unit cell contains four atoms to determine this we take the equation from the aforementioned simple cubic unit cell and add to the parenthesized six faces of the unit cell multiplied by onehalf due to the lattice points on each face of the cubic cell corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell faces x contribution atoms to calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows some examples of fccs are gold and silver references brown theodore l chemistry the
