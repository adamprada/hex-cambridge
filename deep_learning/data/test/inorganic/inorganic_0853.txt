silver is gmol thus we divide by avagadros number x we end up with x gatom next we find the mass of the unit cell by multiplying the number of atoms in the unit cell by the mass of each atom x gatom x grams next we find the edge length by which equals x meters now we find the volume which equals the edge length to the third power we convert meters into centimeters by dividing the edge length by cmm to the third power x m x cmm x cubic centimeters finally we find the density by mass
