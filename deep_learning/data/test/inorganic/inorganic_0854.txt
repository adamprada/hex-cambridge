and hence a current in the bottom coil when the switch is opened and closed the galvanometer registers currents in opposite directions no current flows through the galvanometer when the switch remains closed or open cc by openstax magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles electrons in atoms also are moving charges with angular momentum so they too produce a magnetic dipole which is why some materials are magnetic a magnetic dipole interacts with an applied magnetic field and the energy of this interaction is given by the scalar product of the magnetic dipole moment and the magnetic
