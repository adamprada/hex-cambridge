since the angle between and can vary continuously from low energy to high energy in a nonuniform magnetic field a current loop and therefore a magnet experiences a net force which tries to pull an aligned dipole into regions where the magnitude of the magnetic field is larger and push an antialigned dipole into regions where magnitude the magnetic field is smaller quantum effects as expected the quantum picture is different pieter zeeman was one of the first to observe the splittings of spectral lines in a magnetic field caused by this interaction consequently such splittings are known as the
