magnetic dipole moment also referred to simply as the magnetic moment and the angular momentum of a particle with mass m and charge is given by for an electron this equation becomes where the specific charge and mass of the electron have been substituted for and the magnetic moment for the electron is a vector pointing in the direction opposite to both of which classically are perpendicular to the plane of the rotational motion exercise will an electron in the ground state of hydrogen have a magnetic moment why or why not the relationship between the angular momentum of a
