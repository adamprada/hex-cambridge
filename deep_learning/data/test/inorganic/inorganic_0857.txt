energy terms that are relevant to the problem at hand where is the hamiltonian operator in the absence of the field and is written using the operator forms of equations and the scalar product simplifies if the zaxis is defined as the direction of the external field because then and are automatically and equation ref becomes where is the magnitude of the magnetic field which is along the zaxis we now can ask what is the effect of a magnetic field on the energy of the hydrogen atom orbitals to answer this question we will not solve the schr√∂dinger equation
