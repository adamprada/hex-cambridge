perturbation theory is discussed in the next chapter the expectation value calculated for the total energy in this case is the sum of the energy in the absence of the field plus the zeeman energy the factor defines the constant called the bohr magneton which is taken to be the fundamental magnetic moment it has units of erggauss or jouletesla this factor will help you to relate magnetic fields measured in gauss or tesla to energies measured in ergs or joules for any particle with a charge and mass the same as an electron equation ref shows that the quantum
