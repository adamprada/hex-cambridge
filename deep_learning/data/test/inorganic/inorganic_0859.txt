experiences no interaction with the magnetic field the state for which the angular momentum in the zdirection is Ä§ and the magnetic moment is in the opposite direction against the field experiences a raising of energy in the presence of a field maintaining the magnetic dipole against the external field direction is like holding a small bar magnet with its poles aligned exactly opposite to the poles of a large magnet figure it is a higher energy situation than when the magnetic moments are aligned with each other figure the effect of an external magnetic field on the energy of
