orbitals that derive from σu and σg become degenerate ie they have identically the same energy by symmetry the term symbol e means doubly degenerate we will see later that t means triply degenerate note that we drop the g and u for the triangular orbitals because a triangle does not have an inversion center the triangular form is most stable because the two electrons in h have lower energy in the lowest orbital bending the molecule creates a third bonding interaction between the s orbitals on the ends mo diagram for xh x be b c some key points
