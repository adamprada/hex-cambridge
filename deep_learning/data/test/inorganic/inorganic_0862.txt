that has πu symmetry in the mo diagram we make bonding and antibonding combinations of the σgs and the σus for beh we then populate the lowest two orbitals with the four valence electrons and discover not surprisingly that the molecule has two bonds and can be written hbeh the correlation diagram shows that a bent form of the molecule should be less stable an interesting story about this mo diagram is that it is difficult to predict a priori whether ch should be linear or bent in charles bender and henry schaefer using quantum chemical calculations predicted that the
