molecule is affected when not all of the pairs of electrons are nonbonding before that however it is important to discuss how bond angles are affected by lone pairs according to vsepr electronelectron repulsion decreases in the following manner lone pair lone pair lone pair bonding pair bonding pair bonding pair this means that presence of lone pairs will increase electronelectron repulsion causing a change in the bond angles the first alternate shape for a coordinate molecule then is where one of the bonding pairs of electrons is replaced with a lone pair the best place for the lone pair
