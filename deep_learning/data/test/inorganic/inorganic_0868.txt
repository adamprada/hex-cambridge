to be linear stereoisomers due to the fact that there are two possible types of x atoms axial or equatorial stereoisomers of trigonal bipyramidal species with more than one type of a atom are possible if there are two different x atoms then those atoms have the option of being cis or trans to each other meaning if one is axial then the other can be equatorial cis or also axial trans stereoisomers occur when two or more molecules with the same molecular formula have different molecular shapes references housecroft catherine e and alan g sharpe inorganic chemistry london pearson
