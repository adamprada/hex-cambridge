of degree bond angles as a result all are placed in the equatorial position leaving room at the axial postion for the atoms thus the bond angles of the atoms are degrees from each other stereoisomers since there are two types of atoms on a trigonal bipyramidal structure axial and equatorial there are different stereoisomers that could arise depending on the substituents attached for example if there is x atoms and y atom attached to the central atom y could either be in an equatorial position or in an axial position if there are x atoms and y atoms then
