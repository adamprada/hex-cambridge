cells are shown in the tiling pattern at the right along with arrows that indicate unit translation vectors in three dimensions the hexagonal or rhombic unit cells of this pattern would be replaced by three dimensional boxes that would stack together to fill all space as shown in the figure the origin of the unit cell is arbitrary the same set of boxes will fill all space no matter where we define the origin of the lattice we will see that pure metals typically have very simple crystal structures with cubic or hexagonal unit cells however the crystal structures of
