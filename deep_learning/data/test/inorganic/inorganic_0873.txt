there are not enough to put two electrons between each pair of atoms transition metals can also use their dorbitals in bonding but again there are never enough electrons to completely fill all the bonds possible unit cells in a periodic tile pattern the arrows connect translationally equivalent points lattice points in the pattern the atoms in a metal lattice arrange themselves in a certain pattern which can be represented as a d box structure known as the unit cell which repeats across the entire metal simple cubic body centered cubic face centered cubic hexagonal close packed atomcell atomscell atomscell
