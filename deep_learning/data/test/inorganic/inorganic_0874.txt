unit cell a face centered cubic fcc unit cell and a body centered cubic bcc unit cell simple cubic corner atoms ⅛ atomcell the packing in this structure is not efficient and so this structure type is very rare for metals body centered cubic bcc corner atoms ⅛ center atom atomscell the packing is more efficient and the structure is a common one for alkali metals and early transition metals alloys such as brass cuzn also adopt these structures face centered cubic fcc also called cubic close packed ccp corner atoms ⅛ face atoms ½ atomscell this structure along with
