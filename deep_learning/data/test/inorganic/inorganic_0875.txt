the cubic cells is found by cubing the side length as an example lets calculate the packing efficiency of a simple cubic unit cell as we saw earlier in the section a simple cubic unit cell contains one atom the side length of the simple cubic unit cell is r since the centers of each atom occupy the corners of the unit cell the same method can be applied to bcc and fcc structures facecentered cubic stack of cannonballs no headers no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which
