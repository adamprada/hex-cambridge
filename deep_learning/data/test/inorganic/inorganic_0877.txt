participate in bonding ie chemistry and are called core electrons the valence electrons ie the part are valence electrons which do participate in the making and breaking of bonds similarly in calcium equation the electrons in the argonlike closed shell are the core electrons and the the two electrons in the s orbital are valence electrons example cobalt what are the core and valence electrons in cobalt solution start by writing the electron configuration of cobalt with electrons however argon has the electronic structure so we can rewrite the configuration as the two electrons in the orbital and the seven
