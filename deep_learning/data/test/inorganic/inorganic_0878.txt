chemical property of a group which is called periodical trend the number of valence electrons in a main period is the same as its group number the table below shows this rule clearly under construction figure a a are metals a to a are nonmetals however this periodicity cannot be applied to the transition group which is more complicated than that of the main group although the outermost electrons can be easily determined the apparent valence electrons considered in chemical reactivity are complex and fluctuated electrons going into d sublevel can play either a role of valence electrons or shielding
