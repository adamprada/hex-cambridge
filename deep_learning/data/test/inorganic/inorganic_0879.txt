than those that are not for example ne is chemically inert because it has two valence electrons that fill its outermost shell which makes it stable compared to atoms such as al which has three valence electrons but its valence electrons does not fill its outermost shell although core electrons do not take part in chemical bonding they play a role in determining the chemical reactivity of an atom this influence is generally due to the effect it has on valence electrons the effect can be observed from the gradual change of chemical reactivity in a group as you go
