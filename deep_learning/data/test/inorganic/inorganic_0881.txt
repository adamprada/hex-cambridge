predicting the behavior of electrons in bonding it focuses on the overlap of the outermost orbitals where the valence electrons reside electrons are thought to be concentrated along the interculear axis causing a density of negatively charged electrons between both atoms attracted by the nuclei these shared electrons pull together their respective atoms to which the electrons belong and the result is formation of a covalent bond these hydrogens come together because of the electrostatic attraction between the nuclei and the electron desnity between them based on the the principle of valence bond theory two electrons are required to make
