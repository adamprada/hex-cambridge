electrons so it can bond with hydrogen atoms resulting a ch molecule valence bond theory is most of the time used in conjuction with the idea of hybridization and vsepr valence shell electron pair repulsion in other to predict the shape and the bond angles of a molecule valence bond model of hydrogen the formation of h in valence bond theory in this diagram ha and hb both have one electron that can be accounted for we know that the electron on ha belongs to ha and the electron on hb belongs to hb however when these two hydrogen bond
