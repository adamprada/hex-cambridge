pairs constructing the octet valence bond picture for a molecule we can construct an octet picture for any molecule using the nv method number of electrons needed to make separate octets around all atoms n n for nonh atoms n for h number of valence electrons v add up using group numbers dont forget to add or subtract for charges on ions number of shared electrons s nv and therefore the number of bonds s fill in lone pairs everywhere else to complete octets example nitrate anion no n atoms x electrons v n o o o charge s shared
