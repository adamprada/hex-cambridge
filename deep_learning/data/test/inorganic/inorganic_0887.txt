spectra xps energetic xrays ionize atoms by kicking out electrons from their core orbitals by conservation of energy the kinetic energy ke of an emitted electron is related to its binding energy be and the energy of the incoming xray photon hν by be hν ke electrons are harder to remove from positively charged atoms higher be and easier to remove from negatively charged atoms lower be relative to the neutral element the formal charge distribution is assigned by dividing the shared bonding electrons equally between atoms thus the singly bonded o atoms each possess electrons and because o is
