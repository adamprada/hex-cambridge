as we will discuss in chapter like oxidation states the formal charges on the atoms in a molecule or ion must add up to its overall charge we can similarly draw the lewis structure for ammonia as shown below when we divide the shared electrons equally between the atoms we see that the n atom has five electrons and each h atom has one these are the same as their group numbers and thus all the formal charges in the ammonia molecule are zero octet structures of the lewis acidbase adduct nhbf the hydronium ion ho and the sulfate anion
