should be placed on the most electronegative atoms positive formal charges should be placed on the least electronegative atoms it is unfavorable to place like charges or on neighboring atoms in a molecule examples of these rules are shown below for alternative structures of bf and onf in the bf case the structure on the left is nonoctet because there are only six electrons three bonds in the valence shell of b such structures are said to be electron deficient an octet structure right can be drawn but it places a positive formal charge on f the most electronegative atom
