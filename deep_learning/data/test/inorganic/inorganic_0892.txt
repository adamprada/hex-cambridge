structures the rules of resonance also apply to inequivalent structures which in general will have different energies from each other in this case the structure of the molecule represents a weighted average of the low energy structures a good example is the cyanate ion ocn we can write three inequivalent octet structures for the molecule the first two are reasonable resonance structures although we suspect the one on the left is the best because it puts the negative formal charge on the most electronegative atom the last one is clearly a bad resonance structure because the formal charges are high
