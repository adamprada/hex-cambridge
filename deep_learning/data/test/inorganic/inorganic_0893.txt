and moving a lone pair from x into the xy bond we generate the resonance structure shown on the right in which all atoms remain octet but there is no bond between y and z it is important to recognize in this example that the nobond form is only one resonance structure and therefore the z atom is still bound to y if the two resonance structures in this example have the same energy we would expect the xy bond order to be and the yz bond order to be therefore the yz bond should be longer than it is
