is often used to provide an octet bonding picture for socalled hypervalent compounds which are compounds that appear to have more than valence electrons in the bonding shell of the central atom for example we can consider two different valence bond structures for the triiodide ion i which is formed by reaction of i with i in water in this structure the central iodine atom has electrons in its valence shell in violation of the octet rule raman spectra of the triiodide ion show that the ii bond is weaker than the ii single bond in i suggesting that this
