can draw a similar picture for the xef molecule which has the same number of valence electrons as i this picture is consistent with xps data which show a partial negative charge on the f atoms as well as vibrational spectra which show that the xef bond is weaker in xef than it is in the singlybonded cation xef other well known examples of hypervalent compounds are pf pch and sf as well as oxyacids such as hso and hclo the hypervalent structure is often drawn for these molecules with the explanation that dorbitals on the central atom contribute to
