the octet structure is unreasonable because it suggests a polar bond between p and c with a partial negative charge on c further in the case of oxyacids such as hso and hclo xray crystallographic data establish that the so and clo bonds are shorter for the oxygen atoms not bonded to hydrogen which is more consistent with the hypervalent picture the question of whether hypervalency and the octet rule are really useful descriptions of the bonding in these compounds has been considered in a number of computational studies which have used increasingly accurate quantum mechanical calculations to determine the
