rule that is useful within certain limits the isoelectronic principle in calculating the octet structures of molecules using the nv method we needed to know only the number of atoms and the number of electrons not the identities of the atoms themselves this means that we will get the same answer and the same set of octet and resonance structures for any molecule or ion that contains a the same number of nonhydrogen atoms and b the same total number of valence electrons such molecules are said to be isoelectronic this is a powerful conclusion because once we have determined
