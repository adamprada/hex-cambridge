have a trigonal planar shape while bf is a member of this isoelectronic series we do not write it in the resonance form that contains a bf double bond because that would put a positive formal charge on f similarly we can show that ch nh nh ho ho hf f and oh are all isoelectronic with one nonh atom and eight valence electrons in the next section we will see that this gives rise to nearly identical electronic shapes for these molecules nitrous oxide no or laughing gas is isoelectronic with co the two molecules have the same shape
