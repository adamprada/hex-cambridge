gan all contain four valence electrons per atom cdte and cuinxgaxse cigs are promising solar cell materials that also have the same number of valence electrons per atom like si and ge these compounds have tetrahedrally bonded structures in the solid state and absorb light across most of the solar spectrum as we will discuss in more detail in chapters and figure the tetrahedral bonding in crystals of gaas cdte cuinxgaxse and other semiconductors is similar to that in isoelectronic si and ge the isoelectronic principle is also a powerful tool in materials research because it provides guidance about where
