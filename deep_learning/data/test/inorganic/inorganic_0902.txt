such as co all bent triatomic molecules belong to the point group cv while all the liner triatomic molecules with an inversion center belong to the dinfinityh point group those without an inversion center belong to the point group cinfinityv this gives these two structures very different infrared spectrum even though they have the same number of atoms linear molecules using vespr theory there are several ways to achieve a linear structure triatomic molecules where the central atom is using all of its electrons in the bonds with the surrounding molecules or in other words the central atom does not
