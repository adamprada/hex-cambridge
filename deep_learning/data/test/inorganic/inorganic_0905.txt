wavenature of electrons and other fundamental principles eg charge and momentum together produce the wave mechanics of electron the effects of electron wave mechanics are far reaching responsible for such phenomena as electricity emission and absorption and bonding and hybridization background wavenature of matter accurate explanations of atomic natural physical chemical phenomena are dependent on energy quantization the realization of this fundamental characteristic of matter was developed through treatment of a couple well known experiments notably max plancks explanation of black body radiation and einsteins explanation of the photoelectric effect the conclusions of energy quantization were consolidated by louis de
