most simple atomic example the three dimensional harmonics of an electron bound within the potential energy well of a proton results in what are conventionally called orbitals orbitals are commonly depicted as contours of some percent of the complex conjugate of the electrons approximate wave function though realistically without external potentials they diffuse infinitely a bound electron occupies higher harmonics of the bound state with increasing energy energy can only be increased in specific quanta as demanded for the wave function to exist the discrete energy levels of higher harmonics correspond to higher orbitals electrons can gain energy to exist
