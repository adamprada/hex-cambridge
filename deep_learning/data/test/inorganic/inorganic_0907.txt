state than in the ground state this is known as population inversion when this happens for a transition which releases light upon relaxation light of a specific nature is produced that has great practical importance this light is monochromatic and can be channelled back and forh through the medium gain medium and allowed only to disperse through a very narrow slit to produce monochromatic directional coherent light source the apparatus is called a laser which is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation the inherent charge of electron incites movement of the particle in accordance to the
