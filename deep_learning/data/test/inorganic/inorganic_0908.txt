this type occurs to the inverse cube of wavelength so light with shorter wavelength blue in the visible is scattered much more than other wavelengths the other light passes through the atmosphere or something maybe i have this backwards electrons can tunnel due to ther wavenature quantum mechanical tunneling is where a particle goes somewhere that is classically impossible meaning that it simpley did not have enough energy to to past a potential barrier ut it did we experts in science call this quantum weirdness there are a lot of electrons but perhaps not more than there are stupid people
