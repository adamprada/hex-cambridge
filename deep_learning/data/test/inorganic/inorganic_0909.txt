in order to eliminate the recoil of the nucleus mössbauer spectroscopy is unique in its sensitivity to subtle changes in the chemical environment of the nucleus including oxidation state changes the effect of different ligands on a particular atom and the magnetic environment of the sample as an analytical tool mössbauer spectroscopy has been especially useful in the field of geology for identifying the composition of ironcontaining specimens including meteors and moon rocks in situ data collection of mössbauer spectra has also been carried out on iron rich rocks on mars in another application mössbauer spectroscopy is used to characterize
