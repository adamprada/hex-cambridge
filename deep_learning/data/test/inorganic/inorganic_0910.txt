antimonycontaining tin dioxide catalyst transform into the oxidation state following the catalytic reaction almost all sb ions revert from the to the oxidation state a significant change in the chemical environment surrounding the antimony nucleus occurs during the oxidation state change which can easily be monitored as an isomer shift in the m√∂ssbauer spectrum this technique has also been used to observe the secondorder transverse doppler effect predicted by the theory of relativity because of very high energy resolution bioinorganic chemistry mossbauer spectroscopy has been widely applied to bioinorganic chemistry especially for the study of ironcontaining proteins and enzymes often
