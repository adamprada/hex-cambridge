line this involves far less force than breaking an entire plane of bonds as we would need to do to shear a perfect crystal in a given polycrystalline sample there are many dislocation lines that run perpendicular to all possible shear directions so their motion can be used to tear the metal apart turbine rotors on large jets are made of very expensive single crystal nickeltitanium alloys so that these shearing deformations can be avoided we can see that motion of dislocations is basically bad news if we want a metal to be strong and hard eg if we want
