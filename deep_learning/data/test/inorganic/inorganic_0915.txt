impurity phases that pin the motion of defects an impurity atom stops the motion because it is a different size or makes stronger bonds than the other metal atoms the line defect has a hard time moving away from rows of such atoms an impurity phase like fec in iron makes extra grain boundaries that can stop the motion of defects this effect is analogous to the graphite fibers in fiberreinforced crosslinked polymers used eg in tennis rackets that stop the propagation of cracks a simple illustration of work hardening can be done with a piece of copper wire when
