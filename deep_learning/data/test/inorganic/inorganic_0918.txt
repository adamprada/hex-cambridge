which has a σsymmetry lone pair and an empty metal d orbital binds to a metal that has electrons in a tg orbital this is a common situation for phosphine complexes eg triphenylphosphine bound to lowvalent late transition metals the backbonding in this case is analogous to the co example except that the acceptor orbital is a phosphorus d orbital rather than a ligand π orbital here the phosphine ligand acts as a σdonor and a πacceptor forming a dπdπ bond the third kind of metalligand πbonding occurs when a πdonor ligand an element with both a σsymmetry electron pair
