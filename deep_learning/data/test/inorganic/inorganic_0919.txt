ligands are low in the spectrochemical series carboncontaining ligands that are Ï€donors and their complexes with transition metal ions are very important in olefin metathesis a reaction in which carboncarbon double bonds are interchanged using these catalysts cyclic olefins can be transformed into linear polymers in high yield through ringopening metathesis polymerization romp catalysts of this kind were developed by the groups of richard schrock and robert grubbs who shared the nobel prize in chemistry with yves chauvin for their discoveries the schrock catalysts are based on early transition metals such as mo they are more reactive but less tolerant
