and occur by facetoface overlap of dorbitals as in the ion recl the fact that the cl atoms are eclipsed in this anion is evidence of δ bonding figure the octachlorodirhenateiii anion recl which has a quadruple rere bond some possible σ top row π bottom row and δ bonding combinations right of s p and d orbitals are sketched below in each case we can make bonding or antibonding combinations depending on the signs of the ao wavefunctions because pπpπ bonding involves sideways overlap of porbitals it is most commonly observed with secondrow elements c n o πbonded compounds
