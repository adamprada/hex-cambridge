complexes in metal carbonyl complexes such as nico and moco there is sideways overlap between filled metal dorbitals and the empty πantibonding orbitals the lumo of the co molecule as shown in the figure below this interaction strengthens the metalcarbon bond but weakens the carbonoxygen bond the co infrared stretching frequency is diagnostic of the strength of the bond and can be used to estimate the degree to which electrons are transferred from the metal dorbital to the co πantibonding orbital the same kind of backbonding occurs with phosphine complexes which have empty π orbitals as shown at the right
