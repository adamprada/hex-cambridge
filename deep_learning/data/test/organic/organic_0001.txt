possibilities would be to see if they both have the same solubility in water or other solvents and whether they give the same reaction products with various reagents of course all this gets a bit tough when the compounds are not pure and no good ways are available to purify them but that is part of the job think about how you might proceed in retrospect it is surprising that in less than fifty years an enormous even if incomplete edifice of structural organic chemistry was constructed on the basis of the results of chemical reactions without determination of a
