this also as a valid idea furthermore when modern tools for determining organic structures that involve actually measuring the distances between the atoms became available these provided great convenience but no great surprises to be sure a few structures turned out to be incorrect because they were based on faulty or inadequate experimental evidence but on the whole the modern threedimensional representations of molecules that accord with actual measurements of bond distances and angles are in no important respect different from the widely used threedimensional ballandstick models of organic molecules and these in essentially their present form date from at
