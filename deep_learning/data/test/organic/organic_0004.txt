formula of or a multiple thereof if we know that hydrogen gas is and has a molecular weight of we can compare the weight of a given volume of hydrogen with the weight of the same volume of our unknown in the gas phase at the same temperature and pressure if the experimental ratio of these weights turns out to be then the molecular weight of the unknown would be and the formula would be correct b valence if we assume that the molecule is held together by chemical bonds without knowing more we could write numerous structures such as
