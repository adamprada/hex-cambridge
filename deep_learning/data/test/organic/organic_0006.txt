other as are the s on the same carbon we therefore have a problem as to whether these two different formulas also represent different compounds d tetrahedral carbon a brilliant solution to the problem posed in the preceding section came in when j h vant hoff proposed that all four valences of carbon are equivalent and directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron if we redraw the structures for as we see that there is only one possible arrangement and contrary to the impression we got from our earlier structural formulas the bromine is equivalently located with respect to
