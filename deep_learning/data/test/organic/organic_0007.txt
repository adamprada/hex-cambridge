is a problem apparently first clearly recognized by paterno in we call these rotational or conformational isomers because one is converted to another by rotation of the halves of the molecule with respect to one another with the bond acting as an axle if this is not clear you should make a ballandstick model and see what rotation around the bond does to the relationships between the atoms on the carbons the difficulty presented by these possibilities finally was circumvented by a brilliant suggestion by vant hoff of free rotation which holds that isomers corresponding to different rotational angles such
