detail in chapters and f the substitution method for proof of structure the problem of determining whether a particular isomer of is could be solved today in a few minutes by spectroscopic means as will be explained in chapter however at the time structure theory was being developed the structure had to be deduced on the basis of chemical reactions which could include either how the compound was formed or what it could be converted to a virtually unassailable proof of structure where it is applicable is to determine how many different substitution products each of a given group of
