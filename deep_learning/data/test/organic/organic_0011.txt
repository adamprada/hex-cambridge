unequivocal proofs of structure use of chemical transformations for proofs of structure depends on the applicability of a simple guiding principle often called the principle of least structural change as we shall see later many exceptions are known and care is required to keep from making serious errors with this caution let us see how the principle may be applied the compound discussed in section a reacts slowly with water to give a product of formula the normal valence of oxygen is two and we can write two and only two different structures and for the principle of least structural
