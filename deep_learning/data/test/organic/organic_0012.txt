are broken and bonds are formed we could conceive of many other possible reactions of with for example which as indicated by does not occur but hardly can be ruled out by the principle of least structural change itself showing how the probability of such alternative reactions can be evaluated will be a very large part of our later discussions i reactivity saturation unsaturation and reaction mechanisms the substitution method and the interconversion reactions discussed for proof of structure possibly may give you erroneous ideas about the reactions and reactivity of organic compounds we certainly do not wish to imply
