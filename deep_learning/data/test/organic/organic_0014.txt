bromine the early organic chemists also used the terms unsaturated and saturated for this behavior and these terms are still in wide use today but we need to distinguish between unsaturated and reactive and between saturated and unreactive because these pairs of terms are not synonymous the equations for the reactions of ethene and ethane with bromine are different in that ethene adds bromine whereas ethane substitutes bromine you should reserve the term unsaturated for compounds that can at least potentially react by addition and saturated for compounds that can only be expected to react by substitution the difference between
