equations indicate in fact such equations are regarded best as chemical accounting operations the number of bonds is shown correctly for both the reactants and the products and there is an indication of which bonds break and which bonds are formed in the overall process however do not make the mistake of assuming that no other bonds are broken or made in intermediate stages of the reaction much of what comes later in this book will be concerned with what we know or can find out about the mechanisms of such reactions a reaction mechanism being the actual sequence of
