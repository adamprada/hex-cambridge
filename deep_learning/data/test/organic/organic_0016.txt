does occur although sluggishly obviously tetrachloroethene is unsaturated in the sense it can undergo addition even if it is unreactive to bromine in the absence of aluminum bromide the aluminum bromide functions in the addition of bromine to tetrachloroethene as a catalyst which is something that facilitates the conversion of reactants to products the study of the nature and uses of catalysts will concern us throughout this book catalysis is our principal means of controlling organic reactions to help form the product we want in the shortest possible time we will finesse here the long and important struggle of getting
