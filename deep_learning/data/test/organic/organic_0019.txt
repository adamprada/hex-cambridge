even though we may not know the absolute configuration the sign of rotation of planepolarized light by an enantiomer is not easily related to its configuration this is true even for substances with very similar structures thus given lactic acid with a specific rotation and methyl lactate with a specific rotation we cannot tell from the rotation alone whether the acid and ester have the same or a different arrangement of groups about the chiral center their relative configurations have to be obtained by other means if we convert lactic acid into its methyl ester we can be reasonably certain
