the absolute configuration of no optically active compound was known instead configurations were assigned relative to a standard glyceraldehyde which originally was chosen by e fischer around for the purpose of correlating the configuration of carbohydrates fischer arbitrarily assigned the configuration to dextrorotatory glyceraldehyde which was known as glyceraldehyde the levorotatory enantiomer is designated as glyceraldehyde if you are unsure of the terminology and or of the rules for writing fischer projection formulas review sections c and the configurations of many compounds besides sugars now have been related to glyceraldehyde including amino acids terpenes steroids and other biochemically important substances
