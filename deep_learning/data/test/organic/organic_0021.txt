tartrate the configuration of tartaric acid section previously had been shown by chemical means to be opposite to that of glyceraldehyde consequently the absolute configuration of any compound now is known once it has been correlated directly or indirectly with glyceraldehyde for example figure below whereby the configuration of lactic acid is related to the amino acid alanine because lactic acid has been related to glyceraldehyde it follows that the absolute configurations are lactic acid and alanine chemical transformation showing how the configuration of natural alanine has been related to lactic acid and hence to glyceraldehyde the transformations shown involve
