the highestnumbered chiral carbon is referred to glyceraldehyde to determine the overall configuration of the molecule for glucose this atom is next to the group and has the hydroxyl group on the right therefore naturally occurring glucose which has a rotation belongs to the series and is properly called glucose however the configurations of amino acids possessing more than one chiral carbon are determined by the lowestnumbered chiral carbon which is the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group thus even though the natural amino acid threonine has exactly the same kind of arrangement of substituents as the natural sugar threose
