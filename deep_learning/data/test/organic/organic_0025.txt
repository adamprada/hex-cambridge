moleculeat the same temperature cannot be used to establish the absolute configuration of an enantiomer this is because the sign of optical rotation for a particular enantiomer may change when the temperature changes the cahningoldprelog rules of priority are based on the atomic numbers of the atoms of interest for chirality the atoms of interest are the atoms bonded to the chiral carbon the atom with higher atomic number has higher priority i br cl s p f o n c h when comparing isotopes the atom with the higher mass number has higher priority o o or n n
