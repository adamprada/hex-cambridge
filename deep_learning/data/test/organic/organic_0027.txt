structure absolute configurations of perspective formulas chemists need a convenient way to distinguish one stereoisomer from another the cahningoldprelog system is a set of rules that allows us to unambiguously define the stereochemical configuration of any stereocenter using the designations r from the latin rectus meaning righthanded or s from the latin sinister meaning lefthanded the rules for this system of stereochemical nomenclature are on the surface fairly simple rules for assigning an rs designation to a chiral center assign priorities to the four substituents with being the highest priority and the lowest priorities are based on the atomic number
