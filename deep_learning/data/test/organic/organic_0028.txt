sugar glyceraldehyde as our first example the first thing that we must do is to assign a priority to each of the four substituents bound to the chiral center we first look at the atoms that are directly bonded to the chiral center these are h o in the hydroxyl c in the aldehyde and c in the choh group assigning rs configuration to glyceraldehyde two priorities are easy hydrogen with an atomic number of is the lowest priority and the hydroxyl oxygen with atomic number is priority carbon has an atomic number of which of the two c groups
