page thus step a from the procedure above applies then we trace a circle defined by the and priority groups in increasing order the circle is clockwise which by step a tells us that this carbon has the r configuration and that this molecule is rglyceraldehyde its enantiomer by definition must be sglyceraldehyde next lets look at one of the enantiomers of lactic acid and determine the configuration of the chiral center clearly h is the substituent and oh is owing to its three bonds to oxygen the carbon on the acid group takes priority and the methyl group takes
