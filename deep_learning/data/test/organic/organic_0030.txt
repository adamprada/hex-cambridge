defects in babies born to women who had taken it thalidomide contains a chiral center and thus exists in two enantiomeric forms it was marketed as a racemic mixture in other words a mixture of both enantiomers lets try to determine the stereochemical configuration of the enantiomer on the left of the four bonds to the chiral center the priority is hydrogen the nitrogen group is the carbonyl side of the ring is and the ch side of the ring is the hydrogen is shown pointing away from us and the prioritized substituents trace a clockwise circle this is the
