to exercises absolute configurations of fischer projections to determine the absolute configuration of a chiral center in a fisher projection use the following twostep procedure step assign priority numbers to the four ligands groups bonded to the chiral center using the cip priority system step vertical option if the lowest priority ligand is on a vertical bond then it is pointing away from the viewer trace the three highestpriority ligands starting at the highestpriority ligand ① ② ③ in the direction that will give a very correct answer in the compound below the movement is clockwise indicating an rconfiguration the
