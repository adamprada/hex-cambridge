a fischer projection restricts a threedimensional molecule into two dimensions consequently there are limitations as to the operations that can be performed on a fischer projection without changing the absolute configuration at chiral centers the operations that do not change the absolute configuration at a chiral center in a fischer projections can be summarized as two rules rule rotation of the fischer projection by ยบ in either direction without lifting it off the plane of the paper does not change the absolute configuration at the chiral center rule rotation of three ligands on the chiral center in either direction keeping
