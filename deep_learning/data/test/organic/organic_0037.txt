to water a protontransfer event acidbase reaction occurs to some extent notice the phrase to some extent this reaction does not run to completion with all of the acetic acid converted to acetate its conjugate base rather a dynamic equilibrium is reached with proton transfer going in both directions thus the twoway arrows and finite concentrations of all four species in play the nature of this equilibrium situation as you recall from general chemistry is expressed by an equilibrium constant k the equilibrium constant is actually a ratio of activities represented by the symbol but activities are rarely used in
