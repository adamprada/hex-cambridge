acetic acid acetate ion and hydronium ion are all solutes and so their activities are approximated with molarities the acid dissociation constant or ka for acetic acid is therefore defined as because dividing by does not change the value of the constant the is usually not written and ka is written as in more general terms the dissociation constant for a given acid is expressed as or equation applies to a neutral acid such as like hcl or acetic acid while equation applies to a cationic acid like ammonium nh the value of ka x for acetic acid is very
