acetic acid is the use of pka values allows us to express the acidity of common compounds and functional groups on a numerical scale of about very strong acid to not acidic at all table at the end of the text lists exact or approximate pka values for different types of protons that you are likely to encounter in your study of organic and biological chemistry looking at table you see that the pka of carboxylic acids are in the range the pka of sulfuric acid is and the pka of water is alkenes and alkanes which are not acidic
