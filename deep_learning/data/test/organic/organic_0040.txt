how much water our table of pka values will also allow us to compare the strengths of different bases by comparing the pka values of their conjugate acids the key idea to remember is this the stronger the conjugate acid the weaker the conjugate base sulfuric acid is the strongest acid on our list with a pka value of so hso is the weakest conjugate base you can see that hydroxide ion is a stronger base than ammonia nh because ammonium nh pka is a stronger acid than water pka the stronger the conjugate acid the weaker the conjugate base
