neighborhood of close to that of our reference compound phenol notice in this example that we need to evaluate the potential acidity at four different locations on the molecule aldehyde and aromatic protons are not at all acidic pka values are above not on our table the two protons on the carbon next to the carbonyl are slightly acidic with pka values around according to the table the most acidic proton is on the phenol group so if the compound were to be reacted with a single molar equivalent of strong base this is the proton that would be donated
