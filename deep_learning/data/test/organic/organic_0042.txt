compared to that of ethoxide ion chcho for example the relevant pka values to consider are the pka of ammonium ion and the pka of ethanol from these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base do not make the mistake of using the pka value of this is the pka of ammonia acting as an acid and tells you how basic the nh ion is very basic example acidic groups using the pka table estimate pka values for the most acidic group on the compounds below and draw the structure of the conjugate base that results when this
