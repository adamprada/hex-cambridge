the proton leads to the formation of an acetylide anion rcc the origin of the enhanced acidity can be attributed to the stability of the acetylide anion which has the unpaired electrons in an sp hybridized orbital the stability results from occupying an orbital with a high degree of sorbital character there is a strong correlation between scharacter in the orbital containing the nonbonding electrons in the anion and the acidity of hydrocarbons the enhanced acidity with greater scharacter occurs despite the fact that the homolytic ch bde is larger table akynes compound conjugate base hybridization s character pka ch
