both protonation and deprotonation between alcohols and water alcohols can be considered alkylated water and share many similarities in both physical properties and chemical reactivity yes very well there is a difference of pka units between the pka of water and the pka of acetic acid the equilibrium lies well to the right with acetate as the predominate form of the original acetic acid no hardly at all the hydroxide ion is too weak a base to remove a proton from acetylene the equilibrium lies so far to the left that it is considered a no reaction contributors and attributions
