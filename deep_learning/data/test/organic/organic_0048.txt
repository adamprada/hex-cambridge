in aqueous solutions acids and bases can be defined in terms of the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base thus for every acidic species in an aqueous solution there exists a species derived from the acid by the loss of a proton these two species that differ by only a proton constitute a conjugate acidbase pair for example in the reaction of hcl with water shown below hcl the parent acid donates a proton to a water molecule the parent base thereby forming cl thus hcl and cl constitute a conjugate acidbase pair by convention we
