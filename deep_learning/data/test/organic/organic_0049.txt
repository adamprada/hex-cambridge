is the acid that donates a proton to the acetate ion which acts as the base once again we have two conjugate acidbase pairs the parent acid and its conjugate base chcohchco and the parent base and its conjugate acid hoho in the reaction of ammonia with water to give ammonium ions and hydroxide ions ammonia acts as a base by accepting a proton from a water molecule which in this case means that water is acting as an acid in the reverse reaction an ammonium ion acts as an acid by donating a proton to a hydroxide ion and
