a proton it is the brønstedlowry base the ho molecule because it donates a proton is the brønstedlowry acid example identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium solution one pair is ho and oh where ho has one more h and is the conjugate acid while oh has one less h and is the conjugate base the other pair consists of chn and chnh where chnh is the conjugate acid it has an additional proton and chn is the conjugate base some common conjugate acidbase pairs are shown in figure the strongest acids are at the bottom left and
