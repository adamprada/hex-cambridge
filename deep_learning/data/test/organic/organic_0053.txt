electronpair flow from lewis base to lewis acid is shown using curved arrows much like those used for resonance structures in section curved arrows always mean that an electron pair moves from the atom at the tail of the arrow to the atom at the head of the arrow in this case the lone pair on the lewis base attacks the lewis acid forming a bond this new type of electron pair movement along with those described in section will be used throughout this text to describe electron flow during reactions lewis acid a species that accepts an electron pair
