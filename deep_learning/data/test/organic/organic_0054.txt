pair elections are contained in an sp hybrid orbital making it a lewis base these two orbitals overlap creating a covalent bond in a boron trifluoridetrimethylamine complex the movement of electrons during this interaction is show by by an arrow positive ions are often lewis acids because they have an electrostatic attraction for electron donors examples include alkali and alkaline earth metals in the group ia and iia columns k mg and ca are sometimes seen as lewis acidic sites in biology for example these ions are very stable forms of these elements because of their low electron ionization potentials
