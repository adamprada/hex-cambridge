in their valence shell transition metals such as titanium iron and nickel may have up to eighteen electrons and can frequently accept electron pairs from lewis bases transition metals are often lewis acids for example titanium has four valence electrons and can form four bonds in compounds such as titanium tetrakis isopropoxide below or titanium tetrachloride ticl however the titanium atom in that compound has only eight valence electrons not eighteen it can easily accept electrons from donors figure although titanium has eight electrons in this molecule titanium tetrakisisopropoxide it can accommodate up to eighteen it is a lewis acid
