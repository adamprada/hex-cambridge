a proton if an electron is removed to make a cation a proton is all that is left a proton is a lewis acid for a number of reasons it has a positive charge and so it will attract electrons which are negative also it lacks the electron configuration of its noble gas neighbor helium helium has two electrons if a lewis base or nucleophile donates a pair of electrons to a proton the proton will obtain a helium noble gas configuration figure proton reacting as a lewis acid there is something about hydrogen cations that is not so simple
