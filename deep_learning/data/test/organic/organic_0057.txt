and forming a bond we have one lewis base replacing another at a proton two specific movements of electrons are shown in the reaction both of which are show by arrows lone pair electrons on oxygen attack the hydrogen to form an oh bond in the product also the electrons of the hcl bond move to become a lone pair on chlorine as the hcl bond breaks these two arrows together are said to represent the mechanism of this acidbase reaction lewis bases what makes a molecule or an atom or ion a lewis base it must have a pair
