containing compounds can act as lewis bases note ammonia ammonia nh has a lone pair and is a lewis base it can donate to compounds that will accept electrons ammonia donating to an electron acceptor or lewis acid not all compounds can act as a lewis base for example methane ch has all of its valence electrons in bonding pairs these bonding pairs are too stable to donate under normal conditions therefore methane is not a lewis base neutral boron compounds also have all electrons in bonding pairs for example borane bh has no lone pairs all its valence electrons
