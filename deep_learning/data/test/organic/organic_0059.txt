valence electrons so there are two lone pairs available e yes this ion has lone pairs available lewis acidbase complexes what happens when a lewis base donates a pair of electrons to a lewis acid the electron pushing formalism arrows we have been using to illustrate the behavior of lewis acids and lewis bases is meant to show the direction of electron movement from the donor to the acceptor however given that a bond can be thought of as a pair of electrons that are shared between two atoms in this case between the donor and the acceptor these arrows
