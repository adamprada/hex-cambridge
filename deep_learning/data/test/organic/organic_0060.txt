coordination complex together figure formation of a lewis acidbase complex from ammonia and boron trifluoride when the nitrogen donates a pair of electrons to share with the boron the bond that forms is sometimes called a coordinate bond a coordinate bond is any covalent bond that arose because one atom brought a pair of its electrons and donated them to another in organic chemistry terminology the electron donor is called a nucleophile and the electron acceptor is called an electrophile ammonia is a nucleophile and boron trifluoride is an electrophile because lewis bases are attracted to electrondeficient atoms and because
