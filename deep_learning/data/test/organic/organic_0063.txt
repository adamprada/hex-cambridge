point for the enzymes substrates substrate is the term that biochemists use for a reactant molecule in an enzymecatalyzed reaction it is inside the active site pocket that enzymatic catalysis occurs shown below is an image of the glycolytic enzyme fructosebisphosphate aldolase with its substrate bound inside the active site pocket when the substrate binds to the active site a large number of noncovalent interactions form with the amino acid residues that line the active site the shape of the active site and the enzymesubstrate interactions that form as a result of substrate binding are specific to the substrateenzyme pair
