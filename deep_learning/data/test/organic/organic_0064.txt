grey for carbon red for oxygen blue for nitrogen and orange for phosphorus below is a twodimensional picture of the substrate colored red surrounded by hydrogenbonding active site amino acids notice that both main chain and side chain groups contribute to hydrogen bonding in this figure main chain hbonding groups are colored blue and side chain hbonding groups are colored green looking at the last three images should give you some appreciation for the specific manner in which a substrate fits inside its active site transition state stabilization one of the most important ways that an enzyme catalyzes any given
