in solution the likelihood of this occurring is very small the entropy of the system is simply too high in other words this reaction takes place very slowly without the help of a catalyst heres where the enzymes active site pocket comes into play it is lined with various functional groups from the amino acid main and side chains and has a very specific threedimensional architecture that has evolved to bind to both of the substrates if the sam molecule for example diffuses into the active site it can replace its favorable interactions with the surrounding water molecules with even
