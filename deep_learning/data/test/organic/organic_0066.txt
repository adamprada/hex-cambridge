active site because in this case the second substrate is a small segment of a long dna molecule the dnabinding region of the active site is more of a groove than a pocket so now we have both substrates bound in the active site but they are not just bound in any random orientation they are specifically positioned relative to one another so that the nucleophilic nitrogen is held very close to the electrophilic carbon with a free path of attack what used to be a very disordered situation two reactants diffusing freely in solution is now a very highly
