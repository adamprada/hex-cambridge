interactions are not strong rather that enzymets interactions are far stronger often by several orders of magnitude think about it this way if an enzyme were to bind to and stabilize its substrates more tightly than it bound to and stabilized the transition state it would actually slow down the reaction because it would be increasing the energy difference between starting state and transition state the enzyme has evolved to maximize favorable noncovalent interactions to the transition state in our example this is the state in which the nucleophilic nitrogen is already beginning to attack the electrophilic carbon and the
