below that the main chain carbonyl of an active site proline forms a hydrogen bond with the amine which also has the effect of increasing the nitrogens electron density and thus its nucleophilicity nucleic acids res how does our picture of enzyme catalysis apply to multistep reaction mechanisms although the twostep nucleophilic substitution reaction between tertbutyl chloride and hydroxide section c is not a biologically relevant process lets pretend just for the sake of illustration that there is a hypothetical enzyme that catalyzes this reaction the same basic principles apply here the enzyme binds best to the transition state but
