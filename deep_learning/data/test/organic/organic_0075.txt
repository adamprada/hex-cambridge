needed to prepare a given substituted cyclopropane by addition of a carbene to a double bond identify the substituted cyclopropane formed from the reaction of a given alkene with the reagents necessary to form a carbene key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below carbene rc carbenoid simmonssmith reaction stereospecific study notes a carbenoid is best considered to be a reagent which while not actually a carbene behaves as if it were an intermediate of this type dichlorocarbenes can also form cyclopropane structures and are created in situ from reagents such as
