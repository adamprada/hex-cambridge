the formula of carbenes are referred to as carbenoids introduction carbenes were once only thought of as short lived intermediates the reactions of this section only deal with these short lived carbenes which are mostly prepared in situ in conjunction with the main reaction however there do exist so called persistent carbenes these persistent carbenes are stabilized by a variety of methods often including aromatic rings or transition metals in general a carbene is neutral and has valence electrons of which are non bonding these electrons can either occupy the same sp hybridized orbital to form a singlet carbene with
