is generally carbene formation preparation of methylene the preparation of methylene starts with the yellow gas diazomethane chn diazomethane can be exposed to light heat or copper to facilitate the loss of nitrogen gas and the formation of the simplest carbene methylene the process is driven by the formation of the nitrogen gas which is a very stable molecule carbene reaction with alkenes a carbene such as methlyene will react with an alkene which will break the double bond and result with a cyclopropane the reaction will usually leave stereochemistry of the double bond unchanged as stated before carbenes are
