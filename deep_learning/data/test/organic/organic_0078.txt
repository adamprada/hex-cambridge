place of the hydrogen atoms carbenoids are substances that form cyclopropanes like carbenes but are not technically carbenes one common example is the stereospecific simmonsmith reaction which utilizes the carbenoid ichzni the carbenoid is formed in situ via the mixing of a zncu couple with chisince this reacts thesame as a carbene the same methods can be applied to determine the product an example of this is given as problem outside links httpenwikipediaorgwikisimmonssmithreaction httpenwikipediaorgwikicarbene problems knowing that cycloalkenes react much the same as regular alkenes what would be the expected structure of the product of cyclohexene and diazomethane facilitated by
