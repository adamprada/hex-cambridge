bond this interaction induces a dipole moment in the halogen molecule bond allowing one of the halogens to gain a partial positive charge and take the role of electrophile the nucleophilic pi electrons form a bond to the electrophilic halogen while the halogen molecular bond heterolytically breaks to release bromide as a leaving group the halogen addition is not regioselective but stereoselective stereochemistry of this addition is analogous to the oxymercuration mechanism in this reaction a bromonium halogenium ion froms as the intermediate the bromonium ion formation stabilizes the positive charge and prevents carbocation rearrangement in the second step the
