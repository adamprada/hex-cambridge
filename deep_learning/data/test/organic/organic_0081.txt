any carbon from the opposite side of the cycle it creates a mixture of steric productsoptically inactive starting material produce optically inactive achiral products meso or a racemic mixture electrophilic addition mechanism consists of two steps before constructing the mechanism let us summarize conditions for this reaction we will use br in our example for halogenation of ethylene halogens can act as electrophiles due to polarizability of their covalent bond addition of halogens is stereospecific and produces vicinial dihalides with antiaddition cis starting materials will give a mixture of enantiomers and trans starting materials produce a meso compound nucleophile pi
