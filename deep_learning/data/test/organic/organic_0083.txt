what happens if you add the hydrogen to the carbon atom at the righthand end of the double bond and the chlorine to the lefthand end you would still have the same product the chlorine would be on a carbon atom next to the end of the chain you would simply have drawn the molecule flipped over in space that would be different of the alkene was unsymmetrical thats why we have to look at them separately mechanism the addition of hydrogen halides is one of the easiest electrophilic addition reactions because it uses the simplest electrophile the proton hydrogen
