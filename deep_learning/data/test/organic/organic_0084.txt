a good nucleophile is used mechanism of electrophilic addition of hydrogen chloride to butene all of the halides hbr hcl hi hf can participate in this reaction and add on in the same manner although different halides do have different rates of reaction due to the hx bond getting weaker as x gets larger poor overlap of orbitalss reaction rates variation of rates when you change the halogen reaction rates increase in the order hf hcl hbr hi hydrogen fluoride reacts much more slowly than the other three and is normally ignored in talking about these reactions when the hydrogen
