solution in closed form is known or foreseeable the calculations are formidable because account must be taken of several factors the attractive forces between the electrons and the nuclei the interelectronic repulsions between individual electrons the internuclear repulsions and the electron spins the success of any given ab initio method usually is judged by how well it reproduces known molecular properties with considerable premium for use of tolerable amounts of computer time unfortunately many ab initio calculations do not start from a readily visualized physical model and hence give numbers that although agreeing well with experiment cannot be used to
