capable of increasing our ability to predict the properties of complex molecules one very successful ab initio procedure called the generalized valencebond gvb method avoids specific hybridization assignments for the orbitals and calculates an optimum set of orbitals to give the most stable possible electronic configuration for the specified positions of the atomic nuclei each chemical bond in the gvb method involves two electrons with paired spins in two more or less localized atomic orbitals one on each atom thus the bonds correspond rather closely to the qualitative formulations used previously in this chapter for example figure the generalized valencebond
