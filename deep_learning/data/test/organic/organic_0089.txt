the nucleus the regions of equalelectron amplitude for like orbitals middleright of figure surround the nuclei as a set of concentric shells corresponding to the surfaces of the layers of an onion figure with the like orbitals the amplitude is zero at the nucleus of the atom to which the orbital belongs figure generalized valencebond orbitals calculated for ethene by the ab initio method the nuclei are located in the plane of the coordinate system at the positions indicated by crosses the long dashes correspond to locations of change of phase the dotted lines are contour lines of electron amplitude
