be measured by appropriate experiments looking down on ethene we see at the top of figure two identical bonding orbitals one on each carbon directed toward each other the long dashed lines divide the space around the atom into regions of opposite orbital phase solid is positive and dotted is negative the contours for one of the bonding orbitals are in the middle of the figure and you will see that the orbital centered on the hydrogen is very much like an orbital while the one on the carbon is a hybrid orbital with considerable character there are three other
