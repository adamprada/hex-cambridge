shown in figure the important point is that the hybrid in figure is an atomic orbital calculated for a single electron on a single atom alone in space the gvb orbital is much more physically realistic because it is an orbital derived for a molecule with all of the nuclei and other electrons present nonetheless the general shape of the gvb like orbitals will be seen to correspond rather closely to the simple orbital in figure this should give us confidence in the qualitative use of our simple atomicorbital models contributors and attributions john d robert and marjorie c caserio
