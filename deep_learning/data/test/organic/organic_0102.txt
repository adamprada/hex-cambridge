this formula we can write a molecular formula for any alkane with a given number of carbon atoms for example an alkane with eight carbon atoms has the molecular formula ch ch molecular formulas alkanes are the simplest family of hydrocarbons compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only alkanes only contain carbonhydrogen bonds and carboncarbon single bonds the first six alkanes are as follows table molecular formulas for small alkanes methane ch ethane ch propane ch butane ch pentane ch hexane ch you can work out the formula of any of the alkanes using the general formula cnhn isomerism all of
