possible structure the four carbons can be drawn in a row to form butane or the can branch to form isobutane the two compounds have different propertiesfor example butane boils at c while isobutane boils at c butane isobutane likewise the molecular formula ch has three possible isomer the compound at the far left is pentane because it has all five carbon atoms in a continuous chain the compound in the middle is isopentane like isobutane it has a one ch branch off the second carbon atom of the continuous chain the compound at the far right discovered after the
