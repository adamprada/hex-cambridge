number of possible isomers also increases as shown in the table below table number of isomers for hydrocarbons molecular formula number of structural isomers ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch akanes can be represented in many different ways the figure below shows some of the different ways straightchain butane can be represented most often chemists refer to butane by the condensed structure chchchch or nch where n denotes a normal straight alkane note that many of these structures only imply bonding connections and do not indicate any particular geometry the bottom two structures
