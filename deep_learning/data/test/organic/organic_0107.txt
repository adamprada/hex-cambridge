to it already applying markovnikovs rule to the reaction above the hydrogen bonds with the ch group because the ch group has more hydrogens than the ch group notice that only the hydrogens directly attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond count regioselectivity a closer look if more than one reaction could occur between a set of reactants under the same conditions giving products that are constitutional isomers and if one product forms in greater amounts than the others the overall reaction is said to be regioselective say three reactions could occur between the hypothetical
