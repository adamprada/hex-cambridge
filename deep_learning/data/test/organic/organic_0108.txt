b is regioselective eg experimentally is the major product is the minor product thus the overall reaction between and hbr is regioselective toward if more than one reaction could occur between a set of reactants under the same conditions giving products that are constitutional isomers and if only one product is observed the overall reaction is said to be regioselective or regiospecific eg the only observed product is relative yields of and are and respectively thus the overall reaction between and hbr is regiospecific toward regiospecificity is merely the limiting case of regioselectivity all regiospecific reactions are regioselective but not
