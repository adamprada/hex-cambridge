parenthetically also hydrogen atoms that are bonded directly to the unsaturated carbon atoms of a double bond often are called vinyl hydrogens although the term alkenic hydrogens is more accurate and therefore preferable cycloalkenes are named by the system used for the openchain alkenes except that numbering always is started at one of the carbons of the double bond and continued around the ring through the double bond so as to keep the index numbers as small as possible when a hydrocarbon group is doublebonded to a single carbon of a cycloalkane ring the suffix ylidene as in alkylidene is
