that the molecular formula for ethene is ch whereas that for ethane is ch structure of ethene the simplest alkene ethene is not a very complicated molecule it is made up of four s hydrogen atoms and two s carbon atoms these carbon atoms already have four electrons but they each want to get four more so that they have a full eight in the valence shell having eight valence electrons around carbon gives the atom itself the same electron configuration as neon a noble gas carbon wants to have the same configuration as neon because when it has eight
