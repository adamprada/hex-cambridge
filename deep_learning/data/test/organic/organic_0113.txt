is made from one s orbital and two p orbitals when atoms are an hybrid they have a trigonal planar structure these structures are very similar to a peace sign there is a central atom with three atoms around it all on one plane trigonal planar molecules have an ideal bond angle of on each side the hch bond angle is which is very close to the ideal of a carbon with hybridization the other two angles hcc are both rigidity in ethene there is rigidity in the ethene molecule due to the doublebonded carbons a double bond consists of
