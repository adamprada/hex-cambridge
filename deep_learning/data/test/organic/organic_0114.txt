carboncarbon sigma bond the two carbon atoms of a double bond and the four atoms attached to them lie in a plane with bond angles of approximately as shownn in the figure below a the σbonded framework is formed by the overlap of two sets of singly occupied carbon sp hybrid orbitals and four singly occupied hydrogen s orbitals to form electronpair bonds this uses of the valence electrons to form a total of five σ bonds four ch bonds and one cc bond b one singly occupied unhybridized pz orbital remains on each carbon atom to form a carboncarbon
