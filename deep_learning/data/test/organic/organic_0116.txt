is required the hydroxyl group is protonated so that water is now the leaving group therefore the dehydration reaction of alcohols to generate alkene proceeds by heating the alcohols in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid at high temperatures the required reaction temperature range decreases with increasing substitution of the hydroxycontaining carbon alcohols c alcohols c alcohols c if the reaction is not sufficiently heated the alcohols do not dehydrate to form alkenes but react with one another to form ethers eg the williamson ether synthesis mechanism for the dehydration of alcohols different types
