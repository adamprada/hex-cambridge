of alcohols in dehydration reaction is ranked as the following methanol primary secondary tertiary primary alcohol dehydrates through the e mechanism oxygen donates two electrons to a proton from sulfuric acid hso forming an alkyloxonium ion the resulting conjugate base hso approaches in an anticoplanar orientation relative to the leaving group and reacts with one adjacent hydrogen while the alkyloxonium ion simultaneously leaves in a concerted process making a double bond secondary and tertiary alcohols and the e mechanism secondary and tertiary alcohols dehydrate through the e mechanism similarly to the reaction above secondary and tertiary oh protonate to form
