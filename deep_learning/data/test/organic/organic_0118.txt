thereore the trans diastereomer of the butene product is most abundant the dehydration mechanism for a tertiary alcohol is analogous to that shown above for a secondary alcohol the e elimination of ºalcohols under relatively nonacidic conditions may be accomplished by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride pocl in pyridine this procedure is also effective with hindered ºalcohols but for unhindered and ºalcohols an sn chloride ion substitution of the chlorophosphate intermediate competes with elimination examples of these and related reactions are given in the following figure the first equation shows the dehydration of a ºalcohol the predominance of the nonzaitsev product
