three factors the base strong bases favor the e mechanism whereas e mechanisms only require a weak base the solvent good ionizing xolvents polar protic favor the e mechanism by stabilizing the carbocation intermediate the alkyl halide primary alkyl halides have the only structure useful in distinguishing between the e and e pathways since primary carbocations do not form only the e mechanism is possible reaction parameter e e alkyl halide structure tertiary secondary primary tertiary secondary primary nucleophile high concentration of a strong base weak base mechanism step step rate limiting step anticoplanar bimolecular transition state carbocation formation rate
