with a given alkyl halide will result in substitution or elimination and draw the structure of the product formed in either case key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below alkylation study notes the alkylation of acetylide ions is important in organic synthesis because it is a reaction in which a new carboncarbon bond is formed hence it can be used when an organic chemist is trying to build a complicated molecule from much simpler starting materials the alkyl halide used in this reaction must be primary thus if you were asked
