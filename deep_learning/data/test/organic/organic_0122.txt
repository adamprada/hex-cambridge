will give elimination by the e mechanism nucleophilic addition of acetylides to carbonyls acetylide anions will add to aldehydes and ketones to form alkoxides which upon protonation give propargyl alcohols with aldehydes and nonsymmetric ketones in the absence of chiral catalyst the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers exercises the pka of ammonia is estimate the equilibrium constant for the deprotonation of pentyne by amide as shown above answers assuming the pka of pentyne is about then the difference in pkas is since pentyne is more acidic the formation of the acetylide will be favored at
