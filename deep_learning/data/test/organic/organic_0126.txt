halogens which contain only a few carbons the halogen is shown as bonded to the connection point of the alkyl group classification of carbon atoms carbons have a special terminology to describe how many other carbons they are attached to this allows for an easy description of branching in alkanes also we will find that the number of carbons attached to a given atom will have subtle effects on its chemistry primary carbons o attached to one other c atom secondary carbons o are attached to two other cs tertiary carbons o are attached to three other cs quaternary carbons
