p and an sphybrid orbital is s and p the greater the s character of the orbital the closer the electrons are to the nucleus thus in a cspceh bond the bonding electrons are closer to the carbon nucleus than they are in a cspceh bond in other words compared to a cspceh bond or a cspceh bond a cspceh bond is very slightly polar cδcehδ this slight polarity makes it easier for a base to remove a proton from a terminal alkyne than from a less polar or nonpolar alkene or alkane as you will appreciate the reaction between
