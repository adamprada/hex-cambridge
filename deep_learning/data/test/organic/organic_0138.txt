end of the double bond for example there are two ways of looking at the reasons for this both of which need you to know about the mechanism for the reactions alkenes react because the electrons in the pi bond attract things with any degree of positive charge anything which increases the electron density around the double bond will help this alkyl groups have a tendency to push electrons away from themselves towards the double bond the more alkyl groups you have the more negative the area around the double bonds becomes the more negatively charged that region becomes the
