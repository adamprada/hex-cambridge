conception of a multistep synthesis for the construction of a designated compound from a specified starting material becomes one of the most challenging problems that may be posed functional group reaction maps like the one below for alkenes can be helpful in designing multistep syntheses it can be helpful to build and design your own reaction maps for each functional group studied alkene reaction map please note the reagents for each chemical transformation have been intentionally omitted so that this map can be used as a study tool the answers are provided at the end of this section as part
