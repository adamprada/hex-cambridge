the retrosynthesis the ethylbromide must also be derived from acetylene so multiple reaction pathways are combined as shown below in the second example we are asked to synthesize dibromobutane from acetylene once again there is an increase in the carbon chain length indicating an acetylide sn reaction with an alkyl halide similar to the first example the hydrohalogenation can be subtle to discern because the hydrogen atoms are not shown in bondline structures comparing the chemical formulas of butyne with dibromobutane there is a difference of two h atoms and two br atoms indicating hydrohalogenation and not halogenation the addition
