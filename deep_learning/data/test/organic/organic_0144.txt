one important missing aspect of this reaction is a good leaving group lg alkanes are chemically quite boring we can burn them as fuel or perform freeradical halogenation to create alkyl halides with excellent leaving groups with these observations the following retrosynthesis is reasonable retrosynthesis working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each reaction for the initial freeradical halogenation of the alkane we have the option of chlorine cl or bromine br because methylcyclohexane has several different classifications of carbons the selectivity of br is more important than the faster reactivity of cl an strong base with heat can
