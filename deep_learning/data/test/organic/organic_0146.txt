assist you in designing such syntheses to achieve this objective you will need to have all of the reactions described in the course available in your memory you will need to recall some reactions much more frequently than others and the only way to master this objective is to practise the examples given in this chapter will be relatively simple but you will soon see that you can devise some quite sophisticated syntheses using a limited number of basic reactions the study of organic chemistry exposes a student to a wide range of interrelated reactions alkenes for example may be
