not that difficult to deduce if for example one is asked to prepare mesohexanediol from hexyne most students realize it will be necessary to reduce the alkyne to cis or transhexene before undertaking glycol formation permanaganate or osmium tetroxide hydroxylation of cishexene would form the desired meso isomer from transhexene it would be necessary to first epoxidize the alkene with a peracid followed by ring opening with hydroxide ion this example illustrates a common feature in synthesis often there is more than one effective procedure that leads to the desired product longer multistep syntheses require careful analysis and thought since
