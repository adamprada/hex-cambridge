in this case it should be apparent that cyclohexanol may be substituted for cyclohexanone since the latter could then be made by a simple oxidation also since cyclohexane and alkanes in general is relatively unreactive bromination or chlorination would seem to be an obvious first step at this point one is tempted to convert bromocyclohexane to cyclohexanol by an sn reaction with hydroxide ion this reaction would undoubtedly be accompanied by e elimination so it would be cleaner although one step longer to first make cyclohexene and then hydrate it by any of several methods eg oxymercuration and hydroboration including
