in the third problem are isomers but some kind of bondbreaking and bondmaking sequence is clearly necessary for this structural change to occur one possible procedure is shown above acidcatalyzed rearrangement of cyclohexene oxide followed by reduction might also serve the useful approach of working out syntheses starting from the target molecule and working backward toward simpler starting materials has been formalized by prof e j corey harvard and termed retrosynthetic analysis in this procedure the target molecule is transformed progressively into simpler structures by disconnecting selected carboncarbon bonds these disconnections rest on transforms which are the reverse of plausible
