while entirely reasonable do not fit well with a tertbutanol start likewise a cyclopentyl intermediate might provide an excellent route to the product in example but does not meet the specified conditions of the problem retrosynthetic analysis is especially useful when considering relatively complex molecules without starting material constraints if it is conducted without bias unusual and intriguing possibilities sometimes appear unfortunately molecular complexity composed of size functionality heteroatom incorporation cyclic connectivity and stereoisomerism generally leads to very large and extensively branched transform trees computer assisted analysis has proven helpful but in the end the instincts and experience of the
