arenes are cyclic unsaturated compounds that have such strikingly different chemical properties from conjugated alkenes polyenes that it is convenient to consider them as a separate class of hydrocarbon the simplest member is benzene which frequently is represented as a cyclic conjugated molecule of three single and three double carboncarbon bonds actually all the carboncarbon bonds are equivalent see chapter but it is convenient to represent the structure in the manner shown a variety of substituted benzenes are known that have one or more of the hydrogen atoms of the ring replaced with other atoms or groups in almost all
