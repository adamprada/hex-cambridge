position isomerism arises thus there are three possible isomeric disubstituted benzene derivatives according to whether the substituents have the or relationship the isomers commonly are designated as ortho meta and para or o m and p for the and isomers respectively the actual symmetry of the benzene ring is such that only one disubstitution product is found despite the fact that two would be predicted if benzene had the cyclohexatriene structure when the benzene ring carries different substituents we shall cite them in alphabetical order disregarding multiplying prefixes and assign their positions on the ring with the lowest possible numbers
