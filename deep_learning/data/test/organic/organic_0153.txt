structural isomers and stereoisomers geometric isomers key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below constitutional structural isomers stereoisomers different types of isomers vladsinger conformational isomers the cc single bonds in ethane propane and other alkanes are formed by the overlap of an sp hybrid orbital on one carbon atom with an sp hybrid orbital on another carbon atom forming a Ïƒ bond each sp hybrid orbital is cylindrically symmetrical all crosssections are circles resulting in a carboncarbon single bond that is also cylindrically symmetrical about the cc axis because rotation about the
