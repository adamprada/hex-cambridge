position of the oh group differs which leads to differences in their physical and chemical properties in the conversion of one structural isomer to another at least one bond must be broken and reformed at a different position in the molecule consider for example the following five structures represented by the formula ch of these structures a and d represent the same compound as do b and c no bonds have been broken and reformed the molecules are simply rotated about a vertical axis only threenpentane a and d methylbutane b and c and dimethylpropane eare structural isomers because no
