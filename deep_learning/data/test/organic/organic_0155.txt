the substituents are therefore rigidly locked into a particular spatial arrangement thus a carboncarbon multiple bond or in some cases a ring prevents one geometric isomer from being readily converted to the other the members of an isomeric pair are identified as either cis or trans and interconversion between the two forms requires breaking and reforming one or more bonds because their structural difference causes them to have different physical and chemical properties cis and trans isomers are actually two distinct chemical compounds stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different arrangements of atoms in space optical isomers are molecules whose
