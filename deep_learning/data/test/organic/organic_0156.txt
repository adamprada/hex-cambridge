on its mirror image as shown by the superimposed flasks in part b in figure figure chiral and achiral objects a objects that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are chiral such as the left and the right hand b the unmarked flask is achiral because it can be superimposed on its mirror image most chiral organic molecules have at least one carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups as occurs in the bromochlorofluoromethane molecule shown in part a in figure this carbon often designated by an asterisk in structural drawings is called a chiral center or
