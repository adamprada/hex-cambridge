references the energies of the hydrogenlike orbitals of various atoms were mentioned in chapter and in particular we showed a diagram of the most stable state of a carbon atom figure transfer of one of the electrons to the orbital requires excitation of the atom to a higher energy state and this can be achieved by absorption of electromagnetic radiation of the proper wavelength the usual way that such excitation occurs is by absorption of a single quantum of radiant energy and we can say that the absorption of this amount of energy corresponds to excitation of the atom from
