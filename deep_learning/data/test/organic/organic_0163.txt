the idea of a spectroscopic change being related to a change in energy associated with the absorption of a quantum of energy spectra are the result of searches for such absorptions over a range of wavelengths or frequencies if one determines and plots the degree of absorption by a monoatomic gas such as sodium vapor as a function of wavelength a series of very sharp absorption bands or lines are observed hence the name line spectra the lines are sharp because they correspond to specific changes in electronic configuration without complication from other possible energy changes see section for discussion
