their derivatives which have normal tetrahedral angles for the bonds to carbon can be formulated readily in terms of atomic orbitals with bonds to carbon an example is shown in figure which also shows how an atomicorbital model can be drawn in abbreviated style the lines in this drawing correspond to bonds and are labeled as with the overlapping orbitals of the bond or as with the overlapping orbitals of the bonds b atoms with unshared electron pairs many important molecules such as ammonia water and hydrogen fluoride have atoms with unshared pairs of electrons if we formulate each of
