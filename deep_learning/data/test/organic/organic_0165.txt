is too simple and has to be modified to take into account that the repulsion is more severe between pairs of unshared electrons than between electrons in bonding orbitals on the same atom this is because when a bond is formed between two nuclei the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons shrinks the orbitals available to the bonding electrons thereby reducing their electrostatic repulsion with other pairs the degree of repulsion between electron pairs diminishes in the sequence unshared pairs vs unshared pairs unshared pairs vs bonding pairs bonding pairs vs bonding pairs from this we expect that in
