will recall that to form two bonds to we had to promote an electron and change the electronic configuration to the valence configuration the situation with is different in that the oxygen ground state and valence state are the same this means we could form two figure overlap of the hydrogen orbitals with and orbitals centered on oxygen the orbitals are represented here with distorted shapes to make the drawing clearer equivalent bonds to oxygen using the and orbitals at an angle of figure now to explain why the bond angles are instead of we can say that the repulsion
