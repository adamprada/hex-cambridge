in water molecules uses orbitals that are and in its bonds and furthermore that the unshared pairs are in equivalent hybrid orbitals not one pair as and the other as each of the unshared electronpair orbitals of oxygen in water is calculated to be about and the results are hardly clearcut but the bonding orbitals are considerably closer to and than they are to we recommend that the bonding orbitals of nitrogen and oxygen be considered to be and the unshared pairs designated simply as an abbreviated atomic orbital model of methanol made on this basis is shown in figure
