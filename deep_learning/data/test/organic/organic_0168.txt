as arising from sidewise overlap of the two orbitals one on each carbon that are not utilized in making the hybrids sidewise overlap of orbitals is called overlap to distinguish it from the endwise overlap of the type we have discussed previously figure the resulting bond differs from the bond in that electron density is concentrated in the regions above and below the bond axis rather than along the bond axis figure the formulation of ethene formulations of ethene in this way suggests that it should be a planar molecule with angles of ethene is indeed planar but its angles
