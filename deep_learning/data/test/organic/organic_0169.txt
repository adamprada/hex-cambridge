derive a new set of overlapping orbitals for the double bond these orbitals are called tau bonding orbitals and can be represented by two bananashaped orbitals between the carbons figure the result is two completely equivalent bonds the model has the advantage of offering a striking parallel to ballandstick models whereas the model is of particular value as a basis for quantitative calculations as will be discussed in chapter figure formulation of ethene with bonds each orbital is considered to contain an electron pair using the model of double bonds we conclude that the twisted configuration shown in figure should
