the carbonhydrogen framework is built up through overlap of two hybrid orbitals one from each carbon atom to form a bond and overlap of the remaining orbitals with the orbital of two hydrogens to form bonds the remaining two carboncarbon bonds result through sidewise overlap of the pure orbitals as shown in figure this model fits well with the properties of the ethyne molecule being linear bond angles of also the bonds in ethyne are different from those in ethene or ethane as judged by their stretching and bending frequencies in the figure the formulation of ethyne infrared chapter their
