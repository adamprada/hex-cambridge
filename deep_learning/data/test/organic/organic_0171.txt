localized on atom a planar triangular molecule with three attached ligands at angles of is hybridized at atom a linear molecule with two ligands is hybridized at applying the converse of these rules one should be able to predict molecular geometry by making reasonable assumptions as to the state of hybridization for each atom in the molecule obviously in doing this we have to take account of unshared electron pairs prediction is easy if unshared pairs are absent thus four attached ligands as in or imply hybridization at the central atom and therefore a tetrahedral arrangement of ligands three ligands
