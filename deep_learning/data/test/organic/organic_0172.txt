result of the hypothetical processes and methane is tetrahedral with carbon bonding orbitals removal of gives which corresponds in electronic structure to and for the same reasons should have a pyramidal shape with nearly tetrahedral angles removal of from to give with six bonding electrons suggests a change to bonding orbitals for the carbon and planar geometry with angles of the radical presents a special problem we can think of it as being formed by the loss of from by adding an electron to planar or by removing an electron from pyramidal we can formulate with orbitals for the bonds
