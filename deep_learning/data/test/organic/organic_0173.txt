on eg and are expected to be and are tetrahedral by the same reasoning three electron pairs around one atom should seek a planar arrangement with angles to minimize electron repulsion accordingly species of the type which have no unshared pairs on eg and have this geometry with only two electron pairs the preferred arrangement is linear the bond angles of compounds with multiple bonds can be explained similarly for example in ethene the four electrons of the double bond occupy the region in space between the two carbon nuclei the situation at either carbon is rather like the case
