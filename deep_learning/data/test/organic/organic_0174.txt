the bond is polarized in the sense and the carbon then should have some of the character of thus the angles are expected to be greater than as in fact they are in chloromethane for example the angle is also we can explain on the basis of electron repulsions why the bond angle in phosphine is less than that in ammonia and the bond angle in is less than that in the important point is that phosphorus and sulfur are larger atoms than nitrogen and oxygen this means than the and bond angles can be about without bringing the hydrogens
