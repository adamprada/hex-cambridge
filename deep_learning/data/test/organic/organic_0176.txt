be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations the valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element before assigning the electrons of an atom into orbitals one must become familiar with the basic concepts of electron configurations every element on the periodic table consists of atoms which are composed of protons neutrons and
