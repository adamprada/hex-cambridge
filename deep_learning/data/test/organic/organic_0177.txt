given by the atomic number of the element orbitals on different energy levels are similar to each other but they occupy different areas in space the s orbital and s orbital both have the characteristics of an s orbital radial nodes spherical volume probabilities can only hold two electrons etc but as they are found in different energy levels they occupy different spaces around the nucleus each orbital can be represented by specific blocks on the periodic table the sblock is the region of the alkali metals including helium groups the dblock are the transition metals groups to the pblock
