no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers the first three n l and ml may be the same but the fourth quantum number must be different a single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons which must have opposing spins otherwise they would have the same four quantum numbers which is forbidden one electron is spin up ms and the other would spin down ms this tells us that each subshell has double the electrons per orbital the s subshell has orbital that can hold up to electrons the p subshell has orbitals that can hold
