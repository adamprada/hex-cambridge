s denoting helium visually this is be represented as as shown the s subshell can hold only two electrons and when filled the electrons have opposite spins hunds rule when assigning electrons in orbitals each electron will first fill all the orbitals with similar energy also referred to as degenerate before pairing with another electron in a halffilled orbital atoms at ground states tend to have as many unpaired electrons as possible when visualizing this processes think about how electrons are exhibiting the same behavior as the same poles on a magnet would if they came into contact as the
