at the element after nitrogen in the same period oxygen z its electron configuration is s s p for an atom oxygen has one more electron than nitrogen and as the orbitals are all half filled the electron must pair up occupation of orbitals electrons fill orbitals in a way to minimize the energy of the atom therefore the electrons in an atom fill the principal energy levels in order of increasing energy the electrons are getting farther from the nucleus the relative energy of the orbitals is shown in figure figure the relative potential energy of atomic orbitals the
