of shielding and penetration effects consequently the electron configuration of potassium which begins the fourth period is ars and the configuration of calcium is ars five d orbitals are filled by the next elements the transition metals followed by three p orbitals notice that the last member of this row is the noble gas krypton z arsdp kr which has filled s d and p orbitals the fifth row of the periodic table is essentially the same as the fourth except that the s d and p orbitals are filled sequentially figure predicting the order in which orbitals are filled
