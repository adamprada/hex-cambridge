generally not useful for transition metals instead the modified d electron count method is used except for helium which has only two valence electrons the electron configuration of an element is the arrangement of its electrons in its atomic orbitals by knowing the electron configuration of an element we can predict and explain a great deal of its chemistry example draw an orbital diagram and use it to derive the electron configuration of phosphorus z what is its valence electron configuration given atomic number asked for orbital diagram and valence electron configuration for phosphorus strategy locate the nearest noble gas
