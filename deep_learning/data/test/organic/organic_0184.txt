periodic table we know that it has a ne closed shell with electrons we begin by subtracting electrons from the in phosphorus b the additional five electrons are placed in the next available orbitals which figure tells us are the s and p orbitals because the s orbital is lower in energy than the p orbitals we fill it first hunds rule tells us that the remaining three electrons will occupy the degenerate p orbitals separately but with their spins aligned the electron configuration is nesp c we obtain the valence electron configuration by ignoring the inner orbitals which for
