noble gas radon z xesfdp rn in the last row the f orbitals are filled between the s and the d orbitals which gives the actinide elements because the large number of protons makes their nuclei unstable all the actinides are radioactive example write the electron configuration of mercury z showing all the inner orbitals given atomic number asked for complete electron configuration strategy using the orbital diagram in figure and the periodic table as a guide fill the orbitals until all electrons have been placed solution by placing the electrons in orbitals following the order shown in figure and
