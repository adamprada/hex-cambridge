pauli principle and a knowledge of orbital energies obtained using hydrogenlike orbitals it is possible to construct the periodic table by filling up the available orbitals beginning with the lowestenergy orbitals the aufbau principle which gives rise to a particular arrangement of electrons for each element its electron configuration hunds rule says that the lowestenergy arrangement of electrons is the one that places them in degenerate orbitals with their spins parallel for chemical purposes the most important electrons are those in the outermost principal shell the valence electrons exercises write the electron configuration for carbon and draw the orbital diagram
