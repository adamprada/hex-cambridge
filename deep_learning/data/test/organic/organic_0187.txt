completing this section you should be able to describe the physical significance of an orbital list the atomic orbitals from s to d in order of increasing energy sketch the shapes of s and p orbitals key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below nodal plane node orbital quantum mechanics wave function for a refresher on quantum numbers view this text atomic orbitals an orbital is the quantum mechanical refinement of bohrs orbit in contrast to his concept of a simple circular orbit with a fixed radius orbitals are mathematically derived regions
