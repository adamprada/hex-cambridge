decreases steadily with increasing distance at very large values of r the electron probability density is very small but not zero in contrast we can calculate the radial probability the probability of finding a s electron at a distance r from the nucleus by adding together the probabilities of an electron being at all points on a series of x spherical shells of radius r r r rx rx in effect we are dividing the atom into very thin concentric shells much like the layers of an onion part a in figure and calculating the probability of finding an electron
