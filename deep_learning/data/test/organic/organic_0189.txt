very small the surface area of a spherical shell is so small that the total probability of finding an electron close to the nucleus is very low at the nucleus the electron probability vanishes part d in figure figure most probable radius for the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom a imagine dividing the atoms total volume into very thin concentric shells as shown in the onion drawing b a plot of electron probability density Ïˆ versus r shows that the electron probability density is greatest at r and falls off smoothly with increasing r the density
