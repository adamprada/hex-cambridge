is exactly the radius predicted by bohrs model of the hydrogen atom for the hydrogen atom the peak in the radial probability plot occurs at r å pm which is exactly the radius calculated by bohr for the n orbit thus the most probable radius obtained from quantum mechanics is identical to the radius calculated by classical mechanics in bohrs model however the electron was assumed to be at this distance of the time whereas in the quantum mechanical schrödinger model it is at this distance only some of the time the difference between the two models is attributable to
