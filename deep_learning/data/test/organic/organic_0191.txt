for the s s and s orbitals of the hydrogen atom a the electron probability density in any plane that contains the nucleus is shown note the presence of circular regions or nodes where the probability density is zero b contour surfaces enclose of the electron probability which illustrates the different sizes of the s s and s orbitals the cutaway drawings give partial views of the internal spherical nodes the orange color corresponds to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is positive and the blue color corresponds to regions of space where the phase of
