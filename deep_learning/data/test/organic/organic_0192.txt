s orbitals also become higher in energy as n increases because of their increased distance from the nucleus orbitals are generally drawn as threedimensional surfaces that enclose of the electron density as was shown for the hydrogen s s and s orbitals in part b in figure although such drawings show the relative sizes of the orbitals they do not normally show the spherical nodes in the s and s orbitals because the spherical nodes lie inside the surface fortunately the positions of the spherical nodes are not important for chemical bonding p orbitals only s orbitals are spherically symmetrical
