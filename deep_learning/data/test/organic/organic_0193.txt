plane ie the xy plane is a nodal plane it is a pz orbital as shown in figure the other two p orbitals have identical shapes but they lie along the x axis px and y axis py respectively note that each p orbital has just one nodal plane in each case the phase of the wave function for each of the p orbitals is positive for the lobe that points along the positive axis and negative for the lobe that points along the negative axis it is important to emphasize that these signs correspond to the phase of the
