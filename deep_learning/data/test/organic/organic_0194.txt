the size and complexity of the p orbitals for any atom increase as the principal quantum number n increases the shapes of the probability surfaces of the p p and higherenergy p orbitals are however essentially the same as those shown in figure the electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by
