on a line in a d coordinate system this orbial has one node so it is a p orbital and it is orientated on the z axis so it is a pz orbial s as the n value of an orbital inreases its distance from the nucleus also increases s as the n value of an orbital decreases the electrons in the orbial come closer to the nucleus this makes the orbital lower in energy l is equal to for all p orbitals q label the following orbitals answer s s pz contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor
