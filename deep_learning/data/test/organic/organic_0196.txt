a series of elegant experiments carried out between and the most notable of these achievements was ernest rutherfords famous alpharay scattering experiment which established that almost all of the mass of an atom is contained within a tiny and therefore extremely dense nucleus which carries a positive electric charge whose value identifies each element and is known as the atomic number of the element almost all of the volume of an atom consists of empty space in which electrons the fundamental carriers of negative electric charge reside the extremely small mass of the electron th the mass of the hydrogen
