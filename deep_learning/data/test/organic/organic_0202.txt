neutrons are called isotopes all isotopes of an element have the same number of protons and electrons which means they exhibit the same chemistry the isotopes of an element differ only in their atomic mass which is given by the mass number a the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons carbon isotopes the element carbon c has an atomic number of which means that all neutral carbon atoms contain protons and electrons in a typical sample of carboncontaining material of the carbon atoms also contain neutrons so each has a mass number of an isotope of any element
