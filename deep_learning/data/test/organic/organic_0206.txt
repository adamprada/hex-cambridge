the symmetry axis of the ring in the figure above the equatorial hydrogens are colored blue and the axial hydrogens are black since there are two equivalent chair conformations of cyclohexane in rapid equilibrium all twelve hydrogens have equatorial and axial character how to draw axial and equatorial bonds how not to draw the chair aside from drawing the basic chair the key points are axial bonds alternate up and down and are shown vertical equatorial groups are approximately horizontal but actually somewhat distorted from that slightly up or slightly down so that the angle from the axial group is
