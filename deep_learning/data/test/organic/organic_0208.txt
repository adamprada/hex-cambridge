following please indicate if the substituents are in the axial or equatorial positions solution due to the large number of bonds in cyclohexane it is common to only draw in the relevant ones leaving off the hydrogens unless they are involved in a reaction or are important for analysis it is still possible to determine axial and equatorial positioning with some thought with problems such as this it is important to remember that each carbon in a cyclohexane ring has one axial and one equatorial bond also remember that axial bonds are perpendicular with the ring and appear to be
