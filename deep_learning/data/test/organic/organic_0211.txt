for designating stereochemistry which deal with looking at the groups attached to a chiral center and assigning priority based on atomic number however carvones chiral center actually has three carbons attached to it they all have the same atomic number we need a new rule to break the tie if two substituent groups have the same atomic number go one bond further to the next atom if there is a difference among the second tier of atoms stop the group in which you have encountered a higher atomic number gets the highest priority if there is not a clear difference
