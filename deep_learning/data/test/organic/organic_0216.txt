flavindependent reactions flavin coenzymes like their nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad counterparts can act as hydride acceptors and donors in these redox reactions two electrons are transferred together in the form of a hydride ion flavin however is also capable of mediating chemical steps in which a single unpaired electron is transferred in other words radical chemistry this is due to the ability of the flavin system to form a stabilized radical intermediate called a semiquinone formed when fadh or fmnh donates a single electron or when fad or fmn accepts a single electron this singleelectron transfer capability of flavins is
