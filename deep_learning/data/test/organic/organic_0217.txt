as well as twoelectron chemistry the relevant mechanisms of flavoenzymecatalyzed reactions are often more difficult to determine recall the dehydrogenation reaction catalyzed by acylcoa dehydrogenase section c it involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons ie a hydrogen molecule to fad both electrons could be transferred together with the fad coenzyme simply acting as a hydride acceptor this is the mechanism we considered previously however because the oxidizing coenzyme being used is fad rather than nad it is also possible that the reaction could proceed by a singleelectron radical intermediate process in the alternate radical mechanism proposed below
