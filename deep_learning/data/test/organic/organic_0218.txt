relevant mechanism this could simply be a conjugated e reaction with formation of an allylic carbocation intermediate the question plaguing researchers studying this enzyme however is why fadh is required this is not a redox reaction and correspondingly fadh is not used up in the course of the transformation it just needs to be bound in the active site in order for the reaction to proceed given that flavins generally participate in singleelectron chemistry this is an indication that radical intermediates may be involved recently an alternative mechanism involving a flavin semiquinone intermediate has been proposed j biol chem notice
