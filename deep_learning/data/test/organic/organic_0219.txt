models represent two possible mechanistic extremes and actual enzymatic elimination reactions may fall somewhere in between in an ee hybrid elimination for example cβx bond cleavage may be quite advanced but not complete before proton abstraction takes place this would lead to the buildup of transient partial positive charge on cβ but a discreet carbocation intermediate would not form the extent to which partial positive charge builds up determines whether we refer to the mechanism as elike or elike a reaction in the histidine biosynthetic pathway provides a good example of a biological elike elimination step were looking specifically here
