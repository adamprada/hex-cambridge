intermediate in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids experimental evidence indicates that significant positive charge probably builds up on cÎ² of the starting compound implying that co bond cleavage is advanced before proton abstraction occurs notice the parallels to the cope elimination in the previous section the very next step in the aromatic acid biosynthesis pathway is also an elimination this time a conjugated elimination rather than a simple betaelimination an elike mechanism as illustrated above has been proposed for this step but other evidence suggests that a freeradical mechanism may be involved while most e and e reactions involve
