common leaving groups in biochemical reactions are phosphates water alcohols and thiols in many cases the leaving group is protonated by an acidic group on the enzyme as bondbreaking occurs for example hydroxide ion itself seldom acts as a leaving group it is simply too high in energy too basic rather the hydroxide oxygen is generally protonated by an enzymatic acid before or during the bondbreaking event resulting in a very stable water leaving group more often however the hydroxyl group of an alcohol is first converted enzymatically to a phosphate ester in order to create a better leaving group
