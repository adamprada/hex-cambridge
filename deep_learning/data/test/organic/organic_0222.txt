a nucleophilic substitution reaction sam methyltransferases some of the most important examples of sn reactions in biochemistry are those catalyzed by sadenosyl methionine sam dependent methyltransferase enzymes we have already seen in chapter and again in chapter how a methyl group is transferred in an sn reaction from sam to the amine group on the nucleotide base adenosine nucleic acids res another samdependent methylation reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called catecholomethyltransferase the substrate here is epinephrine also known as adrenaline notice that in this example the attacking nucleophile is an alcohol rather than an amine thats why the enzyme
