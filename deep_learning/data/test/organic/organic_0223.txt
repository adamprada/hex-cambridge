stable sulfide all in all in both reactions we have a reasonably good nucleophile an electronpoor unhindered electrophile and an excellent leaving group because the electrophilic carbon in these reactions is a methyl carbon a stepwise snlike mechanism is extremely unlikely a methyl carbocation is very high in energy and thus is not a reasonable intermediate to propose we can confidently predict that this reaction is sn does this sn reaction occur as expected with inversion of stereochemistry of course the electrophilic methyl carbon in these reactions is achiral so inversion is not apparent to demonstrate inversion the following experiment
