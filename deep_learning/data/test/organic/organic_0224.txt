molecules we assume that a covalent chemical bond between two atoms involves sharing a pair of elections one from each atom figure shows how atomic orbitals can be considered to be used in bond formation here we postulate that a single bond is formed by the pulling together of two atomic nuclei by attractive forces exerted by the nuclei for the two paired electrons in overlapping atomic orbitals because two atomic orbitals can hold a maximum of four electrons it is reasonable to ask why it is that two rather than one three or four electrons normally are involved in
