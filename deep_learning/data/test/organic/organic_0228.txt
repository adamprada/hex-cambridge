ammonium ion and the hydroxide ion are products what has happened in this reaction is that the original water molecule has donated a hydrogen ion to the original ammonia molecule which in turn has accepted the hydrogen ion we can illustrate this as follows because the water molecule donates a hydrogen ion to the ammonia it is the brønstedlowry acid while the ammonia moleculewhich accepts the hydrogen ionis the brønstedlowry base thus ammonia acts as a base in both the arrhenius sense and the brønstedlowry sense is an arrhenius acid like hydrochloric acid still an acid in the brønstedlowry sense
