there are no bare protons floating around in solution rather these protons are actually attached to solvent molecules the hydronium ion a proton in aqueous solution may be surrounded by more than one water molecule leading to formulas like or rather than it is simpler however to use to represent the hydronium ion with this in mind how do we define hcl as an acid in the br√∏nstedlowry sense consider what happens when hcl is dissolved in ho we can depict this process using lewis electron dot diagrams now we see that a hydrogen ion is transferred from the hcl
