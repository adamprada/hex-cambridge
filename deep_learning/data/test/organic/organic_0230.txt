base in this circumstance a brønstedlowry acid is a proton hydrogen ion donor a brønstedlowry base is a proton hydrogen ion acceptor all arrhenius acids and bases are brønstedlowry acids and bases as well however not all brønstedlowry acids and bases are arrhenius acids and bases example aniline chnh is slightly soluble in water it has a nitrogen atom that can accept a hydrogen ion from a water molecule just like the nitrogen atom in ammonia does write the chemical equation for this reaction and identify the brønstedlowry acid and base solution chnh and ho are the reactants when chnh
