and because they are bronstedlowry acids they all give away protons in the case of consider the following equation here it is clear that hpo is the acid since it donates a proton to water to make ho and po now consider the following equation in this case hpo is the base since it accepts a proton from water to form hpo and oh thus hpo is an acid and base together making it amphoteric since hpo is the only compound from the options that can act as a base the answer is b hpo conjugate acidbase pair in reality
