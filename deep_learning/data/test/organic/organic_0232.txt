an ammonium ion acts as an acid by donating a proton to a hydroxide ion and the hydroxide ion acts as a base the conjugate acidbase pairs for this reaction are and figure the strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at the top right the conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong base is a very weak acid figure the relative strengths of some common conjugate acidbase pairs the strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at
