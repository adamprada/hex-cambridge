its conjugate acid example identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium solution one pair is ho and oh where ho has one more h and is the conjugate acid while oh has one less h and is the conjugate base the other pair consists of chn and chnh where chnh is the conjugate acid it has an additional proton and chn is the conjugate base exercise identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium answer ho acid and oh base nh base and nh acid contributors and attributions marisa alviaragnew sacramento city college henry agnew uc davis saturated and
