terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below degree of unsaturation saturated unsaturated there are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule although nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and infrared radiation ir are the primary ways of determining molecular structures calculating the degrees of unsaturation is useful information since knowing the degrees of unsaturation make it easier for one to figure out the molecular structure it helps one doublecheck the number of bonds andor cyclic rings saturated and unsaturated molecules in the lab saturation may be thought
