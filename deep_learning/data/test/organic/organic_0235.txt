only single bonds and no rings another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by c which is the general molecular representation of an alkane as an example for the molecular formula ch the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is cx the compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens
