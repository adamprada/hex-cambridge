iv double bonds d i triple bonds ii triple bonds double bonds iii triple bonds double bond ring iv as you can see the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor ring thus the formula may give numerous possible structures for a given molecular formula answers a unsaturated even though rings only contain single bonds rings are considered unsaturated b unsaturated c saturated d unsaturated if the molecular structure is given the easiest way to solve is to count the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings however you can also determine the
