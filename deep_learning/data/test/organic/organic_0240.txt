charges on the carbon atoms of the three surrounding alkyl groups and indeed on the hydrogen atoms attached to them chemists sometimes use an arrow to represent this inductive release note these diagrams do not reflect the geometry of the carbocation the overall charge on the carbocation remains unchanged but some of the charge is now carried by the alkyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that is the charge has been dispersed in the tertiary carbocation shown above the three alkyl groups help to stabilize the positive charge in a secondary carbocation only two alkyl groups would be
