the carbocation intermediate is the faster this first bondbreaking step will occur in other words the likelihood of a nucleophilic substitution reaction proceeding by a dissociative sn mechanism depends to a large degree on the stability of the carbocation intermediate that forms the critical question now becomes what stabilizes a carbocation so if it takes an electron withdrawing group to stabilize a negative charge what will stabilize a positive charge an electron donating group a positively charged species such as a carbocation is very electronpoor and thus anything which donates electron density to the center of electron poverty will help
