poverty of the positivelycharged carbon it is not accurate to say however that carbocations with higher substitution are always more stable than those with less substitution just as electrondonating groups can stabilize a carbocation electronwithdrawing groups act to destabilize carbocations carbonyl groups are electronwithdrawing by inductive effects due to the polarity of the co double bond it is possible to demonstrate in the laboratory see section d that carbocation a below is more stable than carbocation b even though a is a primary carbocation and b is secondary the difference in stability can be explained by considering the electronwithdrawing inductive
