sn or sn stabilization of a carbocation can also occur through resonance effects and as we have already discussed in the acidbase chapter resonance effects as a rule are more powerful than inductive effects consider the simple case of a benzylic carbocation this carbocation is comparatively stable in this case electron donation is a resonance effect three additional resonance structures can be drawn for this carbocation in which the positive charge is located on one of three aromatic carbons the positive charge is not isolated on the benzylic carbon rather it is delocalized around the aromatic structure this delocalization of
