by induction they are electron donating groups by resonance and it is this resonance effect which is more powerful we previously encountered this same idea when considering the relative acidity and basicity of phenols and aromatic amines in section consider the two pairs of carbocation species below in the more stable carbocations the heteroatom acts as an electron donating group by resonance in effect the lone pair on the heteroatom is available to delocalize the positive charge in the less stable carbocations the positivelycharged carbon is more than one bond away from the heteroatom and thus no resonance effects are
