this is not possible for the carbocation species on the right for the most part carbocations are very highenergy transient intermediate species in organic reactions however there are some unusual examples of very stable carbocations that take the form of organic salts crystal violet is the common name for the chloride salt of the carbocation whose structure is shown below notice the structural possibilities for extensive resonance delocalization of the positive charge and the presence of three electrondonating amine groups example draw a resonance structure of the crystal violet cation in which the positive charge is delocalized to one of
