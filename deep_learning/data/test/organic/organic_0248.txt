for e reactions with stereochemistry propose mechanisms for e reactions draw and interpret reaction energy diagrams for e reactions general reaction unimolecular elimination e is a reaction in which loss of the leaving group followed by removal of he betahydrogen results in the formation of a double bond it is similar to a unimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction sn in various ways one being the formation of a carbocation intermediate as the rate determining slow step hence the name unimolecular alkyl halides that can ionize to form stable carbocations are more reactive via the e mechanism because carbocation stability is the
