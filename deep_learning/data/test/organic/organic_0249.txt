type of solvent strength of the base mechanism for alkyl halides as can be seen in the e mechanism below the preliminary step is the leaving group lg leaving on its own because it takes the electrons in the bond along with it the carbon that was attached to it loses its electron making it a carbocation once it becomes a carbocation a lewis base b deprotonates the intermediate carbocation at the beta position which then donates its electrons to the neighboring cc bond to form a double bond unlike e reactions which require the proton to be anti to
