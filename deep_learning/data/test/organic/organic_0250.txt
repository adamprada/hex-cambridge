product more stable reactivity due to the fact that e reactions create a carbocation intermediate rules present in reactions still apply as expected tertiary carbocations are favored over secondary primary and methyls this is due to the phenomena of hyperconjugation which essentially allows a nearby cc or ch bond to interact with the p orbital of the carbon to bring the electrons down to a lower energy state thus this has a stabilizing effect on the molecule as a whole in general primary and methyl carbocations do not proceed through the e pathway for this reason unless there is a
