as well polar protic solvents may be used to hinder nucleophiles thus disfavoring e sn from occurring regiochemistry stereochemistry of the e reaction the e reaction is regiospecific because it follows zaitsevs rule that states the more substituted alkene is the major product this infers that the hydrogen on the most substituted carbon is the most probable to be deprotonated thus allowing for the most substituted alkene to be formed unlike e reactions the e reaction is not stereospecific thus a hydrogen is not required to be anticoplanar to the leaving group because the leaving group is gone in the
