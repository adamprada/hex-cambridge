the mechanism based on its rate equation or reaction data for sn reactions predict the products and specify the reagents for sn reactions with stereochemistry propose mechanisms for sn reactions draw and interpret reaction energy diagrams for sn reactions in order of decreasing importance the factors impacting sn reaction pathways are structure of the alkyl halide stability of the leaving group type of solvent the unimolecular transition state of the sn pathway means that structure of the alkyl halide and stability of the leaving group are the primary considerations alkyl halides that can ionize to form stable carbocations are more
