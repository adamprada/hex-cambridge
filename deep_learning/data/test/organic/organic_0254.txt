be unimolecular and follow a firstorder rate equation hence the name sn is applied to this mechanism the hammond postulate suggests that the activation energy of the ratedetermining first step will be inversely proportional to the stability of the carbocation intermediate the more stable the carbocation the lower the activation energy the faster the reactivity therefore carbocation stability is a primary consideration in sn reactions carbocations can be stabilized by delocalizing the charge via resonance and through inductive electron donation of alkyl groups carbocations can also stabilize by rearrangement via hydride or methyl shifts carbocation rearrangements are explained in a
