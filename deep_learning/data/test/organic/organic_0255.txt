step a good leaving group wants to leave so it breaks the cleaving group bond faster once the bond breaks the carbocation is formed and the faster the carbocation is formed the faster the nucleophile can come in and the faster the reaction will be completed a good leaving group is a weak base because weak bases can hold the charge theyre happy to leave with both electrons and in order for the leaving group to leave it needs to be able to accept electrons strong bases on the other hand donate electrons which is why they cant be good
