on the sn reaction to facilitate the charge separation of the ionization reaction in the first step a good ionizing solvent is needed two solvent characteristics will be particularly important the polarity and the solvating power the dielectric constant Îµ measures polarity of solvent molecules and their ability to orient themselves between ions to attenuate reduce the electrostatic force one ion exerts on the other the higher the dielectric constant the more polar the substance and in the case of sn reactions the faster the rate a dielectric constant below is usually considered nonpolar solvents having high dielectric constants such
