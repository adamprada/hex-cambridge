molecule eg oxygen nitrogen atoms the interaction of the carbocations with these nucleophilic solvents may be strong enough to form covalent bonds to carbon thus converting the intermediate to a substitution product and creating the reaction name solvolysis when solvolysis occurs with water the actions are called hydrolysis reactions as shown in the reaction below polar protic and polar aprotic solvents protic solvents contain polarized hydrogen whereas aprotic solvents do not contain polarized hydrogen for sn reactions solvation of the nucleophile by polar protic solvents slows the reaction rate however in sn reaction the nucleophile is not a part of
