effects of nucleophile the strength of the nucleophile does not affect the reaction rate of sn because the nucleophile is not involved in the ratedetermining step since nucleophiles only participate in the fast second step their relative molar concentrations rather than their nucleophilicities should be the primary productdetermining factor if a nucleophilic solvent such as water is used its high concentration will assure that alcohols are the major product however if you have more than one nucleophile competing to bond to the carbocation the strengths and concentrations of those nucleophiles affects the distribution of products for example if tbutylchloride reacts
