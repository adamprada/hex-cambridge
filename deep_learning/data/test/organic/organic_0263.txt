spatial arrangement of atoms rather than order of atomic connectivity one of their most interesting type of isomer is the mirrorimage stereoisomers a nonsuperimposable set of two molecules that are mirror image of one another the existence of these molecules are determined by concept known as chirality introduction organic compounds molecules created around a chain of carbon atom more commonly known as carbon backbone play an essential role in the chemistry of life these molecules derive their importance from the energy they carry mainly in a form of potential energy between atomic molecules since such potential force can be widely
