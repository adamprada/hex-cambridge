other figure figure in this case the molecule is considered achiral in other words to distinguish chiral molecule from an achiral molecule one must search for the existence of the bisecting plane in a molecule all chiral molecules are deprive of bisecting plane whether simple or complex as a universal rule no molecule with different surrounding atoms are achiral chirality is a simple but essential idea to support the concept of stereoisomerism being used to explain one type of its kind the chemical properties of the chiral molecule differs from its mirror image and in this lies the significance of
