inverts its configuration equilibrium arrows by passing through a planar sphybridized transition state leading to a mixture of interconverting r and s configurations if the nitrogen atom were the only chiral center in the molecule a racemic mixture of r and s configurations would exist at equilibrium if other chiral centers are present as in the ephedrin isomers a mixture of diastereomers will result the takehome message is that nitrogen does not contribute to isolable stereoisomers asymmetric quaternary ammonium groups are also chiral amines however are not chiral because they rapidly invert or turn inside out at room temperature the
