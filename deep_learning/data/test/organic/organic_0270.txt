with a biological emphasis by tim soderberg university of minnesota morris some chiral organic moleculesexercisescontributors and attributions objective after completing this section you should be able to explain how chiral molecules in nature can have such dramatically different biological properties some chiral organic molecules there are a number of important biomolecules that could occur as enantiomers including amino acids and sugars in most cases only one enantiomer occurs although some fungi for example are able to produce mirrorimage forms of these compounds we will look later at some of these biomolecules but first we will look at a compound that
