additional bond to the next set of atoms and so on until you find a difference in carvone this decision tree works as follows the chiral center is connected to a h a c a c and a c the h is lowest priority one c eventually leads to a co however at the second bond from the chiral center this c is connected to a c and two hs a second c is also part of the sixmembered ring but the co is farther away in this direction at the second bond from the chiral center this c is
