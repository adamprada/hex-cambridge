chromatographyb liquidsolid chromatographyreferences a gasliquid chromatography many separation methods are based on chromatography that is separation of the components of a mixture by differences in the way they become distributed or partitioned between two different phases to illustrate with an extreme example suppose we have a mixture of gaseous methane and ammonia and contact this mixture with water ammonia being very soluble in water per water at pressure will mostly go into the water phase whereas the methane being almost insoluble per of water will essentially remain entirely in the gas phase such a separation of methane and ammonia would
