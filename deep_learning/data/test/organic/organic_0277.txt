glass beads moistened with water the stationary phase and a slow stream of an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen or helium is passed in to push the other gases through a multistage partitioning would occur as the ammonia dissolves in the water and the resulting gas stream encounters fresh water as it moves along the column carrier gas enriched with methane would emerge first and effluent gas containing ammonia would come out later this is a crude description of the method of gasliquid chromatography abbreviated often as glc gc or called vaporphase chromatography vpc this technique has become so
