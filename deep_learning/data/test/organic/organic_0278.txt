property of the carrier gas alone versus the carrier gas plus effluent sample at the exit differences in thermal conductivity are particularly easy to measure and give reasonably high detection sensitivities in the usual glc procedure a few microliters of an organic liquid to be analyzed are injected into a vaporizer and carried with a stream of gas usually helium into a long heated column that is packed with a porous solid such as crushed firebrick impregnated with a nonvolatile liquid gasliquid partitioning occurs and small differences between partitioning of the components can be magnified by the large number of
