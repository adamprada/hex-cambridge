smallscale runs are combined figure a gasliquid chromatogram of a mixture of the isomeric butanols at constant column temperature a tiny peak on the far left is a trace of air injected with the sample the retention times of the various isomers are in the same order as the boiling points which are from left to right and the areas under each peak correspond to the relative amounts of material present raising the column temperature at a preprogrammed rate while developing the chromatogram speeds up the removal of the slowermoving components and sharpens their peaks also by diversion of the
