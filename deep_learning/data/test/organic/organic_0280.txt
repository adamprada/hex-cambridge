down through the column what one hopes for but may not always find is that the components of the mixture will be adsorbed unequally by the solid phase so distinct bands or zones of color appear the bands at the top of the column contain the most strongly adsorbed components and the bands at the bottom the least strongly held components the zones may be separated mechanically or sufficient solvent can be added to wash or elute the zones of adsorbed materials sequentially from the column for further analysis liquidsolid chromatography in the form just described was developed first by
