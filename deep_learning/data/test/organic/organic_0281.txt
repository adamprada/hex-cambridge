on a tswett column various detecting means are used simple visual observation for colored compounds differential fluorescence under ultraviolet light and spraying of the plate with substances that will give colored materials with the compounds present in favorable cases this form of liquidsolid chromatography can be carried out with submicrogram quantities of materials figure a simple chromatographic column for liquidsolid chromatography an extremely important improvement on the tswett procedure is highpressure solidliquid chromatography hplc increasing the input pressure on the system to improves the speed of separations by permitting the use of much smaller solid particles with more surface area
