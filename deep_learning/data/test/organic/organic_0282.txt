for separating enzymes and the immobile phase can be constructed from compounds known to react with or be complexed by the enzyme some other forms of chromatography are discussed in sections b and e observation of a single peak in a given chromatographic procedure is evidence albeit not definitive evidence for purity contaminants with nearly the same properties may be very difficult to separate and if knowing the degree of purity is highly important one can run chromatograms with a variety of different adsorbents to see if each gives the same result if they do the presumption of purity improves
