carboncarbon double bonds using the concept of sp hybridization describe the geometry of compounds containing carboncarbon double bonds compare the molecular parameters bond lengths strengths and angles of a typical alkene with those of a typical alkane explain why free rotation is not possible about a carboncarbon double bond explain why the lack of free rotation about a carboncarbon double bond results in the occurrence of cistrans isomerism in certain alkenes decide whether or not cistrans isomerism is possible for a given alkene and where such isomerism is possible draw the kekul√© structure of each isomer key terms make certain
