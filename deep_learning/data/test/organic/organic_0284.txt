the atoms in space that excludes any different arrangements which are simply due to the molecule rotating as a whole or rotating about particular bonds where the atoms making up the various isomers are joined up in a different order this is known as structural isomerism structural isomerism is not a form of stereoisomerism and is dealt with in a separate module geometric cis trans isomerism these isomers occur where you have restricted rotation somewhere in a molecule at an introductory level in organic chemistry examples usually just involve the carboncarbon double bond and thats what this page will concentrate
