what happens if you have a carboncarbon double bond as in dichloroethene these two molecules are not the same the carboncarbon double bond wont rotate and so you would have to take the models to pieces in order to convert one structure into the other one that is a simple test for isomers if you have to take a model to pieces to convert it into another one then youve got isomers if you merely have to twist it a bit then you havent drawing structural formulae for the last pair of models gives two possible isomers in one the
