importance of drawing geometric isomers properly its very easy to miss geometric isomers in exams if you take shortcuts in drawing the structural formulae for example it is very tempting to draw butene as chchchch if you write it like this you will almost certainly miss the fact that there are geometric isomers if there is even the slightest hint in a question that isomers might be involved always draw compounds containing carboncarbon double bonds showing the correct bond angles around the carbon atoms at the ends of the bond in other words use the format shown in the last
