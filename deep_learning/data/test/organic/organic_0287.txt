these are still the same molecule to get from one to the other all you would have to do is to turn the whole model over you wont have geometric isomers if there are two groups the same on one end of the bond in this case the two pink groups on the lefthand end so there must be two different groups on the lefthand carbon and two different groups on the righthand one the cases weve been exploring earlier are like this but you could make things even more different and still have geometric isomers here the blue and
