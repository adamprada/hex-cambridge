and a hatched line for bonds to atoms or groups located below the ring down disubstituted cycloalkane stereoisomers may be designated by nomenclature prefixes such as cis and trans cis and trans isomers are also called geometric isomers for the cis isomer both substituents are aobe or below the carbon ring for the trans isomer one substituent is above the ring while the other substituent is below the ring the cis and trans isomers for dibromocyclopentane are shown as an example below while the carboncarbon single bonds of the rings can rotate partially there is no way to interconvert between
