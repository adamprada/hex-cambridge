the stereochemical notation distinguishing the various isomers becomes more complex however we can always state the relationship of any two substituents using cis or trans for example in the trisubstitutued cyclohexane below we can say that the methyl group is cis to the ethyl group and trans to the chlorine we can also say that the ethyl group is trans to the chlorine we cannot however designate the entire molecule as a cis or trans isomer exercise draw the following molecules transdimethylcyclohexane transdibromocyclopentane cisdichlorocyclobutane answer contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer
