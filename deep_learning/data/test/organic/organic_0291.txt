isomers stereoisomers will be introduced stereoisomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula the same atom connectivity but they differ in the relative spatial orientation of the atoms cycloalkanes are similar to openchain alkanes in many respects they both tend to be nonpolar and relatively inert one important difference is that cycloalkanes have much less freedom of movement than openchain alkanes as discussed in sections and openchain alkanes are capable of rotation around their carboncarbon sigma bonds the ringed structures of cycloalkanes prevent such free rotation causing them to be more rigid and somewhat planar disubstituted cycloalkanes are one
