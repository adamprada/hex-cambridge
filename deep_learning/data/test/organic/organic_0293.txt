the trisubstituted cyclohexane below the methyl group is cis to the ethyl group and also trans to the chlorine however the entire molecule cannot be designated as either a cis or trans isomer later sections will describe how to name these more complex molecules sequence rules for specifying configuration example name the following cycloalkanes solution these two example represent the two main ways of showing spatial orientation in cycloalkanes a in example a the cycloalkane is shown as being flat and in the plane of the page the positioning of the substituents is shown by using dashwedge bonds cistrans positioning
