profoundly by the nature of the functional groups present indeed many organic reactions involve transformations of the functional group that do not affect the rest of the molecule for instance alcohols can be transformed into a number of other compounds such as organic halides or ethers and amines without changing the structure of the hydrocarbon group furthermore any compound possessing a particular functional group may be expected to exhibit reactions characteristic of that group and to some extent at least of inorganic compounds with similar functional groups a good example of the use of the functionalgroup concept is for acidbase
