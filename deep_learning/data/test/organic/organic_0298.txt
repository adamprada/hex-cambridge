also should possess acidic and basic properties they do have these properties and they are in fact stronger acids than either water or alcohols and form salts with bases amines are structurally related to ammonia and we therefore may predict that they will have similar properties a property of ammonia that you probably will have encountered earlier is that it acts as a base and forms salts with acids amines behave likewise it is with logic of this kind inferring chemical behavior from structural analogies that much of organic chemistry can be understood there are other logical classification schemes however
