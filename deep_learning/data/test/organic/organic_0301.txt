is any substance that can accept an electron pair and a base is any substance that can donated an electron pair to form a covalent bond therefore acids must be electrophiles and bases must be nucleophiles for example the methyl cation may be regarded as a lewis acid or an electrophile because it accepts electrons from reagents such as chloride ion or methanol in turn because chloride ion and methanol donate electrons to the methyl cation they are classified as lewis bases or nucleophiles the generalized lewis concept of acids and bases also includes common protontransfer reactions thus water acts
