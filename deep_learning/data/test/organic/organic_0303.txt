electrophile such as methyl chloride the important difference is that the strength of the base is determined in an equilibrium reaction whereas its nucleophilicity is determined by its reactivity in slow substitution reactions to put it another way the base strength corresponds to the overall energy change of a reaction while the nucleophilicity corresponds to the activation energy of a reaction see figure even so it turns out that most strong bases are good nucleophiles and that most strong proton acids are good electrophiles we will see that the converse may not be true good nucleophiles are not always strong
