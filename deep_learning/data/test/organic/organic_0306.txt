statement can be expressed as follows with the symbol denotes that the reactants and products are in the gaseous state except for the water which is liquid if we wish to have with gaseous water as the product we have to make a correction for the heat of vaporization of water at the task of measuring the heats of all chemical reactions is a formidable one and about as practical as counting grains of sand on the beach however it is of practical interest to be able to estimate heats of reaction and this can be done quite simply with
