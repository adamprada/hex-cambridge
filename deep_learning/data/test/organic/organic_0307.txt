make bonds using for each bond in carbon dioxide and for each of the bonds in water the net sum of these values is which is reasonably close to the value of for the heat of combustion of one mole of methane determined experimentally the same type of procedure can be used to estimate values for many other kinds of reactions of organic compounds in the vapor phase at moreover if appropriate heats of vaporization are available it is straightforward to compute for vaporphase reactions of substances which are normally liquids or solids at the special problems that arise when
