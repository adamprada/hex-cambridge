the dissociation of just one bond in a polyatomic molecule for this we need what are called bonddissociation energies some of which are given in table the values given have been selected to emphasize how structure influences bond energy thus bond energies in alkanes decrease in the order primary secondary tertiary likewise bonds decrease in strength along the series how accurate are values calculated from bond energies generally quite good provided nonbonded interactions between the atoms are small and the bond angles and distances are close to the normal values section b a few examples of calculated and experimental heats
