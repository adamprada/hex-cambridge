for cyclohexane which has normal bond angles the heat of combustion is close to the calculated value in this book we use kilocalories in place of the presently recommended si joules for units of energy as of the date of writing it is not clear just how general the use of the joule will become among chemists to convert calories to joules or to multiply by you may wonder how a reaction such as combustion of methane can occur at the fact is that the reaction can be carried out at any desired temperature the important thing is that the
