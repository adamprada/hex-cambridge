is a few shortcuts and some practice at recognizing common bonding patterns lets start with carbon the most important element for organic chemists carbon is said to be tetravalent meaning that it tends to form four bonds if you look at the simple structures of methane methanol ethane ethene and ethyne in the figures from the previous section you should quickly recognize that in each molecule the carbon atom has four bonds and a formal charge of zero this is a pattern that holds throughout most of the organic molecules we will see but there are also exceptions style typetextcssstyle
