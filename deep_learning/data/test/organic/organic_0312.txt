another possibility is a carbon with three bonds and a single unpaired free radical electron in this case the carbon has a formal charge of zero one last possibility is a highly reactive species called a carbene in which a carbon has two bonds and one lone pair of electrons giving it a formal charge of zero you may encounter carbenes in more advanced chemistry courses but they will not be discussed any further in this book you should certainly use the methods you have learned to check that these formal charges are correct for the examples given above more
