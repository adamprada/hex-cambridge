not be seeing naked protons and hydrides as such because they are too reactive to be present in that form in aqueous solution nonetheless the idea of a proton will be very important when we discuss acidbase chemistry and the idea of a hydride ion will become very important much later in the book when we discuss organic oxidation and reduction reactions as a rule though all hydrogen atoms in organic molecules have one bond and no formal charge let us next turn to oxygen atoms typically you will see an oxygen bonding in three ways all of which fulfill
