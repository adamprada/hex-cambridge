iodine are very important in laboratory and medicinal organic chemistry but less common in naturally occurring organic molecules halogens in organic compounds usually are seen with one bond three lone pairs and a formal charge of zero sometimes especially in the case of bromine we will encounter reactive species in which the halogen has two bonds usually in a threemembered ring two lone pairs and a formal charge of these rules if learned and internalized so that you dont even need to think about them will allow you to draw large organic structures complete with formal charges quite quickly once
