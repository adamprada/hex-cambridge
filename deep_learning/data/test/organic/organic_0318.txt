mechanisms for sn sn e and e reactions draw interpret and apply reaction energy diagrams for sn sn e and e reactions summary of reaction patterns having discussed the many factors that influence nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions of alkyl halides we must now consider the practical problem of predicting the most likely outcome when a given alkyl halide is reacted with a given nucleophile as we noted earlier several variables must be considered the most important being the structure of the alkyl group and the nature of the nucleophilic reactantin general in order for an sn or e reaction
