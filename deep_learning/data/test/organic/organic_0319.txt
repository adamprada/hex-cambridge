table summarizes the expected outcome of alkyl halide reactions with nucleophiles it is assumed that the alkyl halides have one or more betahydrogens making elimination possible and that low dielectric solvents eg acetone ethanol tetrahydrofuran ethyl acetate are used when a high dielectric solvent would significantly influence the reaction this is noted in red note that halogens bonded to sp or sp hybridized carbon atoms do not normally undergo substitution or elimination reactions with nucleophilic reagents nucleophile anionic nucleophiles weak bases i br scn n chco rs cn etc pkas from to left to right anionic nucleophiles strong bases ho
