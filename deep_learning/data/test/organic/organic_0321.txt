with nitrogen nucleophiles they are bases in high dielectric ionizing solvents sn and e products may be formed water hydrolysis will be favorable for º ºhalides benzyl chch rapid sn substitution for º and ºhalides for ºhalides a very slow sn substitution or if the nucleophile is moderately basic e elimination in high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile sn and e products may be observed rapid sn substitution for º halides note there are no β hydrogens e elimination will compete with substitution in ºhalides and dominate in the case of ºhalides in high dielectric ionizing
