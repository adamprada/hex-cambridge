and the carbon atoms adjacent to it as beta as noted in the first four equations shown below replacement or substitution of the halogen on the αcarbon colored maroon by a nucleophilic reagent is a commonly observed reaction as shown in equations below also since the electrophilic character introduced by the halogen extends to the βcarbons and since nucleophiles are also bases the possibility of base induced hx elimination must also be considered as illustrated by equation finally there are some combinations of alkyl halides and nucleophiles that fail to show any reaction over a hour period such as the
