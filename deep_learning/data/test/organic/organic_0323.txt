one conclusion relating the structure of the rgroup to possible products should be immediately obvious if r has no betahydrogens an elimination reaction is not possible unless a structural rearrangement occurs first the first four halides shown on the left below do not give elimination reactions on treatment with base because they have no Î²hydrogens the two halides on the right do not normally undergo such reactions because the potential elimination products have highly strained double or triple bonds it is also worth noting that sp hybridized cx compounds such as the three on the right do not normally undergo
