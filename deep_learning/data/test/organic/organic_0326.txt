such as water or alcohols favor the sn mechanism the solvent polar aprotic solvents favor the sn mechanism by enhancing the reactivity of the nucleophile polar protic solvents favor the sn mechanism by stabilizing the transition state and carbocation intermediate sn reactions are called solvolysis reactions when the solvent is the nucleophile these patterns of reactivity are summarized in the table below comparison between sn and sn reactions reaction parameter sn sn alkyl halide structure methyl primary secondary tertiary tertiary secodary primary methyl nucleophile high concentration of a strong nucleophile poor nucleophile often the solvent mechanism step stp rate limiting
