possible depending on the nucleophile and the solvent in this example the nucleophile a thiolate anion is strong and a polar protic solvent is used so the sn mechanism is heavily favored the reaction is expected to proceed with inversion of configuration exercise determine whether each substitution reaction shown below is likely to proceed by an sn or sn mechanism and explain your reasoning answer a sn bc primary alkyl halide with a strong nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent b sn bc tertiary alkyl halide with a weak nucleophile that is also the solvent solvolysis c sn bc secondary
