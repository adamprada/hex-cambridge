of different spatial arrangements of the component atoms thus there are two stereoisomers of butene that differ in the geometric arrangement of the groups attached to the double bond in one isomer both methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond cisbutene and in the other the methyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond transbutene the two isomers clearly have the same structural framework but they differ in the arrangement of this framework in space hence the designation stereoisomers they owe their separate existence to the fact that the double bond is rigid and
