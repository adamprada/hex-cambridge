end of the double bond carries identical groups thus we don not expect there to be cistrans isomers of butene or methylpropene and figure ballandstick models of cis and transbutene indeed none are known you may wish to verify this by making ballandstick models of these substances ring formation also confers rigidity on molecular structure such that rotation about the ring bonds is prevented as a result stereoisomerism of the cistrans type is possible for example dimethylcyclopropane exists in two forms that differ in the arrangement of the two methyl groups with figure ballandstick models of cis and trans isomers
