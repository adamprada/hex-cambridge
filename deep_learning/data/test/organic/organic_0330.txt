describe configurational isomerism in compounds with double bonds and rings when referring to the configuration of a particular isomer we mean to specify its geometry for instance the isomer of dichloroethene shown below has the trans configuration the isomer of dichlorocyclobutane has the cis configuration cistrans isomerism is encountered very frequently by one convention the configuration of a complex alkene is taken to correspond to the configuration of the longest continuous chain as it passes through the double bond thus the following compound is transethylmethylheptene despite the fact that two identical groups are cis with respect to each other because
