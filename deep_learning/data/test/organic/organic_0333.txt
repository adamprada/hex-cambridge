is a widely used inhalation anaesthetic the four different groups in this case are hydrogen chlorine bromine and trifluoromethyl the pair of enantiomers is shown in structures and the atom that carries the four different substituents in and or and is called a chiral atoms or chiral center the latter is the more general term because as we shall see later section a dissymmetry in molecules need not be centered at an atom figure use of ballandstick models to show nonidentity of the enantiomers of chlorobutane and in evaluating a chemical structure for chirality you should look for carbons carrying
