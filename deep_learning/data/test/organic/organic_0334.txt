would be wrong if you look farther you will see that the groups attached to actually are different and are and therefore trimethylcyclohexane has a chiral center at in contrast the isomer has no chiral centers because the groups attached to the ring at are identical several other terms that we shall use frequently in addition to chirality are racemic mixture resolution and racemization a mixture of equal amounts of both enantiomers is a racemic mixture separation of a racemic mixture into its component enantiomers is a resolution and the conversion of either enantiomer into equal parts of both is
