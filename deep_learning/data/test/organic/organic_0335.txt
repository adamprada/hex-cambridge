the concept of the threedimensional carbon atoms expressed independently by j h vant hoff and j a le bel pasteurs contribution to stereochemistry came as a result of his studies of the shapes of crystals of tartaric acid and its salts tartaric acid a byproduct of wine production was known to be optically active and pasteur showed that it and nineteen different salts of it all formed crystals that were not identical with their mirror images a different substance known as racemic acid for which we can write the same condensed formula was known to be optically inactive and pasteur
