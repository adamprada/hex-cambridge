forms now is called a resolution of racemic acid on the basis of his discoveries pasteur postulated that optical isomerism had to be related to the molecular dissymmetry of substances such that nonidentical mirrorimage forms could exist however it remained for vant hoff and le bel to provide almost simultaneously a satisfactory explanation at the molecular level in his first published work on tetrahedral carbon vant hoff said it appears more and more that the present constitutional formulae are incapable of explaining certain cases of isomerism the reason for this is perhaps the fact that we need a more definite
