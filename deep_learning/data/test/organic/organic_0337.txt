was too much for many to accept d properties of enantiomers optical activity is an experimentally useful property and usually is measured as the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization of polarized light passing through solutions of the substances under investigation figure where measurable optical activity is present it is found that one enantiomer rotates the plane of polarization in one direction whereas the other causes the plane to rotate equally but in the opposite direction with reference to the plane of incident light the enantiomer that rotates the plane to the right is called dextrorotatory and is
