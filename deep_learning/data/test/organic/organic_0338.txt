of the plane of polarization of polarized light by an optically active compound planepolarized light is different from ordinary light in that its electrical component vibrates in a plane rather than in all directions the angle is the angle between the plane of polarization of light entering the sample and the plane of polarization of the emerging light a very important point to keep in mind about any pair of enantiomers is that they will have identical chemical and physical properties except for the signs of their optical rotations with one important proviso all of the properties to be compared
