all and looks different from all angles of view formulas and represent asymmetric molecules a dissymmetric molecule is chiral but looks the same from more than one angle of view a helical spring is dissymmetric it looks the same from each end we will encounter dissymmetric molecules later the tetrahedral carbon was first proposed by e paterno in see sectione but he apparently did not recognize its implications for chirality these implications were recognized first by vant hoff and le bel with vant hoff proceeding on the basis of bonds to carbon being directed to the corners of a regular
