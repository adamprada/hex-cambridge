all single bonds except when the carbons are part of a ring as in cyclopropane or cyclohexane figure two rotational conformations of ethane for ethane and its derivatives the staggered conformations are more stable than the eclipsed conformations the reason for this in ethane is not wholly clear but doubtless depends on the fact that in the staggered conformation the bonding electrons are as far away from one another as possible and give the least interelectronic repulsion with groups larger than hydrogen atoms substituted on ethane carbons spacefilling models usually show less interference steric hindrance for staggered conformations than for
