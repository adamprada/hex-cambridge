second figure six rotational conformations about the bond of butane the forward groups are shown here as rotating counterclockwise with respect to the rear groups in butane a rotation about the central bond allows the molecule to pass through three different eclipsed arrangements and three different staggered arrangements as shown in figure experiment shows that butane favors the staggered form in which the methyl groups are farthest apart this form is called the anti or trans conformation sometimes conformer and of the molecules of butane exist in this form at room temperature the other two staggered forms and are called
