the eclipsed forms of butane like the eclipsed forms of ethane are small and represent energy maxima for the molecule as rotation occurs about the central bond the energy differences between the butane conformations are represented diagrammatically in figure the valleys correspond to staggered forms and the energy difference between the anti and gauche forms is pioneering work in the field of conformational analysis was contributed by o hassel norway and d r h barton britain for which they shared the nobel prize in chemistry in hassels work involved the physical determination of preferred conformations of small molecules whereas barton
