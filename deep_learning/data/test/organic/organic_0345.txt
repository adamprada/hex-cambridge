b in which both methyl groups are lined up with hydrogen atoms one more rotation produces another staggered conformation called the anti conformation where the two methyl groups are positioned opposite each other a dihedral angle of o as with ethane the staggered conformations of butane are energy valleys and the eclipsed conformations are energy peaks however in the case of butane there are two different valleys and two different peaks the gauche conformation is a higher energy valley than the anti conformation due to steric strain which is the repulsive interaction caused by the two bulky methyl groups being
