drawings of simple cycloalkanes are geometrical polygons the actual shape of these compounds in most cases is very different cyclopropane is necessarily planar flat with the carbon atoms at the corners of an equilateral triangle the ยบ bond angles are much smaller than the optimum ยบ angles of a normal tetrahedral carbon atom and the resulting angle strain dramatically influences the chemical behavior of this cycloalkane cyclopropane also suffers substantial eclipsing strain since all the carboncarbon bonds are fully eclipsed cyclobutane reduces some bondeclipsing strain by folding the outofplane dihedral angle is about ยบ but the total eclipsing and angle
