large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring cyclic systems are a little different from openchain systems in an open chain any bond can be rotated ยบ going through many different conformations that complete rotation isnt possible in a cyclic system because the parts that would be trying to twist away from each other would still be connected together thus cyclic systems have fewer degrees of freedom than aliphatic systems they have restricted rotation because of the restricted rotation of cyclic systems most of them have much more welldefined shapes than their
