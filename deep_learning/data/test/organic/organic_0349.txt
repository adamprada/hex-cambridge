ring strain in cyclopropane is angle strain all of the carbon atoms in cyclopropane are tetrahedral and would prefer to have a bond angle of o the angles in an equilateral triangle are actually o about half as large as the optimum angle the large deviation from the optimal bond angle means that the cc sigma bonds forming the cyclopropane ring are bent maximum bonding occurs when the overlapping orbitals are pointing directly toward each other the severely strained bond angles in cyclopropane means that the orbitals forming the cc bonds overlap at a slight angle making them weaker this
