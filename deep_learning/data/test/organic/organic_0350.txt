rings before that point rings are not flexible enough to allow for two ring substituents to interact with each other interactive element the d structure of cyclopropane the combination of torsional and angle strain creates a large amount of ring strain in cyclopropane which weakens the cc ring bonds kjmol when compared to cc bonds in openchain propane kjmol cyclobutane cyclobutane is a four membered ring the larger number of ring hydrogens would cause a substantial amount of torsional strain if cyclobutane were planar in three dimensions cyclobutane is flexible enough to buckle into a puckered shape which causes the
