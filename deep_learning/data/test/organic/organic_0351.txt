strain but less than in cyclopropane although torsional strain is still present the neighboring ch bonds are not exactly eclipsed in the cyclobutanes puckered conformation steric strain is very low cyclobutane is still not large enough that substituents can reach around to cause crowding overall the ring strain in cyclobutane kjmol is slightly less than cyclopropane kjmol interactive element the d structure of cyclobutane cyclopentane cyclopentanes are even more stable than cyclobutanes and they are the secondmost common cycloalkane ring in nature after cyclohexanes planar cyclopentane has virtually no angle strain but an immense amount of torsional strain to reduce
