the far top right carbon is the endo position at room temperature cyclopentane undergoes a rapid bond rotation process in which each of the five carbons takes turns being in the endo position cyclopentane distorts only very slightly into an envelope shape in which one corner of the pentagon is lifted up above the plane of the other four the envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope by allowing the bonds to be in an almost completely staggared position however the neighboring bonds are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap
