strain kjmol when compared to cyclopropane and cyclobutane interactive element the d structure of cyclopentane cc cycloalkanes in nature if one of the carboncarbon bonds is broken in cyclopropane or cyclobutane the ring will spring open releasing energy as the bonds reassume their preferred tetrahedral geometry the effectiveness of two antibiotic drugs fosfomycin and penicillin is due in large part to the high reactivity of the three and fourmembered rings in their structures one of the most important fivemembered rings in nature is a sugar called ribose dna and rna are both constructed upon backbones derived from ribose pictured below
