would the strain be on this planar molecule in the two conformations of transdimethylcyclopentane one is more stable than the other explain why this is in methylcyclopentane which carbon would most likely be in the endo position solutions there are eclipsing interactions two per cc bond the extra strain on this molecule would be kjmol kjmol x the first conformation is more stable even though the methyl groups are trans in both models they are anti to one another in the first structure which is lower energy while they are gauche in the second structure increasing strain within the molecule
