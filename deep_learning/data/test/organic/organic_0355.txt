two per cc bond the extra strain on this molecule would be kjmol kjmol x s the first conformation is more stable even though the methyl groups are trans in both models in the second structure they are eclipsing one another therefore increasing the strain within the molecule compared to the first structure where the larger methyl groups are anti to one another contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state university chris p schaller phd college of saint benedict saint johns university william reusch professor emeritus michigan state u virtual
