strain and consequently are the most common cycloalkanes found in nature a wide variety of compounds including hormones pharmaceuticals and flavoring agents have substituted cyclohexane rings example hormone testosterone which contains three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar however this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large
