than in theory cyclohexane in the strained planar configuration showing how the hydrogens become eclipsed chair conformation of cyclohexane the flexibility of cyclohexane allows for a conformation which is almost free of ring strain if two carbon atoms on opposite sides of the sixmembered ring are bent out of the plane of the ring a shape is formed that resembles a reclining beach chair this chair conformation is the lowest energy conformation for cyclohexane with an overall ring strain of kjmol in this conformation the carboncarbon ring bonds are able to assume bonding angles of o which is very near
