resembles a boat the boat conformation is less stable than the chair form for two major reasons the boat conformation has unfavorable steric interactions between a pair of hydrogens the socalled flagpole hydrogens that are forced to be very close together Ã¥ this steric hindrance creates a repulsion energy of about kjmol an additional cause of the higher energy of the boat conformation is that adjacent hydrogen atoms on the bottom of the boat are forced into eclipsed positions for these reasons the boat conformation about kjmol less stable than the chair conformation a boat structure of cyclohexane the interfering
