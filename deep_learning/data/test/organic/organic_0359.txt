conformation of cyclohexane cyclohexane can obtain a partially plane conformation called half chair but with only with excessive amounts of ring strain the half chair conformation is formed by taking planar cyclohexane and lifting one carbon out of the plane of the ring the half chair conformation has much of the same strain effects predicted by the fully planar cyclohexane in the planar portion of half chair cyclohexane the cc bond angles are forced to o which creates significant amounts of angle strain also the corresponding ch bonds are fully eclipsed which create torsional strain the outofplane carbon allows for
