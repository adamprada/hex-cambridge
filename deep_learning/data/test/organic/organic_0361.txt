after completing this section you should be able to use conformational analysis to determine the most stable conformation of a given disubstituted cyclohexane key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below conformational analysis study notes when faced with the problem of trying to decide which of two conformers of a given disubstituted cyclohexane is the more stable you may find the following generalizations helpful a conformation in which both substituents are equatorial will always be more stable than a conformation with both groups axial when one substituent is axial and the other
