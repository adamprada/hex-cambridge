determining the more stable chair conformation becomes more complex when there are two or more substituents attached to the cyclohexane ring to determine the stable chair conformation the steric effects of each substituent along with any additional steric interactions must be taken into account for both chair conformations in this section the effect of conformations on the relative stability of disubstituted cyclohexanes is examined using the two principles substituents prefer equatorial rather than axial positions in order to minimize the steric strain created of diaxial interactions the more stable conformation will place the larger substituent in the equatorial position disubstituted
