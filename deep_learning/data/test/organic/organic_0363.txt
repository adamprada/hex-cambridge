group in an axial position versus equatorial is kjmol from table so both conformers will have equal amounts of steric strain thus the equilibrium between the two conformers does not favor one or the other note that both methyl groups cannot be equatorial at the same time without breaking bonds and creating a different molecule however if the two groups are different as in tertbutylmethylcyclohexane then the equilibrium favors the conformer in which the larger group tertbutyl in this case is in the more stable equatorial position the energy cost of having one tertbutyl group axial versus equatorial can be
