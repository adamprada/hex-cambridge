kjmol of steric strain due to diaxial interactions it is important to note that both chair conformations also have an additional kjmol of steric strain created by a gauche interaction between the two methyl groups overall both chair conformations have kjmol of steric strain and are of equal stability in transdimethylcyclohexane one chair conformer has both methyl groups axial and the other conformer has both methyl groups equatorial the conformer with both methyl groups equatorial has no diaxial interactions however there is till kjmol of strain created by a gauche interaction the conformer with both methyl groups axial has four
