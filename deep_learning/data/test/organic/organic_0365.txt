rings gauche interactions are not possible even without energy calculations it is simple to determine that the conformer with both methyl groups in the equatorial position will be the more stable conformer for transdimethylcyclohexane both conformations have one methyl axial and one methyl group equatorial each conformer has one methyl group creating a diaxial interaction so both are of equal stability summary of disubstitued cyclohexane chair conformations when considering the conformational analyses discussed above a pattern begins to form there are only two possible relationships which can occur between ringflip chair conformations aaee one chair conformation places both substituents in
