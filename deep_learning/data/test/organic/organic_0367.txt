and one conformation with both substituents equatorial based on this we can predict that the conformer which places both substituents equatorial will be the more stable conformer the energy difference of the two chair conformations will be based on the diaxial interactions created by both the methyl and chloro substituents as predicted one chair conformer places both substituents in the axial position and other places both substituents equatorial the more stable conformer will place both substituents in the equatorial position as shown in the structure on the right using the diaxial energy values given in the previous sections we can
