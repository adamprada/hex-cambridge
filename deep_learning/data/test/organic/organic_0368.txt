values may be difficult in these cases a determination of the more stable chair conformer can be made by empirically applying the principles of steric interactions a later chapter will discuss how many sugars can exist in cyclic forms which are often six remembered rings when in an aqueous solution the six carbon sugar glucose is usually a six membered ring adopting a chair conformation when looking at the two possible ringclip chair conformations one has all of the substituents axial and the other has all the substutents equatorial even without a calculation it is clear that the conformation with
