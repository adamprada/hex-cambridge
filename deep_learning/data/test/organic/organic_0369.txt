conformations for cisethylmethylcyclohexane using bondline structures and indicate the more energetically favored conformation draw the most stable conformation for transethylmethylcyclohexane using bondline structures draw the most stable conformation for transtbutylmethylcyclohexane using bondline structures draw the most stable conformation fo transisopropylmethylcyclohexane can a ring flip change a cisdisubstituted cyclohexane to trans explain draw the two chair conformations of the sixcarbon sugar mannose being sure to clearly show each nonhydrogen substituent as axial or equatorial predict which conformation is likely to be more stable and explain why solutions the bulkier isopropyl groups is in the equatorial position no in order to change
