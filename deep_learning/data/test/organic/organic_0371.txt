front ones this is an inherent limitation associated with representing a d structure in two dimensions conformational isomerism involves rotation about sigma bonds and does not involve any differences in the connectivity of the atoms or geometry of bonding two or more structures that are categorized as conformational isomers or conformers are really just two of the exact same molecule that differ only in rotation of one or more sigma bonds ethane conformations although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the
