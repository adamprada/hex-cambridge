geometry looks like when viewed from this perspective and flattened into two dimensions interactive element figure a d model of staggered ethane the lowest energy conformation of ethane shown in the figure above is called the staggered conformation in the staggered conformation all of the ch bonds on the front carbon are positioned at an angle of relative to the ch bonds on the back carbon this angle between a sigma bond on the front carbon compared to a sigma bond on the back carbon is called the dihedral angle in this conformation the distance between the bonds and the
