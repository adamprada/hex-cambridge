torsional strain or eclipsing strain is the name give to the energy difference caused by the increased electrostatic repulsion of eclipsing bonds another rotation returns the molecule to a second eclipsed conformation this process can be continued all around the circle with three possible eclipsed conformations and three staggered conformations in addition to an infinite number of variations in between we will focus on the staggered and eclipsed conformers since they are respectively the lowest and highest energy conformers unhindered free rotations do not exist in ethane the carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate the kcalmol torsional strain
