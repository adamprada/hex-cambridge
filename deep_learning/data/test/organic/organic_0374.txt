associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds valleys in the graph represent the low energy staggered conformers while peaks represent the higher energy eclipsed conformers although the conformers of ethane are in rapid equilibrium with each other the kcalmol energy difference leads to a substantial preponderance of staggered conformers at any given time the animation below illustrates the relationship between ethanes potential energy and its dihedral angle figure animation of potential energy vs dihedral angle in ethane exercises what is the most stable rotational conformation of ethane and explain why it is
