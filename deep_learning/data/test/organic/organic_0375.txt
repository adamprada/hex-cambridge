correlate energies of conformations with rotational energy diagrams and predict the most stable conformations for higher alkanes pentane and higher alkanes pentane and higher alkanes have conformational preferences similar to ethane and butane each dihedral angle tries to adopt a staggered conformation and each internal cc bond attempts to take on an anti conformation to minimize the potential energy of the molecule the most stable conformation of any unbranched alkane follows these rules to take on zigzag shapes figure the zigzag shapes of unbranched alkanes in their most stable conformations lets analyze the staggered conformations of pentane in more detail
