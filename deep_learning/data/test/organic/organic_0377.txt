derivatives as the one shown for methylcyclohexane note that this is similar to the newman projections from chapter such as nbutane newman projections of methylcyclohexane and nbutane when a substituent is added to a cyclohexane ring the two possible chair conformations created during a ring flip are not equally stable in the example of methylcyclohexane the conformation where the methyl group is in the equatorial position is more stable than the axial conformation by kjmol at o c the percentages of the two different conformations at equilibrium can be determined by solving the following equation for k the equilibrium constant
