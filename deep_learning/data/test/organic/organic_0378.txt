axial bonds are parallel to each other substituents larger than hydrogen experience greater steric crowding when they are oriented axial rather than equatorial consequently substituted cyclohexanes will preferentially adopt conformations in which the larger substituents are in the equatorial orientation when the methyl group is in the equatorial position this strain is not present which makes the equatorial conformer more stable and favored in the ring flip equilibrium actually diaxial steric strain is directly related to the steric strain created in the gauche conformer of butane discussed in section when butane is in the gauche conformation kjmol of strain was
