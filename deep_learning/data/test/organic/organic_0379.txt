and butane showing similarity of diaxial and gauche interactions strain values for other cyclohexane substituents can also be considered the relative steric hindrance experienced by different substituent groups oriented in an axial versus equatorial location on cyclohexane determined the amount of strain generated the strain generated can be used to evaluate the relative tendency of substituents to exist in an equatorial or axial location looking at the energy values in this table it is clear that as the size of the substituent increases the diaxial energy tends to increase also note that it is the size and not the molecular
