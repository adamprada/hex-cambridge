why it may help to use molecular model to answer this question solutions the ethyne group is linear and therefore does not affect the hydrogens in the positions to say to the extent as a bulkier or a bent group eg ethene group would this leads to less of a strain on the molecule the equatorial conformation of bromocyclohexane will have two diaxial interactions the table above states that each interaction accounts for kjmol of strain the total strain in equatorial bromocyclohexane will be kjmol kjmol remembering that the axial conformation is higher in energy the energy difference between the
