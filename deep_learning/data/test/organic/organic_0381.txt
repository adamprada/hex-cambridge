x x this means that bromocyclohexane is in the equatorial position of the time and in the axial position of the time the fact that cc sigma bonds can freely rotate allows the ethyl subsistent to obtain a conformation which places the bulky ch group away from the cyclohexane ring this forces the ethyl substituent to have only have diaxial interactions between hydrogens which only provides a slight difference to a methyl group exercises questions q in the molecule cyclohexyl ethyne there is little steric strain why solutions s the ethyne group is linear and therefore does not affect the
