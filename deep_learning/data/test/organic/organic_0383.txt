kjmol each to create a total of kjmol kjmol kjmol of strain this is the highest energy conformation for butane due to torsional strain caused by the electrostatic repulsion of electrons in the eclipsed bonds but also because of another type of strain called steric repulsion between the two rather bulky methyl groups steric strain comes about when two large groups such as two methyl groups try to occupy the same space what results is a repulsive noncovalent interaction caused by their respective electron densities if we rotate the front blue carbon by clockwise the butane molecule is now in
