energy than eclipsed conformation a one more rotation produces the anti conformation where the two methyl groups are positioned opposite each other and steric repulsion is minimized the anti conformation is the lowest energy conformation for butane the diagram below summarizes the relative energies for the various eclipsed staggered and gauche conformations interactive element figure a d structure of the anti butane conformer figure potential curve vs dihedral angle of the cc bond of butane figure newman projections of butane conformations their relative energy differences not total energies conformations form when butane rotates about one of its single covalent bond
