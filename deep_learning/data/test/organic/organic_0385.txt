of drawing it is conventional to draw straightchain alkanes in a zigzag form which implies the anti conformation at all carboncarbon bonds for example octane is commonly drawn as drawing newman projections newman projections are a valuable method for viewing the relative positions of groups within molecule being able to draw the newman projection for a given molecule is a valuable skill and will be used repeatedly throughout organic chemistry because organic molecules often contain multiple carboncarbon bonds it is important to precisely know which bond and which direction is being sighted for the newman projection the details of the
