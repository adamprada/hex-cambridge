asks for the least stable conformation focus on the three possible eclipsed newman projections draw out three eclipsed newman projections as a template because it is difficult to draw a true staggered newman projection it is common to show the bonds slightly askew place the substituents attached to the second carbon c on the back bonds of all three newman projections in this example they are chs and an h place the substituents in the same position on all three newman projections then place the substituents attached to the first carbon c on the front bonds of the newman projection
