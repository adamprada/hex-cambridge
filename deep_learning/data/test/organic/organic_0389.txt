number of carbons between the bridgeheads then place the numbers in square brackets in descending order separated by periods fused and bridged bycyclic compounds should have three numbers such as for fused compounds one of the numbers should be zero place the word bicyclo at the beginning of the name bicyclodecane bicyclodecane examples with carbons and hydrogens explicitly shown naming spiro compounds spiro bicyclics are named using the same basic rules because there is only one bridgehead carbon only two numbers will be required in the brackets also the word spiro is placed at the beginning examples conformations in bicyclic
