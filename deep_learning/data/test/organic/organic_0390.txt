describe because the fusion of the two rings creates a rigid roughly planar structure made up of two chair conformations unlike cyclohexane the two rings cannot flip from one chair form to another accordingly the orientation of the any substituents is fixed in either an axial or equatorial position in transdecalin this means that the cc bonds coming away from the fused edge are held in equatorial positions relative to each ring thus preventing the possibility of any diaxial interactions occurring between ring atoms interactive element the d structure of transdecalin kcal mol the two rings in cisdecalin are also
