conformations this axial cc bond causes diaxial interactions to occur in cisdecalin making it roughly kjmol less stable than transdecalin this amount of diaxial steric strain is roughly equivalent to that of an ethyl substituent attached to a cyclohexane ring kjmol bicyclic compounds with a bridge typically have very little flexibility and are often held in a ridged conformation the molecule norbornane represent a cyclohexane ring connected by a single carbon bridge norbornane bicycloheptane interactive element the d structure of norbornane norbornane is estimated to have kjmol of ring strain which can be understood when viewing the contained rings the
