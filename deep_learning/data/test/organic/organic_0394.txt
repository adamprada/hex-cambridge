give the lowest numbers possible for the substituent positions the substituent groups derived from cycloalkanes by removing one hydrogen are named by replacing the ending ane of the hydrocarbon with yl to give cycloalkyl thus cyclohexane becomes cyclohexyl cyclopentane becomes cyclopentyl and so on remember the numbering of the cycloalkyl substituent starts at the position of attachment and larger rings take precedence over smaller rings when a cycloalkane has an alkyl substituent the compound could be called either an alkylcycloalkane or a cycloalkylalkane the alkylcycloalkane name is the proper one in naming alkyl substituted cycloalkanes contributors and attributions john d
