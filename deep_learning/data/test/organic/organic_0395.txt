carbon atoms the simplest examples of this class consist of a single unsubstituted carbon ring and these form a homologous series similar to the unbranched alkanes the iupac names of the first five members of this series are given in the following table the last column gives the general formula for a cycloalkane of any size if a simple unbranched alkane is converted to a cycloalkane two hydrogen atoms one from each end of the chain must be lost hence the general formula for a cycloalkane composed of n carbons is cnhn although a cycloalkane has two fewer hydrogens than
