cyclic system because the parts that you would be trying to twist away from each other would still be connected together cyclic systems have fewer degrees of freedom than aliphatic systems they have restricted rotation because of the restricted rotation of cyclic systems most of them have much more welldefined shapes than their aliphatic counterparts lets take a look at the basic shapes of some common rings many biologically important compounds are built around structures containing rings so its important that we become familiar with them in nature three to sixmembered rings are frequently encountered so well focus on those
