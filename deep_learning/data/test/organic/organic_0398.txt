they do not have the expected ideal bond angle of o this causes an increase in the potential energy because of the desire for the carbons to be at an ideal o an example of ring strain can be seen in the diagram of cyclopropane below in which the bond angle is o between the carbons the reason for ring strain can be seen through the tetrahedral carbon model the ccc bond angles in cyclopropane diagram above o and cyclobutane o are much different than the ideal bond angle of o this bond angle causes cyclopropane and cyclobutane to have
