decrease in Î´hcombchcan be attributed to a decrease in the ring strain certain cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane deal with ring strain by forming conformers a conformer is a stereoisomer in which molecules of the same connectivity and formula exist as different isomers in this case to reduce ring strain the ring strain is reduced in conformers due to the rotations around the sigma bonds other types of strain there are many different types of strain that occur with cycloalkanes in addition to ring strain there is also transannular strain eclipsing or torsional strain and bond angle straintransannular strain exists when
