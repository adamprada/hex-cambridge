the corners of an equilateral triangle the ยบ bond angles are much smaller than the optimum ยบ angles of a normal tetrahedral carbon atom and the resulting angle strain dramatically influences the chemical behavior of this cycloalkane cyclopropane also suffers substantial eclipsing strain since all the carboncarbon bonds are fully eclipsed furthermore if you look at a model you will find that the neighboring ch bonds cc bonds too are all held in eclipsed conformations cyclopropane is always at maximum torsional strain this strain can be illustrated in a line drawing of cyclopropane as shown from the side in this
