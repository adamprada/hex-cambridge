about half as large as the optimum angle this factor introduces a huge amount of strain in the molecule called ring strain cyclobutane cyclobutane is a four membered ring in two dimensions it is a square with degree angles at each corner cyclobutane reduces some bondeclipsing strain by folding the outofplane dihedral angle is about ยบ but the total eclipsing and angle strain remains high cyclopentane has very little angle strain the angles of a pentagon are ยบ but its eclipsing strain would be large about kcalmol if it remained planar consequently the fivemembered ring adopts nonplanar puckered conformations whenever
