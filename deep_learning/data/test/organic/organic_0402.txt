the molecule can reach around to cause crowding steric strain is very low cyclobutanes are a little more stable than cyclopropanes and are also a little more common in nature cyclopentane cyclopentanes are even more stable than cyclobutanes and they are the secondmost common paraffinic ring in nature after cyclohexanes in two dimensions a cyclopentane appears to be a regular pentagon in three dimensions there is enough freedom of rotation to allow a slight twist out of this planar shape in a line drawing this threedimensional shape is drawn from an oblique view just like cyclobutane the ideal angle in
