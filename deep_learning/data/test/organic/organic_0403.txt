angle strain if they were planar however this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring exercise if cyclobutane were to be planar how many hh eclipsing interactions would there be and assuming kjmol per hh eclipsing interaction what is the strain on this planar
