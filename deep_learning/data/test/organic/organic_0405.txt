stabilities these structural and energetic relationships are summarized in the conformational energy diagram for cyclohexane below the chair conformation a closer look since the chair conformation has the lowest potential energy it is the most relevant to the conformation of cyclohexane on careful examination of a chair conformation of cyclohexane we find that the twelve hydrogens are not structurally equivalent six of them are located about the periphery of the carbon ring and are termed equatorial the other six are oriented above and below the approximate plane of the ring three in each location and are termed axial because they
