two axial hydrogens located on the same side of the ring the conformation in which the methyl group is equatorial is more stable and thus the equilibrium lies in this direction exercise questions consider the conformations of cyclohexane chair boat twist boat order them in increasing strain in the molecule draw two conformations of cyclohexyl amine chnh indicate axial and equatorial positions draw the two isomers of dihydroxylcyclohexane identify which are equatorial and axial in the following molecule label which are equatorial and which are axial then draw the chair flip showing labels answer chair twist boat boat most strain
