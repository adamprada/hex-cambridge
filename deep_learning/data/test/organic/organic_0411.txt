degrees of unsaturation a molecule only containing single bonds with no rings is considered saturated chchch methyoxypentane unlike saturated molecules unsaturated molecules contain double bonds triple bonds andor rings chchchch chlorooctyne there are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule although nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and infrared radiation ir are the primary ways of determining molecular structures these techniques require expensive instrumentation and are not always readily available fortunately calculating the degrees of unsaturation provides useful information about the structure the degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings
