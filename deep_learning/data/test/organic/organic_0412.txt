number of hydrogens the molecular formula of a hydrocarbon provides information about the possible structural types it may represent a saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by c which is the general molecular representation of an alkane as an example for the molecular formula ch the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is cx the compound needs more hydrogens in order
