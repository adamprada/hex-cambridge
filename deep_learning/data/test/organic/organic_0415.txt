calculate the degree of unsaturation dou for the following molecules a chn b chno c chbr the following molecule is caffeine chno determine the degrees of unsaturation dou answer a unsaturated even though rings only contain single bonds rings are considered unsaturated b unsaturated c saturated d unsaturated if the molecular structure is given the easiest way to solve is to count the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings however you can also determine the molecular formula and solve for the degrees of unsaturation by using the formula a b one double bond and the double bond from
