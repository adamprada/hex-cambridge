of calculating the standard enthalpy of a reaction from the appropriate bond dissociation energy data should be familiar to you from your firstyear chemistry course solvation is the interaction between solvent molecules and the ions or molecules dissolved in that solvent the homolytic bond dissociation energy is the amount of energy needed to break apart one mole of covalently bonded gases into a pair of radicals the si units used to describe bond energy are kilojoules per mole of bonds kjmol it indicates how strongly the atoms are bonded to each other introduction breaking a covalent bond between two partners
