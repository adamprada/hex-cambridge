energy change that occurs at k and the symbol is however it is commonly referred to as bde the bond dissociation energy and it is generally used albeit imprecisely interchangeably with the bond dissociation enthalpy which generally refers to the enthalpy change at room temperature k although there are technically differences between bdes at k and k those difference are not large and generally do not affect interpretations of chemical processes bond breakageformation bond dissociation energy or enthalpy is a state function and consequently does not depend on the path by which it occurs therefore the specific mechanism in how
