it does not matter what reactions are combined to make up the overall process using hesss law however bdes are convenient to use because they are readily available alternatively bdes can be used to assess individual steps of a mechanism for example an important step in free radical chlorination of alkanes is the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane to form a free radical rh cl r hcl the energy change for this step is equal to the difference in the bdes in rh and hcl this relationship shows that the hydrogen abstraction step is more favorable when bderh is
