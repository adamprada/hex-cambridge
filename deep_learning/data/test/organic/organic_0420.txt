as is often done analysis of the bdes shown in the table above shows that there are some systematic trends bdes vary with hybridization bonds with sp hybridized carbons are weakest and bonds with sp hybridized carbons are much stronger the vinyl and phenyl ch bonds are similar reflecting their sp hybridization the correlation with hybridization can be viewed as a reflection of the ch bond lengths longer bonds formed with sp orbitals are consequently weaker shorter bonds formed with orbitals that have more scharacter are similarly stronger ch bdes vary with substitution among sp hybridized systems methane has the
