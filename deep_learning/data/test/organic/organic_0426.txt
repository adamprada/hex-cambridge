first an energy barrier must be overcome to get to the product side the height of this energy barrier you may recall is called the activation energy Î´g the activation energy is what determines the kinetics of a reaction the higher the energy hill the slower the reaction at the very top of the energy barrier the reaction is at its transition state ts which is the point at which the bonds are in the process of breaking and forming the transition state is an activated complex a transient and dynamic state that unlike more stable species does not have
