which tells us that the rate of the reaction depends on the rate constant k as well as on the concentration of both reactants the rate constant can be determined experimentally by measuring the rate of the reaction with different starting reactant concentrations the rate constant depends on the activation energy of course but also on temperature a higher temperature means a higher k and a faster reaction all else being equal this should make intuitive sense when there is more heat energy in the system more of the reactant molecules are able to get over the energy barrier here
