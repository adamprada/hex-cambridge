concentrations of the various solutionphase or gasphase reactants and products and substituting these values into the law of mass action free energy the interaction between enthalpy and entropy changes in chemical reactions is best observed by studying their influence on the equilibrium constants of reversible reactions to this end a new thermodynamic function called free energy or gibbs free energy symbol is defined as shown in the first equation below two things should be apparent from this equation first in cases where the entropy change is small second the importance of in determining increases with increasing temperature where the temperature
