energy function provides improved insight into the thermodynamic driving forces that influence reactions a negative is characteristic of an exergonic reaction one which is thermodynamically favorable and often spontaneous as is the melting of ice at Âºc likewise a positive is characteristic of an endergonic reaction one which requires an input of energy from the surroundings for an example of the relationship of free energy to enthalpy consider the decomposition of cyclobutane to ethene shown in the following equation the standard state for all the compounds is gaseous this reaction is endothermic but the increase in number of molecules from
