k mole t temperature in k and k equilibrium constant note equation refeq is important because it demonstrates the fundamental relationship of to the equilibrium constant because of the negative logarithmic relationship between these variables a negative δgº generates a k whereas a positive δgº generates a k when δgº k furthermore small changes in δgº produce large changes in k a change of kcalmole in δgº changes k by approximately a factor of this interrelationship may be explored with the calculator on the right entering free energies outside the range to kcalmole or equilibrium constants outside the range to
