or controlled to shift the equilibrium in the desired direction by a range of experimental methods a theoretical understanding of the reaction free energy and equilibrium helps us predict and design the optimum reaction conditions for a desired product exercises at c the equilibrium constant keq for the reaction has a value of calculate δg for this reaction at c acetylene ch can be converted into benzene ch according to the equation at c δg for this reaction is kj and δh is kj determine δs and indicate whether the size of δs agrees with what you would have predicted
