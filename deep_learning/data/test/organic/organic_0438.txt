charge of recall that a carbocation should be pictured as sp hybridized with trigonal planar geometry perpendicular to the plane formed by the three sp hybrid orbitals is an empty unhybridized p orbital in the second step of this twostep reaction the nucleophile attacks the empty electron hungry p orbital of the carbocation to form a new bond and return the carbon to tetrahedral geometry we saw that sn reactions result specifically in inversion of stereochemistry at the electrophilic carbon center what about the stereochemical outcome of sn reactions in the model sn reaction shown above the leaving group dissociates
