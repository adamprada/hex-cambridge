after an sn reaction with water as the incoming nucleophile exercise draw the structure of the intermediate in the twostep nucleophilic substitution reaction above answer the sn reaction we see an example of a reaction intermediate a very important concept in the study of organic reaction mechanisms that was introduced earlier in the module on organic reactivity recall that many important organic reactions do not occur in a single step rather they are the sum of two or more discreet bondforming bondbreaking steps and involve transient intermediate species that go on to react very quickly in the sn reaction the
