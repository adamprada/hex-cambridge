and is therefore ratedetermining this is illustrated by the energy diagram where the activation energy for the first step is higher than that for the second step also recall that an sn reaction has first order kinetics because the rate determining step involves one molecule splitting apart not two molecules colliding we come now to the subject of catalysis our hypothetical bowl of sugar from section is still stubbornly refusing to turn into carbon dioxide and water even though by doing so it would reach a much more stable energy state there are in fact two ways that we could
