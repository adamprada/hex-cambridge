to go faster by lowering its activation energy how might you catalyze the conversion of sugar to carbon dioxide and water its not too hard just eat the sugar and let your digestive enzymes go to work catalyzing the many biochemical reactions involved in breaking it down enzymes are proteins and are very effective catalysts very effective in this context means very specific and very fast most enzymes are very selective with respect to reactant molecules they have evolved over millions of years to catalyze their specific reactions an enzyme that attaches a phosphate group to glucose for example will
