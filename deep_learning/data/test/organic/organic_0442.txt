groups is phosphorylated finally enzymes are capable of truly amazing rate acceleration typical enzymes will speed up a reaction by anywhere from a million to a billion times and the most efficient enzyme currently known to scientists is believed to accelerate its reaction by a factor of about see chemical and engineering news march p for an interesting discussion about this enzyme orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase we will now begin an exploration of some of the basic ideas about how enzymes accomplish these amazing feats of catalysis and these ideas will be revisited often throughout the rest of the text as
