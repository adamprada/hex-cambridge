molecular orbitalsmo theory and pi bondsexercisesanswerscontributors and attributions objectives after completing this section you should be able to describe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of molecular orbitals account for differences in bond length and strength in terms of the efficiency with which atomic orbitals overlap draw simple molecular orbital diagrams eg for the h molecule showing the formation of bonding and antibonding orbitals key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below antibonding molecular orbital bonding molecular orbital molecular orbital mo theory as we have seen valence bond theory does a
