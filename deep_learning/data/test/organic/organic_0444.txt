the hydrogen molecule using valence bond theory we said that the two s orbitals from each atom overlap allowing the two electrons to be shared and thus forming a covalent bond in molecular orbital theory we make a further statement we say that the two atomic s orbitals dont just overlap they actually combine to form two completely new orbitals these two new orbitals instead of describing the likely location of an electron around a single nucleus describe the location of an electron pair around two or more nuclei the bonding in h then is due to the formation of
