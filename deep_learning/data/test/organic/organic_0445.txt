lower in energy than either of the two isolated atomic s orbitals thus this sigma orbital is referred to as a bonding molecular orbital the second sigmastar Ïƒ orbital is higher in energy than the two atomic s orbitals and is referred to as an antibonding molecular orbital in mo theory a star sign always indicates an antibonding orbital following the aufbau building up principle we place the two electrons in the h molecule in the lowest energy molecular orbital which is the bonding sigma orbital the bonding sigma orbital which holds both electrons in the ground state of the
