another out bonding mos are the consequence of constructive interference between two atomic orbitals which results in an attractive interaction and an increase in electron density between the nuclei antibonding mos are the consequence of destructive interference which results in a repulsive interaction and a canceling out of electron density between the nuclei in other words a node mo theory and pi bonds in p orbitals the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases analogous to how a twodimensional wave has both parts above and below the average we indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes
