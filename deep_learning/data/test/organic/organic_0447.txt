higherenergy antibonding orbital the advantage of mo theory becomes more apparent when we think about pi bonds especially in those situations where two or more pi bonds are able to interact with one another lets first consider the pi bond in ethene from an mo theory standpoint in this example we will be disregarding the various sigma bonds and thinking only about the pi bond according to mo theory the two atomic pz orbitals combine to form two pi π molecular orbitals one a lowenergy π bonding orbital and one a highenergy πstar π antibonding molecular orbital these are sometimes
