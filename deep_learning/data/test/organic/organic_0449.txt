of the chemical bonds themselves we know that a covalent bond involves the sharing of a pair of electrons between two atoms but how does this happen and how does it lead to the formation of a bond holding the two atoms together two main models have been developed to described how covalent bonds are formed valence bond theory and molecularly orbital theory valence bond theory is most often used to describe bonding in organic molecules in this model covalent bonds are considered to form from the overlap of two atomic orbitals on different atoms each orbital containing a single
