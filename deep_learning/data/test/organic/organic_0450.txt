of atomic orbitals in the case of the hydrogen molecule the s orbital of one hydrogen atom overlaps with the s orbital of the second hydrogen atom to form a molecular orbital called a sigma bond which contains two electrons of opposite spin the mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond the strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger
