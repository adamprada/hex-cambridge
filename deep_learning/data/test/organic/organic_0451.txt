hydrogen atoms the colored curve changes as they approach each other when the atoms are far apart there is no overlap and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero as the atoms move together their orbitals begin to overlap each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom in addition the electrons begin to repel each other as do the nuclei while the atoms are still widely separated the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions and the energy of the system decreases a bond begins to form as the atoms
