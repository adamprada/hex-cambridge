interaction between two gaseous hydrogen atoms this optimal internuclear distance is the bond length for the h molecule the distance is pm picometers meters likewise the difference in potential energy between the lowest energy state at the optimal internuclear distance and the state where the two atoms are completely separated is called the bond dissociation energy or more simply bond strength for the hydrogen molecule the hh bond strength is equal to about kjmol this means it would take kj to break one mole of hh bonds every covalent bond in a given molecule has a characteristic length and strength
