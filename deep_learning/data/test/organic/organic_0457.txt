four dots are placed above below to the left and to the right of the symbol in any order as long as elements with four or fewer valence electrons have no more than one dot in each position the next dots for elements with more than four valence electrons are again distributed one at a time each paired with one of the first four fluorine for example with the electron configuration hesp has seven valence electrons so its lewis dot symbol is constructed as follows figure lewis dot symbols for the elements in period lewis used the unpaired dots to
