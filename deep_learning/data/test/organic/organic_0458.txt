are a tool to help draw structures we will see why bonding in molecular compounds follow lewis theory in the next seciont elements in the same period have the same number of valence electrons and similar lewis symbols for example the electron configuration for atomic sulfur is nesp thus there are six valence electrons its lewis symbol would therefore be similar oxygen and look like the octet rule lewiss major contribution to bonding theory was to recognize that atoms tend to lose gain or share electrons to reach a total of eight valence electrons called an octet this socalled octet
