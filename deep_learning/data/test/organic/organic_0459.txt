idea of an octet explains why noble gases rarely form compounds they have the stable sp configuration full octet no charge so they have no reason to react and change their configuration all other elements attempt to gain lose or share electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration this explains why atom combine together to form compounds by forming bond the makes the atoms more stable and lower in energy making bonds releases energy and represents a driving force for the formation of compounds atoms often gain lose or share electrons to achieve the same number of electrons as the
