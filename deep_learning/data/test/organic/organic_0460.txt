nonmetal are part of a compound some atoms achieve an octet by fully gaining or losing electrons to form ions ionic bonds form through the eletrostatic attraction of the created ions the formula for table salt is nacl it is the result of na ions and cl ions bonding together if sodium metal and chlorine gas mix under the right conditions they will form salt the sodium loses an electron and the chlorine gains that electron in the process a great amount of light and heat is released the resulting salt is mostly unreactive it is stable it will not
