electrons that is shared between two atoms is drawn as a single line designating a single covalent bond hydrogen represents a special case because a hydrogen atom cannot fulfill the octet rule it needs only two electrons to have a full shell this is often called the doublet rule for hydrogen one of the simplest organic molecules is methane with the molecular formula ch methane is the natural gas burned in home furnaces and hot water heaters as well as in electrical power generating plants to illustrate the covalent bonding in methane using a lewis structure we first must recognize
