the octetdoublet rule can be fulfilled for all of them by forming one carboncarbon bond and six carbonhydrogen bonds the same approach can be used for molecules in which there is no carbon atom in a water molecule the lewis symbol of the oxygen atom has two unpaired electrons these are paired with the single electron in the lewis symbols of the hydrogens two oh covalent bonds the remaining four nonbonding electrons on oxygen called lone pairs since the lone pair electrons are often not shown in chemical structures it is important to see mentally add the lone pairs in
