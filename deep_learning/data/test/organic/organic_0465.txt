trigonal planar ยบ linear ยบ figure in the three examples shown above the central atom carbon does not have any nonbonding valence electrons consequently the configuration may be estimated from the number of bonding partners alone however for molecules of water and ammonia the nonbonding electrons must be included in the calculation in each case there are four regions of electron density associated with the valence shell so that a tetrahedral bond angle is expected the measured bond angles of these compounds ho ยบ nh ยบ show that they are closer to being tetrahedral than trigonal planar or linear of
