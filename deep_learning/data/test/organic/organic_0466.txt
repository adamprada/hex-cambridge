and no lone pairs of electrons beh ax beh the central atom beryllium contributes two valence electrons and each hydrogen atom contributes one the lewis electron structure is figure lewis structure for beh there are two electron groups around the central atom we see from figure that the arrangement that minimizes repulsions places the groups apart both groups around the central atom are bonding pairs bp thus beh is designated as ax from figure we see that with two bonding pairs the molecular geometry that minimizes repulsions in beh is linear ax co the central atom carbon contributes four valence
