geometry of co is linear figure three electron groups ax bcl the central atom boron contributes three valence electrons and each chlorine atom contributes seven valence electrons the lewis electron structure is there are three electron groups around the central atom to minimize repulsions the groups are placed apart figure all electron groups are bonding pairs bp so the structure is designated as ax from figure we see that with three bonding pairs around the central atom the molecular geometry of bcl is trigonal planar ax co the central atom carbon has four valence electrons and each oxygen atom has
