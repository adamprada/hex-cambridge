for the first time axe so the central atom sulfur has valence electrons as does each oxygen atom with valence electrons the lewis electron structure is shown below there are three electron groups around the central atom two double bonds and one lone pair we initially place the groups in a trigonal planar arrangement to minimize repulsions figure there are two bonding pairs and one lone pair so the structure is designated as axe this designation has a total of three electron pairs two x and one e because a lone pair is not shared by two nuclei it occupies
