electrons and by a bonding pair as with so this composite model of electron distribution and negative electrostatic potential in ammonia shows that a lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space around the nitrogen atom than does a bonding pair of electrons that is shared with a hydrogen atom like lone pairs of electrons multiple bonds occupy more space around the central atom than a single bond which can cause other bond angles to be somewhat smaller than expected this is because a multiple bond has a higher electron density than a single bond so its electrons
