each hydrogen atom has one valence electron so the full lewis electron structure is there are four electron groups around the central atom as shown in figure repulsions are minimized by placing the groups in the corners of a tetrahedron with bond angles of all electron groups are bonding pairs so the structure is designated as ax with four bonding pairs the molecular geometry of methane is tetrahedral figure axe nh in ammonia the central atom nitrogen has five valence electrons and each hydrogen donates one valence electron producing the lewis electron structure there are four electron groups around nitrogen
