however the hnh bond angles are less than the ideal angle of because of lpbp repulsions axe ho oxygen has six valence electrons and each hydrogen has one valence electron producing the lewis electron structure there are four groups around the central oxygen atom two bonding pairs and two lone pairs repulsions are minimized by directing the bonding pairs and the lone pairs to the corners of a tetrahedron figure with two bonding pairs and two lone pairs the structure is designated as axe with a total of four electron pairs due to lplp lpbp and bpbp interactions we expect
