bh cf ho q why is sulfur dioxide a bent molecule bond angle less than solutions s hbh fcf oho s this deviation is due to the lone pairs on the sulfur these force the molecule to exhibit a bent geometry and therefore a deviation from the introductiondiastereomers vs enantiomersexercisesquestionssolutionscontributors and attributions objectives after completing this section you should be able to calculate the maximum number of stereoisomers possible for a compound containing a specified number of chiral carbon atoms draw wedgeandbrokenline structures for all possible stereoisomers of a compound containing two chiral carbon atoms with or without the aid
