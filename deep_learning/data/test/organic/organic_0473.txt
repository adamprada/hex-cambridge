as object and mirror image and are not enantiomers unlike enatiomers which are mirror images of each other and nonsumperimposable diastereomers are not mirror images of each other and nonsuperimposable diastereomers can have different physical properties and reactivity they have different melting points and boiling points and different densities they have two or more stereocenters introduction it is easy to mistake between diasteromers and enantiomers for example we have four steroisomers of bromobutanol the four possible combination are ss rr sr and rs figure one of the molecule is the enantiomer of its mirror image molecule and diasteromer of each
