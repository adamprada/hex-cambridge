achiral rr tartaric acid is enantiomer to is mirror image which is ss tartaric acid and diasteromers to mesotartaric acid figure rr and ss tartaric acid have similar physical properties and reactivity however mesotartaric acid have different physical properties and reactivity for example melting point of rr ss tartaric is about degree celsius and melting point of mesotartaric acid is about degree celsius figure we turn our attention next to molecules which have more than one stereocenter we will start with a common fourcarbon sugar called derythrose a note on sugar nomenclature biochemists use a special system to refer to
