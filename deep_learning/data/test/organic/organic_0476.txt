s configuration at c lthreose is a diastereomer of both erythrose enantiomers in general a structure with n stereocenters will have n different stereoisomers we are not considering for the time being the stereochemistry of double bonds that will come later for example lets consider the glucose molecule in its openchain form recall that many sugar molecules can exist in either an openchain or a cyclic form there are two enantiomers of glucose called dglucose and lglucose the denantiomer is the common sugar that our bodies use for energy it has n stereocenters so therefore there are n possible stereoisomers
