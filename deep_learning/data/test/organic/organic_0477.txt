the structure of two more diastereomers of dglucose one should be an epimer answer erythronolide b a precursor to the macrocyclic antibiotic erythromycin has stereocenters its enantiomer is that molecule in which all stereocenters are inverted in total there are stereoisomers in the erythronolide b family of these are diastereomers of the structure above one is the enantiomer of the structure above and the last is the structure above we know that enantiomers have identical physical properties and equal but opposite degrees of specific rotation diastereomers in theory at least have different physical properties we stipulate in theory because sometimes
