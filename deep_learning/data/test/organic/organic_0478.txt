diastereomers are stereoisomers with two or more chiral centers that are not enantiomers diastereomers have different physical properties melting points boiling points and densities depending on the reaction mechanism diastereomers can produce different stereochemical products introduction so far we have been analyzing compounds with a single chiral center next we turn our attention to those which have multiple chiral centers well start with some stereoisomeric fourcarbon sugars with two chiral centers to avoid confusion we will simply refer to the different stereoisomers by capital letters look first at compound a below both chiral centers in have the r configuration you
