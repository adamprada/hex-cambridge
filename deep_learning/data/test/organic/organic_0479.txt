the same bond connectivity but a different arrangement of atoms in space recall that this is the definition of the term stereoisomer however they are not mirror images of each other confirm this with your models and so they are not enantiomers by definition they are diastereomers of each other notice that compounds c and b also have a diastereomeric relationship by the same definition so compounds a and b are a pair of enantiomers and compound c is a diastereomer of both of them does compound c have its own enantiomer compound d is the mirror image of compound
