come to that later heres another way of looking at the four stereoisomers where one chiral center is associated with red and the other blue pairs of enantiomers are stacked together we know using the shortcut above that the enantiomer of rr must be ss both chiral centers are different we also know that rs and sr are diastereomers of rr because in each case one but not both chiral centers are different diastereomers vs enantiomers in wine chemistry tartaric acid cho is an organic compound that can be found in grape bananas and in wine the structures of tartaric
