in these situations it can be helpful to recognize the role of each reagent to discern patterns anti dihydroxylation epoxides may be cleaved by aqueous acid to give glycols that are often diastereomeric with those prepared by the synhydroxylation reaction described above proton transfer from the acid catalyst generates the conjugate acid of the epoxide which is attacked by nucleophiles such as water in the same way that the cyclic bromonium ion described above undergoes reaction the result is antihydroxylation of the double bond in contrast to the synstereoselectivity of the earlier method in the following equation this procedure is
