osmium tetroxide in pyridine solution both reactions appear to proceed by the same mechanism shown below the metallocyclic intermediate may be isolated in the osmium reaction in basic solution the purple permanganate anion is reduced to the green manganate ion providing a nice color test for the double bond functional group from the mechanism shown here we would expect synstereoselectivity in the bonding to oxygen and regioselectivity is not an issue when viewed in context with the previously discussed addition reactions the hydroxylation reaction might seem implausible permanganate and osmium tetroxide have similar configurations in which the metal atom occupies
