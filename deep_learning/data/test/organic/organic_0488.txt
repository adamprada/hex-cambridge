learning objective determine relative strengths of acids and bases from their pka values determine the form of an acid or base at a specified ph given the pka the hendersonhasselbach equation a quantitative view we will use the general reaction for a weak acid to write the ka expression pka log ka where each bracketed term represents the concentration of that substance in solution the stronger an acid the greater the ionization the lower the pka and the lower the ph the compound will produce in solution it is important to realize that pka is not at all the same
