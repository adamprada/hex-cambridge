ph the compound will produce in solution some selected pka values for compounds in the study of organic chemistry are shown bellow since organic reactions can be performed in nonaqueous environments the ph can exceed and organic compounds can have pka values above it is a variation on that line from the wizard of oz we dont live in water anymore it is a very good idea to commit to memory the approximate pka ranges of the compounds above a word of caution when using the pka table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair
