list the value as these texts have incorrectly factored the molar value for the concentration of water into the equilibrium constant the correct derivation of the equilibrium constant involves the activity of water which has a value of example while this course begins with single functional groups we will eventually work with interesting compounds containing multiple functional groups recognizing which hydrogens can be ionized as acidic protons and which hydrogens can not is a useful skill notice in this example that we need to evaluate the potential acidity at four different locations on the molecule aldehyde and aromatic protons are
