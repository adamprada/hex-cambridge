single double and triple covalent bond covalent bonds are shown using lines the number of dashes indicate whether the bond is a single double or triple covalent bond all atom labels are shown and all lone pairs are shown a bc condensed formula a condensed formula is made up of the elemental symbols condensed structural formulas show the order of atoms like a structural formula but are written in a single line to save space and make it more convenient and faster to write out the order of the atoms suggests the connectivity in the molecule condensed structural formulas are
