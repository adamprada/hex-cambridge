identical molecule under the kekul√© structures and the line formulas a chchoh b clchchchochch c hcnhchcooh lets look closely at example b as you go through a condensed formula you want to focus on the carbons and other elements that arent hydrogen the hydrogens are important but are usually there to complete octets also notice the och is in written in parentheses which tell you that it not part of the main chain of carbons as you read through a a condensed formula if you reach an atom that doesnt have a complete octet by the time you reach the
