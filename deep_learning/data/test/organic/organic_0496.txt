carbons four bonds hydrogens that are attached to elements other than carbon are shown atom labels for all other elements are shown lone pair electrons are usually omitted they are assumed to be present to complete the octet of noncarbon atoms line formulas help show the structure and order of the atoms in a compound a b c these molecules correspond to the exact same molecules depicted for kekul√© structures and condensed formulas notice how the carbons are no longer drawn in and are replaced by the ends and bends of a lines in addition the hydrogens have been omitted
