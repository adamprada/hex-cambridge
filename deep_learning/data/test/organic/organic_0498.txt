to convert it to a kekule structure first identify the carbons in the molecule the will be at the corners and ends of line without an atom label trimethyl amine has three carbons next add hydrogens to the carbons until four bonds are present each carbon in trimethyl amine is singly bonded to nitrogen this means each carbon will need three additional ch bonds to create its octet lastly add lone pairs to other elements to fill their octets the nitrogen in trimethyl amine is bonded to three carbons this means it will require one of lone pair electrons to
