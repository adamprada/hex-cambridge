form another lone pair on the oxygen the curved arrow in structure b represents type resonance motion the pi bond breaks to form a new pi bond to the carbocation carbon in structure c there are two curved arrows the curved arrow from the oxygen lone pair is type resonance motion the lone pairs forms a new pi bond between the oxygen and carbon the other arrow in structure c moves the pi bond to the end of the chain and represents resonance type by combining these three basic types of electron movement we can describe virtually any type of
