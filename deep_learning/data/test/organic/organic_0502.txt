contributor answer recognizing common patterns of resonance if you examine a large number of resonance examples you will begin to notice that they nearly always match common patterns of which there are only three it is important to be able to identify atoms that participate in resonance in complex resonance cases multiple types of resonance may occur simultaneously type i the electrons of a pi bond move to become a set of lone pair electrons on a electronegative atom the resonance structure made has a carbon with a violated octet which make it a minor contributor this type of resonance
