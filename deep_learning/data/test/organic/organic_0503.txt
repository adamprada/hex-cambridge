cases with all carbon this type of resonance can be identified by a threeatom group of atoms each with sp hybridization and a p orbital type iii example atoms with lone pair electrons next to a pi bond can be sp hybridized and have the lone pair of electrons in a p orbital despite the fact that they are surrounded by four electron groups the lone pair electrons contained in the p orbital cause the ion to be stabilized due to resonance similarly carbocations are sphybridized with an empty p orbital oriented perpendicular to the plane formed by three sigma
