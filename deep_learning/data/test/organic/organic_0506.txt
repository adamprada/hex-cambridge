have a resonance structure with a negative charge b draw the two most important resonance contributors for the enolate ion answer the two major contributors are those in which the negative formal charge is located on an oxygen rather than on a carbon exercise a draw three additional resonance contributors for the carbocation below include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how one contributor is converted to the next b fill in the blanks the conjugated pi system in this carbocation is composed of p orbitals sharing delocalized pi electrons exercise draw the major resonance contributor for each
