the unique chemistry of the element introduction before assigning the electrons of an atom into orbitals one must become familiar with the basic concepts of electron configurations every element on the periodic table consists of atoms which are composed of protons neutrons and electrons electrons exhibit a negative charge and are found around the nucleus of the atom in electron orbitals defined as the volume of space in which the electron can be found within probability the four different types of orbitals spd and f have different shapes and one orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons the p
