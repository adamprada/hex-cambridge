energy levels they occupy different spaces around the nucleus each orbital can be represented by specific blocks on the periodic table the sblock is the region of the alkali metals including helium groups the dblock are the transition metals groups to the pblock are the main group elements from groups to and the fblock are the lanthanides and actinides series using the periodic table to determine the electron configurations of atoms is key but also keep in mind that there are certain rules to follow when assigning electrons to different orbitals the periodic table is an incredibly helpful tool in
