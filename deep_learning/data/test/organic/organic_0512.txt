to remember this pattern probably the easiest is to refer to the periodic table and remember where each orbital block falls to logically deduce this pattern another way is to make a table like the one below and use vertical lines to determine which subshells correspond with each other pauli exclusion principle the pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers the first three n l and ml may be the same but the fourth quantum number must be different a single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons which must have
