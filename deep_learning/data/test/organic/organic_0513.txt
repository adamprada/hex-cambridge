to these which would be either ms or ms as we already know from our studies of quantum numbers and electron orbitals we can conclude that these four quantum numbers refer to the s subshell if only one of the ms values are given then we would have s denoting hydrogen if both are given we would have s denoting helium visually this is be represented as as shown the s subshell can hold only two electrons and when filled the electrons have opposite spins hunds rule when assigning electrons in orbitals each electron will first fill all the orbitals
