element in the biology of plants s s p we can clearly see that p orbitals are halffilled as there are three electrons and three p orbitals this is because hunds rule states that the three electrons in the p subshell will fill all the empty orbitals first before filling orbitals with electrons in them if we look at the element after nitrogen in the same period oxygen z its electron configuration is s s p for an atom oxygen has one more electron than nitrogen and as the orbitals are all half filled the electron must pair up the
