itself the greater the value the greater the attractiveness for electrons trends in electronegativity across a period the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract the negatively charged electrons as the number of protons in the nucleus increases the electronegativity or attraction will increase therefore electronegativity increases from left to right in a row in the periodic table this effect only holds true for a row in the periodic table because the attraction between charges falls off rapidly with distance the chart shows electronegativities from sodium to chlorine ignoring argon since it does not does not form bonds trends in
