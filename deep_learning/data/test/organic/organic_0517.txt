sodium chloride as if it were covalently bonded both sodium and chlorine have their bonding electrons in the level the electron pair is screened from both nuclei by the s s and p electrons but the chlorine nucleus has more protons in it it is no wonder the electron pair gets dragged so far towards the chlorine that ions are formed electronegativity increases across a period because the number of charges on the nucleus increases that attracts the bonding pair of electrons more strongly why does electronegativity fall as you go down a group as you go down a group
