when there is a separation of charge they can occur between two ions in an ionic bond or between atoms in a covalent bond dipole moments arise from differences in electronegativity the larger the difference in electronegativity the larger the dipole moment the distance between the charge separation is also a deciding factor into the size of the dipole moment the dipole moment is a measure of the polarity of the molecule bond polarity dipole moment atoms with differences in electronegativity will share electrons unequally the shared electrons of the covalent bond are held more tightly at the more electronegative
