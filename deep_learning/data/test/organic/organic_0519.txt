bond a polar covalent bond and an ionic bond using lewis electron structures in a purely covalent bond a the bonding electrons are shared equally between the atoms in a purely ionic bond c an electron has been transferred completely from one atom to the other a polar covalent bond b is intermediate between the two extremes the bonding electrons are shared unequally between the two atoms and the electron distribution is asymmetrical with the electron density being greater around the more electronegative atom electronrich negatively charged regions are shown in blue electronpoor positively charged regions are shown in red
