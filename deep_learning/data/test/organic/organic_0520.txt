the molecule nonpolar a molecule can only be polar if the structure of that molecule is not symmetric a good example of a nonpolar molecule that contains polar bonds is carbon dioxide this is a linear molecule and the co bonds are in fact polar the central carbon will have a net positive charge and the two outer oxygens a net negative charge however since the molecule is linear these two bond dipoles cancel each other out ie vector addition of the dipoles equals zero and the overall molecule has no dipole Î¼ although a polar bond is a prerequisite
