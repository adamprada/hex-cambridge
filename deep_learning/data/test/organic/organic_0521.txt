is no overall separation of charge from top to bottom or from left to right in contrast chcl is a polar molecule right panel in figure above the hydrogen at the top of the molecule is less electronegative than carbon and so is slightly positive this means that the molecule now has a slightly positive top and a slightly negative bottom and so is overall a polar molecule a polar molecule will need to be lopsided in some way example ccl although the ccl bonds are rather polar the individual bond dipoles cancel one another in this symmetrical structure and
