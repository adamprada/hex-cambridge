the electrons have been dragged slightly towards one end how far does this dragging have to go before the bond counts as ionic there is no real answer to that sodium chloride is typically considered an ionic solid but even here the sodium has not completely lost control of its electron because of the properties of sodium chloride however we tend to count it as if it were purely ionic lithium iodide on the other hand would be described as being ionic with some covalent character in this case the pair of electrons has not moved entirely over to the
