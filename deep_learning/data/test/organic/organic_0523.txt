is not polar in the sense that it doesnt have an end or a side which is slightly negative and one which is slightly positive the whole of the outside of the molecule is somewhat negative but there is no overall separation of charge from top to bottom or from left to right in contrast chcl is a polar molecule right panel in figure above the hydrogen at the top of the molecule is less electronegative than carbon and so is slightly positive this means that the molecule now has a slightly positive top and a slightly negative bottom and
