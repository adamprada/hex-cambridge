discovered radiation beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum this radiation came to be known as ultraviolet and soon was recognized as being especially effective in causing chemical reactions absorption of light in the ultraviolet and visible regions produces changes in the electronic energies of molecules associated with excitation of an electron from a stable to an unstable orbital because the energy required to excite the valenceshell electrons of molecules is comparable to the strengths of chemical bonds absorption may lead to chemical reactions we discussed this briefly in chapter in connection with photochemical halogenation of alkanes a more
