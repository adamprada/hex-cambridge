relatively broad figure the ultraviolet spectrum of propanone acetone in cyclohexane the ultraviolet spectrum of propanone acetone is shown in figure the weak absorption which peaks ie has at is the result of excitation of one of the unshared electrons on oxygen to a higher energy level this is called an often transition in which denotes that the excited electron is one of the unshared electrons on oxygen and pi star denotes that the excited electron goes to a highenergy antibonding orbital of the carbonoxygen double bond cf sections and c the same kind of n rightarrow pi transition occurs
