molecules if we remember that absorptions at longer wavelengths correspond to less energetic transition it can be deduced from the values that less energy is required to excite unshared nonbonding electrons than electrons in double or triple bonds which in turn require less energy than electrons in single bonds figure figure sequence of electronic orbital energies showing different kinds of transitions in approximate order of increasing energy left to right the and transitions usually have low transition probabilities meaning the bands have low or zero intensities b effects of conjugation on electronic spectra the transition for ethene has and it
