systems is less than for isolated systems of double bonds for butadiene and hexadiene we can calculate from equation that the transition energy is about less for the conjugated system the ground state of butadiene is stabilized by perhaps relative to a nonconjugated system of double bonds which means that the excited state must be much more stabilized than this if the transition energy is to be less than for hexadiene why is the excited state of a conjugated system of double bonds stabilized more relative to the ground state than for a nonconjugated system resonance theory provides an explanation
