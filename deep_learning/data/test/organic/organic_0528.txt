be greater than that of the ground state with one dominant pairing scheme the more double bonds in the conjugated system the smaller the energy difference between the normal and excited states the diphenylpolyenes of formula absorb radiation at progressively longer wavelengths as is increased this is apparent from the colors of the compounds which range from colorless with to orange with to red with as goes from the ultraviolet into the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum similar effects are found with conjugated and double bonds for example the electronic spectra of butanone and butenone are shown in figure
