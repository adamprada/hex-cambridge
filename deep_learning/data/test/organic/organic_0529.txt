alkanes and cycloalkanes have no lowenergy electronic transitions comparable to conjugated systems or molecules with nonbonding electrons therefore alkanes and cycloalkanes show no absorption above and are good solvents to use for electronic spectroscopy figure electronic spectra of a butanone and b butenone in cyciohexane solution c applications of electronic spectroscopy how do we use electronic spectroscopy in chemical analysis the two principal applications are structure determinations and quantitative analysis the position and intensity of an electronic absorption band provides information as to chemical structure such absorptions normally are not as useful as infrared absorptions because they do not give
