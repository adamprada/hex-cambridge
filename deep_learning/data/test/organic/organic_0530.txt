and the molar intensities of the absorption bands are known then we can use the degree of absorption for quantitative analysis with the aid of the beerlambert law see table for definitions by measuring the absorbance of a sample of known in a cell of known path length the concentration may be determined because changes in absorbance reflect changes in concentration it is possible to use absorbance measurements to follow rates of chemical reactions to determine equilibrium constants such as the dissociation constants of acids and bases and to follow conformational changes in bioorganic molecules such as proteins and nucleic
