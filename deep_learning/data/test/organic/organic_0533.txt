proportionality constant h is a fundamental constant plancks constant albert einstein used the quantization of energy to explain the photoelectric effect the photoelectric effect when photons of sufficiently high energy strike a metal surface electrons are emitted from the metal the emitted electrons are drawn toward the other electrode which is a positive terminal as a result current flows in a circuit photon smallest increment a quantum of radiant energy a photon of light with frequency v has an energy equal to hv when a photon strikes the metal its energy is transferred to an electron in the metal a
