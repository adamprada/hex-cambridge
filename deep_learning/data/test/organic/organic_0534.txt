has only a single wavelength is monochromatic and is produced by devices called lasers which use transitions between two atomic energy levels to produce light in a very narrow range of wavelengths atoms can also absorb light of certain energies resulting in a transition from the ground state or a lowerenergy e line spectra radiation composed of a single wavelength is said to be monochromatic spectrum distribution among various wavelengths of the radiant energy emitted or absorbed by an object continuous spectrum rainbow of colors containing light of all wavelengths not all radiation sources produce a continuous spectrum line spectrum
