energy state of an atom excited state when the electron is in higher energy orbit less negative n or higher if n becomes infinitely large the electron is completely separated from the nucleus thus the state in which the electron is removed from the nucleus is the reference or zeroenergy state of the hydrogen atom it is important to remember that this zeroenergy state is higher in energy than the states with negative energies electrons can change from one energy state to another by absorbing or emitting radiant energy radiant energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to
