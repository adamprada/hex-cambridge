is impossible to precisely describe both the location and the speed of particles that exhibit wavelike behavior momentum the product of the mass m and the velocity v of a particle matter waves term used to describe the wave characteristics of a particle where is the wavelength is plancks constant is the particle mass and is the velocity the uncertainty principle uncertainty principle theory first put forth by heisenberg states that is it impossible to determine both the exact momentum of the electron and its exact location quantum mechanics and atomic orbitals there is a relationship between the motions of
