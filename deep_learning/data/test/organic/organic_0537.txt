will be found at a given point in space electron density the probability of finding and electron at any particular point in an atom equals Ïˆ orbitals and quantum numbers orbital allowed energy state of an electron in the quantummechanical model of the atom also used to describe the spatial distribution of an electron defined by the value of quantum numbers n l and ml value of l letter used s p d f the principal quantum number n can have integral values of and so forth as n increases the orbital becomes larger the electron has a higher energy
