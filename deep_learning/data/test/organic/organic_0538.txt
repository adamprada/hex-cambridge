values each shell is divided into the number of subshells equal to the principal quantum number n for that shell the first shell consists of only the s subshell the second shell consists of two subshells s and p the third of three subshell s p and d and so forth each subshell is divided into orbitals each s subshell consists of one orbital each p subshell of three orbitals each d subshell of five and each f subshell of seven orbitals d representation of orbitals orbitals with l are s orbitals and are spherically symmetrical with the greatest probability
