regions where Ïˆ goes to zero the number of nodes increases with increasing value for the principal quantum number n the p orbitals electron density is concentrated on two sides of the nucleus separated by a node at the nucleus the orbitals of a given subshell have the same size and shape but differ from each other in orientation the axis along which the orbital is oriented is not related to ml manyelectron atoms in addition to the three quantum numbers dictated by quantum mechanics a fourth quantum number is required to explain certain properties of atoms this is the
