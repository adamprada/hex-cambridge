repulsions cause different subshells to be at different energies effective nuclear charge effective nuclear charge net positive charge attracting electrons where is the effective nuclear charge is the number of protons in the nucleus and is the average number of electrons between the nucleus and electron in question screening effect effect of inner electrons in decreasing the nuclear charge experienced by outer electrons energies of orbitals the extent to which an electron will be screened by the other electrons depends on its electron distribution as we move outward from the nucleus in a manyelectron atom for a given value of
