opposite directions in which the electron can spin pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers n l ml ms this means that if we wish to put two electrons in an orbital and satisfy paulis exclusion principle our only choice is to assign different ms values to the electrons because there are only two values we can conclude that an electron can hold a maximum of two electrons and they must have opposite spins electron configurations based on the pauli principle and a knowledge of orbital energies
