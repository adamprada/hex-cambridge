diagram representation of electron configuration in which each orbital is represented by a box and each electron by a halfarrow a halfarrow pointing upward represents an electron with positive spin one pointing downward represents an electron with a negative spin writing electron configurations hunds rule rule stating that electrons occupy degenerate orbitals in such a way as to maximize the number of electrons with the same spin in other words each orbital has one electron placed in it before paring of electron in orbitals occurs note that this rule applies to orbitals that are degenerate which means that they have
