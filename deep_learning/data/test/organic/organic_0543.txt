elements aka representatives s and p block elements fblock metals elements located below the table f block elements contributors and attributions in predicting bond angles in small molecules we find we can do a great deal with the simple idea that unlike charges produce attractive forces while like charges produce repulsive forces we will have electronnuclear attractions electronelectron repulsions and nucleusnucleus repulsions let us first consider the case of a molecule with just two electronpair bonds as might be expected to be formed by combination of beryllium and hydrogen to give beryllium hydride the problem will be how to formulate
