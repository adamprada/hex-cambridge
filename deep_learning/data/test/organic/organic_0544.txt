the and orbitals as shown in also see figure we might formulate a second bond involving the orbital but a new problem arises as to where the hydrogen should be located relative to the beryllium orbital is it as in or some other way the and nuclei will be farther apart in than they will be in or any other similar arrangement so there will be less internuclear repulsion with we therefore expect the hydrogen to locate along a line going through the greatest extension of the orbital according to this simple picture beryllium hydride should have two different types
