experiment because is unstable and reacts with itself to give a highmolecularweight solid however a number of other compounds such as and are known to have bonds involving valence states measurements of the bond angles at the metal of these substances in the vapor state has shown them to be uniformly figure representation of the relative sizes of and orbitals how are the and orbitals deployed in this kind of bonding it turns out that stronger bonds are formed when the degree of overlap of the orbitals is high the degree of overlap will depend on the sizes of the
