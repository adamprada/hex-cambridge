combinations of and orbitals may overlap better and make more effective bonds than do the individual and orbitals the mathematical procedure for orbital hybridization predicts that an and a orbital of one atom can form two stronger covalent bonds if they combine to form two new orbitals called hybridized orbitals figure each hybrid orbital has an overlapping power of compared to the pure orbital taken as unity and a pure orbital as bond angles of are expected for bonds to an atom using hybrid orbitals and of course this also is the angle we expect on the basis of our
