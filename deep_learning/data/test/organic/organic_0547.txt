using the valencestate electronic configuration are expected to be planar with bond angles of for example any departure from the planar arrangement will be less stable because it will increase internuclear and interelectronic repulsion by bringing nuclei closer together and the electron pairs closer together the and orbitals used in bonding in these compounds can be hybridized to give three equivalent orbitals figure these orbitals have their axes in a common plane and are at to one another the predicted overlapping power is figure diagram of three hybrid orbitals made from an orbital a orbital and a orbital each orbital
