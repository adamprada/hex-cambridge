is held in a molecular orbital above and below the plane of the molecule a molecular orbital is a region of space within the molecule where there is a high probability of finding a particular pair of electrons in this diagram the line between the two carbon atoms represents a normal sigma bond the pair of shared electrons lies in a molecular orbital on the line between the two nuclei where you would expect them to be the other pair of electrons is found somewhere in the shaded part above and below the plane of the molecule this bond is
