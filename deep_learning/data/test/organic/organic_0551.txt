the x atom carries a slight positive charge partial positive the slightly positive x atom is an electrophile and attracts the exposed pi electrons in the ethene now imagine what happens as they approach each other the electrons in the half of the pi bond nearest the xy are attracted to the partial positive charge as shown below the two electrons in the pi bond move closer towards the x until a covalent bond is made simultaneously the electrons in the xy bond are pushed entirely onto the y to form the anion y ion and a carbocation as shown
