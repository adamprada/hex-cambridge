different stereoisomeric products electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes can be stereoselective depending on the symmetry and structure of the alkene the details will be discussed in a later sections of this chapter exercise in the next section we will apply the electrophilic addition mechanism to actual compounds draw the complete mechanism when hydrogen bromide gas is bubbled through a solution of cyclopentene answer contributors jim clark chemguidecouk addition to symmetrical alkenesmechanismreaction ratescontributors and attributions objectives after completing this section you should be able to explain the term electrophilic addition reaction using the reaction of a protic acid hx with an
