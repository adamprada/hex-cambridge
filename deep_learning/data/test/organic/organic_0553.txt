halide to propene shown in the reading is quite detailed normally an organic chemist would write this mechanism as follows however the more detailed mechanism shown in the reading does allow you to see the exact fate of all the electrons involved in the reaction in your previous chemistry course you were probably taught the importance of balancing chemical equations it may come as a surprise to you that organic chemists usually do not balance their equations and often represent reactions using a format which is quite different from the carefully written balanced equations encountered in general chemistry courses in
