would give only mol mol of d you will gain firsthand experience of such situations in the laboratory component of this course this page looks at the reaction of the carboncarbon double bond in alkenes such as ethene with hydrogen halides such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide symmetrical alkenes like ethene or butene are dealt with first these are alkenes where identical groups are attached to each end of the carboncarbon double bond addition to symmetrical alkenes what happens all alkenes undergo addition reactions with the hydrogen halides a hydrogen atom joins to one of the carbon atoms originally
