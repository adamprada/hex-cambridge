would be different of the alkene was unsymmetrical thats why we have to look at them separately mechanism the addition of hydrogen halides is one of the easiest electrophilic addition reactions because it uses the simplest electrophile the proton hydrogen halides provide both a electrophile proton and a nucleophile halide first the electrophile will attack the double bond and take up a set of Ï€ electrons attaching it to the molecule this is basically the reverse of the last step in the e reaction deprotonation step the resulting molecule will have a single carbon carbon bond with a positive charge
