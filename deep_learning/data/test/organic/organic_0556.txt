weaker as x gets larger poor overlap of orbitalss reaction rates variation of rates when you change the halogen reaction rates increase in the order hf hcl hbr hi hydrogen fluoride reacts much more slowly than the other three and is normally ignored in talking about these reactions when the hydrogen halides react with alkenes the hydrogenhalogen bond has to be broken the bond strength falls as you go from hf to hi and the hydrogenfluorine bond is particularly strong because it is difficult to break the bond between the hydrogen and the fluorine the addition of hf is bound
