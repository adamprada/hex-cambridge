because the electrons in the pi bond attract things with any degree of positive charge anything which increases the electron density around the double bond will help this alkyl groups have a tendency to push electrons away from themselves towards the double bond the more alkyl groups you have the more negative the area around the double bonds becomes the more negatively charged that region becomes the more it will attract molecules like hydrogen chloride the more important reason though lies in the stability of the intermediate ion formed during the reaction the three examples given above produce these carbocations
