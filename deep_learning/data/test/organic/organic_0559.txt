pasteur contributed to the development of the concept of the tetrahedral carbon atom because enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in achiral environments separation of the stereoisomeric components of a racemic mixture or racemate is normally not possible by the conventional techniques of distillation and crystallization in some cases however the crystal habits of solid enantiomers and racemates permit the chemist acting as a chiral resolving agent to discriminate enantiomeric components of a mixture as background for the following example it is recommended that the section on crystal properties be reviewed tartaric acid its potassium salt known in antiquity
