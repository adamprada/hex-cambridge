enantiomorphic hemihedral crystals a drawing of such a pair is shown on the right pasteur reasoned that the dissymmetry of the crystals might reflect the optical activity and dissymmetry of its component molecules after picking the different crystals apart with a tweezer he found that one group yielded the known dextrorotatory tartaric acid measured by biot the second led to a previously unknown levorotatory tartaric acid having the same melting point as the dextrorotatory acid today we recognize that pasteur had achieved the first resolution of a racemic mixture and laid the foundation of what we now call stereochemistry optical
