of the biological molecules such as our dna amino acids and sugars are chiral molecules this must mean that enantiomers have properties that make them different from their mirror image molecule one of these properties is that chiral molecules do not have a plane of symmetry or an internal mirror plane so a chiral molecule cannot be divided into two identical halves another property of chiral molecules is optical activity organic compounds molecules created around a chain of carbon atoms more commonly known as the the carbon backbone play an essential role in the chemistry of life these molecules derive
