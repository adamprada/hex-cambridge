atoms in threedimensional space stereoisomers stereoisomers are as mentioned above molecules that contain different types of isomers within itself each with distinct characteristics that further separate each other as different chemical entities having different properties type called entaniomer are the previouslymentioned mirrorimage stereoisomers and will be explained in detail in this article another type diastereomer has different properties and will be introduced afterwards enantiomers this type of stereoisomer is the essential mirrorimage nonsuperimposable type of stereoisomer introduced in the beginning of the article figure provides a perfect example note that the gray plane in the middle denotes the mirror plane
