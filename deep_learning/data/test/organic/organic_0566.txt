same and nonsuperimposable this is where the concept of chirality comes in as one of the most essential and defining idea of stereoisomerism chirality chirality essentially means mirrorimage nonsuperimposable molecules and to say that a molecule is chiral is to say that its mirror image it must have one is not the same as it self whether a molecule is chiral or achiral depends upon a certain set of overlapping conditions figure shows an example of two molecules chiral and achiral respectively notice the distinct characteristic of the achiral molecule it possesses two atoms of same element in theory and
