is a simple but essential idea to support the concept of stereoisomerism being used to explain one type of its kind the chemical properties of the chiral molecule differs from its mirror image and in this lies the significance of chilarity in relation to modern organic chemistry it is pretty interesting that our hands seem to serve the same purpose but most people are only able to use one of their hands to write similarly this is true with chiral biological molecules and interactions contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma
