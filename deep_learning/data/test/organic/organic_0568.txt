excitation of the type described for atoms but also by changes in the vibrational and rotational energies both rotations and vibrations of molecules are quantized this means that only particular values of rotational angular momentum or vibrational energy are possible we speak of these permitted values of the energies as the vibrational and rotational energy levels translational energy is not very important in connection with spectroscopy and will not be considered here references john d robert and marjorie c caserio basic principles of organic chemistry second edition w a benjamin inc menlo park ca isbn this content is copyrighted under
