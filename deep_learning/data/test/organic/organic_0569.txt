must both be in the axial position for the e reaction to occur consequently e reactions of certain cycloalkyl halides show unusual rates and regioselectivity that are not explained by the principles thus far discussed for example transmethylchlorocyclohexane reacts with alcoholic koh at a much slower rate than does its cisisomer furthermore the product from elimination of the transisomer is methylcyclohexene not predicted by the zaitsev rule whereas the cisisomer gives the predicted methylcyclohexene as the chief product these differences are described by the first two equations in the following diagram unlike open chain structures cyclic compounds generally restrict the
