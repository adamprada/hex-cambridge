sixmembered rings so the anti orientation of groups requires that they assume a diaxial conformation the observed differences in rate are the result of a steric preference for equatorial orientation of large substituents which reduces the effective concentration of conformers having an axial halogen in the case of the bromotertbutylcyclohexane isomers the tertbutyl group is so large that it will always assume an equatorial orientation leaving the bromine to be axial in the cisisomer and equatorial in the trans because of symmetry the two axial betahydrogens in the cisisomer react equally with base resulting in rapid elimination to the same
