e elimination is present only in the less stable alternative chair conformer but this structure has only one axial betahydrogen colored red and the resulting elimination gives methylcyclohexene in the cisisomer the smaller chlorine atom assumes an axial position in the more stable chair conformation and here there are two axial beta hydrogens the more stable methylcyclohexene is therefore the predominant product and the overall rate of elimination is relatively fast an orbital drawing of the antitransition state is shown on the right note that the base attacks the alkyl halide from the side opposite the halogen just as in
