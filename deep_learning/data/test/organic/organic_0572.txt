instead in an e reaction stereochemistry of the double bond that is whether the e or z isomer results is dictated by the stereochemistry of the starting material if it is diastereomeric in other words if the carbon with the hydrogen and the carbon with the halogen are both chiral then one diastereomer will lead to one product and the other diastereomer will lead to the other product the following reactions of potassium ethoxide with dibromostilbene dibromodiphenylethane both occurred via an e mechanism two different diastereomers were used two different stereoisomers e vs z resulted exercise which of the following
