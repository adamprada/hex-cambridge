which an alkyl group undergoes a similar migration again taking a bonding pair of electrons with it these migrations usually occur between neighbouring carbon atoms and hence are termed hydride shifts or alkyl shifts a hydride ion consists of a proton and two electrons that is h hydride ions exist in compounds such as sodium hydride nah and calcium hydride cah an electrophilic reaction such as hx with an alkene will often yield more than one product this is strong evidence that the mechanism includes intermediate rearrangement steps of the cation hydride shift a hydride shift is a carbocation rearrangement
