paper onto the plane of the paper step pull the two bonds going into the plane of the paper onto the plane of the paper step omit the chiral atom symbol for convenience this is the fischer projection of rlactic acid the stereochemical formula for rlactic acid can be drawn using either method to build this skill we begin by drawing the structures and converting them step wise models can also be helpful eventually we will be able to mentally conversion between these two structures exercise convert each compound into the alternate sterochemical structure perspective fischer answer see also dlconvention
