in context the key term below valence electrons bonding and nonbonding electrons formal charge carbocations study notes it is more important that students learn to easily identify atoms that have formal charges of zero than it is to actually calculate the formal charge of every atom in an organic compound students will benefit by memorizing the normal number of bonds and nonbonding electrons around atoms whose formal charge is equal to zero determining the formal charge on an atom a formal charge compares the number of electrons around a neutral atom an atom not in a molecule versus the number
