formal charge of valence electrons in free atom of lonepair electrons of bond pair electrons eqn to illustrate this method lets calculate the formal charge on the atoms in ammonia nh whose lewis structure is as follows a neutral nitrogen atom has five valence electrons it is in group from the lewis structure the nitrogen atom in ammonia has one lone pair and three bonds with hydrogen atoms substituting into equation we obtain formal charge of n valence e lone pair e x bond pair e a neutral hydrogen atom has one valence electron each hydrogen atom in the molecule
