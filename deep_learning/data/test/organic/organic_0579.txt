stable lewis structure in cases where there must be positive or negative formal charges on various atoms the most stable structures generally have negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms and positive formal charges on the less electronegative atoms the next example further demonstrates how to calculate formal charges for polyatomic ions example calculate the formal charges on each atom in the nh ion given chemical species asked for formal charges strategy identify the number of valence electrons in each atom in the nh ion use the lewis electron structure of nh to identify the number of bonding and
