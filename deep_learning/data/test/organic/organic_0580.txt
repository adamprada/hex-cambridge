the formal charges on the atoms in the nh ion are thus adding together the formal charges on the atoms should give us the total charge on the molecule or ion in this case the sum of the formal charges is which is the same a s the overall charge of the ammonium polyatomic ion exercise write the formal charges on all atoms in bh answer determining the charge of atoms in organic structures the calculation method reviewed above for determining formal charges on atoms is an essential starting point for a novice organic chemist and works well when dealing
