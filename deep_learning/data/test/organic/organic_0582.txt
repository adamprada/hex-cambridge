charge of carbanions occur when the carbon atom has three bonds plus one lone pair of electrons carbanions have valence electrons and a formal charge of two other possibilities are carbon radicals and carbenes both of which have a formal charge of zero a carbon radical has three bonds and a single unpaired electron carbon radicals have valence electrons and a formal charge of zero carbenes are a highly reactive species in which a carbon atom has two bonds and one lone pair of electrons giving it a formal charge of zero though carbenes are rare you will encounter them
