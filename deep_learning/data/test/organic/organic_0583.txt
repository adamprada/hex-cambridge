charge of zero the exceptions to this rule are the proton h the hydride ion h and the hydrogen radical h the proton is a hydrogen with no bonds and no lone pairs and a formal charge of the hydride ion is a is a hydrogen with no bonds a pair of electrons and a formal charge of the hydrogen radical is a hydrogen atom with no bonds a single unpaired electron and a formal charge of because this book concentrates on organic chemistry as applied to living things however we will not be seeing naked protons and hydrides as
