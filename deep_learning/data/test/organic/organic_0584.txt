and lone pairs that has a formal charge and oxygen with bonds and lone pair that has a formal charge of all three patterns of oxygen fulfill the octet rule if it has two bonds and two lone pairs as in water it will have a formal charge of zero if it has one bond and three lone pairs as in hydroxide ion it will have a formal charge of if it has three bonds and one lone pair as in hydronium ion it will have a formal charge of oxygen can also exist as a radical such as where
