charged nitrogen has two bonds and two lone pairs phosphorus and sulfur two third row elements are commonly found in biological organic molecules phosphorus and sulfur although both of these elements have other bonding patterns that are relevant in laboratory chemistry in a biological context sulfur almost always follows the same bondingformal charge pattern as oxygen while phosphorus is present in the form of phosphate ion po where it has five bonds almost always to oxygen no lone pairs and a formal charge of zero remember that elements in the third row of the periodic table have d orbitals in
