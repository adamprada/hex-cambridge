internalized so that you dont even need to think about them will allow you to draw large organic structures complete with formal charges quite quickly once you have gotten the hang of drawing lewis structures it is not always necessary to draw lone pairs on heteroatoms as you can assume that the proper number of electrons are present around each atom to match the indicated formal charge or lack thereof occasionally though lone pairs are drawn if doing so helps to make an explanation more clear exercise please identify an atom with a nonneutral charge in the following atom answer
