to give oxygen five valence electrons the oxygen has one nonbonding lone pair and three unpaired electrons which can be used to form bonds to three hydrogen atoms using formal charges to distinguish between lewis structures as an example of how formal charges can be used to determine the most stable lewis structure for a substance we can compare two possible structures for co both structures conform to the rules for lewis electron structures co c is less electronegative than o so it is the central atom c has valence electrons and each o has valence electrons for a total
