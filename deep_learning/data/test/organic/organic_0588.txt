from each oxygen to form a symmetrical structure or take both electron pairs from a single oxygen atom to give an asymmetrical structure both lewis electron structures give all three atoms an octet how do we decide between these two possibilities the formal charges for the two lewis electron structures of co are as follows both lewis structures have a net formal charge of zero but the structure on the right has a charge on the more electronegative atom o thus the symmetrical lewis structure on the left is predicted to be more stable and it is in fact the
