preferred arrangement of electrons given chemical species asked for lewis electron structures formal charges and preferred arrangement strategy a use the stepbystep procedure to write two plausible lewis electron structures for scn b calculate the formal charge on each atom using equation c predict which structure is preferred based on the formal charge on each atom and its electronegativity relative to the other atoms present solution a possible lewis structures for the scn ion are as follows b we must calculate the formal charges on each atom to identify the more stable structure if we begin with carbon we notice
