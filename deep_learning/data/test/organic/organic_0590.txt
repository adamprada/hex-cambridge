pairs and has one lone pair and has a total of valence electrons the formal charge on the nitrogen atom is therefore in b the nitrogen atom has a formal charge of in c the nitrogen atom has a formal charge of c which structure is preferred structure b is preferred because the negative charge is on the more electronegative atom n and it has lower formal charges on each atom as compared to structure c versus exercise salts containing the fulminate ion cno are used in explosive detonators draw three lewis electron structures for cno and use formal charges
