solvent like water or an alcohol then the solvent becomes the nucleophile in the second step and reacts with the bromonium or chloronium ion to form a halohydrin as shown below rccr x ho rcohcrx there are also other halogencontaining reagents that add to double bonds such as hypohalous acids hox and sulfenyl chlorides rscl these reagents are unsymmetrical so their addition to unsymmetrical double bonds may in principle take place in two ways in practice these addition reactions are regioselective with one of the two possible constitutionally isomeric products being favored the electrophilic moiety in both of these reagents
