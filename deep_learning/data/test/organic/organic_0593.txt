percentage than the leaving group and reacts with the most substituted carbon of the cyclic bromonium or chloronium ion to create regiochemistry the stereochemistry of this reaction is antiaddition because the solvent approaches the bromonium ion with back side orientation to produce the addition product however since the interaction of the halogen with the alkene can occur from above or below there is no stereochemical control in this reaction and a mixture of enantiomers will be produced when applicable the final step of this mechanism is a proton transfer to a solvent water molecule to neutralize the addition product hox
