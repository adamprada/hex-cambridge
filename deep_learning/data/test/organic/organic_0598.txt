ethene the simplest alkene example is a gas that serves as a cellular signal in fruits to stimulate ripening if you want bananas to ripen quickly put them in a paper bag along with an apple the apple emits ethene gas setting off the ripening process in the bananas ethyne commonly called acetylene is used as a fuel in welding blow torches alkenes and alkynes alkenes have trigonal planar electron geometry due to sp hybrid orbitals at the alkene carbons while alkynes have linear geometry due to sp hybrid orbitals at the alkyne carbons furthermore many alkenes can take two
