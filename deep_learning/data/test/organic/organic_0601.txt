atom of an ether has been replaced by a sulfur atom amines amines are characterized by nitrogen atoms with single bonds to hydrogen and carbon just as there are primary secondary and tertiary alcohols there are primary secondary and tertiary amines ammonia is a special case with no carbon atoms one of the most important properties of amines is that they are basic and are readily protonated to form ammonium cations in the case where a nitrogen has four bonds to carbon which is somewhat unusual in biomolecules it is called a quaternary ammonium ion note do not be confused
