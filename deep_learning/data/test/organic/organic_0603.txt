is a carbonyl bonded to an amine in esters the carbonyl carbon is bonded to an oxygen which is itself bonded to another carbon another way of thinking of an ester is that it is a carbonyl bonded to an alcohol thioesters are similar to esters except a sulfur is in place of the oxygen in an acid anhydride there are two carbonyl carbons with an oxygen in between an acid anhydride is formed from combination of two carboxylic acids with the loss of water anhydride an anhydride in an acyl phosphate the carbonyl carbon is bonded to the oxygen
