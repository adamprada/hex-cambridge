volatility which is usually inversely proportional to their boiling points part a in figure shows a cutaway drawing of a column used in the petroleum industry for separating the components of crude oil the petroleum is heated to approximately c f and becomes a mixture of liquid and vapor this mixture called the feedstock is introduced into the refining tower the most volatile components those with the lowest boiling points condense at the top of the column where it is cooler while the less volatile components condense nearer the bottom some materials are so nonvolatile that they collect at the
