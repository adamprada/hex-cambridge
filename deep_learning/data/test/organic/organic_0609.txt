is a diagram of a distillation column used for separating petroleum fractions b petroleum fractions condense at different temperatures depending on the number of carbon atoms in the molecules and are drawn off from the column the most volatile components those with the lowest boiling points condense at the top of the column and the least volatile those with the highest boiling points condense at the bottom the economics of petroleum refining are complex for example the market demand for kerosene and lubricants is much lower than the demand for gasoline yet all three fractions are obtained from the distillation
