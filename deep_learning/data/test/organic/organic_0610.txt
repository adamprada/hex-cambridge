fraction thus in cracking a straightchain alkane with a number of carbon atoms corresponding to the kerosene fraction is converted to a mixture of hydrocarbons with a number of carbon atoms corresponding to the lighter gasoline fraction the second process used to increase the amount of valuable products is called reforming it is the chemical conversion of straightchain alkanes to either branchedchain alkanes or mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons using metals such as platinum brings about the necessary chemical reactions the mixtures of products obtained from cracking and reforming are separated by fractional distillation octane ratings the quality of a fuel
