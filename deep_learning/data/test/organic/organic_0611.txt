of engine performing at a particular level figure the burning of gasoline in an internal combustion engine a normally fuel is ignited by the spark plug and combustion spreads uniformly outward b gasoline with an octane rating that is too low for the engine can ignite prematurely resulting in uneven burning that causes knocking and pinging the octane scale was established in using a standard test engine and two pure compounds nheptane and isooctane trimethylpentane nheptane which causes a great deal of knocking on combustion was assigned an octane rating of whereas isooctane a very smoothburning fuel was assigned an
