of this work in any format contributors and attributions we now wish to discuss displacements by nucleophilic reagents on alkyl derivatives these are ionic or polar reactions involving attack by a nucleophile at carbon a typical example is the reaction of hydroxide ion with bromomethane to displace bromide ion the electron pair of the bond can be regarded as having been donated by the hydroxide ion while the electron pair of the bond departs with the leaving bromide ion the name for this type of reaction is abbreviated for substitution and for nucleophilic reactions of this type are very useful
