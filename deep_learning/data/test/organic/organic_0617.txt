rather we shall approach the subject here through consideration of the mechanisms of reactions and then develop the scope of the reactions in later chapters the mechanism of an reaction and the reactivity of a given alkyl compound toward a nucleophile depend upon the nature of and and upon the nature of the solvent for an reaction to occur at a reasonable rate it is very important to select a solvent that will dissolve both the alkyl compound and the nucleophilic reagent considerable assistance may be required from both the solvent and the nucleophile to break what usually is a
