is useful however if we want to decide in advance whether such a reaction is actually feasible we have to know more particularly we have to know whether the reaction proceeds in the direction it is written and if so whether conditions can be found under which it proceeds at a convenient rate obviously if one were to mix methane and chlorine and find that at most only conversion to the desired product occurred and that the conversion could be achieved only after a day or so of strong heating this reaction would be both too unfavorable and too slow
