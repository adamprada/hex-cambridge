favorable and unfavorable when proceeding from left to right along the reaction coordinate on the upper level where any disturbance would cause them to roll down to the lower level under the influence of gravity thereby losing energy if the upper level is modified and a low fence added to hold the balls in place it will be just as energetically favorable as when the fence is not there for the balls to be at the lower level the difference is that the process will not occur spontaneously without some major disturbance we can say there is an energy barrier
