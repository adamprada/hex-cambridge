of their thermal motions or from some external agency to permit the reactants to get over the barrier and be transformed into products we shortly will discuss this more but first we wish to illustrate another important concept with our mechanical analogy that of equilibrium and equilibration with gentle shaking of our twolevel box all of the balls on the upper level are expected to wind up on the lower level there will not be enough activation to have them go from the lower to the upper level in this circumstance we can say that the balls are not equilibrated
