the opposite direction the balls now will be equilibrated between the two levels at equilibrium the fraction of the balls on each of the two levels is wholly independent of the height of the barrier just as long as the activation shaking is sufficient to permit the balls to go both ways the diagrams of figure are to be interpreted in the same general way if thermal agitation of the molecules is sufficient then equilibrium can be expected to be established between the reactants and the products whether the overall reaction is energetically favorable left side of figure or energetically
