reaction takes place therefore the reaction is energetically favorable but the activation energy is greater than can be attained by thermal agitation alone at room temperature heat or light therefore must initiate a pathway for the reactants to be converted to products that has a low barrier or activation energy could we have predicted the results of this experiment ahead of time first we must recognize that there really are several questions here could we have decided whether the reaction was energetically favorable that the dark reaction would be slow at room temperature that light would cause the reaction to
