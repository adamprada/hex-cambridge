relationship among the amounts of reactants and products is given by the equilibrium constant expression in which is the equilibrium constant the quantities within the brackets of equation denote either concentrations for liquid reactants or partial pressures for gaseous substances if the equilibrium constant is greater than then on mixing equal volumes of each of the participant substances all are gases above reaction to the right will be initially faster than reaction to the left until equilibrium is established at this point there will be more chloromethane and hydrogen chloride present than methane and chlorine however if the equilibrium constant
