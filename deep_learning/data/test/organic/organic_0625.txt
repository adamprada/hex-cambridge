of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride from methane and chlorine has a of and of per mole of formed at combustion of hydrogen with oxygen to give water has a of and per mole of water formed at however this correlation between and is neither universal nor rigorous reactions are known that absorb heat are endothermic and yet have other reactions have large values and equilibrium constants much less than the problem is that the energy change that correlates with is not but the socalled change of standard gibbs energy and if we know we can calculate by the equation in
