values the situation is not wholly hopeless because there is a relationship between and that also involves and another quantity the standard entropy change of the process this equation shows that and are equal when is zero therefore the sign and magnitude of determine how well correlates with now we have to give attention to whether we can estimate values well enough to decide whether the of a given reaction calculated from bond energies or other information will give a good or poor measure of b entropy and molecular disorder to decide whether we need to worry about with regard
