molecules have different degrees of translational vibrational and rotational freedom and hence different average degrees of molecular disorder or randomness now if for a chemical reaction the degree of molecular disorder is different for the products than for the reactants there will be a change in entropy and a spectacular example of the effect of molecular disorder in contributing to the difference between and is afforded by the formation of liquid nonane from solid carbon and hydrogen gas at with and equations and can be rearranged to calculate and from and and these and values can be compared to those
