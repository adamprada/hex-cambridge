less important solid carbon has an ordered rigid structure with little freedom of motion of the individual carbon atoms these carbons are less constrained in nonane and this would tend to make more positive and more negative corresponding to an increase in equations and however this is a small effect on compared to the enormous difference in the degree of disorder of hydrogen between hydrogen gas and hydrogen bound to carbon in nonane negative entropy effects usually are observed in ringclosure reactions such as the formation of cyclohexane from hexene which occur with substantial loss of rotational freedom disorder about
