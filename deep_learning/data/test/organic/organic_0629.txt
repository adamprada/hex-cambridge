of thumb to predict whether should be greater or less than unity for vaporphase reactions involving simple molecules some idea of the degree of success to be expected from this rule may be inferred from the examples in table which also contains a further comparison of some experimental values with those calculated from bond energies suppose is positive what hope do we have of obtaining a useful conversion to a desired product there is no simple straightforward and general answer to this question when the reaction is reversible the classic procedure of removing one or more of the products to
