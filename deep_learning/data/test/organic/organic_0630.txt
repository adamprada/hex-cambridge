understanding of why methane and chlorine do not react in the dark we must consider the details of how the reaction occurs that is the reaction mechanism the simplest mechanism would be for a chlorine molecule to collide with a methane molecule in such a way as to have chloromethane and hydrogen chloride formed directly as a result of a concerted breaking of the and bonds and making of the and bonds see figure the failure to react indicates that there must be an energy barrier too high for this mechanism to operate why should this be so figure fourcenter
