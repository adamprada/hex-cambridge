per mole of neon atoms generally to bring nonbonded atoms to nearbonding distances to requires a large expenditure of energy as can be seen in figure interatomic repulsive forces increase rapidly at short distances and pushing a chlorine molecule into a methane molecule to attain distances similar to the carbonchlorine bond distance in chloromethane would require a considerable amount of compression see figure valuable information figure models showing the degree of atomic compression required to bring a chlorine molecule to within bonding distance of carbon and hydrogen of methane about interatomic repulsions can be obtained with spacefilling models of the
