reaction mechanisms a slow stepwise reaction is dynamically analogous to the flow of sand through a succession of funnels with different stem diameters the funnel with the smallest stem will be the most important bottleneck and if its stem diameter is much smaller than the others it alone will determine the flow rate generally a multistep chemical reaction will have a slow ratedetermining step analogous to the funnel with the small stem and other relatively fast steps which may occur either before or after the slow step a possible set of steps for the chlorination of methane follows reactions and
