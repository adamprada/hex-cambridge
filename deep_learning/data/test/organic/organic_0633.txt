at temperatures below it is very rare indeed that the thermal agitation alone can supply sufficient energy to break any significant number of bonds stronger than to the bond energy from table is which is much too great to allow bond breaking from thermal agitation at in accord with reaction for reaction it is not advisable to use the bond energy from table because this is one fourth of the energy required to break all four bonds section more specific bonddissociation energies are given in table and it will be seen that to break one bond of methane requires at
