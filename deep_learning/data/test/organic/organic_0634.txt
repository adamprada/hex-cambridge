an ionizing solvent that will assist ionization both of these processes will be discussed later the point here is that ionic dissociation is not a viable step for the vaporphase chlorination of methane d why does light induce the chlorination of methane first we should make clear that the light does more than provide energy merely to lift the molecules of methane and chlorine over the barrier of figure this is evident from the fact that very little light is needed far less than one light photon per molecule of chloromethane produced the light could activate either methane or chlorine
