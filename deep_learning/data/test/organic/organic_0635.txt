collision moreover the interatomic repulsions should be considerably smaller than in the fourcenter mechanism discussed previously for the reaction of molecular chlorine with methane because only two centers have to come close together figure the methyl radical resulting from the attack of atomic chlorine on a hydrogen of methane then can remove a chlorine atom from molecular chlorine and form chloromethane and a new chlorine atom use of bonddissociation energies gives a calculated of for this reaction which is certainly large enough by our rule of thumb to predict that will be greater than attack of a methyl radical on
