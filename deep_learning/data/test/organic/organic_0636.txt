molecules through operation of a chain or cycle of reactions in our example chlorine atoms formed by the action of light on figure models showing the degree of atomic compression required to bring a chlorine atom to within bonding distance of a methane hydrogen compare with figure can induce the chlorination of methane by the chainpropagating steps in practice chain reactions are limited by socalled termination processes in our example chlorine atoms or methyl radicals are destroyed by reacting with one another as shown in the following equations chain reactions may be considered to involve three phases first chain initiation
