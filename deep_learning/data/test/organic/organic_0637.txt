bonds to begin to break the evidence is strong that bondforming reactions between atoms and radicals usually are diffusioncontrolled that there is almost no barrier or activation energy required and the rates of combination are simply the rates at which encounters between radicals or atoms occur if the rates of combination of radicals or atoms are so fast you might well wonder how chain propagation ever could compete of course competition will be possible if the propagation reactions themselves are fast but another important consideration is the fact that the atom or radical concentrations are very low suppose that the
