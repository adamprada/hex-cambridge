substances that can combine with atoms or radicals and convert them into species incapable of participating in the chainpropagation steps such substances are called radical traps or inhibitors oxygen acts as an inhibitor in the chlorination of methane by rapidly combining with a methyl radical to form the comparatively stable less reactive peroxymethyl radical this effectively terminates the chain e can we predict whether reactions will be fast or slow to a considerable degree we can predict relative reactivities provided we use common sense to limit our efforts to reasonable situations in the preceding section we argued that reactions in
