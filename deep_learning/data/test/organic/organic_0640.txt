energetically feasible the reaction is and this is indeed true for complex reactions involving many steps but our intuitive parallel between rate and usually works quite well for the rates of individual steps this is borne out by experimental data on rates of removal of a hydrogen atom from methane by atoms or radicals such as which generally parallel the strength of the new bond formed similarly if we look at the bonddissociation energies of the hydrocarbons shown in table we would infer that would remove a hydrogen most rapidly from the carbon forming the weakest bond and again this
