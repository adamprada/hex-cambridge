more favorable reaction at the methyl group even though the second propagation step is energetically favorable by and presumably would occur very rapidly use of bonddissociation energies to predict relative reaction rates becomes much less valid when we try to compare different kinds of reactions to illustrate ethane might react with to give fluoromethane or hydrogen fluoride it is not a good idea to try to predict the relative rates of these two reactions on the basis of their overall values because the nature of the bonds made and broken is too different f how should we go about formulating
