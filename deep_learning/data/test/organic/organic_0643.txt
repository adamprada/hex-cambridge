overall transformation in terms of discrete steps that are individually simple enough surely to be concerted and that also involves energetically reasonable intermediates such an analysis of a reaction in terms of discrete mechanistic steps offers many possibilities for experimental studies especially in development of procedures for detecting the existence even if highly transitory of the proposed intermediates we shall give many examples of the fruitfulness of this kind of approach in subsequent discussions if calculations based on chemical equilibrium constants are unfamiliar to you we suggest you study one of the general chemistry texts listed for supplemental reading at
