alkene and a halogen occurs note the formation of the bridged bromonium ion intermediate and the anti stereochemistry of the final product because the two bromine atoms come from opposite faces of the double bond additional evidence in support of the bromonium ion mechanism comes from the results obtained when an alkene such as cyclopentene reacts with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride see figure reaction of an alkene with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride below figure reaction of an alkene with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride once formed the bromonium ion is susceptible to
