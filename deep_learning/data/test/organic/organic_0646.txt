creates a dipole moment in the halogenhalogen bond heterolytic bond cleavage occurs and one of the halogens obtains a positive charge and reacts as an electrophile the reaction of the addition is not regioselective but is stereoselective stereochemistry of this addition can be explained by the mechanism of the reaction in the first step the electrophilic halogen with the positive charge approaches the pi bond and p orbitals of the halogen bond with two carbon atoms creating a cyclic ion with a halogen as the intermediate in the second step the remaining halide ion halogen with the negative charge attacks
