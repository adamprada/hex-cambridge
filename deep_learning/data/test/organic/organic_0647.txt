commonly used in this type of the reaction are and in thermodynamical terms is too slow for this reaction because of the size of its atom and is too vigorous and explosive because the halide ionh can attack any carbon from the opposite side of the ring it creates a mixture of steric products optically inactive starting material produce optically inactive achiral products meso or a racemic mixture electrophilic addition mechanism consists of two steps before constructing the mechanism let us summarize conditions for this reaction we will use br in our example for halogenation of ethylene nucleophile double bond
