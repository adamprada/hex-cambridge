where x br or cl chemists often abbreviate the names of frequently used chemicals dmso for dimethyl sulfoxide nbs for nbromosuccinimide etc you should already be familiar with some similar examples from everyday life ddt for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane pcb for polychlorinated biphenyl and asa for acetylsalicylic acid aspirin you can see how someone with a limited knowledge of chemistry could misinterpret the abbreviation nbsit is not a compound containing nitrogen boron and sulfur nbs can serve as a less dangerous and easier to handle replacement for br in the formation of bromohydrins the proton is not the only electrophilic species that
