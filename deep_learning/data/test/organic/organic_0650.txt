below proceeds by an initial electrophilic attack on the pielectrons of the double bond dihalocompounds in which the halogens are bound to adjacent carbons are called vicinal from the latin vicinalis meaning neighboring rccr x rcxcrx other halogencontaining reagents which add to double bonds include hypohalous acids hox and sulfenyl chlorides rscl these reagents are unsymmetrical so their addition to unsymmetrical double bonds may in principle take place in two ways in practice these addition reactions are regioselective with one of the two possible constitutionally isomeric products being favored the electrophilic moiety in both of these reagents is the halogen
