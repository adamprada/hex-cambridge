shown on the right in the case of hypochlorous and hypobromous acids hox these weak br√∏nsted acids pkas ca do not react as proton donors and since oxygen is more electronegative than chlorine or bromine the electrophile will be a halide cation the nucleophilic species that bonds to the intermediate carbocation is then hydroxide ion or more likely water the usual solvent for these reagents and the products are called halohydrins sulfenyl chlorides add in the opposite manner because the electrophile is a sulfur cation rs whereas the nucleophilic moiety is chloride anion chlorine is more electronegative than sulfur below
