calculated as the difference in the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants for homolysis officially the iupac definition of bond dissociation energy refers to the energy change that occurs at k and the symbol is however it is commonly referred to as bde the bond dissociation energy and it is generally used albeit imprecisely interchangeably with the bond dissociation enthalpy which generally refers to the enthalpy change at room temperature k although there are technically differences between bdes at k and k those difference are not large and generally do not affect interpretations of chemical processes bond breakageformation
