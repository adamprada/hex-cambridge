energy it takes to break the bond and is the difference in energy between the reactants and the products therefore it is not appropriate to interpret bdes solely in terms of the stability of the radical products as is often done analysis of the bdes shown in the table above shows that there are some systematic trends bdes vary with hybridization bonds with sp hybridized carbons are weakest and bonds with sp hybridized carbons are much stronger the vinyl and phenyl ch bonds are similar reflecting their sp hybridization the correlation with hybridization can be viewed as a reflection of
