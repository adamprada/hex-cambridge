the alkyl radicals with the assessment that more highly substituted radicals are more stable as with carbocations although this is a popular explanation it fails to account fo the fact the bonds to groups other than h do not show the same types of variation r bderch bdercl bderbr bderoh ch chch chch chc therefore although cch bonds get weaker with more substitution the effect is not nearly as large as that observed with ch bonds the strengths of ccl and cbr bonds are not affected by substitution despite the fact that the same radicals are formed as when breaking
