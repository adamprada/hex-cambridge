according to the expression where and are the electronegativities and the bond energies are in ev therefore the variation in bdes can be interpreted as reflecting variation in the electronegativities of the different types of alkyl fragments there is likely some merit in all three interpretations since gronerts original publication of his alternate explanation there have been many desperate attempts to defend the radical stability explanation exercise given that Î´h for the reaction chg fg cfg hfg is kj use the following data to calculate the average bond energy of the cesfcf bonds in cf bond average bond energy kj
