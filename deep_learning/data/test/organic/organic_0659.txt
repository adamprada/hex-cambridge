through use of superseparation methods to see if any contaminants can be separated or by spectroscopic techniques as will be discussed later in this chapter we begin here with a brief description of chromatographic methods of separation an azeotrope is a mixture of two or more substances that boils at a constant temperature either higher or lower than any of its constituents thus an mole mixture of ethanol and water boils like a pure substance distilling at which is lower than the boiling point of ethanol or of water in contrast a mole mixture of methanoic formic acid and water
