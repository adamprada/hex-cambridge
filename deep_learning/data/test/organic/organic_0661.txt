the arrow notation in mechanisms since chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds a consideration of the movement of bonding and nonbonding valence shell electrons is essential to this understanding it is now common practice to show the movement of electrons with curved arrows and a sequence of equations depicting the consequences of such electron shifts is termed a mechanism in general two kinds of curved arrows are used in drawing mechanisms a full head on the arrow indicates the movement or shift of an electron pair a partial head fishhook on the arrow indicates the shift of
