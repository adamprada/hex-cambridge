arrow the following equations illustrate the proper use of these symbols reactive intermediates the products of bond breaking shown above are not stable in the usual sense and cannot be isolated for prolonged study such species are referred to as reactive intermediates and are believed to be transient intermediates in many reactions the general structures and names of four such intermediates are given below a pair of widely used terms related to the lewis acidbase notation should also be introduced here electrophile an electron deficient atom ion or molecule that has an affinity for an electron pair and will bond
