deficient however they do not in general bond to nucleophilic electron pairs so their chemistry exhibits unique differences from that of conventional electrophiles radical intermediates are often called free radicals the importance of electrophile nucleophile terminology comes from the fact that many organic reactions involve at some stage the bonding of a nucleophile to an electrophile a process that generally leads to a stable intermediate or product reactions of this kind are sometimes called ionic reactions since ionic reactants or products are often involved some common examples of ionic reactions and their mechanisms may be examined below the shapes ideally
