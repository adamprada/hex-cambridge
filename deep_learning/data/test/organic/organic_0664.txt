since three points determine a plane the shape of carbenes must be planar however the valence electron distribution varies ionic reactions the principles and terms introduced in the previous sections can now be summarized and illustrated by the following three examples reactions such as these are called ionic or polar reactions because they often involve charged species and the bonding together of electrophiles and nucleophiles ionic reactions normally take place in liquid solutions where solvent molecules assist the formation of charged intermediates the substitution reaction shown on the left can be viewed as taking place in three steps the first
