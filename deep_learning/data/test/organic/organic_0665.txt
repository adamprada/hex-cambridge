reaction shown on the left takes place in one step the bond breaking and making operations that take place in this step are described by the curved arrows the initial stage may also be viewed as an acidbase interaction with hydroxide ion serving as the base and a hydrogen atom component of the alkyl chloride as an acid there are many kinds of molecular rearrangements the examples shown on the left are from an important class called tautomerization or more specifically ketoenol tautomerization tautomers are rapidly interconverted constitutional isomers usually distinguished by a different bonding location for a labile hydrogen
