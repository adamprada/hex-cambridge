the four ch bonds in methane are arranged with tetrahedral geometry about the central carbon and that each bond has the same length and strength in order to explain this observation valence bond theory relies on a concept called orbital hybridization in this picture the four valence orbitals of the carbon one s and three p orbitals combine mathematically remember orbitals are described by equations to form four equivalent hybrid orbitals which are named sp orbitals because they are formed from mixing one s and three p orbitals in the new electron configuration each of the four valence electrons on
