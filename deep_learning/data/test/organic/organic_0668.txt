apart from each other as possiblethis is simply a restatement of the valence shell electron pair repulsion vsepr theory that you learned in general chemistry electron pairs in orbitals will arrange themselves in such a way as to remain as far apart as possible due to negativenegative electrostatic repulsion each ch bond in methane then can be described as an overlap between a halffilled s orbital in a hydrogen atom and the larger lobe of one of the four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals in the central carbon the length of the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane is Ã¥ x m while
