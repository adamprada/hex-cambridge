at an angle of approximately it would seem logical then to describe the bonding in water as occurring through the overlap of sphybrid orbitals on oxygen with sorbitals on the two hydrogen atoms in this model the two nonbonding lone pairs on oxygen would be located in sp orbitals some experimental evidence however suggests that the bonding orbitals on the oxygen are actually unhybridized p orbitals rather than sp hybrids although this would seem to imply that the hoh bond angle should be remember that p orbitals are oriented perpendicular to one another it appears that electrostatic repulsion has the
