ethene is a planar flat molecule bond angles in ethene are approximately o and the carboncarbon bond length is å significantly shorter than the å single carboncarbon bond in ethane there is a significant barrier to rotation about the carboncarbon double bond clearly these characteristics are not consistent with an sp hybrid bonding picture for the two carbon atoms instead the bonding in ethene is described by a model involving the participation of a different kind of hybrid orbital three atomic orbitals on each carbon the s px and py orbitals combine to form three sp hybrids leaving the pz
