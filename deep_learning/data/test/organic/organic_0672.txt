the two unhybridized pz orbitals from each carbon spacefilling image of bonding in ethene the pi bond does not have symmetrical symmetry because they are the result of sidebyside overlap rather then endtoend overlap like a sigma bond pi bonds are not free to rotate if rotation about this bond were to occur it would involve disrupting the sidebyside overlap between the two pz orbitals that make up the pi bond the presence of the pi bond thus locks the six atoms of ethene into the same plane this argument extends to larger alkene groups in each case the six
