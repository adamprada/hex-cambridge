is sphybridized and we will assume that the oxygen atom is also sp hybridized the carbon has three sigma bonds two are formed by overlap between two of its sp orbitals with the sorbital from each of the hydrogens and the third sigma bond is formed by overlap between the remaining carbon sp orbital and an sp orbital on the oxygen the two lone pairs on oxygen occupy its other two sp orbitals the pi bond is formed by sidebyside overlap of the unhybridized pz orbitals on the carbon and the oxygen just like in alkenes the pz orbitals that
