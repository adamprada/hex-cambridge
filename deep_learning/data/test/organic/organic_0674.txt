make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below lone pair electrons study notes nitrogen is frequently found in organic compounds as with carbon atoms nitrogen atoms can be sp sp or sphybridized note that in this course the term lone pair is used to describe an unshared pair of electrons the valencebond concept of orbital hybridization can be extrapolated to other atoms including nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur in other compounds covalent bonds that are formed can be described using hybrid orbitals nitrogen bonding in nh the nitrogen in nh has five valence electrons
