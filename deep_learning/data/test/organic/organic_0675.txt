was predicted by the lewis structure of nh the four sp hybrid orbitals of nitrogen orientate themselves to form a tetrahedral geometry the three nh sigma bonds of nh are formed by spnsh orbital overlap the fourth sp hybrid orbital contains the two electrons of the lone pair and is not directly involved in bonding methyl amine the nitrogen is sp hybridized which means that it has four sp hybrid orbitals two of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with s orbitals from hydrogens to form the two nh sigma bonds one of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with an sp
