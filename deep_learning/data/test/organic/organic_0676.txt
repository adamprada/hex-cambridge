two sp hybrid orbitals with one unpaired electron each the filled sp hybrid orbitals are considered nonbonding because they are already paired these electrons will be represented as a two sets of lone pair on the structure of ho the two unpaired electrons in the hybrid orbitals are considered bonding and will overlap with the s orbitals in hydrogen to form oh sigma bonds note this bonding configuration was predicted by the lewis structure of ho the four sp hybrid orbitals of oxygen orientate themselves to form a tetrahedral geometry the two oh sigma bonds of ho are formed by
