a tetrahedral geometry however the hoc bond angles are less than the typical o due to compression by the lone pair electrons phosphorus methyl phosphate the bond pattern of phosphorus is analogous to nitrogen because they are both in period however phosphorus can have have expanded octets because it is in the n row typically phosphorus forms five covalent bonds in biological molecules phosphorus is usually found in organophosphates organophosphates are made up of a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygens with one of the oxygens also bonded to a carbon in methyl phosphate the phosphorus is sp hybridized and
