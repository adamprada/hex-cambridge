alcohol oh bond in a sulfide the sulfur is bonded to two carbons the simplest example of a thiol is methane thiol chsh and the simplest example of a sulfide is dimethyl sulfide chs in both cases the sulfur is sp hybridized however the sulfur bond angles are much less than the typical tetrahedral o being o and o respectively methanethiol dimethyl sulfide exercises insert the missing lone pairs of electrons in the following molecules and tell what hybridization you expect for each of the indicated atoms a the oxygen is dimethyl ether b the nitrogen in dimethyl amine c
