sulfate and borane are also electrophiles that can react with alkenes to form hydration products each reaction pathway has its own regio and stereochemical considerations in the example below we see that the same alkene produces different hydration products depending on the hydration pathway mechanism for acidcatalyzed hydration of alkenes temperatures for types of alcohol synthesis heat is used to catalyze electrophilic hydration because the reaction is in equilibrium with the dehydration of an alcohol which requires higher temperatures to form an alkene lower temperatures are required to form an alcohol the exact temperatures used are highly variable and depend
