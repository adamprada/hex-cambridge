bonded to a carbon atom next to the carbocation leaves that carbon to bond with the carbocation after the hydrogen has taken both electrons from the single bond it is known as a hydride this changes the once neighboring carbon to a carbocation and the former carbocation becomes a neighboring carbon atom in a more complex case when alkenes undergo hydration we also observe hydride shift below is the reaction of methylbutene with ho that furnishes to make methylbutanol once again we see multiple products in this case however we see two minor products and one major product we observe
