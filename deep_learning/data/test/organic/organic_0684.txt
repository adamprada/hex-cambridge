available for a hydride shift an entire methyl group performs the same shift the nucleophile attacks the positive charge formed on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond because the nucleophile is seeking that positive charge in the mechanism for a ยบ alcohol shown above water is the nucleophile when the green h is removed from the water molecule the alcohol attached to the most substituted carbon hence electrophilic hydration follows markovnikovs rule stereochemistry of acidcatalyzed hydration stereochemistry deals with how the substituent bonds on the product directionally dashes and wedges denote stereochemistry by showing whether the molecule
