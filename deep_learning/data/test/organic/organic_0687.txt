carry out such a synthesis write the detailed mechanism for the addition of borane to an alkene and explain the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of the reaction key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below hydroboration study notes the two most important factors influencing organic reactions are polar or electronic effects and steric effects hydroborationoxidation is a two step pathway used to produce alcohols the reaction proceeds in an antimarkovnikov manner where the hydrogen from bh or bhr attaches to the more substituted carbon and the boron attaches to the least substituted carbon
