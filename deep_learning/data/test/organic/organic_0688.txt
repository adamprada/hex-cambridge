very valuable laboratory method for the stereoselectivity and regioselectivity of alkenes an additional feature of this reaction is that it occurs without rearrangement the borane complex first off it is very imporatnt to understand little bit about the structure and the properties of the borane molecule borane exists naturally as a very toxic gas and it exists as dimer of the general formula bh diborane additionally the dimer bhignites spontaneously in air borane is commercially available in ether and tetrahydrofuran thf in these solutions the borane can exist as a lewis acidbase complex which allows boron to have an electron
