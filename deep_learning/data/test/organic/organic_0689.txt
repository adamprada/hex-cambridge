the more substituted carbon both the boron and the hydrogen add simultaneously on the same face of the double bond syn addition oxidation of the trialkylborane by hydrogen peroxide step part the first part of this mechanism deals with the donation of a pair of electrons from the hydrogen peroxide ion the hydrogen peroxide is the nucleophile in this reaction because it is the electron donor to the newly formed trialkylborane that resulted from hydroboration part in this second part of the mechanism a rearrangement of an r group with its pair of bonding electrons to an adjacent oxygen results
