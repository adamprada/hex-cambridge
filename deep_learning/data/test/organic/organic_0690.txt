fashion as noted above this is a singlestep reaction since the bonding of the double bond carbons to boron and hydrogen is concerted it follows that the geometry of this addition must be syn furthermore rearrangements are unlikely inasmuch as a discrete carbocation intermediate is never formed these features are illustrated for the hydroboration of Î±pinene since the hydroboration procedure is most commonly used to hydrate alkenes in an antimarkovnikov fashion we also need to know the stereoselectivity of the second oxidation reaction which substitutes a hydroxyl group for the boron atom independent study has shown this reaction takes place
