atom stripped of its electrons electrophilic hydrogen is commonly used to help break double bonds or restore catalysts see sn for more details how does electrophilic hydration work mechanism for ยบ alcohol ยบ and ยบ mechanisms are similar temperatures for types of alcohol synthesis heat is used to catalyze electrophilic hydration because the reaction is in equilibrium with the dehydration of an alcohol which requires higher temperatures to form an alkene lower temperatures are required to form an alcohol the exact temperatures used are highly variable and depend on the product being formed primary alcohol less than ยบc secondary alcohol
