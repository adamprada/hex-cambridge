group on the periodic table and the second row down two electrons in a sorbital and four in porbitals oxygen donates one valence electron to each bond it forms leaving four nonbonded valence electrons after the blue oxygen atom forms its third bond with the moresubstituted carbon it develops a positive charge bonds and valence electrons give the blue oxygen atom a formal charge of the bond between the green hydrogen and the blue oxygen undergoes heterolytic cleavage and both the electrons from the bond move onto the blue oxygen the now negativelycharged strong acid picks up the green electrophilic
