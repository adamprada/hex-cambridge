carbocation after the hydrogen has taken both electrons from the single bond it is known as a hydride this changes the once neighboring carbon to a carbocation and the former carbocation becomes a neighboring carbon atom alkyl shifts if no hydrogen atoms are available for a hydride shift an entire methyl group performs the same shift the nucleophile attacks the positive charge formed on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond because the nucleophile is seeking that positive charge in the mechanism for a ยบ alcohol shown above water is the nucleophile when the green h is removed
