rearrangements but it does require the use of mercury which is highly toxic detractions for using electrophilic hydration to make alcohols include allowing for carbocation rearrangements poor yields due to the reactants and products being in equilibrium allowing for product mixtures such as an renantiomer and an senantiomer using sulfuric or phosphoric acid oxymercuration is a special electrophilic addition it is antistereospecific and regioselective regioselectivity is a process in which the substituents choses one direction it prefers to be attached to over all the other possible directions the good thing about this reaction is that there are no carbocation rearrangement
