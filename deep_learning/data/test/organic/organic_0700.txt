followed by proton transfer to solvent water molecule the organomercury intermediate is then reduced by sodium borohydride the mechanism for this final step is beyond the scope of our discussion here notice that overall the oxymercuration demercuration mechanism follows markovnikovs regioselectivity with the oh group is attached to the most substituted carbon and the h is attach to the least substituted carbon the reaction is useful however because strong acids are not required and carbocation rearrangements are avoided because no discreet carbocation intermediate forms references vollhardt k peter c organic chemistry structure and function new york wh freeman smith michael
