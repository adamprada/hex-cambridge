group to the more substituent side and the hydrogen on the less substituent side more problems predict the product of each reaction how does the cyclopropane group affect the reaction hint what is different about this problem hint consider stereochemistry indicate any shifts as well as the major product answer this is a simple electrophilic hydration the answer is additional side products but the major product formed is still the same the product shown depending on the temperatures used the cyclopropane may open up into a straight chain which makes it unlikely that the major product will form after the
