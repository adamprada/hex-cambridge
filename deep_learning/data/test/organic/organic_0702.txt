plane of the paper the product is racemic in the first picture shown below an alkyl shift occurs but a hydride shift which occurs faster is possible why doesnt a hydride shift occur the answer is because the alkyl shift leads to a more stable product there is a noticeable amount of side product that forms where the two methyl groups are but the major product shown below is still the most significant due to the hyperconjugation that occurs by being in between the two cyclohexanes exercises questions q in each case predict the products of these reactants of oxymercuration
