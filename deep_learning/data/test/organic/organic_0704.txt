make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below enol ketoenol tautomeric equilibrium tautomerism tautomers study notes rapid interconversion between tautomers is called tautomerism however as the two tautomers are in equilibrium the term tautomeric equilibrium may be used this section demonstrates the equilibrium between a ketone and an enol hence the term ketoenol tautomeric equilibrium is appropriate the term enol indicates the presence of a carboncarbon double bond and a hydroxyl ie alcohol group later in the course you will see the importance of ketoenol tautomerism in discussions of the reactions of ketones carbohydrates
