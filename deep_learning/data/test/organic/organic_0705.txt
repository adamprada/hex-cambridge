explanation for this deviation lies in enolketo tautomerization illustrated by the following equation the initial product from the addition of water to an alkyne is an enol a compound having a hydroxyl substituent attached to a doublebond and this immediately rearranges to the more stable keto tautomer tautomers are defined as rapidly interconverted constitutional isomers usually distinguished by a different bonding location for a labile hydrogen atom colored red here and a differently located double bond the equilibrium between tautomers is not only rapid under normal conditions but it often strongly favors one of the isomers acetone for example is
