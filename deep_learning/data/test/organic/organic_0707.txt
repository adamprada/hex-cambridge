just as described in figure the π electrons will attack a proton forming a carbocation which then gets attacked by the nucleophilic water molecules after deprotination we generate an enol which then tautomerizes into the ketone form shown hydration of alkyne as you can see here the π electrons of the triple bond are attacking the proton which forms a covalent bond on the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents once the hydrogen is bound you have a carbocation which gets attacked by the water molecule now you have a positive charge on the oxygen which results in a base
