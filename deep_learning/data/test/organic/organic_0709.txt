with alkyl groups also creates steric hindrance so that the hydroboration reaction produces the regioselective antimarkovnikov product disiamylborane siabh and borabicyclononane bbn are two common reagents for the hydroboration step their structures are shown below the oxidation reagents a basic hydrogen peroxide solution are the same for both alkenes and alkynes the overall reaction is shown below mechanism the hydroboration reaction of alkynes has the same stereo and regiochemistry as the alkene reaction the primary difference is the steric hindrance of the two isoamyl groups of the dialkyl borane creates antimarkovnikov regeioselectivity the hydrogen and boron bond with the same
