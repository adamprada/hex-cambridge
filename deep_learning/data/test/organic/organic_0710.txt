water molecule however this first hydration reaction forms an enol an alcohol bonded to a vinyl carbon enols immediately undergo a special type of isomerization reaction called tautomerization to form carbonyl groups aldehydes or ketones to keep things simple this reaction is called enolketo tautomerization with the understanding that aldehydes form on terminal alkyne carbons as with alkenes hydration addition of water to alkynes requires a strong acid usually sulfuric acid with a mercuric sulfate catalyst as shown below enolketo tautomers tautomers are defined as rapidly interconverted constitutional isomers usually distinguished by a different bonding location for a labile hydrogen
