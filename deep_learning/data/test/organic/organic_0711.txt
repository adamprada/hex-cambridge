alkynes the addition of water follows the markovnikov rule as in the second example below and the final product ia a methyl ketone except for acetylene shown in the first example for internal alkynes the triplebond is within a longer chain the addition of water is not regioselective if the triplebond is not symmetrically located ie if r r in the third equation are not the same two isomeric ketones will be formed with the addition of water alkynes can be hydrated to form enols that spontaneously tautomerize to ketones the reaction is catalyzed by mercury ions and follows markovnikovs
