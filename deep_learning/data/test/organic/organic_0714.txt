two c atoms and is also known by its common name ethylene the smallest alkyne is ethyne which is also known as acetylene for now we will focus on benzene as the representative aromatic hydrocarbon aromatic compounds were first noted for their strong aromas and low chemical reactivity compared to other saturated hydrocarbons aromatic compounds will be discussed in greater detail in the second semester to organic chemistry hydrocarbon functional groups the four distinct hydrocarbon functional groups are alkanes alkenes alkynes and arenes aromatic compounds derive their names from the fact that many of these compounds in the early days
