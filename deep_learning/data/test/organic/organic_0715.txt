it contains no double or triple bonds which are highly reactive in organic chemistry though not totally devoid of reactivity their lack of reactivity under most laboratory conditions makes them a relatively uninteresting though very important component of organic chemistry as you will learn about later the energy confined within the carboncarbon bond and the carbonhydrogen bond is quite high and their rapid oxidation produces a large amount of heat typically in the form of fire the general formula for saturated hydrocarbons is cnhnassuming noncyclic structures as shown in hexane ch below cycloalkanes are hydrocarbons containing one or more carbon
