are hydrocarbons that have at least one aromatic ring aromatic compounds contain the benzene unit benzene itself is composed of six c atoms in a ring with alternating single and double cc bonds calculating degrees of unsaturation du there are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule although nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and infrared radiation ir are the primary ways of determining molecular structures calculating the degrees of unsaturation du is useful information knowing the degrees of unsaturation tells us the combined number of pi bonds and rings within a compound which makes
