can be represented by c which is the general molecular representation of an alkane as an example for the molecular formula ch the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is cx the compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated hence the dob formula divides by the formula subtracts the number of xs because a halogen x replaces a hydrogen in a compound for instance in
