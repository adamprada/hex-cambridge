b c d chn using the molecules from give the degrees of unsaturation for each calculate the degrees of unsaturation for the following molecular formulas a ch b ch c chcl d chno using the molecular formulas from are the molecules unsaturated or saturated using the molecular formulas from if the molecules are unsaturated how many ringsdouble bondstriple bonds are predicted answer a unsaturated even though rings only contain single bonds rings are considered unsaturated b unsaturated c saturated d unsaturated if the molecular structure is given the easiest way to solve is to count the number of double bonds
