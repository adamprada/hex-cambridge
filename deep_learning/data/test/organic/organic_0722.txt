name to communicate the ring structure the general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon containing one ring is cnhn aromatic hydrocarbons also known as arenes are hydrocarbons that have at least one aromatic ring aromatic compounds contain the benzene unit benzene itself is composed of six c atoms in a ring with alternating single and double cc bonds for most compounds information beyond the chemical formula will be needed to elucidate their structure however the ratio of ch in a chemical formula can provide insights into the chemical structure for example lets look at some of the possible structures and chemical
