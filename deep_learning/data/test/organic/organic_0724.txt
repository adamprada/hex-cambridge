atom we do not visualize the orbital electron traversing a simple planetary orbit rather we speak of an atomic orbital in which there is only a probability of finding the electron in a particular volume a given distance and direction from the nucleus the boundaries of such an orbital are not distinct because there always remains a finite even if small probability of finding the electron relatively far from the nucleus there are several discrete atomic orbitals available to the electron of a hydrogen atom these orbitals differ in energy size and shape and exact mathematical descriptions for each are
