finding the electron within the boundary surface is high to see figure this may seem arbitrary but an orbital representation that would have a probability of for finding the electron within the boundary surface would have an infinite radius the reason is that there is a finite even if small probability of finding the electron at any given distance from the nucleus the boundary surfaces we choose turn out to have sizes consistent with the distances between the nuclei of bonded atoms the orbital is very much like the orbital except that it is larger and therefore more diffuse and
