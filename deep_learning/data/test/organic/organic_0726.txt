substances at least for carbon compounds with hydrogen and elements in the first main row of the periodic table the sequence of orbital energies is shown in figure figure the shapes and orientations of the three orbitals of a hydrogen atom notice that orbitals have two lobes one on each side of the nucleus figure schematic diagram of the relative energies of the hydrogenlike atomic orbitals the famous pauli exclusion principle states that no more than two elections can occupy a given orbital and then only if they differ with respect to a property of electrons called electron spin an
