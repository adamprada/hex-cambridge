which the electrons are added to the lowestenergy orbitals for example the electronic configuration of the lowestenergy state of a carbon atom is shown in figure which also shows the relative energies of the through atomic orbitals the orbitals of lowest energy are populated with the proper number of electrons to balance the nuclear charge of for carbon and to preserve the pauli condition of no more than two paired electrons per orbital however the two highestenergy electrons are put into different orbitals with unpaired spins in accordance with hunds rule the rationale of hunds rule depends on the fact
