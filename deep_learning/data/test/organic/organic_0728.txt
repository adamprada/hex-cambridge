they will not be able to approach each other as closely as they would if they could be in the same orbital at the same time for this reason the electronic configuration is expected to be more stable than the configuration if both orbitals have the same energy states such as the one shown in figure for carbon are built up through the following steps helium has two paired electrons in the orbital its configuration can be written as the superscript outside the parentheses denoting two paired electrons in the orbital for lithium we expect to be the ground state
