molecules found in petrol gasoline ethene cracking is the name given to breaking up large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller and more useful bits this is achieved by using high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst the source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum these fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking there is not any single unique reaction happening in the cracker the hydrocarbon molecules
