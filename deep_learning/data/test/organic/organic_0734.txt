method is the topic of this section a general considerations of infrared spectroscopy absorption of infrared radiation causes transitions between vibrational energy states of a molecule a simple diatomic molecule such as has only one vibrational mode available to it a stretching vibration somewhat like balls on the ends of a spring molecules with three or more atoms can vibrate by stretching and also by bending of the chemical bonds as indicated below for carbon dioxide the absorption frequencies in the infrared spectra of molecules correspond to changes in the stretching or bending vibrations or both in general a polyatomic
