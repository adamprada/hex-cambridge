have one vibrational mode but it is important to note that symmetrical diatomic molecules such as and do not absorb in the infrared region of the spectrum this is because absorption cannot occur if the vibration is electrically symmetrical fortunately then the infrared spectra can be recorded in air because the main components of air and do not interfere in practice infrared spectra can be obtained with gaseous liquid or solid samples the sample containers cells and the optical parts of the instrument are made of rock salt or similar material that transmits infrared radiation glass is opaque typical infrared
