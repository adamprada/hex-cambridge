of infrared spectroscopy what information can we derive about molecular structure from the vibrational bands of infrared spectra absorption of radiation in the range of is characteristic of the types of bonds present in the molecule and corresponds for the most part to stretching vibrations for example we know that the bonds of alkanes and alkyl groups have characteristic absorption bands around an unidentified compound that shows absorption in this region will very likely have alkanetype bonds more explicitly the band observed for propanone figure a at arises from absorption of infrared radiation which causes transitions between the ground vibrational
