by its position within a more or less broad frequency range and by its shape broad sharp and intensity strong medium weak a qualitative discussion of the factors that determine infrared band position and band intensities follows to a first approximation a chemical bond resembles a mechanical spring that vibrates with a stretching frequency in which is the force constant and and are the masses of the individual atoms at each end of the bond the force constant is a measure of the stiffness of the bond and usually is related to the bond strength from equation we can see
