vibrations are found at higher frequencies than are those arising from changes in the bending vibrations another consequence of equation is that if and remain the same the larger the value of the higher will be the vibrational frequency because is expected to run more or less parallel to the bond strength and because multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds the absorption frequencies of multiple bonds are higher than for single bonds examples are the absorption of at at and at other effects besides mass and bond strength also affect infrared absorption frequencies the structural environment of a bond
