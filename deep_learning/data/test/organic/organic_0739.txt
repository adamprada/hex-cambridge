absorption lines this is because changes in rotational energies can occur together with the vibrational changes the reason can be seen more clearly in figure in which each vibrational level such as and of a molecule has associated with it closely spaced rotational levels transitions between and also may involve changes in rotational levels this gives a band of closely spaced lines for any given vibrational change for complex molecules particularly in the liquid state the rotational fine structure of a given vibrational band usually cannot be resolved figure schematic vibrational and rotational energy levels the arrows correspond to infrared
