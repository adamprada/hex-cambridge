but quite different from to the fingerprint region of the spectrum is individual enough so that if the infrared spectra of two samples are indistinguishable in the range of frequencies from to it is highly probable that the two samples are of the same compound or the same mixture of compounds characteristic stretching and bending frequencies occur in the fingerprint region but they are less useful for identifying functional groups because they frequently overlap with other bands this region is sufficiently complex that a complete analysis of the spectrum is seldom possible d alkanes and cycloalkanes the infrared spectra of
