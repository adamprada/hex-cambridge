trimethylpentane are characteristic of methyl bending frequencies bending frequencies of methyl groups at are absent a moderately strong scissoring frequency is observed between and the position depending somewhat on the size of the ring these features of the infrared spectra of cycloalkanes are illustrated in figure using cyclooctane and methylcyclohexane as examples figure infrared spectra of a cyclooctane and b methylcyclohexane these spectra can be compared profitably with those in figure e applications of infrared spectroscopy to structure determination infrared spectra are very useful both for identification of specific organic compounds and for determining types of compounds for example figure
