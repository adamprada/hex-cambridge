molecular formula has enough oxygens to allow for this possibility table also shows that a group should have a absorption band between and and absorption bending frequency between and and there is indeed a band of medium intensity at and a strong band at these absorptions being in the fingerprint region do not prove that the compound is a carboxylic acid but if there were no absorptions in the to range the presence of a group would be highly questionable figure infrared spectrum of a compound tentatively then we may write a partial structure for as a propyl group would
