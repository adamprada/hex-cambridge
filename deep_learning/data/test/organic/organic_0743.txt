spectra a total of about infrared spectra are available for comparison purposes you should check with the reference section of your library to see what atlases of spectral data are available to you the foregoing example illustrates the way structures can be determined from infrared spectral data for many purposes the infrared frequencies given in table are both approximate and incomplete however you could be easily frustrated in interpreting spectral data by being burdened with a very detailed table in which the unimportant is mixed with the important the ability to use extensive tables effectively comes with experience you should
