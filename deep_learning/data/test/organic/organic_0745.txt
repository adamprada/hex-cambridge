the overall surface area of the molecules decreases the visual image of mo theory can be helpful in seeing each compound as a cloud of electrons in an all encompassing mo system branching creates more spherical shapes noting that the sphere allows the maximum volume with the least surface area the structural isomers with the chemical formula cho have different dominant imfs the hbonding of ethanol results in a liquid for cocktails at room temperature while the weaker dipoledipole of the dimethylether results in a gas a room temperature in the last example we see the three imfs compared directly
