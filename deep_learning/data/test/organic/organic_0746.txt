the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipoledipole interactions is reflected in higher boiling points just look at the trend for hexane nonpolar london dispersion interactions only hexanone dipoledipole interactions and hexanol hydrogen bonding of particular interest to biologists and pretty much anything else that is alive in the universe is the effect of hydrogen bonding in water because it is able to form tight networks of intermolecular hydrogen bonds water remains in the liquid phase at temperatures up to oc slightly lower at high altitude the world would obviously be a very different place if water boiled at oc
