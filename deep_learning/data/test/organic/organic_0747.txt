of a molecule to pack tightly into a crystal lattice has a very large effect on melting points the flat shape of aromatic compounds such as napthalene and biphenyl allows them to stack together efficiently and thus aromatics tend to have higher melting points compared to alkanes or alkenes with similar molecular weights comparing the melting points of benzene and toluene you can see that the extra methyl group on toluene disrupts the molecules ability to stack thus decreasing the cumulative strength of intermolecular london dispersion forces note also that the boiling point for toluene is oc well above the
