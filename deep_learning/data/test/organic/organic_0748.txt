of the same substance this is because impurities disrupt the ordered packing arrangement of the crystal and make the cumulative intermolecular interactions weaker the melting behavior of lipid structures an interesting biological example of the relationship between molecular structure and melting point is provided by the observable physical difference between animal fats like butter or lard which are solid at room temperature and vegetable oils which are liquid both solid fats and liquid oils are based on a triacylglycerol structure where three hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains of varying length are attached to a glycerol backbone through an ester functional group compare
