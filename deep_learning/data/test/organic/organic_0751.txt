are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids where the molecules are close together these interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law at high pressures for more information on the behavior of real gases and deviations from the ideal gas law in this section we explicitly consider three kinds of intermolecular interactions there are two additional types of electrostatic interaction that you are
