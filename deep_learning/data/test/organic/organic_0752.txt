tend to align themselves so that the positive end of one dipole is near the negative end of another and vice versa as shown in figure figure attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions a and b molecular orientations in which the positive end of one dipole δ is near the negative end of another δ and vice versa produce attractive interactions c and d molecular orientations that juxtapose the positive or negative ends of the dipoles on adjacent molecules produce repulsive interactions these arrangements are more stable than arrangements in which two positive or two negative ends are adjacent figure hence
