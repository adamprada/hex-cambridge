or between a dipole and an ion in which one of the species has at least a full positive or negative charge in addition the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do the ionion interactions recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r where r is the distance between the ions doubling the distance r r decreases the attractive energy by onehalf in contrast the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to r so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction
