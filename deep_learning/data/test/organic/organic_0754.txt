attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r whereas the attractive energy between two dipoles is proportional to r example arrange ethyl methyl ether chochch methylpropane isobutane chchch and acetone chcoch in order of increasing boiling points their structures are as follows given compounds asked for order of increasing boiling points strategy compare the molar masses and the polarities of the compounds compounds with higher molar masses and that are polar will have the highest boiling points solution the three compounds have essentially the same molar mass gmol so we must look at differences in polarity to predict the
