should give a moderately high boiling point acetone contains a polar co double bond oriented at about to two methyl groups with nonpolar ch bonds the co bond dipole therefore corresponds to the molecular dipole which should result in both a rather large dipole moment and a high boiling point thus we predict the following order of boiling points methylpropane ethyl methyl ether acetone this result is in good agreement with the actual data methylpropane boiling point c and the dipole moment μ d methyl ethyl ether boiling point c and μ d acetone boiling point c and μ d
