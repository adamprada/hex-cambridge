shape determines how much of one molecule can interact with its neighboring molecules at any given time for example part b in figure shows dimethylpropane neopentane and npentane both of which have the empirical formula ch neopentane is almost spherical with a small surface area for intermolecular interactions whereas npentane has an extended conformation that enables it to come into close contact with other npentane molecules as a result the boiling point of neopentane c is more than c lower than the boiling point of npentane c figure mass and surface area affect the strength of london dispersion forces a
