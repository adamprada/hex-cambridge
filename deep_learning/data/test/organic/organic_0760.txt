former predominate example arrange nbutane propane methylpropane isobutene chchch and npentane in order of increasing boiling points given compounds asked for order of increasing boiling points strategy determine the intermolecular forces in the compounds and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces the substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point solution the four compounds are alkanes and nonpolar so london dispersion forces are the only important intermolecular forces these forces are generally stronger with increasing molecular mass so propane should have the lowest boiling point and npentane should have the highest with
