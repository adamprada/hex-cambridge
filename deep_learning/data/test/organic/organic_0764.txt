bonds are continually broken and formed because of rapid molecular motion hydrogen bond formation requires both a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor because ice is less dense than liquid water rivers lakes and oceans freeze from the top down in fact the ice forms a protective surface layer that insulates the rest of the water allowing fish and other organisms to survive in the lower levels of a frozen lake or sea if ice were denser than the liquid the ice formed at the surface in cold weather would sink as fast as it formed bodies of
