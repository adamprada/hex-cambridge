of the compounds that can act as hydrogen bond donors identify those that also contain lone pairs of electrons which allow them to be hydrogen bond acceptors if a substance is both a hydrogen donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor draw a structure showing the hydrogen bonding solution a of the species listed xenon xe ethane ch and trimethylamine chn do not contain a hydrogen atom attached to o n or f hence they cannot act as hydrogen bond donors b the one compound that can act as a hydrogen bond donor methanol choh contains both a hydrogen atom attached
