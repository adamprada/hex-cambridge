such as hf can form only two hydrogen bonds at a time as can on average pure liquid nh consequently even though their molecular masses are similar to that of water their boiling points are significantly lower than the boiling point of water which forms four hydrogen bonds at a time example buckyballs arrange c buckminsterfullerene which has a cage structure nacl he ar and no in order of increasing boiling points given compounds asked for order of increasing boiling points strategy identify the intermolecular forces in each compound and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those
