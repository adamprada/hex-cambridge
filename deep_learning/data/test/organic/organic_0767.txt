no should have a higher boiling point a c molecule is nonpolar but its molar mass is gmol much greater than that of ar or no because the boiling points of nonpolar substances increase rapidly with molecular mass c should boil at a higher temperature than the other nonionic substances the predicted order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses he c ar c no c c c nacl c exercise arrange dimethylheptane ne cs cl and kbr in order of decreasing boiling points answer kbr c dimethylheptane c cs c cl c ne c example identify
