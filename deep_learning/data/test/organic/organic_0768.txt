hf hcl answer a hydrogen bonding answer b dipoledipole interactions more complex examples of hydrogen bonding the hydration of negative ions when an ionic substance dissolves in water water molecules cluster around the separated ions this process is called hydration water frequently attaches to positive ions by coordinate dative covalent bonds it bonds to negative ions using hydrogen bonds if you are interested in the bonding in hydrated positive ions you could follow this link to coordinate dative covalent bonding the diagram shows the potential hydrogen bonds formed to a chloride ion cl although the lone pairs in the chloride
