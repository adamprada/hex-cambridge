always have higher boiling points than similarly sized molecules which dont have an oh or an nh group the hydrogen bonding makes the molecules stickier and more heat is necessary to separate them ethanol chchoh and methoxymethane choch are structural isomers with the same molecular formula cho they have the same number of electrons and a similar length to the molecule the van der waals attractions both dispersion forces and dipoledipole attractions in each will be much the same however ethanol has a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen and that oxygen still has exactly the same two lone
