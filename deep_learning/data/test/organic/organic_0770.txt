bonding has on the stickiness of the ethanol molecules ethanol with hydrogen bonding c methoxymethane without hydrogen bonding c the hydrogen bonding in the ethanol has lifted its boiling point about c it is important to realize that hydrogen bonding exists in addition to van der waals attractions for example all the following molecules contain the same number of electrons and the first two are much the same length the higher boiling point of the butanol is due to the additional hydrogen bonding comparing the two alcohols containing oh groups both boiling points are high because of the additional hydrogen
