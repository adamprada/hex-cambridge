are held together by hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen on one strand and lone pairs on another nitrogen or an oxygen on the other one donors and acceptors in order for a hydrogen bond to occur there must be both a hydrogen donor and an acceptor present the donor in a hydrogen bond is the atom to which the hydrogen atom participating in the hydrogen bond is covalently bonded and is usually a strongly electronegative atom such as no or f the hydrogen acceptor is the neighboring electronegative ion or molecule and must posses a lone electron
