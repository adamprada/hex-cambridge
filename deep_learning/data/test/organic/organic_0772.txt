unlike molecules intramolecular hydrogen bonds intramolecular hydrogen bonds are those which occur within one single molecule this occurs when two functional groups of a molecule can form hydrogen bonds with each other in order for this to happen both a hydrogen donor an acceptor must be present within one molecule and they must be within close proximity of each other in the molecule for example intramolecular hydrogen bonding occurs in ethylene glycol choh between its two hydroxyl groups due to the molecular geometry intermolecular hydrogen bonds intermolecular hydrogen bonds occur between separate molecules in a substance they can occur between
