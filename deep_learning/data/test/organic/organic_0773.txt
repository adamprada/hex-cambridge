molecules have more space for electron distribution and thus more possibilities for an instantaneous dipole moment however when we consider the table below we see that this is not always the case compound molar mass normal boiling point gmol k gmol k gmol k gmol k gmol k gmol k we see that ho hf and nh each have higher boiling points than the same compound formed between hydrogen and the next element moving down its respective group indicating that the former have greater intermolecular forces this is because ho hf and nh all exhibit hydrogen bonding whereas the others
