and the atom it is bonded to thus we see molecules such as ph which no not partake in hydrogen bonding ph exhibits a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry like that of ammmonia but unlike nh it cannot hydrogen bond this is due to the similarity in the electronegativities of phosphorous and hydrogen both atoms have an electronegativity of and thus no dipole moment occurs this prevents the hydrogen bonding from acquiring the partial positive charge needed to hydrogen bond with the lone electron pair in another molecule see polarizability atom size the size of donors and acceptors can also effect
