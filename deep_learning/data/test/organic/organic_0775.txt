plants the cohesionadhesion theory of transport in vascular plants uses hydrogen bonding to explain many key components of water movement through the plants xylem and other vessels within a vessel water molecules hydrogen bond not only to each other but also to the cellulose chain which comprises the wall of plant cells this creates a sort of capillary tube which allows for capillary action to occur since the vessel is relatively small this mechanism allows plants to pull water up into their roots furthermorehydrogen bonding can create a long chain of water molecules which can overcome the force of gravity
