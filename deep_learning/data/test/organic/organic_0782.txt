can be gained from the chemical formulas when comparing compounds structural constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but a different bonding arrangement among the atoms stereoisomers have identical molecular formulas and arrangements of atoms they differ from each other only in the spatial orientation of groups in the molecule for organic chemistry there are several types of stereoisomers enantiomers diasteriomers geometric isomers and conformers these stereoisomers will be introduced and explained throughout several chapters structural constitutional isomers because carbon forms four bonds there can be multiple ways to form molecules that follow the octet rule even with only four
