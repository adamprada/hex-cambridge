bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations conformers are the simplest example of stereoisomerism identical compounds are the same compound shown with all atoms in the same spatial orientation conformers are the same compound shown with different rotations about single bonds in the example below we can compare two identical structures for ethane with two conformers of ethane geometric isomers an example of stereoisomerism the rigidity of the pi bonds in double bonds can
