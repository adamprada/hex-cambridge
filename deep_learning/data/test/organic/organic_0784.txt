the example below for now it is important to distinguish between structural differences and spatial differences when comparing compounds in the future we will look more closely at isomerism example lets look ate the bondline structures below and determine the relationships between the following pairs of compounds identical conformers structural isomers geometric isomers or completely different compounds the first important step that is often skipped is to determine the chemical formula of each compound if the chemical formulas are different then the compounds are completely different and there is no isomeric relationship if the chemical formulas are the same then
