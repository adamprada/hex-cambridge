structural isomers differ in connectivity as illustrated below for propanol and propanol although these two alcohols have the same molecular formula cho the position of the oh group differs creating a unique compounds with differences in their physical and chemical properties consider for example the following five structures represented by the formula ch in the conversion of one structural isomer to another at least one bond must be broken and reformed at a different position in the molecule structures a and d above represent the same compound npentane structures b and c represent the same compound methylbutane no bonds need
