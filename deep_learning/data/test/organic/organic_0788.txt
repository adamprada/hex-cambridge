type of isomer the position isomer and in later chapters we will discuss another type of isomer the stereoisomer and the experimental approaches that are used to establish the purity identity structure and stereochemistry of organic compounds a position isomers compounds having the same number and kind of atoms but having different bonding arrangements between the atoms are called position isomers butane and methylpropane are examples of position isomers the atoms are connected differently in the two structures because the carbon chain in butane is a straight or continuous chain whereas in methylpropane it is branched therefore these two molecules
