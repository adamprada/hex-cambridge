share two or more atoms then the structure is called a bicyclic compound if the two rings share a single atom then the structure is called a spirocyclic compound examples of each way to join rings is shown below bicyclic compounds fused rings share two adjacent carbon atoms decalin is a fused bicyclic compound its iupac name is bibyclodecane to communicate the bonding arrangement bridged rings share two nonadjacent carbon atoms and one or more carbon atoms between them bicycloheptane shows the difference between the bridgehead carbons and the bridge carbons spirocyclic compounds a spirobicycloalkane is a molecule in which
