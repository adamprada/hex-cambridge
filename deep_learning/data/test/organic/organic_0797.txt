bonding through the use of the lewis definition of acids and bases chemists are now able to predict a wider variety of acidbase reactions lewis theory used electrons instead of proton transfer and specifically stated that an acid is a species that accepts an electron pair while a base donates an electron pair figure above a lewis base b donates it electrons to a lewis acid a resulting in a coordinate covalently bonded compound also known as an adduct the reaction of a lewis acid and a lewis base will produce a coordinate covalent bond as shown in figure above
