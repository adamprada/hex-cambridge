only the homo is considered for bases and only the lumo is considered for acids figure figure lewis acids have vacant orbitals so they are in a lower energy level while lewis bases have lone pair electrons to share and thus occupy a higher energy level complex ion coordination compounds complex ions are polyatomic ions which are formed from a central metal ion that has other smaller ions joined around it while br√∏nsted theory cant explain this reaction lewis acidbase theory can help a lewis base is often the ligand of a coordination compound with the metal acting as the
