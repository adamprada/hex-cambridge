ammonia with zn zn nh rightarrow znnh label similarly the lewis acid is the zinc ion and the lewis base is nh note how br√∏nsted theory of acids and bases will not be able to explain how this reaction occurs because there are no or ions involved thus lewis acid and base theory allows us to explain the formation of other species and complex ions which do not ordinarily contain hydronium or hydroxide ions one is able to expand the definition of an acid and a base via the lewis acid and base theory the lack of or ions in
