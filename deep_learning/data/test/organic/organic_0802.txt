predicting reaction mechanisms the electron rich lewis base can be described as a nucleophile nucleophiles are attracted to and can react with compounds or ions that have full or partial positive charge like the nucleus the electron poor lewis acids can be described as electrophiles electrophiles attract nucleophiles until orbital overlap occurs between them triggering a reaction at this point in the course we can indicate electron flow using curved arrows when both the reactants and products are given example exercises for the following reactions a add curved arrows to indicate the electron flow b label each reactant as the
