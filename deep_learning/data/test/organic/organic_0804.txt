the lone pair electrons are often not shown in chemical structures it is important to see mentally add the lone pairs in the beginning it can be helpful to physically add the lone pair electrons bonding patterns for organic chemistry the common bonding patterns of carbon oxygen and nitrogen have useful applications when evaluating chemical structures and reactivity formal charges organic molecules can also have positive or negative charges associated with them during chemical reactions it is common to have charge reactant intermediates andor products recognizing and distinguishing between neutral and charged bonding patterns will be helpful in learning reaction
