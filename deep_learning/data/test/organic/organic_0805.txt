atom rather than on the carbon or any of the hydrogen atoms figuring out the formal charge on different atoms of a molecule is a straightforward process its simply a matter of adding up valence electrons a unbound oxygen atom has valence electrons when it is bound as part of a methanol molecule however an oxygen atom is surrounded by valence electrons nonbonding electrons two lone pairs and electrons in each of its two covalent bonds one to carbon one to hydrogen in the formal charge convention we say that the oxygen owns all nonbonding electrons however it only owns
