atom number of nonbonding electrons on the bound atom ½ the number of bonding electrons on the bound atom using this formula for the oxygen atom of methanol we have formal charge on oxygen valence electrons on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons thus oxygen in methanol has a formal charge of zero in other words it has no formal charge how about the carbon atom in methanol an isolated carbon owns valence electrons the bound carbon in methanol owns ½ x valence electrons formal charge on carbon valence electron on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding
