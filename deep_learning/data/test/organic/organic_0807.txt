electrons a formal charge of is located on the oxygen atom for methoxide the anionic form of methanol the calculation for the oxygen atom is formal charge on oxygen valence electrons in isolated atom nonbonding electrons Â½ x bonding electrons a formal charge of is located on the oxygen atom a very important rule to keep in mind is that the sum of the formal charges on all atoms of a molecule must equal the net charge on the whole molecule when drawing the structures of organic molecules it is very important to show all nonzero formal charges being clear
