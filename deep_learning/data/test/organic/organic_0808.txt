the two electrons in a bond to be shared equally even if that is not an accurate reflection of chemical reality formal charges are just that a formality a method of electron bookkeeping that is tied into the lewis system for drawing the structures of organic compounds and ions later we will see how the concept of formal charge can help us to visualize how organic molecules react finally dont be lured into thinking that just because the net charge on a structure is zero there are no atoms with formal charges one atom could have a positive formal charge
