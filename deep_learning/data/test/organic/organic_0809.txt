by lone pair electrons valence bond and molecular orbital theories the table below summarizes the main points of the two complementary bonding theories both theories provide different useful ways of describing molecular structure we will use both theories and often blend them to analyze and predict chemical structure and reactivity the bonding theories are reviewed in greater detail in the next two sections comparison of bonding theories valence bond theory molecular orbital theory considers bonds as localized between one pair of atoms considers electrons delocalized throughout the entire molecule creates bonds from overlap of atomic orbitals s p d and
