create the framework that holds all the atoms together as a molecule or ion unhybridized p orbitals create pi bonds perpendicular to this sigma framework in the future we will learn that some lone pair electrons on heteroatoms of rings can occupy p orbitals to create aromaticity stay tuned for upcoming attractions for the first ten chapters of this text we will only focus on nonaromatic compounds to identify the orbitals of the lone pair electrons in nonaromatic compounds we can follow a twostep approach step add any missing lone pair electrons to the heteroatoms atoms other than carbon and
