a add the lone pair electrons b label the hybridization and electron geometry for all nonhydrogen atoms c specify the hybridization of the orbital for each lone pair d what is the chemical formula of this compound answer references the usual application of mass spectroscopy to organic molecules involves bombardment with a beam of mediumenergy electrons or in high vacuum and analysis of the charged particles and fragments so produced most mass spectrometers are set up to analyze positively charged fragments although negativeion mass spectrometry also is possible the elements of a mass spectrometer are shown in figure the positive
