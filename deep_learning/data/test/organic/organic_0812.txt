magnet figure schematic diagram of a mass spectrometer mass spectra of propanone butanone and propanal are shown in figure each peak represents ions of particular masses formed as the result of fragmentation of the molecule produced by electron impact into and so on the cracking patterns are of course functions of the energy of the bombarding electrons and serve as an extraordinarily individual fingerprint of the particular molecules for instance propanone and propanal are isomers yet their cracking patterns are strikingly different figure the mass spectra of a butanone b propanal and c propanone these spectra were supplied through the
