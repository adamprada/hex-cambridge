corresponding to may be or less of the highest peak in the spectrum which is called the base peak and usually is assigned an arbitrary intensity of the pressure of the sample in the ion source of a mass spectrometer is usually about and under these conditions buildup of fragments to give significant peaks with greater than is rare one exception to this is the formation of peaks resulting from transfer of a hydrogen atom from to the relative intensities of such peaks are usually sensitive to the sample pressure and may be identified in this way with the molecular
