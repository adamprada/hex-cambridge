isotope abundance we will illustrate this with the following simple example the highest peaks corresponding to in the mass spectrum of an unknown sample have equal to and with relative intensities of what is the elemental composition the abundance ratio is uniquely characteristic of the chlorine isotopes the mass peaks at and are therefore both molecular ions the peak is of an ion containing and the peak is of an ion containing the remaining atoms in the molecule must add up to or mass units there are several possible combinations of and that give mass they are and of these
