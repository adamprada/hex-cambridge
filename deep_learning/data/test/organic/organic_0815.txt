one ion in place of the intensity ratio will depend on the number of carbon atoms present because the more carbons there are the greater the probability will be that one of them is the greater the probability the larger the ratio for carbons we expect if the measured ratio is then the only hydrocarbon formula with and is nitrogen and oxygen as also contribute to if present while and two s contribute to the calculated intensities of and relative to as are tabulated in table for elemental composition of ions up to the table applies to fragment ions as
