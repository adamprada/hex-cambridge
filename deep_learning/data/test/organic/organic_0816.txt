occur by reasonable chemical processes and this may involve straightforward fragmentation or rearrangement of atoms from one part of the molecule to another in general fragmentation occurs at the weakest bonds and the most abundant fragments also are the most stable ones for instance hydrocarbons fragment preferentially at branch points partly because the bonds are weaker here than elsewhere along the chain and partly because the ionic fragments are more stable as an example consider dimethylbutane there is no molecular ion evident in its mass spectrum because it cleaves so readily at the quaternary carbon to give the peak corresponding
