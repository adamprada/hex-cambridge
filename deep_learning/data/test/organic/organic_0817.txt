this is that the fragmentation patterns found in the mass spectrometry of the ion itself are the same no matter which of the monodeuteriomethylbenzenes is used as starting material this rearrangement occurs because of the high delocalization energy of the symmetrical ion usually called tropylium cation and because its charge is spread out more evenly over the carbons than would be the charge for the phenylmethyl cation see section b tabulations of elemental compositions of and for mass values up to are listed in many texts on mass spectrometry consult these tables to see all possible alternatives see also j
