to bond making in the first mechanism the overall reaction is the result of two steps the first of which involves a slow dissociation of chloromethane to solvated methyl carbocation and solvated chloride ion the second step involves a fast reaction between the carbocation and hydroxide ion or water to yield methanol mechanism or in the second mechanism the reaction proceeds in a single step attack of hydroxide ion at carbon occurs simultaneously with the loss of chloride ion that is the carbonoxygen bond is formed as the carbonchlorine bond is broken mechanism both of these mechanisms are important in
