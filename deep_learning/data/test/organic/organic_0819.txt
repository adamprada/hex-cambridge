secondary reaction in contrast mechanism requires the rate to depend on the concentrations of both reagents because the slow step involves collisions between hydroxide ions and chloromethane molecules more precisely the reaction rate may be expressed in terms of equation for mechanism and equation for mechanism customarily is expressed in moles of product formed per liter of solution per unit of time most frequently in seconds the concentration terms and are then in units of moles per liter and the proportionality constant called the specific rate constant has the units of for mechanism and for mechanism it is important to
