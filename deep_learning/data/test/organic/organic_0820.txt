the overall order of reaction is the sum of the orders of the respective reactants thus equations and express the rates of overall firstorder and secondorder reactions respectively we can use the overall reaction order to distinguish between the two possible mechanisms and experimentally the rate of formation of methanol is found to be proportional to the concentrations both of chloromethane and of hydroxide ion therefore the reaction rate is second order overall and is expressed correctly by equation this means that the mechanism of the reaction is the singlestep process such reactions generally are classified as bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions
