as water ethanol ethanoic acid and methanoic acid two examples are in these examples solvolysis is necessarily a firstorder reaction because normally the solvent is in such great excess that its concentration does not change appreciably during reaction and hence its contribution to the rate does not change however that the overall rate is first order does not mean the reaction necessarily proceeds by an mechanism particularly in solvents such as water alcohols or amines which are reasonably good nucleophilic agents the solvent can act as the displacing agent in an reaction to distinguish between and mechanisms of solvolysis requires
