if the reaction is the rate of disappearance of should increase because reacts with the nucleophile in an reaction and now the rate depends on both the nature and the concentration of the nucleophile many organic chemists and indeed the previous versions of this book use the term carbonium ion for species of this kind however there is wellestablished usage of the onium suffix for ammonium oxonium chloronium and so on to denote positively charged atoms with filled valence shells in the interest of greater uniformity of nomenclature we shall use carbocation for carbon positive ions that have unfilled valence
