the stereochemistry of stereocenters should cancel out what it means here is that when we have an internal plane that splits the compound into two symmetrical sides the stereochemistry of both left and right side should be opposite to each other and therefore result in optically inactive cyclic compounds may also be meso identification if a is a meso compound it should have two or more stereocenters an internal plane and the stereochemistry should be r and s look for an internal plane or internal mirror that lies in between the compound the stereochemistry eg r or s is very
