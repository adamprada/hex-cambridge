internal plane here is depicted on two dimensions however in reality it is three dimensions so be aware of it when we identify the internal mirror example has a plane of symmetry the horizonatal plane going through the red broken line and therefore is achiral has chiral centers thus is a meso compound example this molecules has a plane of symmetry the vertical plane going through the red broken line perpendicular to the plane of the ring and therefore is achiral but has has two chiral centers thus its is a meso compound other examples of meso compounds meso compounds
