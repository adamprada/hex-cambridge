same four substituents and are equivalent as a result two of the four possible stereoisomers of this compound are identical due to a plane of symmetry so there are only three stereoisomeric tartaric acids two of these stereoisomers are enantiomers and the third is an achiral diastereomer called a meso compound meso compounds are achiral optically inactive diastereomers of chiral stereoisomers investigations of isomeric tartaric acid salts carried out by louis pasteur in the mid th century were instrumental in elucidating some of the subtleties of stereochemistry some physical properties of the isomers of tartaric acid are given in the
