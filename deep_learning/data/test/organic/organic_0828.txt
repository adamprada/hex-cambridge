us here in setting the stage for the consideration of more complex absorptions that occur with infrared radiation figure a small part of the microwave spectrum of at a pressure of showing absorptions of the trans and gauche conformations notice the regular spacings of the lines for each conformation that the spacings are different for the two conformations reflects their different moments of inertia the horizontal scale is gigahertz and corresponds to which from equation can be calculated to mean a rotational energy change of spectrum courtesy of dr howard harrington hewlettpackard corp references john d robert and marjorie c
