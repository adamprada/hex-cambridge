formula cannot be reduced any more then the empirical formula is the same as the molecular formula combustion analysis can determine the empirical formula of a compound but cannot determine the molecular formula other techniques can though once known the molecular formula can be calculated from the empirical formula empirical formulas an empirical formula tells us the relative ratios of different atoms in a compound the ratios hold true on the molar level as well thus ho is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and atom of oxygen likewise mole of ho is composed of moles of hydrogen and mole
