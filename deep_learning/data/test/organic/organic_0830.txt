as many moles ie atoms of cl as hg the empirical formula would thus be remember to list cation first anion last molecular formula from empirical formula the chemical formula for a compound obtained by composition analysis is always the empirical formula we can obtain the chemical formula from the empirical formula if we know the molecular weight of the compound the chemical formula will always be some integer multiple of the empirical formula ie integer multiples of the subscripts of the empirical formula the general flow for this approach is shown in figure and demonstrated in example figure the
