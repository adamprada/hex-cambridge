amounts of carbon and oxygen appear to be equal but the relative molar amount of hydrogen is higher since we cannot have fractional atoms in a compound we need to normalize the relative amount of hydrogen to be equal to an integer would appear to be and so if we multiply the relative amounts of each atom by we should be able to get integer values for each atom c h o or cho this is our empirical formula for ascorbic acid what about the chemical formula we are told that the experimentally determined molecular mass is amu what is
