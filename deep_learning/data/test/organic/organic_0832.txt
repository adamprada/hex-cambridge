co and the hydrogen to ho figure the amount of carbon produced can be determined by measuring the amount of co produced this is trapped by the sodium hydroxide and thus we can monitor the mass of co produced by determining the increase in mass of the co trap likewise we can determine the amount of h produced by the amount of ho trapped by the magnesium perchlorate figure combustion analysis apparatus one of the most common ways to determine the elemental composition of an unknown hydrocarbon is an analytical procedure called combustion analysis a small carefully weighed sample of
