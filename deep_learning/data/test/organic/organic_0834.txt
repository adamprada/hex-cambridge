the most likely empirical formula for propanol would be example combustion of naphalene naphthalene the active ingredient in one variety of mothballs is an organic compound that contains carbon and hydrogen only complete combustion of a mg sample of naphthalene in oxygen yielded mg of co and mg of ho determine the empirical formula of naphthalene given mass of sample and mass of combustion products asked for empirical formula strategy use the masses and molar masses of the combustion products co and ho to calculate the masses of carbon and hydrogen present in the original sample of naphthalene use those
