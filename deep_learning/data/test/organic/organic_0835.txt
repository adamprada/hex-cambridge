numbers of atoms of both elements present we need to calculate the number of moles of each and divide by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount dividing each number by the number of moles of the element present in the smaller amount gives thus naphthalene contains a ratio of moles of carbon to moles of hydrogen ch because the ratios of the elements in the empirical formula must be expressed as small whole numbers multiply both subscripts by which gives ch as the empirical formula of naphthalene in fact the molecular formula of naphthalene
