electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals using quantum mechanics the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function ψ analogous to the behavior in an atom just like electrons around isolated atoms electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete quantized energies the region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital ψ like an atomic orbital a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin we will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed
