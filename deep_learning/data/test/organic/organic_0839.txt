with inphase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and outofphase waves producing nodes or regions of no electron density figure a when inphase waves combine constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude b when outofphase waves combine destructive interference produces a wave with less or no amplitude there are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms the two types are illustrated in figure the inphase combination produces a lower energy Ïƒs molecular orbital read as sigmas in which most of the electron density
