in the orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei the attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart hence these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals electrons fill the lowerenergy bonding orbital before the higherenergy antibonding orbital just as they fill lowerenergy atomic orbitals before they fill higherenergy atomic orbitals figure sigma σ and sigmastar σ molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of two s atomic orbitals the plus signs indicate the locations of nuclei in p orbitals the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases analogous
