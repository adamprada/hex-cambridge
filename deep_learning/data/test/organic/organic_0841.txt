sigmapx star respectively just as with sorbital overlap the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei which is a higherenergy antibonding orbital figure combining wave functions of two p atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis creates two molecular orbitals σp and the sidebyside overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi π bonding molecular orbital and a π antibonding molecular orbital as shown in figure in valence bond theory we describe π bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals with electron density on
