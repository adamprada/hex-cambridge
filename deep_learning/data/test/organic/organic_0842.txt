one contains the internuclear axis and one is perpendicular to the axis combining the inphase orbitals results in a bonding orbital there is a node blue plane containing the internuclear axis with the two lobes of the orbital located above and below this node in the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules each atom also has two sets of p orbitals oriented side by side py and pz so these four atomic orbitals combine pairwise to create two π orbitals and two π orbitals the πpy and orbitals are oriented at right angles to the πpz and orbitals except for their
