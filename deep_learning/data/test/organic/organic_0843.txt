not result in a new orbital because the inphase component bottom and outofphase component top cancel out only orbitals with the correct alignment can combine this is an outofphase combination resulting in a orbital exercise label the molecular orbital shown as σ or π bonding or antibonding and indicate where the node occurs answer the orbital is located along the internuclear axis so it is a σ orbital there is a node bisecting the internuclear axis so it is an antibonding orbital molecular orbital energy diagrams the relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a
