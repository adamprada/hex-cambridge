orbitals results in three bonding orbitals one σ and two π and three antibonding orbitals one σ and two π figure this is the molecular orbital diagram for the homonuclear diatomic showing the molecular orbitals of the valence shell only the molecular orbitals are filled in the same manner as atomic orbitals using the aufbau principle and hunds rule we predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals by the aufbau principle lowerenergy orbitals fill first electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing and each
