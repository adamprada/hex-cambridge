and include only the valence electrons bond order the filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals the net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons when using lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms thus a single bond has a bond order of a double bond has a bond order of
