from the stabilizing bonding electrons since a bond consists of two electrons we divide by two to get the bond order we can determine bond order with the following equation the order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases if the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero a stable bond does not form we next look at some specific examples of mo diagrams and bond orders bonding
