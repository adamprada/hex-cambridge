this configuration by a molecular orbital energy diagram figure in which a single upward arrow indicates one electron in an orbital and two upward and downward arrows indicate two electrons of opposite spin figure the molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that h will be a stable molecule with lower energy than the separated atoms a dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons so we have because the bond order for the hh bond is equal to the bond is a single bond a helium atom has two electrons both of which are in its s orbital two
