chiral carbons the same as your model of figure translation of a projection formula to a ballandstick model and then to a newman formula the first step is to assemble the model over the projection formula in the same way as shown in figure except that configurations at each of two atoms are involved next the model is turned and rotated around the center bond to put the methyl and carboxyl groups anti to one another the newman formula is then drawn to correspond to the ballandstick model because each chiral center added to a chain doubles the number of
