a left foot a meso compounds achiral diastereomers all of the threonine stereoisomers are chiral substances that is they are not identical with their mirror images however it is important to recognize that not all diastereomers are chiral to illustrate this point we return to the tartaric acids mentioned previously in connection is pasteurs discoveries section c proceeding as we did for threonine we can write four projection formulas for tartaric acid dihydroxybutanedioic acid as shown by these projection formulas can be translated into the respective newman representations we highly recommend that you verify this by the procedure of figure
