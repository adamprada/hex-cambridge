symmetry which means that a plane can be placed through the molecule such that one half of the molecule is a mirror image of the other half the mirror plane for mesotartaric acid can be seen easily from its projection formulas and these two formulas are superimposable if one is rotated in the plane of the paper the newman representations and of mesotartaric acid does not have a mirror plane why is it different from the fischer projections in this respect the reason is that the projection formulas represent a particular eclipsed conformation of mesotartaric acid that does have a
