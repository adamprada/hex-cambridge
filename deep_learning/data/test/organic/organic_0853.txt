simple analogy may help keep matters straight consider three sets of shoes a right shoe beside a left shoe is a meso combination with a plane of symmetry a left shoe next to a left shoe is not identical with but is the mirror image of a right shoe next to a right shoe none of the three combinations are identical each right or left shoe corresponds to a right or left configuration of a tartaric acid carbon so the three sets correspond to meso and tartaric acid respectively there is another symmetry test for meso configurations that is applicable
