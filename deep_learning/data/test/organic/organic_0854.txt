with chiral centers if its projection formula has a plane of symmetry or if we can find a rotational conformation with either a plane or center of symmetry then it will be meso and achiral the idea that for every chiral centers there can be different configurations will be true only if none of the configurations has sufficient symmetry to be identical with its mirror image for every meso form there will be one less pair of enantiomers and one less total number of possible configurations than is theoretically possible according to the number of chiral centers at most one
