a maximum we call them saturated with hydrogen beginning with butane ch and becoming more numerous with larger alkanes we note the existence of alkane isomers for example there are five ch isomers shown below as abbreviated line formulas a through e although these distinct compounds all have the same molecular formula only one a can be called hexane how then are we to name the others the iupac system requires first that we have names for simple unbranched chains as noted above and second that we have names for simple alkyl groups that may be attached to the chains
