have the lowest possible carbon number if there are no functional groups then any substitute present must have the lowest possible number because this example does not contain any functional groups we only need to be concerned with the two substitutes present that is the two methyl groups if we begin numbering the chain from the left the methyls would be assigned the numbers and respectively if we begin numbering the chain from the right the methyls would be assigned the numbers and therefore to satisfy the second rule numbering begins on the right side of the carbon chain as
