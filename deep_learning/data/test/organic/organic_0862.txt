carbons rule carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number if there are no functional groups then any substituent present must have the lowest possible number in this example numbering the chain from either the left or the right would satisfy this rule if we number the chain from the left bromine and chlorine would be assigned the second and sixth carbon positions respectively if we number the chain from the right chlorine would be assigned the second position and bromine would be assigned the sixth position in other words whether we choose to number
