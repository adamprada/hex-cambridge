and chlorine and one substitute the methyl group the longest carbon chain has been highlighted in red and consists of seven carbons rule carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number after taking functional groups into consideration any substitutes present must have the lowest possible carbon number this particular example illustrates the point of difference principle if we number the chain from the left bromine the methyl group and chlorine would occupy the second fifth and sixth positions respectively this concept is illustrated in the second drawing below if we number the chain from the
