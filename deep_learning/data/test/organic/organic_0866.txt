bond angles of approximately a double bond consists of one sigma bond formed by overlap of sp hybrid orbitals and one pi bond formed by overlap of parallel p atomic orbitals the basic rules for straight chain alkenes it is the same basic rules as nomenclature of alkanes except change the suffix to ene find the longest carbon chain that contains the carbon carbon double bond if you have two ties for longest carbon chain and both chains contain a carbon carbon double bond then identify the most substituted chain give the lowest possible number to the carbon carbon double
