this diagram this is a cis conformation it has both the substituents going upward this molecule would be called cis chloroheptene trans would look like this v on the other hand if there are or nonhydrogen different atoms attached to the alkene then use the e z system e entgegen means the higher priority groups are opposite one another relative to the double bond z zusammen means the higher priority groups are on the same side relative to the double bond you could think of z as zame zide to help memorize it in this example it is echloroheptene it
