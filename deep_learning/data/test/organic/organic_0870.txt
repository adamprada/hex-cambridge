carbons the iupac name is therefore trimethylhexene in example the longest chain incorporating both carbon atoms of the double bond has a length of five there is a sevencarbon chain but it contains only one of the double bond carbon atoms consequently the root name of this compound will be pentene there is a propyl substituent on the inside double bond carbon atom so the iupac name is propylpentene the double bond in example is located in the center of a sixcarbon chain the double bond would therefore have a locator number of regardless of the end chosen to begin
