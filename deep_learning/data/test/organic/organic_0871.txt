carboncarbon triple bonds example is best named as an alkyne bearing a cyclobutyl substituent example is simply a tenmembered ring containing both a double and a triple bond the double bond is cited first in the iupac name so numbering begins with those two carbons in the direction that gives the triple bond carbons the lowest locator numbers because of the linear geometry of a triple bond aten membered ring is the smallest ring in which this functional group is easily accommodated example is a cyclooctatriene three double bonds in an eightmembered ring the numbering must begin with one of
