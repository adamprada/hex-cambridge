isomerism hence in this sense their nomenclature is simpler than that of alkenes alkynes are organic molecules made of the functional group carboncarbon triple bonds and are written in the empirical formula of they are unsaturated hydrocarbons like alkenes have the suffix ene alkynes use the ending yne this suffix is used when there is only one alkyne in the molecule introduction here are the molecular formulas and names of the first ten carbon straight chain alkynes name molecular formula ethyne ch propyne ch butyne ch pentyne ch hexyne ch heptyne ch octyne ch nonyne ch decyne ch the more
