substituent the name of this molecule is cyclopropylmethyldecane example name the cycloalkane structure solution there are two different cycloalkanes in this molecule because it contains more carbons the cyclopentane ring will be named as the parent chain the smaller ring cyclobutane is named as a substituent on the parent chain the name of this molecule is cyclobutylcyclopentane when there is only one substituent on the ring the ring carbon attached to the substituent is automatically carbon indicating the number of the carbon with the substituent in the name is optional example chlorocyclobutane or cholorocyclobutane propylcyclohexane or propylcyclohexane if there are
