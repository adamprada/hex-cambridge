not in this example the ethyl or the methyl subsistent could be attached to carbon one the ethyl group attachment is assigned carbon because ethyl comes before methyl alphabetically after assigning carbon the cyclohexane ring can be numbered going clockwise or counterclockwise when looking at the numbers produced going clockwise produces lower substituents numbers than when numbered counterclockwise example name the following structure using iupac rules solution remember when dealing with cycloalkanes with more than two substituents finding the lowest possible substituent numbering takes prescient consider a numbering system with each substituent attachment point as being carbon one compare them
