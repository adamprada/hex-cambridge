chlorine attachment as example bromodimethylcyclohexane although di alphabetically precedes f di is not used in determining the alphabetical order example fluorodimethylcyclohexane not dimethylfluorocyclohexane also fluorodimethylcyclohexane not fluorodimethylcyclohexane although di alphabetically precedes f di is not used in determining the alphabetical order of the substitutents notice that the attachment point of the two methyl groups is assigned carbon despite the fact that fluorine comes first alphabetically this is because this assignment allows for a lower overall numbering of substituents so assigning alphabetical priority is not necessary hydrocarbons having more than one ring are common and are referred to as bicyclic two
