only about kj to overcome the intermolecular attractions and convert mol of liquid water to water vapor at c despite this seemingly low value the intermolecular forces in liquid water are among the strongest such forces known given the large difference in the strengths of intra and intermolecular forces changes between the solid liquid and gaseous states almost invariably occur for molecular substances without breaking covalent bonds note the properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the
