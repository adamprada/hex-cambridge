intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids where the molecules are close together these interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law in this section we explicitly consider three kinds of intermolecular interactions dipoledipole forces dispersion forces and hydrogen bonds these intermolecular interactions are also called van der waals forces or noncovalent interactions there are two additional types of electrostatic interaction that you are already familiar with the ionion interactions that are responsible for ionic bonding and the iondipole interactions that occur when
