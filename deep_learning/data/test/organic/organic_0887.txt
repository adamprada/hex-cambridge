negative end of another and vice versa as shown in figure parts a and b arrangements in which two positive or two negative ends are adjacent parts c and d in figure are higher energy as the similar charges would repel one another hence dipoledipole interactions such as those in parts a and b in figure are attractive intermolecular interactions whereas those in part c and d are repulsive intermolecular interactions figure attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions a and b molecular orientations in which the positive end of one dipole δ is near the negative end of another δ and
