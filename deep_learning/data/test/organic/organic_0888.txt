charge the other end of the molecule has electron density pulled away from it giving it a partial positive charge seen in blue the positive and negative ends of different chloromethane molecules are attracted to one another through this electrostatic interaction because each end of a dipole possesses only a fraction of the charge of an electron dipoledipole interactions are substantially weaker than the interactions between two ions each of which has a charge of at least or between a dipole and an ion in which one of the species has at least a full positive or negative charge in
