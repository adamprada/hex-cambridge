atm pressure whereas nacl which is held together by ionic interactions is a highmeltingpoint solid within a series of compounds of similar molar mass the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases as shown in table using what we learned about predicting relative bond polarities from the electronegativities of the bonded atoms we can make educated guesses about the relative boiling points of similar molecules table relationships between the dipole moment and the boiling point for organic compounds of similar molar mass compound molar mass gmol dipole moment d boiling point k ch
