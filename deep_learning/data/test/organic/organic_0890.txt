of the intermolecular dipoledipole interactions and thus the boiling points of the compounds the first compound methylpropane contains only ch bonds which are not very polar because c and h have similar electronegativity values it should therefore have a very small but nonzero dipole moment and a very low boiling point ethyl methyl ether has a structure similar to ho it contains two polar co single bonds oriented at about a angle to each other in addition to relatively nonpolar ch bonds as a result the co bond dipoles partially reinforce one another and generate a significant dipole moment that
