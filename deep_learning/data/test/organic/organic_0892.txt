a pair of adjacent he atoms for example on average the two electrons in each he atom are uniformly distributed around the nucleus because the electrons are in constant motion however their distribution in one atom is likely to be asymmetrical at any given instant resulting in an instantaneous dipole moment as shown in part a in figure the instantaneous dipole moment on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom pulling them toward the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end the net effect is that the first atom causes
