induced dipole on an adjacent atom or molecule instantaneous dipoleinduced dipole interactions between nonpolar molecules can produce intermolecular attractions just as they produce interatomic attractions in monatomic substances like xe this effect illustrated for two h molecules in part b in figure tends to become more pronounced as atomic and molecular masses increase table for example xe boils at c whereas he boils at c the reason for this trend is that the strength of london dispersion forces is related to the ease with which the electron distribution in a given atom can be perturbed in small atoms such as
