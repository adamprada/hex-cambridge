in this series of four simple alkanes larger molecules have stronger london forces between them than smaller molecules and consequently higher boiling points b linear npentane molecules have a larger surface area and stronger intermolecular forces than spherical neopentane molecules as a result neopentane is a gas at room temperature whereas npentane is a volatile liquid all molecules whether polar or nonpolar are attracted to one another by london dispersion forces in addition to any other attractive forces that may be present in general however dipoledipole interactions in small polar molecules are significantly stronger than london dispersion forces so the
