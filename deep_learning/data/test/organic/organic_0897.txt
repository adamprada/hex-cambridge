predicted on the basis of their molar masses the effect is most dramatic for water if we extend the straight line connecting the points for hte and hse to the line for period we obtain an estimated boiling point of c for water imagine the implications for life on earth if water boiled at c rather than c figure the effects of hydrogen bonding on boiling points these plots of the boiling points of the covalent hydrides of the elements of groups show that the boiling points of the lightest members of each series for which hydrogen bonding is possible
