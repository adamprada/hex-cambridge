be lethal for most aquatic creatures the expansion of water when freezing also explains why automobile or boat engines must be protected by antifreeze and why unprotected pipes in houses break if they are allowed to freeze although hydrogen bonds are significantly weaker than covalent bonds with typical dissociation energies of only kjmol they have a significant influence on the physical properties of a compound compounds such as hf can form only two hydrogen bonds at a time as can on average pure liquid nh consequently even though their molecular masses are similar to that of water their boiling points
