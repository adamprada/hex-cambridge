acceptor draw a structure showing the hydrogen bonding solution a of the species listed xenon xe ethane ch and trimethylamine chn do not contain a hydrogen atom attached to o n or f hence they cannot act as hydrogen bond donors b the one compound that can act as a hydrogen bond donor methanol choh contains both a hydrogen atom attached to o making it a hydrogen bond donor and two lone pairs of electrons on o making it a hydrogen bond acceptor methanol can thus form hydrogen bonds by acting as either a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen
