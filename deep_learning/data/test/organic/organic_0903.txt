atoms together within molecules and polyatomic ions transitions between the solid and liquid or the liquid and gas phases are due to changes in intermolecular interactions but do not affect intramolecular interactions the three major types of intermolecular interactions are dipoledipole interactions london dispersion forces these two are often referred to collectively as van der waals forces and hydrogen bonds dipoledipole interactions arise from the electrostatic interactions of the positive and negative ends of molecules with permanent dipole moments their strength is proportional to the magnitude of the dipole moment and to r where r is the distance between dipoles
