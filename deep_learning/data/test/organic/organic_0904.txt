partially positively charged h atom on one molecule the hydrogen bond donor can interact strongly with a lone pair of electrons of a partially negatively charged o n or f atom on adjacent molecules the hydrogen bond acceptor because of strong ohhydrogen bonding between water molecules water has an unusually high boiling point and ice has an open cagelike structure that is less dense than liquid water key takeaway intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature and include van der waals forces and hydrogen bonds problems which are strongerdipoledipole interactions or london dispersion forces which are likely to be more important
