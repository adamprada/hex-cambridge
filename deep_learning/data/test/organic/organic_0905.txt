b hf c co d ccl e chcl both water and methanol have anomalously high boiling points due to hydrogen bonding but the boiling point of water is greater than that of methanol despite its lower molecular mass why draw the structures of these two compounds including any lone pairs and indicate potential hydrogen bonds do you expect the boiling point of hs to be higher or lower than that of ho justify your answer some recipes call for vigorous boiling while others call for gentle simmering what is the difference in the temperature of the cooking liquid between boiling
