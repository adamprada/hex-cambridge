distance of those electrons from the nucleus larger atoms with more electrons are more easily polarized than smaller atoms and the increase in polarizability with atomic number increases the strength of london dispersion forces these intermolecular interactions are strong enough to favor the condensed states for bromine and iodine under normal conditions of temperature and pressure a the vshaped so molecule has a large dipole moment due to the polar so bonds so dipoledipole interactions will be most important b the hf bond is highly polar and the fluorine atom has three lone pairs of electrons to act as hydrogen
