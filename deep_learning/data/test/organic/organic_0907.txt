plus two lone pairs of electrons that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors giving a net of four hydrogen bonds per ho molecule although methanol also has two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors it only has one oh bond with an h atom that can act as a hydrogen bond donor consequently methanol can only form two hydrogen bonds per molecule on average versus four for water hydrogen bonding therefore has a much greater effect on the boiling point of water ho would have the higher boiling point because it can form
