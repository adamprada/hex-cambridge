is required to change the more stable alignment to the less stable alignment figure schematic representation of the possible alignments of a magnetic nucleus here hydrogen in an applied magnetic field transitions between the two states constitute the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance the arrows through the nuclei represent the average component of their nuclear magnetic moment in the field direction a schematic diagram of an nmr instrument is shown in figure when a substance such as ethanol the hydrogens of which have nuclei protons that are magnetic is placed in the transmitter coil and the magnetic field is increased
