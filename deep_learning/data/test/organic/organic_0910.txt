of a simple nmr spectrometer for what kinds of substances can we expect nuclear magnetic resonance absorption to occur magnetic properties always are found with nuclei of oddnumbered masses and so on as well as for nuclei of even mass but odd atomic number and so on nuclei such as and which have even mass and atomic numbers have no magnetic properties and do not give nuclear magnetic resonance signals for various reasons routine use of nmr spectra in organic chemistry is confined to and we shall be concerned in this chapter only with nmr spectra of hydrogen and of
