a single absorption peak but they also can be much more complex than the spectrum of figure however it is important to recognize that no matter how complex an nmr spectrum appears to be in involves just three parameters chemical shifts spinspin splittings and kinetic reactionrate processes we shall have more to say about each of these later first let us try to establish the relationship of nmr spectroscopy to some of the other forms of spectroscopy we have already discussed in this chapter a the relation of nmr to other kinds of spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy involves transitions
