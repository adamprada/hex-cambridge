nuclear magnetism such that when is zero the nucleus has no spin and no magnetic properties examples are and several nuclei of particular interest to organic chemists and have spin of with there are only two magnetic energy states of the nucleus in a magnetic field these states are designated with the spin quantum numbers and the difference in energy between these states is given by or in which is plancks constant is in hertz is a nuclear magnetic constant called the gyromagnetic ratio and is the magnetic field strength at the nucleus in general will not be exactly equal
