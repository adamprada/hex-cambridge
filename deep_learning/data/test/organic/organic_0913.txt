gauss the dashed vertical line at gauss tells us that the resonance frequency will be and the resonance frequency will be at this field strength there are several modes of operation of an nmr spectrometer first and most common we hold constant and vary or sweep close to energy is absorbed by the nuclei and the current flow from the transmitter increases until is exactly equal to further increase of makes and the current flow decreases the form of the energyabsorption curve as a function of when is changed very slowly is shown in figure a the peak is centered
