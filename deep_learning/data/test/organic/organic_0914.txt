figure an alternative method of running an nmr spectrometer is to hold the magnetic field constant and to sweep the transmitter frequency through the resonances this mode of operation is more like other forms of spectroscopy and gives the same line shapes as sweeping the field figure what energy is associated with a nmr transition the magnitude of this energy may be calculated from the relationship between energy and wavelength frequency of the absorbed radiation section that is and the frequency is the operating frequency of the spectrometer which we will take as or cycles and the velocity of light
