but located in different molecular environments are called chemical shifts another very important point to notice about figure is that the intensities of the three principal absorptions are in the ratio of corresponding to the ratio of the number of each kind of proton producing the signal in general areas under the peaks of a spectrum such as in figure are proportional to the number of nuclei in the sample that give those peaks the areas can be measured by electronic integration and the integral often is displayed on the chart as it is in figure as a stepped line
