occurs is as follows first when an atom is placed in a magnetic field its electrons are forced to undergo a rotation about the field axis as shown in figure second figure induced magnetic field at the nucleus as the result of rotation of electrons about the nucleus in an applied magnetic field rotation of the electrons around the nucleus is a circulation of charge and this creates a small magnetic field at the nucleus opposite in the direction to third the magnitude of this diamagnetic effect is directly proportional to and can be quantified as in which is the
