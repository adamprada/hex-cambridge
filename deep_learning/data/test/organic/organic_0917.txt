are recorded with the field increasing from left to right c chemical shift and stereochemistry the value of nmr spectroscopy in structure determination lies in the fact that chemically different nuclei absorb at different field strengths in later sections we will be concerned with correlating the chemical shifts with structural features however before proceeding furher it is extremely important that you be able to identify the number and kind of nonequivalent protons in a given structure and therefore the number of chemical shifts to expect this number is not always selfevident especially when subtle factors of stereochemistry intervene for this
