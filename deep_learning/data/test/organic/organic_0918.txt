more complicated with substances such as and notice that represents a chiral molecule and if and each are replaced with we get and which are diastereomers see section you can verify this with molecular models if necessary diastereomers have different chemical and physical properties therefore and in are nonequivalent they often are called diastereotopic hydrogens what of the two methylene protons in ethanol which we have labeled as are they identical in a sense they are not identical because if each were replaced by we would have a pair of enantiomers therefore and sometimes are called enantiotopic hydrogens but you
