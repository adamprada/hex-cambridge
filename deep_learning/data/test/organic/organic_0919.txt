be identical the hydrogens in each are trans to the bromine on the adjacent carbon while the hydrogens are cis to the same bromines see section a consequently the and hydrogens are nonequivalent and would be expected to have different chemical shifts in contrast all of the hydrogens of the anti conformer are equivalent and would have the same chemical shift therefore we would expect to observe three chemical shifts arising from and for a mixture of and however the actual spectrum of dibromoethane shows only one sharp proton signal under ordinary conditions the reason is that the magnetic nuclei
