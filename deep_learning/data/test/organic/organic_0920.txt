the appearance of the signal to the rates of the exchange processes are given in section d chemicalshift standards and units chemical shifts always are measured with reference to a standard for protons or in organic molecules the customary standard is a tetramethylsilane which gives strong sharp nmr signals in regions where only a very few other kinds of protons or carbon nuclei absorb chemical shifts often are expressed in cycles per second relative to tetramethylsilane tms these may seem odd units for magnetic field strength but because resonance occurs at either frequency units radians or magnetic field units gauss
