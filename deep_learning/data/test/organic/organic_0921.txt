as from to means a fold increase in at the point of resonance remember and this means also a fold increase in thus resonances that differ because they correspond to different values will be twelve times farther apart at than at this can produce a dramatic simplification of spectra as can be seen from figure which shows the effect of almost a factor of four in on the proton nmr spectrum of methylbutanol figure comparison of the proton nmr spectra of methylbutanol at rf transmitter frequencies of and the line at in the spectrum is due to the protons and
