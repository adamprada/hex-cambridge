get a set of frequencyindependent shifts in parts per million which are useful for all nmr spectrometers nmr shifts reported in relative to tms as zero as shown in figure are called delta values thus if at a proton signal comes downfield relative to tetramethylsilane it can be designated as being relative to tetramethylsilane at the line then will be downfield from tetramethylsilane typical proton chemical shifts relative to tms are given in table the values quoted for each type of proton may in practice show variations of this is not unreasonable because the chemical shift of a given proton
