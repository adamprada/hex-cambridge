life with nmr spectra would be simpler if the scale would just go away e correlations between structure and chemical shifts protonc chemical shifts are very valuable for the determination of structures but to use the shifts in this way we must know something about the correlations that exist between chemical shift and structural environment of protons in organic compounds the most important effects arise from differences in electronegativity types of carbon bonding hydrogen bonding and chemical exchange electronegativity consider first the chemical shifts of protons attached to an carbon the degree of shielding of the proton by the carbon
