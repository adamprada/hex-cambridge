range of not more than compared to for the proton resonances see table figure shows how the shift differences between the and the protons in some derivatives depend on the electronegativity of using the electronegativity defined by l pauling see section b the trend is not wholly linear but the proton chemicalshift differences become larger the more electronegative becomes we can predict with some confidence therefore that a molecule such as will have lowerfield chemical shifts larger for than for if is more electronegative than table typical proton chemicalshift values in dilute solutions figure chemicalshift differences between the and protons
