coming at the lowfield end of this range and protons coming at the highfield end see table alkenic hydrogens vinyl hydrogens normally are observed between toward lower fields than the shifts of protons in alkanes and cycloalkanes this means that alkenic hydrogens in an organic compound can be easily distinguished from alkane hydrogens aromatic protons such as those in benzene have shifts at still lower fields and commonly are observed at in contrast alkynic protons of the type give resonances that are upfield of alkenic or aromatic protons and come at another effect associated with multiple bonds is the large
