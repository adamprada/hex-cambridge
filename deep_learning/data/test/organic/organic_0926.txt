and are observed at rather high field hydrogen bonding when a proton is directly bonded to a strongly electronegative atom such as oxygen or nitrogen its chemical shift is critically dependent on the nature of the solvent temperature concentration and whether acidic or basic impurities are present the usual variations in chemical shift for such protons are so large up to for alcohols that no very useful correlations exist hydrogen bonding is the major reason for the variable chemical shifts of and protons in general hydrogen bonding results in deshielding which causes the resonances to move downfield the extent of
