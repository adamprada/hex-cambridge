broad at compared to figure a triplet at broad at the other concentrations is a consequence of slow exchange of the protons only from molecule to molecule as will be discussed in section i there is no significant change in the relative shifts of the and lines as the concentration is changed chemical exchange many and compounds are weak acids and weak bases and can undergo autoprotolysis which means that a proton can be transferred from one molecule to another suppose we have a compound such as aminoethanol this substance normally would be expected to have an proton resonance at
