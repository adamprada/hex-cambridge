shift averaging that occurs for rapidly equilibrating conformations see section c f application of chemical shifts to structure determination to see how nmr and infrared spectra can be used together for structure determination we shall work through a representative example the objective is to assign a structure to the compound whose nmr spectrum is shown in figure and whose infrared spectrum shows prominent bands at and figure proton nmr spectrum of a compound at relative to tms the infrared spectrum indicates and the position of the carbonyl band suggests that it is probably an ester a carboxylic acid is ruled
