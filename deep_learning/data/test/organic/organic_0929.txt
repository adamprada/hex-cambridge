an ether function if you put all of this information together you find that is the only possible structure to check whether the resonance at is consistent with the assigned structure we can calculate a shift value from equation the agreement between the calculated and observed shifts is not perfect but is within the usual range of variation for equation we can be satisfied that the assigned structure is correct figure proton nmr spectrum of a compound at relative to tms at the stepped line is the integral running from left to right g spinspin splitting what we observe if
