interaction of magnetic nuclei is called spinspin splitting and while it complicates nmr spectra it also provides valuable structural information as we shall see an example of a complex proton spectrum is that of ethyl iodide figure to a first approximation the two main groups of lines appear as equally spaced sets of three and four lines arising from what are called firstorder spinspin interactions matters are further complicated by additional splitting of the threefour pattern of ethyl iodide as also can be seen in figure this additional splitting is called secondorder splitting when there are so many lines present
