shift can be recognized by the fact that it is directly proportional to the transmitter frequency if we double the chemical shifts double in contrast the firstorder spinspin splittings remain the same by this we mean that the magnitude in of the spacing between the lines of a split resonance is independent of the transmitter frequency this spacing corresponds to what is called the spinspin coupling constant or simply the coupling constant and is symbolized by and are directly proportional to the transmitter frequency of the spectrometer but the internal spacings of the split resonances are not see figure third
