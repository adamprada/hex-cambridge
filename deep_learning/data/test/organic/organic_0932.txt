carbons for example the resonance of the ethyl group of ethyl iodide is a quartet of lines because of the spinspin interaction with the neighboring three protons of the methyl group likewise the group is a triplet of lines because of spinspin interactions with the two protons of the methylene group the spinspin splitting patterns observed for some different combinations of protons on contiguous carbons are given in figure where and are groups that give no spin interactions with the protons the value of these patterns when observed lies in the way that they indicate the number of equivalent protons
