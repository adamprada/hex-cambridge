line intensities in the spinspin splitting patterns of figure usually follow simple rules a doublet appears as two lines of equal intensity a triplet as three lines in the ratio a quartet as four lines in the ratio a quintet as and so on the intensities follow the binomial coefficients for where is the number of protons in the splitting group thus when we have or the spectrum of figure provides an excellent example of how nmr shows the presence of contiguous protons the symmetrical doublet and quartet are typical of the interaction between a single proton and an adjacent
