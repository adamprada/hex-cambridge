chemical shifts where restricted rotation or double and triplebonded groups are involved widely divergent splittings are observed for double bonds the twobond couplings between two nonequivalent hydrogens located on one end are characteristically small while the threebond couplings in are larger especially for the trans configuration coupling through four or more bonds is significant for compounds with double or triple bonds examples of these socalled longrange couplings and some other useful splitting values follow finally chemically equivalent protons do not split each others resonances h protonproton splittings and conformational analysis a very important characteristic of threebond protonproton couplings is the
