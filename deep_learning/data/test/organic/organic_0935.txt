the neighboring methylene protons because they are only three bonds apart however this coupling will not be observed if the hydroxyl protons are exchanging rapidly between the ethanol molecules section e when proton exchange is rapid the spin interactions between the and protons average to zero at intermediate exchange rates the coupling manifests itself through line broadening or by actually giving multiple lines if you look at the several spectra of ethanol in figure you will notice how the shape of the resonance varies from a broad singlet to a distinct triplet rapid chemical exchange of magnetic nuclei is not
