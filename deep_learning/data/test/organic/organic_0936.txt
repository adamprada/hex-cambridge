other the magnetic interaction between the states therefore averages to zero this decoupling of magnetic nuclei by double resonance techniques is especially important in nmr spectroscopy section l but also is used to simplify proton spectra by selectively removing particular couplings j use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in organic structural analysis the solution of a typical structural analysis problem by nmr methods utilizes at least four kinds of information obtained directly from the spectrum they are chemical shifts line intensities signal areas spinspin splitting patterns line mulitplicities and coupling constants we already have shown how chemical shifts are used
