pair of dividers with a ruler or with horizontal lines as in figure the integral suggests that one hydrogen is responsible for the resonance at two hydrogens at and three at three hydrogens in a single group suggest a group and because there is a threefour splitting pattern it is reasonable to postulate subtracting from the given formula leaves which with normal valences has to be the spectrum thus appears to be consistent with the structure propanal as judged from the molecular formula and the spinspin splitting pattern which indicates the grouping to be sure of the structure we should
