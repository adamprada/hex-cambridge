to be generally smaller than couplings we usually would not rely on nmr alone in a structureanalysis problem of this kind but would seek clues or corroboration from the infrared electronic or other spectra as well as chemical tests in later chapters we will have many problems that will be facilitated by the use of both nmr and infrared spectra a further worked example will illustrate the approach a compound has the composition and gives the infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra shown in figure the problem is how to use this information to deduce the structure of the compound
