is a alkyne figure infrared and nmr spectra for a compound of formula the infrared spectrum here is different from others shown in this book in being linear in wavelength instead of in wave numbers the units of wavelength here are microns the proton nmr spectrum shows that there are only two principal groups of lines a twoproton doublet at and a oneproton triplet at the twothree splitting pattern combined with the proton ratio suggests a group coupled with a group the structure must be a bromopropyne to confirm the assignment the chemical shifts should be checked table the at
