the integral is not shown the main groups of lines have intensities from the lowfield to highfield in the ratio of figure nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of at the calibrations are relative to the protons of tms the insets show the peaks centered on and with an expanded scale the spacing between the peaks is for group b at and for groups a and c at and the protons are coupled to each other not to a b or c the fiveproton signal at is typical of a phenyl group and the oneproton signals at and are in the region
