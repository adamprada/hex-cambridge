should give four lines two for a and two for b as shown in figure because a and b also are coupled to the three hydrogens of the methyl group c each of the four lines corresponding to will be further split into quartets if then the spacing of the lines in the two sets of quartets will not be the same figure spinspin splitting patterns predicted for the nmr signals of the two alkenic protons a and b of a methylsubstituted alkene of the type where according to the foregoing analysis the maximum number of lines observable for the
