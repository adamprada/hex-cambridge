becomes comparable to coupling constants for magnetic interaction between the groups under these circumstances you may expect to see more lines or lines in different positions with different intensities than predicted from the simple firstorder treatment one example is the effect of changing chemical shift on a twoproton spectrum with figure we see in figure that even when the shift is times larger than the coupling the outside lines are weaker than the inside lines this general kind of asymmetry of line intensities also is apparent in the spectrum of ethyl iodide figure in which the lines of each group
