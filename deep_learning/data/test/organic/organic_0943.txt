line is observed if the shift difference is zero to explain the effect of chemical shifts on secondorder splitting is beyond the scope of this book in fact we havent really explained firstorder splitting although more on this topic will be found in section but regardless of how many lines appear in a complex nmr spectrum they can be rationalized in terms of the chemical shifts coupling constants and exchange effects furthermore the overall signal intensities remain proportional to the number of protons giving rise to the signals when there are many hydrogens and small chemicalshift differences as in alkanes
