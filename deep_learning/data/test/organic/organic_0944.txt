represents the spectrum from at increased sensitivity to show the details of the absorption notice that the ratio of to usually can be determined from the integrals centered on and and will be for an unbranched alkane with carbons for octane a the integral ratio is or l carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in recent years nmr spectroscopy using of natural abundance has become an important tool for organic structural analysis that this did not happen sooner is because has a much smaller magnetic moment than and the small moment combined with the small natural abundance means that is harder
