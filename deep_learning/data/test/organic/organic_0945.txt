on the crucial time basis nmr signals require times more time to get the same signaltonoise ratio as in nmr for the same number of nuclei per unit volume this is a problem electronic improvements and use of communication theory with emphasis on the sayitagain technique have provided the means for obtaining routine spectra for even fairly dilute solutions of quite complex molecules some of the same kinds of structural effects are important for chemical shifts as for proton chemical shifts section e for example there is a similar parallel between shift differences in compounds of the type and electronegativity
