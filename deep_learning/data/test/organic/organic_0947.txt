center of the spectrum arises from the solvent there is no indication of any abnormality in the chemical shifts of carbons and shown in figure a furthermore there is a downfield resonance from the carbons of tms not shown in figure a which is typical of a carbon corresponding to c when is treated with acid we expect the product warfarin of structure to be formed which should have a spectrum much like that shown in figure a in fact the nmr spectrum of the product figure b is much more complex the c c and c resonances of figure
