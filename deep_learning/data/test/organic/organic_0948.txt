sense used here means that the radiofrequency absorption takes place at specified resonance frequencies however you will see that almost all of the forms of spectroscopy we discuss in this book involve resonance absorption in the same sense here is in per gauss physicists usually define in radians per second per gauss from the greek prefix dia meaning through across the opposite of diamagnetic is paramagnetic para meaning alongside we shall use this term later in addition to giving better separation of the lines and clearer spectra going to higher fields also has the beneficial effect of increasing the proportions
