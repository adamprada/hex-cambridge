of this work in any format the octet rulecovalent bondsionic bondssummaryexercisescontributors and attributions learning objective draw interpret and convert between lewis kekule condensed and bondline structures note the review of general chemistry in sections is integrated into the above learning objective for organic chemistry in sections and for organic chemistry the emphasis is on the chemistry of carbon the chemistry of carbon becomes more interesting when carbon is bonded to oxygen andor nitrogen or other heteroatoms atoms that are not carbon or hydrogen therefore the octet rule is a strong factor in organic chemistry and is only violated by noncarbon
