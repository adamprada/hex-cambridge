stable state possible a complete octet is very stable because all orbitals will be full atoms with greater stability have less energy so a reaction that increases the stability of the atoms will release energy in the form of heat or light reactions that decrease stability must absorb energy getting colder the octet rule atoms often gain lose or share electrons to achieve the same number of electrons as the noble gas closest to them in the periodic table when discussing the octet rule we do not consider d or f electrons only the s and p electrons are involved
