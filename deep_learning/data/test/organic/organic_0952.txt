there will be a maximum of eight electrons in the valence shell octet structure eg figure bonding in and methane the other tendency of atoms is to maintain a neutral charge only the noble gases the elements on the rightmost column of the periodic table have zero charge with filled valence octets all of the other elements have a charge when they have eight electrons all to themselves the result of these two guiding principles is the explanation for much of the reactivity and bonding that is observed within atoms atoms seek to share electrons in a way that minimizes
