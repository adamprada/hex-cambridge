heat is released the resulting salt is mostly unreactive it is stable it will not undergo any explosive reactions unlike the sodium and chlorine that it is made of why referring to the octet rule atoms attempt to get a noble gas electron configuration which is eight valence electrons sodium has one valence electron so giving it up would result in the same electron configuration as neon chlorine has seven valence electrons so if it takes one it will have eight an octet chlorine has the electron configuration of argon when it gains an electron the octet rule could have
