be written as follows no dots are shown on cs in the product because cesium has lost its single valence electron to fluorine the transfer of this electron produces the cs ion which has the valence electron configuration of xe and the f ion which has a total of eight valence electrons an octet and the ne electron configuration this description is consistent with the statement that among the main group elements ions in simple binary ionic compounds generally have the electron configurations of the nearest noble gas the charge of each ion is written in the product and the
