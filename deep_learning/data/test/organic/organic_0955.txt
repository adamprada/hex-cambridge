of bonds in compounds is by using lewis electron dot symbols which consist of the chemical symbol for an element surrounded by dots that represent its valence electrons grouped into pairs often placed above below and to the left and right of the symbol the structures reflect the fact that the elements in period and beyond tend to gain lose or share electrons to reach a total of eight valence electrons in their compounds the socalled octet rule hydrogen with only two valence electrons does not obey the octet rule exercises lewis contributors and attributions mike blaber florida state university
