in basic methanol ringopening occurs by an sn mechanism and the less substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under steric considerations and produces product b in the example below conversely when solvolysis occurs in acidic methanol the reaction occurs by a mechanism with substantial sn character and the more substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under electrostatic considerations and produces product a in the example below these are both good examples of regioselective reactions in a regioselective reaction two or more different constitutional isomers are possible as products but one is formed preferentially or sometimes exclusively let us examine the
