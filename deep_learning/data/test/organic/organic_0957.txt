in an sn reaction is the carbon that is least hindered this accounts for the observed regiochemical outcome like in other sn reactions nucleophilic reactions take place with backside orientation relative to the leaving group resulting in inversion at the electrophilic carbon probably the best way to depict the acidcatalyzed epoxide ringopening reaction is as a hybrid or cross between an sn and sn mechanism first the oxygen is protonated creating a good leaving group step below electrostatic considerations have greater importance with a protonated intermediate as the carbonoxygen bond begins to break step positive charge builds on the more
