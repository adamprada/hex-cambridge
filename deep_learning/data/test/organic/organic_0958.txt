stability take a dominant role in determining the mechanism example predict the major products of the ring opening reaction that occurs when the epoxide shown below is treated with ethanol and a small amount of sodium hydroxide ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid hint be sure to consider both regiochemistry and stereochemistry solution addition of hx epoxides can also be opened by other anhydrous acids hx to form a trans halohydrin when both the epoxide carbons are either primary or secondary the halogen anion will attack the less substituted carbon and an sn like reaction however if one
