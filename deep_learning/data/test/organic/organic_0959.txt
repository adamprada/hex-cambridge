it be answer note that the stereochemistry has been inverted first look at the symmetry of the alkene there is a mirror plane shown here then think about the mechanism of epoxidation with an oxyacid take for example mcpba the mechanism is concerted so the original cis stereochemistry is not changed this leads to two epoxides however these two mirror images are actually identical due to the mirror plane of the cis geometry it is a meso compound so the final result is a single stereoisomer but not a single enantiomer contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of
