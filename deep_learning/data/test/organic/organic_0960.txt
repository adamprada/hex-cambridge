through which only light waves oscillating in a single plane may pass a polarimeter is an instrument used to determine the angle through which planepolarized light has been rotated by a given sample you will have the opportunity to use a polarimeter in the laboratory component of the course an analyzer is the component of a polarimeter that allows the angle of rotation of planepolarized light to be determined specific rotations are normally measured at c and this property may be indicated by the symbol cesfalphad sometimes the solvent is specified in parentheses behind the specific rotation value for example
