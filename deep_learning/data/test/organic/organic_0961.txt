enantiomers of a chiral compound perturb planepolarized light in opposite ways this perturbation is unique to chiral molecules and has been termed optical activity polarimetry planepolarized light is created by passing ordinary light through a polarizing device which may be as simple as a lens taken from polarizing sunglasses such devices transmit selectively only that component of a light beam having electrical and magnetic field vectors oscillating in a single plane the plane of polarization can be determined by an instrument called a polarimeter shown in the diagram below monochromatic single wavelength light is polarized by a fixed polarizer next
