chemists use polarimeters to investigate the influence of compounds in the sample cell on plane polarized light samples composed only of achiral molecules eg water or hexane have no effect on the polarized light beam however if a single enantiomer is examined all sample molecules being righthanded or all being lefthanded the plane of polarization is rotated in either a clockwise positive or counterclockwise negative direction and the analyzer must be turned an appropriate matching angle ฮฑ if full light intensity is to reach the detector in the above illustration the sample has rotated the polarization plane clockwise by ยบ
