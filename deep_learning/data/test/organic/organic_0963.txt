to be absolutely certain whether an observed rotation is positive or negative it is often necessary to make a second measurement using a different amount or concentration of the sample in the above illustration for example α might be º or º rather than º if the sample concentration is reduced by then the positive rotation would change to º or º while the negative rotation would change to º and the correct α would be identified unambiguously since it is not always possible to obtain or use samples of exactly the same size the observed rotation is usually corrected
