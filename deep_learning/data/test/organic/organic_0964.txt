identify pure enantiomers for example the lactic acid and carvone enantiomers discussed earlier have the following specific rotations carvone from caraway αd º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or dcarvone carvone from spearmint αd º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or lcarvone lactic acid from muscle tissue αd º this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or dlactic acid lactic acid from sour milk αd º this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or llactic acid a mixture of enantiomers has no observable optical activity such mixtures are called racemates
