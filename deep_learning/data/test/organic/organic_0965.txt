and reflects the inherently chiral nature of life itself chiral synthetic compounds on the other hand are commonly racemates unless they have been prepared from enantiomerically pure starting materials there are two ways in which the condition of a chiral substance may be changed a racemate may be separated into its component enantiomers this process is called resolution a pure enantiomer may be transformed into its racemate this process is called racemization enantiomeric excess the optical purity is a comparison of the optical rotation of a pure sample of unknown stereochemistry versus the optical rotation of a sample of pure
