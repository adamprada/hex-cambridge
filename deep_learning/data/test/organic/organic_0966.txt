excess ee to quantify the difference enantiomeric excess can be expressed as for example a mixture containing r enantiomer and s enantiomer has a enantiomeric excess of r x example carvone the specific rotation of scarvone is measured neat pure liquid sample no solvent the optical rotation of a neat sample of a mixture of r and s carvone is measured at which enantiomer is in excess and what is its ee what are the percentages of r and scarvone in the sample answer the observed rotation of the mixture is levorotary negative counterclockwise and the specific rotation of the
