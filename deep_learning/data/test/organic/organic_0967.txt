or carvone for the racemic mixture however there is no relationship whatsoever between a molecules rs designation and the sign of its specific rotation without performing a polarimetry experiment or looking in the literature we would have no idea that carvone has the r configuration and carvone has the s configuration separation of chiral compounds as noted earlier chiral compounds synthesized from achiral starting materials and reagents are generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called resolution since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution
