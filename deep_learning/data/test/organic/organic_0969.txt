identifying and distinguishing enantiomers is inherently difficult since their physical and chemical properties are largely identical fortunately a nearly two hundred year old discovery by the french physicist jeanbaptiste biot has made this task much easier this discovery disclosed that the right and lefthanded enantiomers of a chiral compound perturb planepolarized light in opposite ways this perturbation is unique to chiral molecules and has been termed optical activity polarimetry planepolarized light is created by passing ordinary light through a polarizing device which may be as simple as a lens taken from polarizing sunglasses such devices transmit selectively only that component
