intensity at the detector is at a maximum when the second movable polarizer is set parallel to the first polarizer ฮฑ ยบ if the analyzer is turned ยบ to the plane of initial polarization all the light will be blocked from reaching the detector chemists use polarimeters to investigate the influence of compounds in the sample cell on plane polarized light samples composed only of achiral molecules eg water or hexane have no effect on the polarized light beam however if a single enantiomer is examined all sample molecules being righthanded or all being lefthanded the plane of polarization is
