lamp compounds that rotate the plane of polarized light are termed optically active each enantiomer of a stereoisomeric pair is optically active and has an equal but oppositeinsign specific rotation specific rotations are useful in that they are experimentally determined constants that characterize and identify pure enantiomers for example the lactic acid and carvone enantiomers discussed earlier have the following specific rotations carvone from caraway αd º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or dcarvone carvone from spearmint αd º this isomer may be referred to as carvone or lcarvone lactic acid from muscle tissue αd º this
