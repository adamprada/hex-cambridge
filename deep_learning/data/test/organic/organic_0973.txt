the following equation chchchch hbr chchchbrch chiral organic compounds isolated from living organisms are usually optically active indicating that one of the enantiomers predominates often it is the only isomer present this is a result of the action of chiral catalysts we call enzymes and reflects the inherently chiral nature of life itself chiral synthetic compounds on the other hand are commonly racemates unless they have been prepared from enantiomerically pure starting materials there are two ways in which the condition of a chiral substance may be changed a racemate may be separated into its component enantiomers this process is
