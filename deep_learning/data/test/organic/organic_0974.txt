for a chiral molecule however we can easily calculate the ratio of enantiomers present in a mixture of two enantiomers based on its measured optical activity when a mixture contains more of one enantiomer than the other chemists often use the concept of enantiomeric excess ee to quantify the difference enantiomeric excess can be expressed as for example a mixture containing r enantiomer and s enantiomer has a enantiomeric excess of r x example the specific rotation of scarvone is measured neat pure liquid sample no solvent the optical rotation of a neat sample of a mixture of r and
