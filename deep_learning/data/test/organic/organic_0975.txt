x x solve for x x and x therefore the percentages of r and scarvone in the sample are and respectively ee more abundant enantiomer chiral molecules are often labeled according to the sign of their specific rotation as in scarvone and rcarvone or carvone for the racemic mixture however there is no relationship whatsoever between a molecules rs designation and the sign of its specific rotation without performing a polarimetry experiment or looking in the literature we would have no idea that carvone has the r configuration and carvone has the s configuration separation of chiral compounds as noted
