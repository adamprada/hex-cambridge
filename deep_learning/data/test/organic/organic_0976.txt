carboxylic acid the result is a mixture of diastereomers in this case because the pure r entantiomer of the acid was used the product is a mixture of rr and rs diastereomeric esters which can in theory be separated by their different physical properties subsequent hydrolysis of each separated ester will yield the resolved enantiomerically pure alcohols the used in this technique are known as exercise a sample with a concentration of gml was placed in a cell with a length of cm the resulting rotation at the sodium d line was what is the αd solution cm dm αd
