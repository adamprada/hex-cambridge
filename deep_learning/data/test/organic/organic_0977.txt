to predict the relative acidity of two organic molecules from their structures predict the relative basicity of two organic molecules from their structures this page explains the acidity of simple organic acids and looks at the factors which affect their relative strengths organic acids as weak acids for the purposes of this topic we are going to take the definition of an acid as a substance which donates hydrogen ions protons to other things we are going to get a measure of this by looking at how easily the acids release hydrogen ions to water molecules when they are in
