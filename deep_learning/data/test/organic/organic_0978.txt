the acid will be present in the solution as unionized molecules for example in the case of dilute ethanoic acid the solution contains about of ethanoic acid molecules at any instant only about have actually ionized the position of equilibrium therefore lies well to the left weak acid polarization organic acids can usually can be characterized in electrostatic potential maps by the presence of of a positively polarized hydrogen atom shown in blue when looking at the maps below methanol has a slightly polarized oh bond and is considered very weakly acidic the oh bond in methyl amine is less
