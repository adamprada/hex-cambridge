conjugate base stabilization of the conjugate base four main considerations size and electronegativity of the atom holding the charge can the charge be delocalized by resonance are there any inductive effects hybridization of orbital holding the charge these considerations are listed in order of importance and are explained individually but must be looked at collectively size and electronegativity effects in acidity when comparing elements it depends on the positional relationship of the elements on the periodic table when moving a period aka across a row of the main group elements the valence electrons all occupy orbitals in the same shell
