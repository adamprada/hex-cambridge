borne by carbon in the methylamine anion a nitrogen and in the methoxide anion an oxygeny remember the periodic trend in electronegativity it also increases as we move from left to right along a row meaning that oxygen is the most electronegative of three elements being considered this makes the negative charge on the methoxide anion the most stable of the three conjugate bases and methanol the strongest of the three acids likewise carbon is the least eletronegative making ethane the weakest of the three acids within a group aka down a column as we move down the periodic table
