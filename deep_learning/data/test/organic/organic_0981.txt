and larger as you go down any one column numbers are the radii in pm this relationship of atomic size and electron density is illustrated when we compare the relative acidities of methanol choh with methanethiol chsh the lower pka value of for methanethiol indicates that it is a stronger acid than methanol with a pka value of it is important to remember that neither compound is considered an acid these relationships become useful when trying to deprotonate compounds to increase their chemical reactivity in nonaqueous reaction conditions methanol ionization methanethiol ionization the difference in size can easilty be seen
