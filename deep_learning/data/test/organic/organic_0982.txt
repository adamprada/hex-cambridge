delocalizing electrons over two or more atoms spreads out the electron density increasing the stability of the conjugate base and increasing the acidity of the corresponding acid a classic example compares the relative acidity of ethanol and acetic acid but the conclusions we reach will be equally valid for all alcohol and carboxylic acid groups despite the fact that they are both oxygen acids the pka values of ethanol and acetic acid are very different in both species the negative charge on the conjugate base is held by an oxygen so periodic trends cannot be invoked for acetic acid however
