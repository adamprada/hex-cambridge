leads to a markedly increased acidity the delocalization of charge by resonance has a very powerful effect on the reactivity of organic molecules enough to account for the difference of nearly pka units between ethanol and acetic acid and remember pka is a log expression so we are talking about a difference of over between the acidity constants for the two molecules the acetate ion is much more stable than the ethoxide ion due to the effects of resonance delocalization the effects of conjugation can be seen when comparing the electrostatic potential maps of ethanol and acetic acid conjugation creates
