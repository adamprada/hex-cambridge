very weak acid the position of equilibrium lies well to the left however phenol can lose a hydrogen ion because the phenoxide ion or phenolate ion the two terms can be used interchangeably formed is stabilized due to resonance the negative charge on the oxygen atom is delocalized around the ring since one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom can be in a p orbital and overlap with the pi electrons on the benzene ring this overlap leads to a delocalization which extends from the ring out over the oxygen atom as a result the negative charge is
