as can be seen in the following energy diagram resonance stabilization is increased for the conjugate base of phenol vs cyclohexanol after removal of a proton the resonance stabilization in these two cases is very different an important principle of resonance is that charge separation diminishes the importance of contributors to the resonance hybrid the contributing structures to the phenol hybrid all suffer charge separation resulting in very modest stabilization of this compound on the other hand the phenolate anion is already charged and the canonical contributors act to disperse the charge resulting in a substantial stabilization of this species
