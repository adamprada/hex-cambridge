hydrogen α alpha to carbonyl alkyl hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbon atom in a α alpha position directly adjacent relative to a co group display unusual acidity while the pka values for alkyl ch bonds in is typically on the order of pka values for these alpha hydrogens is more on the order of this is almost exclusively due to the resonance stabilization of the product carbanion called an enolate as illustrated in the diagram below the effect of the the stabilizing co is seen when comparing the pka for the α hydrogens of aldehydes ketones and esters inductive
