called an electronwithdrawing group notice that the pkalowering effect of each chlorine atom while significant is not as dramatic as the delocalizing resonance effect illustrated by the difference in pka values between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid in general resonance effects are more powerful than inductive effects compare the pka values of acetic acid and its mono di and trichlorinated derivatives the inductive effects of chlorine can be clearly seen when looking at the electrostatic potential maps of acetic acid left and trichloroacetic acid right the oh bond in trichloroacetic acid is highly polarized as shown by the dark
