electron density onto the conjugate base causing the electron density to become more concentrated and producing a destabilizing effect the inductive effects of alkyl groups causes a significant variation in the acidities of different carboxylic acids notice that the inductive effect drops off after the alkyl chain is about three carbons long pka hcooh methanoic acid chcooh ethanoic acid or acetic acid chchcooh propanoic acid chchchcooh butanoic acid orbital hybridization the hybridization of an orbital affects its electronegativity within a shell the s orbitals occupy the region closer to the nucleus than the p orbitals therefore the spherical s orbitals
