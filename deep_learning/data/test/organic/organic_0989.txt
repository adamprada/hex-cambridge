can bond to h below are the maps of methanol methyl amine and acetone all three compounds can be protonated with a sufficiently strong acid note that all three of these compounds also have the ability to donate a proton when reacted with a strong enough base whether these compounds act as a acid or base depends on the conditions it is common to compare basicitys quantitatively by using the pkas of their conjugate acids rather than their pkbs since pka pkb the higher the pka the stronger the base in contrast to the usual inverse relationship of pka with
