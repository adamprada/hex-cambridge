base because of the active lone pair on the nitrogen nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen and so attracts the bonding electrons in the ammonia molecule towards itself that means that in addition to the lone pair there is a buildup of negative charge around the nitrogen atom that combination of extra negativity and active lone pair attracts the new hydrogen from the water when looking at the table below it is clear that the basicity of nitrogen containing compounds is greatly influenced by their structures the variance in the basicity of these compounds can mostly be explained by the
