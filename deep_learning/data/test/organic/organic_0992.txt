are more basic than ammonia making the nitrogen more negative helps the lone pair to pick up a hydrogen ion what about the effect on the positive methylammonium ion formed is this more stable than a simple ammonium ion compare the methylammonium ion with an ammonium ion in the methylammonium ion the positive charge is spread around the ion by the electronpushing effect of the methyl group the more you can spread charge around the more stable an ion becomes in the ammonium ion there is not any way of spreading the charge to summarize the nitrogen is more negative
