amine nitrogen is localized in one place the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is delocalized by resonance the lone pair is stabilized by resonance delocalization heres another way to think about it the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is not available for bonding with a proton these two electrons are too stable being part of the delocalized pibonding system the electrostatic potential map show the effect of resonance on the basicity of an amide the map shows that the electron density shown in red is almost completely shifted towards the oxygen this greatly decreases the basicity of the
