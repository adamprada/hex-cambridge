objective distinguish between organic compounds that are hbond donors versus hbond acceptors hbond donors vs hbond acceptors compounds with hbonding as their dominant intermolecular force imf are both hbond donors and hbond acceptors they are hbond donors because they have a highly polar hydrogen atom bonded to a strongly electronegative atom primarily nitrogen oxygen or fluorine nof because there is an equivalent partial negative charge on the atom bonded to hydrogen mostly nof this atom can accept hbonds from another atoms since hbond donors are always hbond acceptors we simplify communication to hbond donor there are two hbonding interactions for
