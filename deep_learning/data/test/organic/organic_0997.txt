hydrogen bonds is a major component of the liquid state if this is an accurate representation of the composition of this compound then we would expect its boiling point to be equivalent to that of a cho compound formula weight a suitable approximation of such a compound is found in tetramethoxymethane choc which is actually a bit larger formula weight and has a boiling point of Âºc thus the dimeric hydrogen bonded structure appears to be a good representation of acetic acid in the condensed state a related principle is worth noting at this point although the hydrogen bond is
