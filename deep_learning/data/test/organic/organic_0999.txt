added to an unsymmetrical alkene the hydrogen becomes attached to the carbon with the most hydrogens attached to it already in this case the hydrogen becomes attached to the ch group because the ch group has more hydrogens than the ch group notice that only the hydrogens directly attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond count the ones in the ch group are totally irrelevant regioselective if more than one reaction could occur between a set of reactants under the same conditions giving products that are constitutional isomers and if one product forms in greater
