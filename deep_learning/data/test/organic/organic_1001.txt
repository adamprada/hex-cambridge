write an equation to describe the cleavage of an alkene by ozone followed by reduction of the ozonide so formed with either sodium borohydride or zinc and acetic acid predict the products formed from the ozonolysisreduction of a given alkene write an equation to describe the cleavage of an alkene by potassium permanganate predict the products from the oxidative cleavage of a given alkene by potassium permanganate use the results of ozonolysisreduction or cleavage with permanganate to deduce the structure of an unknown alkene identify the reagents that should be used in the oxidative cleavage of an alkene to obtain
