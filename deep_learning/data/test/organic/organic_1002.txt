complex doublebondcontaining compounds into smaller more easily identified products from the identity of the products formed it may be possible to deduce the structure of the original doublebondcontaining substance ozonolysis will feature prominently in many of the roadmap problems that you will encounter in this course a molozonide is an unstable cyclic intermediate that is initially formed when an alkene reacts with ozone alkenes can also be cleaved by other oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate however kmno will carry the oxidation further than ozonolysis so products can be slightly different note within the summary of the following reactions that
