down repeated units used in rubber and other polymers on an industrial scale azelaic acid and pelargonic acids are produced from ozonolysis introduction the gaseous ozone is first passed through the desired alkene solution in either methanol or dichloromethane the first intermediate product is an ozonide molecule which is then further reduced to carbonyl products this results in the breaking of the carboncarbon double bond and is replaced by a carbonoxygen double bond instead reaction mechanism step the first step in the mechanism of ozonolysis is the initial electrophilic addition of ozone to the carboncarbon double bond which then form
