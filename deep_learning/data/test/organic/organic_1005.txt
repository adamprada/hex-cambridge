work in any format oxidation a closer lookepoxide oxacyclopropane synthesis by peroxycarboxylic acidmechanismcontributors and attributions learning objective recognize organic oxidation and reduction reactions predict the productsspecify the reagents for epoxidation of alkenes oxidation a closer look there are a variety of oxidative reagents that can react with alkenes these reagents oxidize the alkene to different degrees and have different synthetic applications it can be helpful to describe the relative oxidative strength of the reagents some reagents are so strong that the carbon chain will be cleaved at the alkene this reactivity can also be a useful distinction before we explore
