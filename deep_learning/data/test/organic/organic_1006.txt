be performed under reductive or gentle conditions or a strong oxidative cleavage reaction can occur with the strongest reagents these four reaction pathways are summarized below epoxide oxacyclopropane synthesis by peroxycarboxylic acid oxacyclopropane rings also called epoxide rings are useful reagents that may be opened by further reaction to form anti vicinal diols one way to synthesize oxacyclopropane rings is through the reaction of an alkene with a peroxycarboxylic acid such as mcpba mchloroperoxybenzoic acid oxacyclopropane synthesis by peroxycarboxylic acid requires an alkene and a peroxycarboxylic acid as well as an appropriate solvent the peroxycarboxylic acid has the unique property
