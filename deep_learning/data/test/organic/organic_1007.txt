exception is mcpba shown in the mechanism above often abbreviated mcpba it is a stable crystalline solid consequently mcpba is popular for laboratory use however mcpba can be explosive under some conditions peroxycarboxylic acids are sometimes replaced in industrial applications by monoperphthalic acid or the monoperoxyphthalate ion bound to magnesium which gives magnesium monoperoxyphthalate mmpp in either case a nonaqueous solvent such as chloroform ether acetone or dioxane is used this is because in an aqueous medium with any acid or base catalyst present the epoxide ring is hydrolyzed to form a vicinal diol a molecule with two oh groups
