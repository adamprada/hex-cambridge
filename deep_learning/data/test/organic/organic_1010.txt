to synthesize oxacyclopropane rings is through the reaction of an alkene with peroxycarboxylic acid oxacyclopropane synthesis by peroxycarboxylic acid oxacyclopropane synthesis by peroxycarboxylic acid requires an alkene and a peroxycarboxylic acid as well as an appropriate solvent the peroxycarboxylic acid has the unique property of having an electropositive oxygen atom on the cooh group the reaction is initiated by the electrophilic oxygen atom reacting with the nucleophilic carboncarbon double bond the mechanism involves a concerted reaction with a fourpart circular transition state the result is that the originally electropositive oxygen atom ends up in the oxacyclopropane ring and the cooh
