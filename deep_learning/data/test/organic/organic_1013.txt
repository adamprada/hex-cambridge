contrast to the synstereoselectivity of the earlier method in the following equation this procedure is illustrated for a cisdisubstituted epoxide which of course could be prepared from the corresponding cisalkene this hydration of an epoxide does not change the oxidation state of any atoms or groups syn dihydroxylation osmium tetroxide oxidizes alkenes to give glycols through syn addition a glycol also known as a vicinal diol is a compound with two oh groups on adjacent carbons introduction the reaction with is a concerted process that has a cyclic intermediate and no rearrangements vicinal syn dihydroxylation complements the epoxidehydrolysis sequence which
