potassium permanganate although syn diols will result from the reaction of kmno and an alkene potassium permanganate is less useful since it gives poor yields of the product because of overoxidation mechanism electrophilic attack on the alkene pi bond of the alkene acts as the nucleophile and reacts with osmium viii tetroxide oso electrons from the double bond flows toward the osmium metal in the process electron pairs move simultaneously cyclic ester with os vi is produced reduction hs reduces the cyclic ester nahso with ho may be used forms the syndiol glycol example dihydroxylation of ethylcycloheptene hydroxylation of alkenes
