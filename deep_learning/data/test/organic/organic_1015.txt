permanganate and osmium tetroxide have similar configurations in which the metal atom occupies the center of a tetrahedral grouping of negatively charged oxygen atoms how then would such a species interact with the nucleophilic pielectrons of a double bond a possible explanation is that an empty dorbital of the electrophilic metal atom extends well beyond the surrounding oxygen atoms and initiates electron transfer from the double bond to the metal in much the same fashion noted above for platinum backbonding of the nucleophilic oxygens to the antibonding Ï€orbital completes this interaction the result is formation of a metallocyclic intermediate as
