objective predict the products and specify the reagents for the oxidation of alkynes alkynes similar to alkenes can be oxidized gently or strongly depending on the reaction environment since alkynes are less stable than alkenens the reactions conditions can be gentler for examples alkynes form vicinal dicarbonyls in neutral permanganate solution for the alkene reaction to vicinal dialcohols the permanganate reaction requires a lightly basic environment for the reaction to occur during strong oxidation with ozone or basic potassium permanganate the alkyne is cleaved into two products because at least one of the reaction products is a carboxylic acid it
