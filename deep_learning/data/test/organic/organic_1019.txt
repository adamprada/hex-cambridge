syndihydroxylation followed by periodic acid alkenes can also be gently cleavage in a twostep reaction sequence in which the alkene first undergoes syndihydroxylation using cold slightly basic kmno or osoho followed by oxidation with periodic acid hio both reaction sequences are shown below using methylcyclohexene as an example gentle cleavage ozonolysis with a reduction workup ozonolysis is a method of oxidatively cleaving alkenes or alkynes using ozone a reactive allotrope of oxygen the process allows for carboncarbon double or triple bonds to be replaced by double bonds with oxygen this reaction is often used to identify the structure of unknown
