mechanism of ozonolysis is the initial electrophilic addition of ozone to the carboncarbon double bond to form the molozonide intermediate due to low stablility of molozonide it continues reacting and breaks apart to form a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide molecule step the electrons of the carbonyl and the carbonyl oxide form the stable ozonide intermediate which can then undergo an oxidative or reductive workup to form the products of interest a reductive workup converts the ozonide molecule into the desired carbonyl products with aldehyde on terminal carbons an oxidative workup converts the ozonide molecule into the desired carbonyl products
