organic compounds are classified by their functional groups to talk about organic chemistry we need to be able to a recognize and name the major organic functional groups see chapter for nomenclature b apply bonding theories to the structure of functional groups c visual functional groups in three dimensions d determine the polarity intermolecular forces of organic compounds ultimately all of the information above will be integrated at the end of this chapter to predict solubilities and relative boiling points of organic compounds in future chapters these skills will help elucidate reaction mechanisms and pathways sterics electrostatics all roads lead
