lowest charge distribution is the most stable and reacts preferentially sterics can be predicted using bonding theories molecular orbital mo theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire molecule in valence bond theory vb theory atomic orbitals can be hybridized vb theory assumes that all bonds are localized bonds formed between two atoms by the donation of an electron from each atom as discussed in chapter this assumption is invalid because some atoms can bond using delocalized electrons through resonance vb theory does a good job of qualitatively describing the shapes
