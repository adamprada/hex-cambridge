boiling point which is a small number of degrees lower than the corresponding alkane the only attractions involved are van der waals dispersion forces and these depend on the shape of the molecule and the number of electrons it contains compound boiling points oc ethene propene transbutene cisbutene trans dichlorobutene cis dichlorobutene pentene transpentene cispentene heptene octene nonene decene melting points melting points of alkenes depends on the packaging of the molecules so the stereochemistry of the carboncarbon double bond has a strong influence on the relative melting points alkenes have similar melting points to that of alkanes however in
