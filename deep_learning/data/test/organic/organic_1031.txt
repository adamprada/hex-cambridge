properties and undergo relatively few chemical reactions other than combustion they serve as a basis of comparison for the properties of many other organic compound families lets consider their physical properties first boiling points table describes some of the properties of some of the first straightchain alkanes because alkane molecules are nonpolar they are insoluble in water which is a polar solvent but are soluble in nonpolar and slightly polar solvents consequently alkanes themselves are commonly used as solvents for organic substances of low polarity such as fats oils and waxes nearly all alkanes have densities less than gml and
