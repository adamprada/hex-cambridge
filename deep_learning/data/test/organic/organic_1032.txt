per milliliter gas densities are at atm pressure the boiling points for the straight chain isomers and isoalkanes isomers are shown to demonstrate that branching decreases the surfaces area weakens the imfs and lowers the boiling point this next diagrams summarizes the physical states of the first six alkanes the first four alkanes are gases at room temperature and solids do not begin to appear until about but this is imprecise because different isomers typically have different melting and boiling points by the time you get carbons into an alkane there are unbelievable numbers of isomers cycloalkanes have boiling points
