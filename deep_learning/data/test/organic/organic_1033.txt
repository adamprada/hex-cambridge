more branched the chain the lower the boiling point tends to be van der waals dispersion forces are smaller for shorter molecules and only operate over very short distances between one molecule and its neighbors it is more difficult for short fat molecules with lots of branching to lie as close together as long thin molecules example structure dependent boiling points for example the boiling points of the three isomers of are pentane k methylbutane k dimethylpropane k the slightly higher boiling points for the cycloalkanes are presumably because the molecules can get closer together because the ring structure makes
