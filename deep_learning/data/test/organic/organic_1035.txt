slick hectares acres in size this and similar spills provide a reminder that hydrocarbons and water dont mix source photo courtesy of nasa goddard modis rapid response team httpwwwnasagovtopicsearthfeaturesoilspilloilahtml solubility in organic solvents in most organic solvents the primary forces of attraction between the solvent molecules are van der waals either dispersion forces or dipoledipole attractions therefore when an alkane dissolves in an organic solvent the van der waals forces are broken and are replaced by new van der waals forces the two processes more or less cancel each other out energetically thus there is no barrier to solubility looking
