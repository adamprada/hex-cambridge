much heavier than air density gl if bottled gas escapes into a building it collects near the floor this presents a much more serious fire hazard than a naturalgas leak because it is more difficult to rid the room of the heavier gas also shown in table are the boiling points of the straightchain alkanes increase with increasing molar mass this general rule holds true for the straightchain homologs of all organic compound families larger molecules have greater surface areas and consequently interact more strongly more energy is therefore required to separate them for a given molar mass the boiling
