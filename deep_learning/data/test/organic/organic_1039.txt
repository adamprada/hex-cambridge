of atoms in the structural backbone are said to constitute a homologous series when used to forecast the properties of unknown members of the series the concept of homology works most satisfactorily for the highermolecularweight members because the introduction of additional groups makes a smaller relative change in the overall composition of such molecules this is better seen from figure which shows figure dependence of difference in boiling and melting points between consecutive members of the series of continuouschain alkanes on number of carbon atoms how the differences in boiling points and melting points between consecutive members of the homologous
