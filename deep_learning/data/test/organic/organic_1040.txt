aid for the organic chemist to cope with the large numbers of compounds with which he works in the simplest approximation the members of a homologous series are assumed to have essentially the same properties except for the increases in boiling point and melting point as shown in figure for alkanes this generally will be true except when the number of carbons is small and when the hydrocarbon chain has polar substituents to explain briefly consider compounds such as alcohols which have polar groups as we indicated in section polarity causes molecules to associate with one another which decreases their
