the presence or absence of a dipole moment may also give an important clue to a compounds structure bcl for example has no dipole moment while nh does this suggests that in bcl the chlorines around boron are in a trigonal planar arrangement while the hydrogens around nitrogen in nh have a less symmetrical arrangement trigonal pyramidal remember that the ch bond is assumed to be nonpolar molecular dipole moments in molecules containing more than one polar bond the molecular dipole moment is just the vector combination of what can be regarded as individual bond dipole moments mathematically dipole moments
