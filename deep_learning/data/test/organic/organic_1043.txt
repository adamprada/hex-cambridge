molecule has no net dipole moment even though it has a substantial separation of charge in contrast the ho molecule is not linear figure it is bent in threedimensional space so the dipole moments do not cancel each other thus a molecule such as ho has a net dipole moment we expect the concentration of negative charge to be on the oxygen the more electronegative atom and positive charge on the two hydrogens this charge polarization allows ho to hydrogenbond to other polarized or charged species including other water molecules figure how individual bond dipole moments are added together to
