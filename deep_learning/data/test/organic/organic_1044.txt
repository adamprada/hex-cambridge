within a molecule this bond dipole Âµ greek mu is interpreted as the dipole from a charge separation over a distance between the partial charges and or the more commonly used terms the orientation of the dipole is along the axis of the bond the units on dipole moments are typically debyes d where one debye is equal to x coulomb meters c m in si units consider a simple system of a single electron and proton separated by a fix distance the unit charge on an electron is x c and the proton electron are pm apart about the
