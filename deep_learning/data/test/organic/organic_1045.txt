of the hydrogenoxygen bonds next because the oxygen is the more electronegative atom it exerts a greater pull on the shared electrons it also has two lone pairs of electrons from this it can be concluded that the dipole moment points from between the two hydrogen atoms toward the oxygen atom using the equation above the dipole moment is calculated to be d by multiplying the distance between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms by the charge difference between them and then finding the components of each that point in the direction of the net dipole moment the angle of the
