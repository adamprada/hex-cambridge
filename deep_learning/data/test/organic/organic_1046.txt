or a side which is slightly negative and one which is slightly positive the whole of the outside of the molecule is somewhat negative but there is no overall separation of charge from top to bottom or from left to right in contrast is a polar molecule right panel in figure above however although a molecule like chcl has a tetrahedral geometry the atoms bonded to carbon are not identical consequently the bond dipole moments do not cancel one another and the result is a molecule which has a dipole moment the hydrogen at the top of the molecule is
