d which points in the direction of the chlorine in the evenly spaced red areas represent that there is no separation of charge in the molecule has a net dipole moment of zero which makes it a nonpolar molecule figure electrostatic potential maps and dipole moments for chloromethane and tetrachloromethane carbon tetrachloride molecules with asymmetrical charge distributions have a net dipole moment other examples of molecules with polar bonds are shown in figure in molecules like bcl and ccl that have only one type of bond and a molecular geometries that are highly symmetrical trigonal planar and tetrahedral the individual
