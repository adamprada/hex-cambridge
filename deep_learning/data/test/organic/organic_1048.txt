pf and sf table dipole moments of some compounds compound dipole moment debyes nacl measured in the gas phase cho chcl ho choh nh chnh co ccl ch chch the table above give the dipole moment of some common substances sodium chloride has the largest dipole listed d because it is an ionic compounds even small organic compounds such as formaldehyde cho d and methanol choh d have significant dipole moments both of these molecules contain the strongly electronegative oxygen atom lone pair electrons which gives rise to considerable dipole moments in contrast many organic molecule have a zero dipole
