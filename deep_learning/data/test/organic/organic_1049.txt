polar or nonpolar answer although the ccl bonds are rather polar the individual bond dipoles cancel one another in this symmetrical structure and does not have a net dipole momentclcccl exercise the following molecule has no net dipole moment explain answer the hydroxyl groups are oriented opposite of one another and therefore the dipole moments would cancel one another out therefore having a zero netdipole exercise within reactions with carbonyls such as a hydride reduction reaction the carbonyl is attacked from the carbon side and not the oxygen side using knowledge of electronegativity explain why this happens answer the oxygen
