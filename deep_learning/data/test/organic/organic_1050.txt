molecular geometry of hs is bent the bond dipoles cannot cancel one another so the molecule has a net dipole moment difluoroamine has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry because there is one hydrogen and two fluorines and because of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen the molecule is not symmetrical and the bond dipoles of nhf cannot cancel one another this means that nhf has a net dipole moment we expect polarization from the two fluorine atoms the most electronegative atoms in the periodic table to have a greater affect on the net dipole moment than polarization from the
