as a reduction reaction the carbonyl is attacked from the carbon side and not the oxygen side using knowledge of electronegativity explain why this happens solutions s the hydroxyl groups are oriented opposite of one another and therefore the dipole moments would cancel one another out therefore having a zero netdipole s and have a net dipoles s the oxygen is more electronegative than the carbon and therefore creates a dipole along the bond this leads to having a partial positive charge on the carbon and the reduction can take place contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of
