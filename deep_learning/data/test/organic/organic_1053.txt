the knowledge of bond polarity indispensible when you start to write reaction mechanisms note because of the small difference in electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen the ch bond is normally assumed to be nonpolar electronegativity because the tendency of an element to gain or lose electrons is so important in determining its chemistry various methods have been developed to quantitatively describe this tendency the most important method uses a measurement called electronegativity represented by the greek letter chi Ï‡ pronounced ky as in sky which is defined as the relative ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself in
