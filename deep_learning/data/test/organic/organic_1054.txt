different methods for measuring the electronegativity of an atom are compared they all tend to assign similar relative values to a given element figure shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century linus pauling in this scale a value of is arbitrarily given to the most electronegative element fluorine and the other electronegativities are scaled relative to this value in general electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group thus the nonmetals which lie in the upper right
