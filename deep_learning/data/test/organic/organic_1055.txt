a particular molecule to attract electrons to itself the larger the electronegativity value the greater the attraction figure pauling scale electronegativities of elements figure visual representation of electronegativities electronegativity and bond type the two idealized extremes of chemical bonding ionic bondingin which one or more electrons are transferred completely from one atom to another and the resulting ions are held together by purely electrostatic forcesand covalent bonding in which electrons are shared equally between two atoms most compounds however have polar covalent bonds which means that electrons are shared unequally between the bonded atoms electronegativity determines how the shared electrons
