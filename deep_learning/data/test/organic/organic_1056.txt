charge indicated by δ and a bond between two atoms that possess partial charges is a polar bond figure the electron distribution in a nonpolar covalent bond a polar covalent bond and an ionic bond using lewis electron structures electronrich negatively charged regions are shown in blue electronpoor positively charged regions are shown in red whether a bond is ionic nonpolar covalent or polar covalent can be estimated by by calculating the absolute value of the difference in electronegativity δen of two bonded atoms when the difference is very small or zero the bond is covalent and nonpolar when it
