in the periodic table bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent bonding between a metal and a nonmetal is often ionic figure as the electronegativity difference increases between two atoms the bond becomes more ionic some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds the atoms in polyatomic ions such as oh no and nh are held together by polar covalent bonds however these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds by combining with ions of opposite charge for example potassium nitrate kno contains the k cation and the polyatomic no anion thus bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic resulting from the electrostatic
