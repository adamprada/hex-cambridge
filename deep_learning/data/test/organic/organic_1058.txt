more electronegative of the two table shows these bonds in order of increasing polarity table bond polarity and electronegativity difference bond Î´en polarity ch sh cn nh co oh visualizing bonding calculated charge distributions in molecules can easily be visualized by using electrostatic potential maps the color red is used to indicate electronrich regions of a molecule while the color blue is used to indicated electronpoor regions an easier method for visually representing electron displacement in a molecule uses a crossed arrow by convention the arrow point in the direction of the electronrich region of a molecule and away from
