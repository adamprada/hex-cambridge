of atoms relatively electronegative atoms such as fluorine tend to inductively draw electrons towards themselves and away from nearby atoms the inductive effect will be used to explain chemical reactivity in many situations in organic chemistry an excellent example of the inductive effect is seen when comparing the oh bond polarities of water ho and hypochlorous acid cloh replacing the less electronegative hydrogen en in water with the more electronegative chlorine en in hypochlorous acid creates a greater bond polarity the chlorine draws electrons away giving the hydrogen a greater partial positive charge this is shown in the electrostatic potential
