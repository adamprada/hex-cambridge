properties of sodium chloride however we tend to count it as if it were purely ionic lithium iodide on the other hand would be described as being ionic with some covalent character in this case the pair of electrons has not moved entirely over to the iodine end of the bond lithium iodide for example dissolves in organic solvents like ethanol not something which ionic substances normally do a general rule in organic chemistry is if the bond is between metal and a nonmetal atoms then the bond should be considered ionic examples of this are the lithium carbon bond
