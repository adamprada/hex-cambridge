in a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms there is no difference in electronegativity so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent when the electronegativity difference is very large as is the case between metals and nonmetals the bonding is characterized as ionic no electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a nonpolar covalent bond a small electronegativity difference leads to a polar covalent bond a large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond hclhohoc exercises identify the positive and negative ends of each of the bonds shown below which of the following elements is the more electronegative a br
