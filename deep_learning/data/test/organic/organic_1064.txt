progress down the periodic table from fluorine to iodine molecular size increases as a result we also see an increase in bond length conversely as molecular size increases and we get longer bonds the strength of those bonds decreases the influence of bond polarity of the four halogens fluorine is the most electronegative and iodine the least that means that the electron pair in the carbonfluorine bond will be dragged most towards the halogen end looking at the methyl halides as simple examples the electronegativities of carbon and iodine are equal and so there will be no separation of charge
