positive and negative charge already present but thats not so quite the opposite is true the thing that governs the reactivity is the strength of the bonds which have to be broken if is difficult to break a carbonfluorine bond but easy to break a carboniodine one the carbonyl group co is prone to additions and nucleophillic attack because or carbons positive charge and oxygens negative charge the resonance of the carbon partial positive charge allows the negative charge on the nucleophile to attack the carbonyl group and become a part of the structure and a positive charge usually a
