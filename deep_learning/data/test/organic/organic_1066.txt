to this plane and forms a sidebyside pi bond with a p orbital on the oxygen the carbonoxygen double bond is polar oxygen is more electronegative than carbon so electron density is higher on the oxygen side of the bond and lower on the carbon side recall that bond polarity can be depicted with a dipole arrow or by showing the oxygen as holding a partial negative charge and the carbonyl carbon a partial positive charge a third way to illustrate the carbonoxygen dipole is to consider the two main resonance contributors of a carbonyl group the major form which
