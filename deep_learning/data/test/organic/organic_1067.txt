carbonyl double bond bears a partial negative charge anything that can help to stabilize this charge by accepting some of the electron density will increase the bonds polarity and make the carbon more electrophilic very often a general acid group serves this purpose donating a proton to the carbonyl oxygen the same effect can also be achieved if a lewis acid such as a magnesium ion is located near the carbonyl oxygen unlike the situation in a nucleophilic substitution reaction when a nucleophile attacks an aldehyde or ketone carbon there is no leaving group the incoming nucleophile simply pushes the
