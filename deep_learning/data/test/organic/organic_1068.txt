an alcohol oxygen or an amine nitrogen or occasionally a thiol sulfur in one very important reaction type known as an aldol reaction the nucleophile attacking the carbonyl is a resonancestabilized carbanion in this chapter we will concentrate on reactions where the nucleophile is an oxygen or nitrogen nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and ketones nucleophilic substitution of rcoz z leaving group general reaction general mechanism polarity patterns in other common functional groups nucleophile nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond in both laboratory and biological
