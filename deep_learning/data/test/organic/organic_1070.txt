the electrophile is a methyl carbon and another in which it is tertiary carbon because the three substituents on the methyl carbon electrophile are tiny hydrogens the nucleophile has a relatively clear path for backside attack however backside attack on the tertiary carbon is blocked by the bulkier methyl groups once again steric hindrance this time caused by bulky groups attached to the electrophile rather than to the nucleophile hinders the progress of an associative nucleophilic sn displacement the factors discussed in the above paragraph however do not prevent a stericallyhindered carbon from being a good electrophile they only make
