be carried out at temperatures of about in the dark under such circumstances the mechanism is similar to that of lightinduced chlorination except that the chlorine atoms are formed by thermal dissociation of chlorine molecules solid carbon surfaces catalyze thermal chlorination possibly by aiding in the cleavage of the chlorine molecules direct monohalogenation of saturated hydrocarbons works satisfactorily only with chlorine and bromine for the general reaction the calculated value is negative and very large for fluorine negative and moderate for chlorine and bromine and positive for iodine see table with fluorine the reaction evolves so much heat that it
