less reactive toward hydrocarbons than chlorine is both at high temperatures and with activation by light nonetheless it usually is possible to brominate saturated hydrocarbons successfully iodine is unreactive table calculated heat of reaction for halogenation fo hydrocarbons halogen x kcalmolea f cl br i acalculated from the bond energies of table the chlorination of methane does not have to stop with the formation of chloromethane methyl chloride it is usual when chlorinating methane to obtain some of the higher chlorination products dichloromethane methylene chloride trichloromethane chloroform and tetrachloromethane carbon tetrachloride in practice one can control the degree of substitution
