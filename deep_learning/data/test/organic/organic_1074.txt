positions of substitution that is and would be formed in the ratio however as can be seen from table the strengths of hydrogen bonds to primary secondary and tertiary carbons are not the same and from the argument given in section e we would expect the weaker bonds to be preferentially attacked by the proportion of formed is about three times that expected on a statistical basis which is in accord with our expectation that the tertiary bond of methylbutane should be the weakest of the bonds see table the factors governing selectivity in halogenation of alkanes follow the rates
