chlorine atoms usually are exothermic data from table bromine removes only those hydrogens that are relatively weakly bonded to a carbon atom as predicted attack of on methylbutane leads mostly to bromomethylbutane some secondary bromide and essentially no primary bromides the selectivity of chlorination reactions carried on in solution is increased markedly in the presence of benzene or alkylsubstituted benzenes because benzene and other arenes form loose complexes with chlorine atoms this substantially cuts down chlorineatom reactivity thereby making the chlorine atoms behave more like bromine atoms b chemical initiation of radicalchain substitution it is possible to achieve chlorination of
