below pka using pka values to predict reaction equilibria by definition the pka value tells us the extent to which an acid will react with water as the base but by extension we can also calculate the equilibrium constant for a reaction between any acidbase pair mathematically it can be shown that keq for the acid base reaction in question Î´pka where is the of product acid minus of reactant acid consider a reaction between methylamine and acetic acid first we need to identify the acid species on either side of the equation on the left side the acid is
