the righthand side of the equation just as we had predicted if you had just wanted to approximate an answer without bothering to look for a calculator you could have noted that the difference in pka values is approximately so the equilibrium constant should be somewhere in the order of or one million using the pka table in this way and making functional groupbased pka approximations for molecules for which we dont have exact values we can easily estimate the extent to which a given acidbase reaction will proceed example show the products of the following acidbase reactions and estimate
