p blocks from the periodic table to scale showing the two trends for the atomic radius figure atomic radii trends on the periodic table although there are some reversals in the trend eg see po in the bottom row atoms generally get smaller as you go across the periodic table and larger as you go down any one column numbers are the radii in pm this relationship of atomic size and electron density is illustrated when we compare the relative acidities of methanol choh with methanethiol chsh the lower pka value of for methanethiol indicates that it is a stronger
