methane ammonia water and hydrofluoric acid reflects the relative electonegativities of the c n o f periodic trends first we will focus on individual atoms and think about trends associated with the position of an element on the periodic table well use as our first models the simple organic compounds ethane methylamine and methanol but the concepts apply equally to more complex biomolecules such as the side chains of alanine lysine and serine we can see a clear trend in acidity as we move from left to right along the second row of the periodic table from carbon to nitrogen
