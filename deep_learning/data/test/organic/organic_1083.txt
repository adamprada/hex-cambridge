the three and carbon the least the more electronegative an atom the better it is able to bear a negative charge thus the methoxide anion is the most stable lowest energy least basic of the three conjugate bases and the ethyl anion is the least stable highest energy most basic we can use the same set of ideas to explain the difference in basicity between water and ammonia by looking at the pkavalues for the appropriate conjugate acids we know that ammonia is more basic than water oxygen as the more electronegative element holds more tightly to its lone pair
