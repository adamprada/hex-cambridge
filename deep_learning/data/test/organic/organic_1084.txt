trend we will once again consider the stability of the conjugate bases because fluorine is the most electronegative halogen element we might expect fluoride to also be the least basic halogen ion but in fact it is the least stable and the most basic it turns out that when moving vertically in the periodic table the size of the atom trumps its electronegativity with regard to basicity the atomic radius of iodine is approximately twice that of fluorine so in an iodine ion the negative charge is spread out over a significantly larger volume this illustrates a fundamental concept in
