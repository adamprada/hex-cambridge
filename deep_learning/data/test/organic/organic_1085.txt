is one the strongest acids known more importantly to the study of biological organic chemistry this trend tells us that thiols are more acidic than alcohols the pka of the thiol group on the cysteine side chain for example is approximately while the pka for the hydroxl on the serine side chain is on the order of to reiterate acid strength increases as we move to the right along a row of the periodic table and as we move down a column example draw the structure of the conjugate base that would form if the compound below were to react
