chapter delocalizing electrons over two or more atoms lowers the electron density the first model pair we will consider is ethanol and acetic acid but the conclusions we reach will be equally valid for all alcohol and carboxylic acid groups despite the fact that they are both oxygen acids the pka values of ethanol and acetic acid are very different what makes a carboxylic acid so much more acidic than an alcohol as before we begin by considering the conjugate bases in both species the negative charge on the conjugate base is held by an oxygen so periodic trends cannot
