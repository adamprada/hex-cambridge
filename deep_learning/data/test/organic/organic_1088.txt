in an amine but not basic when it is part of an amide group recall that in an amide there is significant doublebond character to the carbonnitrogen bond due to a second resonance contributor in which the nitrogen lone pair is part of a p bond while the electron lone pair of an amine nitrogen is stuck in one place the lone pair on an amide nitrogen is delocalized by resonance notice that in this case we are extending our central statement to say that electron density in the form of a lone pair is stabilized by resonance delocalization even
