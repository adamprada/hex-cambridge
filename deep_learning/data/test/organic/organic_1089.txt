pka of there are four hydroxyl groups on this molecule which one is the most acidic if we consider all four possible conjugate bases we find that there is only one for which we can delocalized the negative charge over two oxygen atoms example rank the compounds below from most acidic to least acidic and explain your reasoning inductive effects the inductive effect is an experimentally observed effect of the transmission of charge through a chain of atoms in a molecule resulting in a permanent dipole in a bond inductive effects decrease quickly with distance the inductive effect can be
