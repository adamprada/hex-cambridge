the conjugate base compare the pka values of acetic acid and its mono di and trichlorinated derivatives the presence of the chlorines clearly increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid group a chlorine atom is more electronegative than a hydrogen and thus is able to induce or pull electron density towards itself away from the carboxylate group in helping to further spread out the electron density of the conjugate base which as we know has a stabilizing effect in this context the chlorine substituent is called an electronwithdrawing group notice that the pkalowering effect of each chlorine atom while significant
