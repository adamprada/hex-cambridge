electronegativity within a shell the s orbitals occupy the region closer to the nucleus than the p orbitals therfore the spherical s orbitals are more electronegative than the lobed p orbitals the relative electronegativity of hybridized orbitals is sp sp sp this trend indicates the sp hybridized orbitals are more stable with a charge than sp hybridized orbitals the table below shows how orbital hybridization compares with the identity of the atom when predicting relative acidity guided practice lets practice by comparing the relative acidity of phenol with acetic acid which compound is the stronger acid phenol or acetic acid
