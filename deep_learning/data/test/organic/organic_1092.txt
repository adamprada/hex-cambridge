pka table below supports our prediction acetic acid has a pka of while phenol has a pka of a word of caution when using the pka table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair if you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia nh compared to that of ethoxide ion chcho for example the relevant pka values to consider are the pka of ammonium ion and the pka of ethanol from these numbers you know that ethoxide is the stronger base do not make the mistake of using the pka value of
