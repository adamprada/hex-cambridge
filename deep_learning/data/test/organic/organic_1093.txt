here at the beginning of out discussion of organic reactions because they provide a sound basis for understanding the key questions concerning the practical use of organic reactions is the equilibrium point of a given reaction far enough toward the desired products to be useful can conditions be found in which the reaction will take place at a practical rate how can unwanted side reactions be suppressed initially we will be concerned with the physical properties of alkanes and how these properties can be correlated by the important concept of homology this will be followed by a brief survey of
