that it is electrical forces of attraction and repulsion between the electrons and nuclei that determine the bonding perhaps we should be surprised that such simple mechanical models provide so much useful information what we will try to do in this chapter is to show you how the modern electronic theory of chemical bonding provides strong support for the use of ballandstick models for many organic molecules and also where it indicates that the models need to be modified or cannot properly represent the structural arrangements there are several qualitative approaches to bonding in polyatomic molecules but we shall discuss
