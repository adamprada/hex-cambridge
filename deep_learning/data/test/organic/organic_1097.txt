as opposed to homolytic cleavage of electronpair bonds in heterolytic bond cleavage the electron pair can be considered to go with one or the other of the groups and when the bond is broken as one example is a group such that it has an unshared electron pair and also is a negative ion a heterolytic substitution reaction in which the bonding pair goes with would lead to and a specific substitution reaction of this type is that of chloromethane with hydroxide ion to form methanol in this chapter we shall discuss substitution reactions that proceed by ionic or polar
