and structural formulas but this is a slow process if the molecules are complicated and is not well suited for conversation try describing a structural formula of a complex molecule to someone for more rapid and efficient communication we need to have names for compounds and we should have every reason to hope that after years the names now in use would be clear unambiguous easy to pronounce easy to spell and to remember as well as being amenable to arrangement in alphabetical order but even more we should hope that the names of organic compounds would contain enough information
