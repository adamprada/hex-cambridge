appropriate classes of compounds identification and structure determination are often closely allied to the problem of separation once a compound is separated how do we determine whether it is identical to some previously known compound identification or if that cant be done how do we determine its chemical structure the spectroscopic properties of molecules have proven to be extremely informative for both identification and structure determination and this chapter is mainly concerned with the application of spectroscopy for such purposes we will give you now an overview of the spectroscopic properties of the major classes of organic compounds in subsequent
