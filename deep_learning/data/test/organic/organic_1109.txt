the same positions in the molecules chloropropane and chloropropane are straightforward examples of position isomers a much more subtle form of isomerism is present when two different compounds have the same molecular formulas the same substituent and chainbranching positions and indeed even have the same names by all of the nomenclature rules we have given you so far such isomers are different because their molecules have different arrangements of the atoms in space these are stereoisomers and this type of isomerism called stereoisomerism is of enormous importance to all areas of organic chemistry and biochemistry to understand stereoisomerism of carbon
