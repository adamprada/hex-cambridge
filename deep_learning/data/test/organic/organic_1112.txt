reactive because they have a highlying pair of πbonding electrons these electrons are loosely held being high in energy compared to σbonds the fact that they are not located between the carbon nuclei but are found above and below the plane of the double bond also makes these electrons more accessible alkenes can donate their electrons to strong electrophiles other than protons too sometimes their reactivity pattern is a little different than the simple addition across the double bond but that straightforward pattern is what we will focus on in this chapter elimination reactions elimination reactions are possible by abstraction
