of a photochemical reaction the simplest example is shown below for methane reacting with chlorine in the presence of light to form chloromethane and hydrogen chloride gas free radical halogenation of alkanes has been thoroughly explained in chapter the structure of the alkane is evaluated to choose between the high reactivity of chlorine cl and the high selectivity of bromine br allylic bromination when halogens are in the presence of unsaturated molecules such as alkenes the expected reaction is addition to the double bond carbons resulting in a vicinal dihalide halogens on adjacent carbons the reaction is studied in a
