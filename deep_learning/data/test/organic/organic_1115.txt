is resonancestabilized hence given that the halogen concentration is low substitution at the allylic position is favored over competing reactions however when the halogen concentration is high addition at the double bond is favored because a polar reaction out competes the radical chain reaction radical allylic bromination using nbs and light preparation of bromine low concentration nbs nbromosuccinimide is the most commonly used reagent to produce low concentrations of bromine when suspended in tetrachloride ccl nbs reacts with trace amounts of hbr to produce a low enough concentration of bromine to facilitate the allylic bromination reaction allylic bromination mechanism step
