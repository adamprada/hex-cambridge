allylic bromide product and regenerate the bromine radical which continues the radical chain mechanism if the alkene reactant is asymmetric two distinct product isomers are formed step termination the radical chain mechanism of allylic bromination can be terminated by any of the possible steps shown below radical allylic chlorination like bromination chlorination at the allylic position of an alkene is achieved when low concentrations of cl are present the reaction is run at high temperatures to achieve the desired results industrial uses allylic chlorination has important practical applications in industry since chlorine is inexpensive allylic chlorinations of alkenes have been
