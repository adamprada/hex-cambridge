write a reaction sequence to show how the double bond of an alkene can be transformed into a triple bond identify the vicinal dihalide or vinylic halide needed to synthesize a given alkyne by dehydrohalogenation key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below vicinal dihalide vinylic halide alkynes can be a useful functional group to synthesize due to some of their antibacterial antiparasitic and antifungal properties one simple method for alkyne synthesis is by double elimination from a dihaloalkane introduction one case in which elimination can occur is when a haloalkane is
