pulled off the molecule this is unimportant to the synthesis of alkynes for more information on this see the page on preparation of alkenes from haloalkanes preparation of alkynes from alkenes lastly we will briefly look at how to prepare alkynes from alkenes this is a simple process using first halogenation of the alkene bond to form the dihaloalkane and next using the double elimination process to protonate the alkane and from the bonds this first process is gone over in much greater detail in the page on halogenation of an alkene in general chlorine or bromine is used with
