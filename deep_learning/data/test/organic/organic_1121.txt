then produces pentyne if the very strong base sodium amide is used the terminal alkyne is trapped as its sodium salt from which it may be released by mild acid treatment nb one cannot stop the reaction at the terminal alkyne with equivalents of strong base however if the weaker base koh with heat is used for the elimination the terminal alkyne salt is not formed or is formed reversibly and the initially generated pentyne rearranges to the more stable pentyne via an allene intermediate questions question why would we need bases for every terminal dihaloalkane instead of in order
