with a central nucleus and surrounding electrons the nucleus is itself composed of two kinds of particles protons are the carriers of positive electric charge in the nucleus the proton charge is exactly the same as the electron charge but of opposite sign this means that in any electrically neutral atom the number of protons in the nucleus often referred to as the nuclear charge is balanced by the same number of electrons outside the nucleus the other nuclear particle is the neutron as its name implies this particle carries no electrical charge its mass is almost the same as
