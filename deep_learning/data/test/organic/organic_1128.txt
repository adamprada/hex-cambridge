number of an isotope of any element can be uniquely represented as where x is the atomic symbol of the element the isotope of carbon that has neutrons is therefore the subscript indicating the atomic number is actually redundant because the atomic symbol already uniquely specifies z consequently is more often written as c which is read as carbon nevertheless the value of z is commonly included in the notation for nuclear reactions because these reactions involve changes in z figure formalism used for identifying specific nuclide any particular kind of nucleus in addition to a typical sample of carbon
