to as a prochiral center the actual example shown below is the reduced form of a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh an important participant in many biochemical oxidationreduction reactions section a note that if in a thought experiment we changed either one of the indicated hydrogens on nadh to a deuterium the h isotope of hydrogen the carbon would become a chiral center prochirality is an important concept in biological chemistry because enzymes can distinguish between the two identical groups bound to a prochiral carbon center due to the fact that they occupy different regions in threedimensional space for
