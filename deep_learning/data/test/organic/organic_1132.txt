to a deuterium the molecule would now be chiral and the stereocenter would have the s configuration d has a higher priority than h for this reason we can refer to hb as the pros hydrogen of ethanol and label it hs conversely if we change ha to d and leave hb as a hydrogen the configuration of the molecule becomes r so we can refer to ha as the pror hydrogen of ethanol and label it hr looking back at our fatty acid example we see that it is specifically the pror hydrogens on carbons and that are lost
