about the analytical technique called nuclear magnetic resonance two hydrogens on the same carbon of a substituted ring structure can be diastereotopic we determine this by carrying out the same thought experiment as discussed above in the example below the diastereotopic hydrogens indicated are either on the same side or on the opposite side of the ring relative to the hydroxyl group finally hydrogens that are completely identical and can be designated neither enantiotopic nor diastereotopic are called homotopic if a homotopic hydrogen is replaced by deuterium a chiral center is not created the three hydrogen atoms on the methyl
