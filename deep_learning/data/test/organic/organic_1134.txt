now has the r configuration citrate provides a more complex example the central carbon is a prochiral center with two arms that are identical except that one can be designated pror and the other pros in a reaction of the citric acid cycle krebs cycle a water molecule is specifically lost on the pror arm we will study this reaction in section b notice also that it is specifically the pror hydrogen on the pror arm of citrate that is lost one more layer of stereoselectivity example leucine assign pror andpros designations to all prochiral groups in the amino acid
