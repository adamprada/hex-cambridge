bonded to three different substitutuents as you might expect we and the enzymes that catalyze their reactions can distinguish between the two planar faces of a prochiral sp hybridized group these faces are designated by the terms re and si to determine which is the re and which is the si face of a planar organic group we simply use the same priority rankings that we are familiar with from the rs system and trace a circle re is clockwise and si is counterclockwise below for example we are looking down on the re face of the ketone group in
