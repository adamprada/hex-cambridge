size for isomers the more branched the chain the lower the boiling point tends to be van der waals dispersion forces are smaller for shorter molecules and only operate over very short distances between one molecule and its neighbors it is more difficult for short fat molecules with lots of branching to lie as close together as long thin molecules the boiling points shown are for the straight chain isomers of which there is more than one the first four alkanes are gases at room temperature and solids do not begin to appear until about but this is imprecise because
