that branching decreases the surfaces area weakens the imfs and lowers the boiling point example boiling points of alkanes for example the boiling points of the three isomers of are pentane k methylbutane k dimethylpropane k the slightly higher boiling points for the cycloalkanes are presumably because the molecules can get closer together because the ring structure makes them better able exercise for each of the following pairs of compounds select the substance which you expect to have the higher boiling point octane and nonane octane and tetramethylbutane solution a nonane since it has more atoms it will have greater
