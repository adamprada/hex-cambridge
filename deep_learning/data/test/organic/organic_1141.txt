the following pairs of compounds select the substance you expect to have the higher boiling point octane and nonane octane and tetramethylbutane answer nonane will have a higher boiling point than octane because it has a longer carbon chain than octane octane will have a higher boiling point than tetramethylbutane because it branches less than tetramethylbutane and therefore has a larger surface area and more van der waals forces note the actual boiling points are nonane c octane c tetramethylbutane c reactions of alkanes alkanes undergo very few reactions there are two important reactions that are still possible combustion and
