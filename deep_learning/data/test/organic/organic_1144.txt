attributions objectives after completing this section you should be able to describe a common process for separating a mixture of enantiomers explain why racemic mixtures do not rotate planepolarized light key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below racemic mixture or racemate resolve study notes a racemic mixture is a mixture of two enantiomers because they are mirror images each enantiomer rotates planepolarized light in an equal but opposite direction and is optically inactive if the enantiomers are separated the mixture is said to have been resolved a common experiment in the
