generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called resolution since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution is extremely difficult diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated for example if a racemic mixture of a chiral alcohol is reacted with a enantiomerically pure carboxylic acid the result is a mixture of diastereomers in this
