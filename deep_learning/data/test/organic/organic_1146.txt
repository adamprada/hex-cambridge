resolution since enantiomers have identical physical properties such as solubility and melting point resolution is extremely difficult diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated reversing the first reaction then leads to the separated enantiomers plus the recovered reagent figure many kinds of chemical and physical reactions including salt formation may be used to achieve the diastereomeric intermediates needed for separation figure illustrates this general principle by showing how a
