crystallization or distillation it is only under the influence of another chiral substance that enantiomers behave differently and almost all methods of resolution of enantiomers are based upon this fact we include here a discussion of the primary methods of resolution chiral amines as resolving agents and resolution of racemic acids the most commonly used procedure for separating enantiomers is to convert them to a mixture of diastereomers that will have different physical properties melting point boiling point solubility and so on section for example if you have a racemic or dl mixture of enantiomers of an acid and convert
