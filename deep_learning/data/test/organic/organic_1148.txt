adequate supplies of suitable chiral bases brucine strychnine and quinine frequently are used for this purpose because they are readily available naturally occurring chiral bases simpler amines of synthetic origin such as amino butanol amphetamine and phenylethanamine also can be used but first they must be resolved themselves resolution of racemic bases chiral acids such as tartaric acid malic acid mandelic acid and camphor sulfonic acid are used for the resolution of a racemic base the principle is the same as for the resolution of a racemic acid with a chiral base and the choice of acid will depend both
