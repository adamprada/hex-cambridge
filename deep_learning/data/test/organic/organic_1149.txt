the optical rotation of this enantiomer will be a maximum value if it is optically pure because any amount of the other enantiomer could only reduce the magnitude of the measured rotation resolution of racemic alcohols to resolve a racemic alcohol a chiral acid can be used to convert the alcohol to a mixture of diastereomeric esters this is not as generally useful as might be thought because esters tend to be liquids unless they are very highmolecularweight compounds if the diastereomeric esters are not crystalline they must be separated by some other method than fractional crystallization for instance by
