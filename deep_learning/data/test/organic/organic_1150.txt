in one operation without destroying either of the enantiomers we have not achieved that ideal yet but it may not be far in the future chromatographic methods section whereby the stationary phase is a chiral reagent that adsorbs one enantiomer more strongly than the other have been used to resolve racemic compounds but such resolutions seldom have led to both pure enantiomers on a preparative scale other methods called kinetic resolutions are excellent when applicable the procedure takes advantage of differences in reaction rates of enantiomers with chiral reagents one enantiomer may react more rapidly thereby leaving an excess of
