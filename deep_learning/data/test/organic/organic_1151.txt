of individual crystals of each enantiomer thus if the crystallization of sodium ammonium tartrate is carried out below the usual racemate salt does not form a mixture of crystals of the and salts forms instead the two different kinds of crystals which are related as an object to its mirror image can be separated manually with the aid of a microscope and subsequently may be converted to the tartaric acid enantiomers by strong acid a variation on this method of resolution is the seeding of a saturated solution of a racemic mixture with crystals of one pure enantiomer in the
