pibond in the monomer is converted to a sigmabond in the polymer the polymerization reaction is usually exothermic by to kcalmol indeed cases of explosively uncontrolled polymerizations have been reported it is useful to distinguish four polymerization procedures fitting this general description radical polymerization the initiator is a radical and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbon radical cationic polymerization the initiator is an acid and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbocation anionic polymerization the initiator is a nucleophile and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbanion coordination catalytic polymerization the initiator is a transition metal
