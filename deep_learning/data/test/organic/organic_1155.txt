by using small amounts of initiators a wide variety of monomers can be polymerized one example of this radical polymerization is the conversion of styrene to polystyrene shown in the following diagram the first two equations illustrate the initiation process and the last two equations are examples of chain propagation each monomer unit adds to the growing chain in a manner that generates the most stable radical since carbon radicals are stabilized by substituents of many kinds the preference for headtotail regioselectivity in most addition polymerizations is understandable because radicals are tolerant of many functional groups and solvents including water
