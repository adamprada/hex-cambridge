to stable products since the concentration of radical species in a polymerization reaction is small relative to other reactants eg monomers solvents and terminated chains the rate at which these radicalradical termination reactions occurs is very small and most growing chains achieve moderate length before termination the relative importance of these terminations varies with the nature of the monomer undergoing polymerization for acrylonitrile and styrene combination is the major process however methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate are terminated chiefly by disproportionation another reaction that diverts radical chaingrowth polymerizations from producing linear macromolecules is called chain transfer as the name implies
