the initiator is a radical and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbon radical cationic polymerization the initiator is an acid and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbocation anionic polymerization the initiator is a nucleophile and the propagating site of reactivity is a carbanion coordination catalytic polymerization the initiator is a transition metal complex and the propagating site of reactivity is a terminal catalytic complex radical chaingrowth polymerization virtually all of the monomers described above are subject to radical polymerization since this can be initiated by traces of oxygen or other minor impurities pure samples of these
