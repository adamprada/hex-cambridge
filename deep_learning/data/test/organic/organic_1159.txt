equations are examples of chain propagation each monomer unit adds to the growing chain in a manner that generates the most stable radical since carbon radicals are stabilized by substituents of many kinds the preference for headtotail regioselectivity in most addition polymerizations is understandable because radicals are tolerant of many functional groups and solvents including water radical polymerizations are widely used in the chemical industry in principle once started a radical polymerization might be expected to continue unchecked producing a few extremely long chain polymers in practice larger numbers of moderately sized chains are formed indicating that chainterminating reactions must
