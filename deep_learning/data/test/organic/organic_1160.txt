before termination the relative importance of these terminations varies with the nature of the monomer undergoing polymerization for acrylonitrile and styrene combination is the major process however methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate are terminated chiefly by disproportionation another reaction that diverts radical chaingrowth polymerizations from producing linear macromolecules is called chain transfer as the name implies this reaction moves a carbon radical from one location to another by an intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer colored green these possibilities are demonstrated by the following equations chain transfer reactions are especially prevalent in the high pressure radical polymerization of ethylene which
