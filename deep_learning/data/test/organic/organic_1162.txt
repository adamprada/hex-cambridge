longer be propagated while radical halogenation of very simple alkanes can be an effective synthetic strategy it cannot be employed for larger more complex alkanes to yield specific alkyl halides since the reactive nature of radicals always leads to mixtures of single and multiplehalogenated products the three phases of radical chain reactions because of their high reactivity free radicals have the potential to be both extremely powerful chemical tools and extremely harmful contaminants much of the power of free radical species stems from the natural tendency of radical processes to occur in a chain reaction fashion radical chain reactions have
