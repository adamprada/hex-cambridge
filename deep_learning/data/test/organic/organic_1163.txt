the propagation phase describes the chain part of chain reactions once a reactive free radical is generated it can react with stable molecules to form new free radicals these new free radicals go on to generate yet more free radicals and so on propagation steps often involve hydrogen abstraction or addition of the radical to double bonds chain termination occurs when two free radical species react with each other to form a stable nonradical adduct although this is a very thermodynamically downhill event it is also very rare due to the low concentration of radical species and the small likelihood
