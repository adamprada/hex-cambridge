of infrared and raman spectra when a bond is electrically symmetrical it does not absorb infrared radiation and for this reason symmetrical diatomic molecules such as and which are always electrically symmetrical do not give infrared absorption spectra however excitation of symmetrical vibrations does occur in raman scattering in a molecule such as ethene the doublebond stretching vibration is symmetrical because both ends of the molecule are the same as a result the doublebond stretching absorption is not observable in the infrared spectrum of ethene and is weak in all nearly symmetrically substituted ethenes nonetheless this vibration appears strongly in
