an energy diagram the vertical axis represents the overall energy of the reactants while the horizontal axis is the reaction coordinate tracing from left to right the progress of the reaction from starting compounds to final products the energy diagram for a typical onestep reaction might look like this despite its apparent simplicity this energy diagram conveys some very important ideas about the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction recall that when we talk about the thermodynamics of a reaction we are concerned with the difference in energy between reactants and products and whether a reaction is downhill exergonic energy
