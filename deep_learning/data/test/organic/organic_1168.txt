δhrnx the change in enthalpy heat and δsrnx the change in entropy disorder where t is the absolute temperature in kelvin for chemical processes where the entropy change is small the enthalpy change is essentially the same as the change in gibbs free energy energy diagrams for these processes will often plot the enthalpy h instead of free energy for simplicity the standard gibbs free energy change for a reaction can be related to the reactions equilibrium constant keq by a simple equation where keq product reactant at equilibrium r jkmol or cal kmol t temperature in kelvin k if
