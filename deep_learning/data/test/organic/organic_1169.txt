the height of this energy barrier you may recall is called the activation energy Î´g you may have been taught to use the term activated complex rather than transition state as the two are often used interchangeably similarly the activation energy of a reaction is often represented by the symbol eact or ea the activation energy is what determines the kinetics of a reaction the higher the energy hill the slower the reaction at the very top of the energy barrier the reaction is at its transition state ts which is the point at which the bonds are in the
