two molecules for this reason we say that it has second order kinetics the rate expression for this type of reaction is rate kreactant reactant which tells us that the rate of the reaction depends on the rate constant k as well as on the concentration of both reactants the rate constant can be determined experimentally by measuring the rate of the reaction with different starting reactant concentrations the rate constant depends on the activation energy of course but also on temperature a higher temperature means a higher k and a faster reaction all else being equal this should make
