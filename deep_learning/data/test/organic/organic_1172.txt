example butane combustion with butane ch you can again balance the carbons and hydrogens as you write the equation down counting the oxygens leads to a slight problem with on the righthand side the simple trick is to allow yourself to have sixandahalf o molecules on the left if that offends you double everything the hydrocarbons become harder to ignite as the molecules get bigger this is because the bigger molecules dont vaporize so easily the reaction is much better if the oxygen and the hydrocarbon are well mixed as gases if the liquid is not very volatile only those
