atoms in the methane are replaced one at a time by chlorine atoms you end up with a mixture of chloromethane dichloromethane trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane the original mixture of a colorless and a green gas would produce steamy fumes of hydrogen chloride and a mist of organic liquids all of the organic products are liquid at room temperature with the exception of the chloromethane which is a gas if you were using bromine you could either mix methane with bromine vapor or bubble the methane through liquid bromine in either case exposed to uv light the original mixture of gases
