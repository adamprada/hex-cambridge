substitution and elimination alkyl halides can undergo two major types of reactions substitution andor elimination the substitution reaction is called a nucleophilic substitution reaction because the electrophilic alkyl halide forms a new bond with the nucleophile which substitutes for replaces the halogen at the alphacarbon because carbon can only form four bonds the halogen must leave and is called the leaving group alkyl halides are excellent electrophiles because halogens share a polar bond with carbon are polarizable and form relatively stable leaving groups as halide anions in the example below bromopropane is converted into propanol in a substitution reaction allkyl
