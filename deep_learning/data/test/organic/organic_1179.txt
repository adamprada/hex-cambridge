some elimination the product distribution depends on a number of factors these factors will be explored in the remaining sections of this chapter depending on the structure of the alkyl halide reagent type reaction conditions some reactions will only undergo only one pathway substitution or elimination while other alkyl halides will always produce a mixture of substitution and elimination products like the example above the goal of efficient multiplestep synthetic pathways is to maximize the formation of a single product during each step the reaction conditions explored in this chapter will be useful for future reactions we will study and
