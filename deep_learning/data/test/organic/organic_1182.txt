of these additions are themselves substituted alkenes and can therefore undergo further addition because of their high electronegativity halogen substituents on a double bond act to reduce its nucleophilicity and thereby decrease the rate of electrophilic addition reactions consequently there is a delicate balance as to whether the product of an initial addition to an alkyne will suffer further addition to a saturated product although the initial alkene products can often be isolated and identified they are commonly present in mixtures of products and may not be obtained in high yield the following reactions illustrate many of these features in
