sluggish than the corresponding reactions of alkenes after all addition reactions to alkynes are generally more exothermic than additions to alkenes and there would seem to be a higher πelectron density about the triple bond two πbonds versus one two factors are significant in explaining this apparent paradox first although there are more πelectrons associated with the triple bond the sphybridized carbons exert a strong attraction for these πelectrons which are consequently bound more tightly to the functional group than are the πelectrons of a double bond this is seen in the ionization potentials of ethylene and acetylene acetylene hcch
