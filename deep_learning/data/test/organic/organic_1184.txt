an alkene or alkyne is the formation of a picomplex in which the electrophile accepts electrons from and becomes weakly bonded to the multiple bond the relatively slower reactions of alkynes becomes understandable a second factor is presumed to be the stability of the carbocation intermediate generated by sigmabonding of a proton or other electrophile to one of the triple bond carbon atoms this intermediate has its positive charge localized on an unsaturated carbon and such vinyl cations are less stable than their saturated analogs indeed we can modify our earlier ordering of carbocation stability to include these vinyl cations
