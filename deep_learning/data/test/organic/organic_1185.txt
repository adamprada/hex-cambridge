to alkynes have emerged as exceptionally useful synthetic transforms addition of hydrogen halide to an alkyne summary reactivity order of hydrogen halides hi hb r hcl hf follows markovnikovs rule hydrogen adds to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogens the halogen adds to the carbon with fewest hydrogens protination occurs on the more stable carbocation with the addition of hx haloalkenes form with the addition of excess hx you get anti addition forming a geminal dihaloalkane addition of a hx to an internal alkyne as described in figure the electrons will attack the hydrogen of the hbr and
