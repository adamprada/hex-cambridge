was added to the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents the bromine which has a negative charge attacks the positively charged carbocation forming the final product with the nucleophile on the more substituted carbon addition due to excess hbr present most hydrogen halide reactions with alkynes occur in a markovnikovmanner in which the halide attaches to the most substituted carbon since it is the most positively polarized a more substituted carbon has more bonds attached to carbons or electrondonating groups such as fluorine and other halides however there are two specific reactions among alkynes where antimarkovnikov reactions take place the
