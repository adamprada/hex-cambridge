factors the inductive effect electronegative atoms adjacent to the charge will stabilize the charge hybridization of the chargebearing atom the greater the scharacter of the chargebearing atom the more stable the anion the extent of conjugation of the anion resonance effects can stabilize the anion this is especially true when the anion is stabilized as a result of aromaticity a carbanion is a reactive intermediate and is encountered in organic chemistry for instance in the ecb elimination reaction and in organometallic chemistry in for instance a grignard reaction or in alkyl lithium chemistry stable carbanions do however exist in olmstead
