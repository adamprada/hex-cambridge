whereas the cyclopentadienyl anion has a single resonance at ppm carbon acids any molecule containing a ch can lose a proton forming the carbanion hence any hydrocarbon containing ch bonds can be considered an acid with a corresponding pka value methane is certainly not an acid in its classical meaning yet its estimated pka is compare this to acetic acid with pka the same factors that determine the stability of the carbanion also determine the order in pka in carbon acids these values are determined for the compounds either in water in order to compare them to ordinary acids indimethyl
