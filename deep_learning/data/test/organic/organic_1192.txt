cho meldrums acid cho acetic acid chcooh barbituric acid chonh trinitromethane hcno fulminic acid hcno carborane superacid hchbcl note that the anions formed by ionization of acetic acid ethanol or aniline are not carbanions starting from methane in table the acidity increases when the anion is aromatic either because the added electron causes the anion to become aromatic as in indene and cyclopentadiene or because the negative charge on carbon can be delocalized over several alreadyaromatic rings as in triphenylmethane or the carborane superacid when the carbanion is surrounded by strongly electronegative groups through the partial neutralisation of the negative
