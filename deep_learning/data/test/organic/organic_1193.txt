carbanions can display chirality because if the activation barrier for inversion of this geometry is too low any attempt at introducing chirality will end inracemization similar to the nitrogen inversion however solid evidence exists that carbanions can indeed be chiral for example in research carried out with certain organolithium compounds the first ever evidence for the existence of chiral organolithium compounds was obtained in reaction of chiral iodooctane with secbutyllithium in petroleum ether at c followed by reaction with dry ice yielded mostly racemic methylbutyric acid but also an amount of optically active methyloctanoic acid which could only have formed
