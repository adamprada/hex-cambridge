chiral group with a hydrogen and a deuterium substituent the stannyl group is replaced by lithium to intermediate which undergoes a phosphatephosphorane rearrangement to phosphorane which on reaction with acetic acid givesalcohol once again in the range of c to c the chirality is preserved in this reaction sequence history a carbanionic structure first made an appearance in the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation as correctly proposed by clarke and lapworth in in schlenk prepared phcnme in a quest for pentavalent nitrogen fromtetramethylammonium chloride and phcna and in he demonstrated how triarylmethyl radicals could be reduced to carbonions by
