general reaction the calculated value is negative and very large for fluorine negative and moderate for chlorine and bromine and positive for iodine see table with fluorine the reaction evolves so much heat that it may be difficult to control and products from cleavage of carboncarbon as well as of carbonhydrogen bonds may be obtained the only successful direct fluorination procedure for hydrocarbons involves diffusion of minute amounts of fluorine mixed with helium into liquid or solid hydrocarbons at low temperatures typically dry ice temperature as fluorination proceeds the concentration of fluorine can be increased the process is best suited
