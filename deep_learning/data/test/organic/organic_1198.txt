chloromethane methyl chloride it is usual when chlorinating methane to obtain some of the higher chlorination products dichloromethane methylene chloride trichloromethane chloroform and tetrachloromethane carbon tetrachloride in practice one can control the degree of substitution to a considerable extent by controlling the methanechlorine ratio for example for monochlorination to predominate a high methanechlorine ratio is necessary such that the chlorine atoms react with and not with selectivity in alkane halogenation for propane and higher hydrocarbons for which more than one monosubstitution product is generally possible difficult separation problems bay arise when a particular product is desired for example the chlorination
