tertiary bond of methylbutane should be the weakest of the bonds bromine atoms are far more selective than chlorine atoms this is not unexpected because is endothermic whereas corresponding reactions with a chlorine atoms usually are exothermic data from table bromine removes only those hydrogens that are relatively weakly bonded to a carbon atom as predicted attack of on methylbutane leads mostly to bromomethylbutane some secondary bromide and essentially no primary bromides when the structure of the alkane is symmetrical then the fast reactivity of chlorination can be used for efficiency when the structure of the alkane can produce a
