attributions learning objective predict carbocation rearrangements in st order reactions whenever reactants like alkyl halides form carbocations the carbocations are subject to a phenomenon known as carbocation rearrangement a carbocation is highly reactive and holds the positive charge on carbon with a sextet rather than an octet there are two types of rearrangements hydride shift and alkyl shift rearrangements occur to create more stable carbocations reviewing carbocation stability from chapter is helpful in identifying carbocations that can undergo rearrangement once rearranged the molecules can also undergo further unimolecular substitution sn or unimolecular elimination e nucleophilic reactions often produce two products
