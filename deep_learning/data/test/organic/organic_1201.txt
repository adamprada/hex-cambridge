have nothing to do with the nomenclature of the reactant we can see the phenomenon of hydride shift in solvolysis sn reactions like the example below as shown in the following mechanism the polarized carbonchlorine bonds is heterolytically broken to produce a chloride ion and carbocation the secondary carbocation undergoes a hydride shift to produce the more stable tertiary carbocation the oxygen of a water molecule acts as the nucleophile and reacts with the carbocation to form a protonated alcohol the intermediate is deprotonated to form the final product an alcohol the mechanism for hydride shift occurs in multiple steps
