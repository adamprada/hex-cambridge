pair with it to furnish a bond to the neighboring or adjacent carbocation the shifted alkyl group and the positive charge of the carbocation switch positions on the molecule exercise draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction answer alkyl halide classification and carbocation rearrangements reactions of tertiary carbocations react much faster than that of secondary carbocations and will form the major product almost exclusively alkyl shifts from a secondary carbocation to tertiary carbocation in sn reactions occur by independent steps when the alkyl halide is primary then slight variations and differences between the two reaction
