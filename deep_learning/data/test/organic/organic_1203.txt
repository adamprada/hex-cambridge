difficult processes since they require higher temperatures and longer reaction times after protonating the alcohol substrate to form the alkyloxonium ion the water must leave at the same time as the alkyl group shifts from the adjacent carbon to skip the formation of the unstable primary carbocation exercise draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction answer hydride and greater shifts typically hydride shifts can occur at low temperatures however by heating the solutionf of a cation it can easily and readily speed the process of rearrangement one way to account for a slight barrier is
