catalytic hydrogenation hydrogenation of a double bond is a thermodynamically favorable reaction because it forms a more stable lower energy product in other words the energy of the product is lower than the energy of the reactant thus it is exothermic heat is released the heat released is called the heat of hydrogenation which is an indicator of a molecules stability regioselectivity is not an issue because the same group a hydrogen atom is bonded to each of the vinyl carbons the simplest source of two hydrogen atoms is molecular hydrogen h but mixing alkenes with hydrogen does not result
