to recognizing oxidation and reduction reactions for inorganic chemistry however for organic chemistry most of the reactants and products are neutral so the electron flow is more difficult to track for organic compounds oxidation and reduction reactions can be recognized at least three different ways oxidation is an increase in the number of carbon to oxygen bonds or a decrease in the number of carbon to hydrogen bonds reduction is the opposite of oxidation so it is a decrease in the number of carbon to oxygen bonds or an increase in the number of carbon to hydrogen bonds for reactions
