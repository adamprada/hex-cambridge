catalysts commonly used in alkene hydrogenation are platinum palladium and nickel the metal catalyst acts as a surface on which the reaction takes place this increases the rate by putting the reactants in close proximity to each other facilitating interactions between them with this catalyst present the sigma bond of h breaks and the two hydrogen atoms instead bind to the metal see in the figure below the bond of the alkene weakens as it also interacts with the metal as shown in step of the diagram below since both the reactants are bound to the metal catalyst the hydrogen
