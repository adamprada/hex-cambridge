stability of alkenes having different numbers of alkyl substituents on the double bond for example the following table lists the heats of hydrogenation for three ch alkenes which give the same alkane product methylbutane since a large heat of reaction indicates a high energy reactant these heats are inversely proportional to the stabilities of the alkene isomers to a rough approximation we see that each alkyl substituent on a double bond stabilizes this functional group by a bit more than kcalmole alkene isomer chchchch methylbutene chcchchch methylbutene chcchch methylbutene heat of reaction δhº kcalmole kcalmole kcalmole stereochemistry of catalytic hydrogenation
