also not reduced under the conditions used to reduce alkenes although these rings appear to contain three carboncarbon double bonds as you will see later aromatic rings do not really contain any double bonds and many chemists prefer to represent the benzene ring as a hexagon with a circle inside it rather than as a hexagon with three alternating double bonds the representation of the benzene ring will be discussed further in section the reaction between carboncarbon double bonds and hydrogen provides a method of determining the number of double bonds present in a compound for example one mole of
