such an addition is the reductive removal of the double bond functional group regioselectivity is not an issue since the same group a hydrogen atom is bonded to each of the double bond carbons the simplest source of two hydrogen atoms is molecular hydrogen h but mixing alkenes with hydrogen does not result in any discernible reaction although the overall hydrogenation reaction is exothermic a high activation energy prevents it from taking place under normal conditions this restriction may be circumvented by the use of a catalyst as shown in the reaction coordinate diagram below an example of an alkene
