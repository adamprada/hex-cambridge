being consumed or appearing as part of the product catalysts act by lowering the activation energy of reactions but they do not change the relative potential energy of the reactants and products finely divided metals such as platinum palladium and nickel are among the most widely used hydrogenation catalysts catalytic hydrogenation takes place in at least two stages as depicted in the diagram first the alkene must be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst along with some of the hydrogen next two hydrogens shift from the metal surface to the carbons of the double bond and the resulting saturated
