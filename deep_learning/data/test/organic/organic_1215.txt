energy reactant these heats are inversely proportional to the stabilities of the alkene isomers to a rough approximation we see that each alkyl substituent on a double bond stabilizes this functional group by a bit more than kcalmole alkene isomer chchchch methylbutene chcchchch methylbutene chcchch methylbutene heat of reaction δhº kcalmole kcalmole kcalmole from the mechanism shown here we would expect the addition of hydrogen to occur with synstereoselectivity this is often true but the hydrogenation catalysts may also cause isomerization of the double bond prior to hydrogen addition in which case stereoselectivity may be uncertain exercise in the reaction
