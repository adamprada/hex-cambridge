undergo additions because of their availability of two Ï€ bonds hydrogenation of alkynes alkynes can be fully hydrogenated into alkanes with the help of a platinum catalyst however the use of two other catalysts can be used to hydrogenate alkynes to alkanes these catalysts are palladium dispersed on carbon pdc and finely dispersed nickel raneyni hydrogenation of an alkyne to a zalkene cisalkene because hydrogenation is an interruptible process involving a series of steps hydrogenation can be stopped using modified catalysts eg lindlars catalyst at the transitional alkene stage lindars catalyst has three components palladiumcalcium carbonate lead acetate and quinoline
