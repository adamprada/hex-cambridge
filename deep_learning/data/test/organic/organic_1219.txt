than alkanes the standard bond energies for carboncarbon bonds confirm this conclusion thus a double bond is stronger than a single bond but not twice as strong the difference kcalmole may be regarded as the strength of the πbond component similarly a triple bond is stronger than a double bond but not stronger here the difference kcalmole may be taken as the strength of the second πbond the kcalmole weakening of this second πbond is reflected in the heat of hydrogenation numbers since alkynes are thermodynamically less stable than alkenes we might expect addition reactions of the former to be
