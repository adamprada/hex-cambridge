reduced to transalkenes with the use of sodium dissolved in an ammonia solvent an na radical donates an electron to one of the p bonds in a carboncarbon triple bond this forms an anion which can be protonated by a hydrogen in an ammonia solvent this prompts another na radical to donate an electron to the second p orbital soon after this anion is also protonated by a hydrogen from the ammonia solvent resulting in a transalkene rccr na in nh liq trans rchchr nanh mechanism exercises questions q usng any alkyne how would you prepare the following compounds pentane
