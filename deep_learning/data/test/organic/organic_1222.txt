and newman conventions there is little to choose between the two conventions for simple ethane derivatives but the sawhorse convention is strongly favored for representing the conformations of ring compounds such as cyclohexane the resemblance between the gauche forms of butane and the most stable conformation of cyclohexane is strikingly apparent in the sawhorse representations of both as shown in figure notice that the ring carbons of cyclohexane do not lie in one plane and that all the bond angles are tetrahedral the conformations of this interesting and important molecule are discussed in detail in chapter figure sawhorse and newman
