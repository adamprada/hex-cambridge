better to learn to draw molecules in as nearly correct perspective as possible once the sawhorse representation of cyclohexane is mastered it is almost as easy to drawn as and is much more informative about the shape of the molecule we have indicated how the enantiomers of butanol differ by drawing their strutures and section d in perspective to show the tetrahedral configuration of substituents at the chiral carbon this configuration also can be represented by the sawhorse or newman formulas using any one of the several possible staggered conformations such as and or and these drawings are clear but
