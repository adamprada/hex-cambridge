and ions key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below resonance form delocalization resonance delocalization sometimes even when formal charges are considered the bonding in some molecules or ions cannot be described by a single lewis structure resonance is a way of describing delocalized electrons within certain molecules or polyatomic ions where the bonding cannot be expressed by a single lewis formula a molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures also called resonance contributors or canonical forms resonance contributors involve the imaginary movement of pibonded electrons
