neither one by itself is an accurate picture of the delocalized pi bonds the two alternative drawings however when considered together give a much more accurate picture than either one on its own this is because they imply together that the carboncarbon bonds are not double bonds not single bonds but about halfway in between when it is possible to draw more than one valid structure for a compound or ion we have identified resonance contributors two or more different lewis structures depicting the same molecule or ion that when considered together do a better job of approximating delocalized pibonding
