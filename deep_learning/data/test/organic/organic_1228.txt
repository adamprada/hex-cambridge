a negative formal charge located on the singlebonded oxygen however the two carbonoxygen bonds in formate are actually the same length pm which implies that neither resonance contributor is correct although there is an overall negative formal charge on the formate ion it is shared equally between the two oxygens therefore the formate ion can be more accurately depicted by a pair of resonance contributors alternatively a single structure can be used with a dashed line depicting the resonancedelocalized pi bond and the negative charge located in between the two oxygens the electrostatic potential map of formate shows that there
