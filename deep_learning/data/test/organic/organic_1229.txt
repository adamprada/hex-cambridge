these three pz orbitals are parallel to each other and can overlap in a sidebyside fashion to form a delocalized pi bond overall the situation is one of three parallel overlapping pz orbitals sharing four delocalized pi electrons because there is one more electron than there are pz orbitals the system has an overall charge of resonance contributors are used to approximate overlapping pz orbitals and delocalized pi electrons molecules with resonance are usually drawn showing only one resonance contributor for the sake of simplicity however identifying molecules with resonance is an important skill in organic chemistry this example shows
