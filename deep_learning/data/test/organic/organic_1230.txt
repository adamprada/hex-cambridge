gives the oxygen a p orbital allowing it to participate in conjugation as a general rule sp hybridized atoms with lone pair electrons tend to become sp hybridized when adjacent to a conjugated system example carbonate co like formate the electronic structure of the carbonate ion cannot be described by a single lewis electron structure unlike o though the lewis structures describing co has three equivalent representations because carbon is the least electronegative element we place it in the central position carbon has valence electrons each oxygen has valence electrons and there are more for the charge this gives valence
