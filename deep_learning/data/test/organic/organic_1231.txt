carbonoxygen double bond and two carbonoxygen single bonds but experimentally all co bond lengths are identical we can write resonance structures in this case three of them for the carbonate ion as the case for formate the actual structure involves the formation of a molecular orbital from pz orbitals centered on each atom and sitting above and below the plane of the co ion example benzene is a common organic solvent that was previously used in gasoline it is no longer used for this purpose however because it is now known to be a carcinogen the benzene molecule ch consists
