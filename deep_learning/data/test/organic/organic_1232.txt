valence electron and each carbon atom contributes valence electrons for a total of valence electrons if we place a single bonding electron pair between each pair of carbon atoms and between each carbon and a hydrogen atom we obtain the following each carbon atom in this structure has only electrons and has a formal charge of but we have used only of the valence electrons b if the remaining electrons are uniformly distributed pairwise on alternate carbon atoms we obtain the following three carbon atoms now have an octet configuration and a formal charge of while three carbon atoms have
