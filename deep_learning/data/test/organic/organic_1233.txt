actual electronic structure is an average of the two the existence of multiple resonance structures for aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene is often indicated by drawing either a circle or dashed lines inside the hexagon this combination of p orbitals for benzene can be visualized as a ring with a node in the plane of the carbon atoms as can be seen in an electrostatic potential map of benzene the electrons are distributed symmetrically around the ring exercise the sodium salt of nitrite is used to relieve muscle spasms draw two resonance structures for the nitrite ion no answer exercises questions
