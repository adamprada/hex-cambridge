so one o atom is central each o atom has valence electrons for a total of valence electrons assigning one bonding pair of electrons to each oxygenoxygen bond gives with electrons left over if we place three lone pairs of electrons on each terminal oxygen we obtain and have electrons left over at this point both terminal oxygen atoms have octets of electrons we therefore place the last electrons on the central atom the central oxygen has only electrons we must convert one lone pair on a terminal oxygen atom to a bonding pair of electronsbut which one depending on
