various resonance structures of a compound but the position of the electrons is different doubleheaded arrows link the different resonance structures of a compound before the development of quantum chemistry it was thought that the doubleheaded arrow indicates that the actual electronic structure is an average of those shown or that the molecule oscillates between the two structures today we know that the electrons involved in the double bonds occupy an orbital that extends over all three oxygen molecules combining p orbitals on all three figure figure the resonance structure of ozone involves a molecular orbital extending all three oxygen
