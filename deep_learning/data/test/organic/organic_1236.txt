with resonance contributors recognizing drawing and evaluating the relative stability of resonance contributors is essential to understanding organic reaction mechanisms when learning to draw and interpret resonance structures there are a few basic guidelines to help there is only one real structure for each molecule or ion this real structure the resonance hybrid takes its character from the average of all the individual resonance contributors when looking at a resonance contributors we are seeing the exact same molecule or ion depicted in different ways resonance hybrids are really a single unchanging structure major resonance contributors of the formate ion representations
