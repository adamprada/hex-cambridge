do not have to be equivalent because of this resonance structures do necessarily contribute equally to the resonance hybrid the two resonance structures shown below are not equivalent because one show the negative charge on an oxygen while the other shows it on a carbon later we will show that the contributor with the negative charge on the oxygen is the more stable of the two also this means that the resonance hybrid will not be an exact mixture of the two structures all resonance contributors must be correct lewis structures each atom should have a complete valence shell and
