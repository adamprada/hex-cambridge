also the two structures have different net charges neutral vs positive resonance contributors only differ by the positions of pi bond and lone pair electrons sigma bonds are never broken or made because of this atoms must maintain their same position the molecules in the figure below are not resonance structures of the same molecule even though they have the same molecular formula cho these molecules are considered structural isomers because their difference involves the breaking of a sigma bond and moving a hydrogen atom major and minor resonance contributors as previously state the true structure of a resonance hybrid
