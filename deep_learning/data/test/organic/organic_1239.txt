the violated octet of a carbocation the relative stabilities of the two structures are so vastly different that molecules which contain a co bond are almost exclusively written in a form like structure i however as will learn in chapter the positively charged carbon created by structure ii will explain how the co bond will react with electron rich species rules for estimating stability of resonance structures the resonance structures in which all atoms have complete valence shells is more stable this means most atoms have a full octet in the example below structure i has a carbon atom with
