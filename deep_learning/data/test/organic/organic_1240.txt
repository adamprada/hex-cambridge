ii is the more stable and the major resonance contributor because it places the negative charge on the more electronegative oxygen the structures with a positive charges on the least electronegative atom most electropositive is more stable the structures with the least separation of formal charges is more stable the only difference between the two structures below are the relative positions of the positive and negative charges in structure i the charges are closer together making it more stable resonance forms that are equivalent have no difference in stability when looking at the two structures below no difference can be
