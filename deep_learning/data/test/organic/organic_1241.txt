to a and b how do we know that structure c is the minor contributor apply the rules below the carbon in contributor c does not have an octect in general resonance contributors in which a carbon does not fulfill the octet rule are relatively less important rule in structure c there are only three bonds compared to four in a and b in general a resonance structure with a lower number of total bonds is relatively less important rule structure c also has more formal charges than are present in a or b in general resonance contributors in which
