the resonance structures listed below structure i would be the most stable because all the nonhydrogen atoms have a full octet and the negative charge is on the more electronegative atom oxygen structure iii would be next in stability because all of the nonhydrogen atoms have full octets though now the negative charge is on carbon rather than oxygen structure ii would be the least stable of the three because it has the carbocation does not have an octet of the three structure i would be the major resonance structure and would most resemble the structure of the true resonance
