pair on the oxygen can be moved to the adjacent bond to the left and the electrons in the double bond shifted over to the left see the rules for drawing resonance contributors to convince yourself that these are legal moves the resulting resonance contributor in which the oxygen bears the formal charge is the major one because all atoms have a complete octet and there is one additional bond drawn resonance rules and both apply this system can be thought of as four parallel p orbitals one each on c c and c plus one on oxygen sharing four
