major contributor draw three resonance contributors of methyl acetate an ester with the structure chcooch and order them according to their relative importance to the bonding picture of the molecule explain your reasoning below is a minor resonance contributor of a species known as an enamine which we will study more in section formation of enamines section reactions of enamines draw the major resonance contributor for the enamine and explain why your contributor is the major one draw the major resonance contributor for each of the anions below solutions structure i would be the most stable because all the nonhydrogen
