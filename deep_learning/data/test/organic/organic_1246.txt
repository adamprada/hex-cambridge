illustrates one way to recognize resonance when it is possible to draw two or more equivalent lewis structures if we were to draw the structure of an aromatic molecule such as dimethylbenzene there are two ways that we could draw the double bonds which way is correct there are two simple answers to this question both and neither one both ways of drawing the molecule are equally acceptable approximations of the bonding picture for the molecule but neither one by itself is an accurate picture of the delocalized pi bonds the two alternative drawings however when considered together give a
