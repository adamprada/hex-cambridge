is implied however sometimes benzene will be drawn with a circle inside the hexagon either solid or dashed as a way of drawing a resonance hybrid the above resonance structures show that the electrons are delocalized within the molecule and through this process the molecule gains extra stability ozone with both of its opposite formal charges creates a neutral molecule and through resonance it is a stable molecule the extra electron that created the negative charge one terminal oxygen can be delocalized by resonance through the other terminal oxygen benzene is an extremely stable molecule due to its geometry and
