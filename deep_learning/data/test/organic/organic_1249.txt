at the above rules for estimating the stability of a molecule we see that for the third molecule the first and second forms are the major contributors for the overall stability of the molecule the nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon so it can handle the negative charge more than carbon a carbon with a negative charge is the least favorable conformation for the molecule to exist so the last resonance form contributes very little for the stability of the ion the hybrid resonance forms show the different lewis structures with the electron been delocalized this is very important for
