unambiguously assigning the handedness of molecules was originated by three chemists rs cahn c ingold and v prelog and as such is also often called the cahningoldprelog rules in addition to the cahningold system there are two ways of experimentally determining the absolute configuration of an enantiomer xray diffraction analysis note that there is no correlation between the sign of rotation and the structure of a particular enantiomer chemical correlation with a molecule whose structure has already been determined via xray diffraction however for nonlaboratory purposes it is beneficial to focus on the rs system the sign of optical rotation
