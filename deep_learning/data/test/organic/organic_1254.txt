substituent at the connectivity of the stereocenter both have a carbon atom which are equal in rank going down the chains a methyl has only has hydrogen atoms attached to it whereas the ethyl has another carbon atom the carbon atom on the ethyl is the first point of difference and has a higher atomic number than hydrogen therefore the ethyl takes priority over the methyl rule if a chain is connected to the same kind of atom twice or three times check to see if the atom it is connected to has a greater atomic number than any of
