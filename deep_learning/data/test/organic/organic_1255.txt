point of difference therefore methylethyl ranks higher in priority than ethyl as shown below however remember that being double or triple bonded to an atom means that the atom is connected to the same atom twice in such a case follow the same method as above caution keep in mind that priority is determined by the first point of difference along the two similar substituent chains after the first point of difference the rest of the chain is irrelevant when looking for the first point of difference on similar substituent chains one may encounter branching if there is branching choose
