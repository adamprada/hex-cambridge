br and i by the cip priority rules i is higher priority than br higher atomic number now look at c the atoms are cl and f with cl being higher priority we see that the higher priority group is down at c and down at c since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together therefore this is the z isomer similarly the right hand structure is e ez will work but may not agree with cistrans consider the molecule shown at the left this
