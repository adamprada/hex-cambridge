first conformer has one gauche interaction between the ch groups so the strain energy of this conformer is kcalmol the second conformer has four diaxial interaction between h and ch groups so its strain energy is x kcalmol therefore the energy difference in these two conformations is kcalmol a b c d e f in αdglucopyranose the hydroxyl group at c occupies an axial position in βdglucopyranose the hydroxyl group at c of occupies an equatorial position which is the more stable structure so the β forms predominates in equilibrium a b c d e f g h i j
