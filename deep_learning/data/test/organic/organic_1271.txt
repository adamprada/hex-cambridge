generally the larger and more complex that chiral reagent becomes the greater is its selectivity or power to discriminate between enantiomers and diastereomers as well the property of being able to discriminate between diastereomers is called stereospecificity and this is an especially important characteristic of biological systems for example our ability to taste and smell is regulated by chiral molecules in our mouths and noses that act as receptors to sense foreign substances we can anticipate then that enantiomers may interact differently with the receptor molecules and induce different sensations this appears to be the case the two enantiomers of
