in common experience derives from quantum mechanics the quantum mechanical effect explains why benzene is unusually stable how and why many reactions occur in special ways and probably most important of all the ways that organic compounds interact with electromagnetic radiation of all kinds from radio waves to x rays we shall try to give as clear explanations as possible of the quantum mechanical effects but some of it will just have to be accepted as fact that we cannot ourselves experience directly nor understand intuitively for example when a grindstone rotates so far as our experience goes it can
