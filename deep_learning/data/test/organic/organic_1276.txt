useful information about what might be called the potential for any process to occur be it production of electricity from a battery water running uphill photosynthesis or formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion of gasoline in the past most organic chemists seldom tried to apply thermodynamics to the reactions in which they were interested much of this was due to the paucity of thermodynamic data for more than a few organic compounds but some was because organic chemists often liked to think of themselves as artistic types with little use for quantitative data on their reactions which may have meant
