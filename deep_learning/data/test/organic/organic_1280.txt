simplest molecule which contains a carbon carbon double bond the lewis structure of ethylene indicates that there are one carboncarbon double bond and four carbonhydrogen single bonds experimentally the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the ethylene molecule have been shown to be identical because each carbon is surrounded by three electron groups vsepr theory says the molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry although each carbon has fulfilled its tetravalent requirement one bond appears different clearly a different type of orbital overlap is involved the sigma bonds formed in ethene is by the participation of a different kind of hybrid orbital
