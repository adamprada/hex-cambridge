of bonds will form the shape of the sphybridized orbital has be mathematically shown to to be roughly the same as that of the sphybridized orbital to minimize the repulsion between electrons the three sphybridized orbitals are arranged with a trigonal planar geometry each orbital lobe is pointing to the three corners of an equilateral triangle with angles of between them again geometry and hybrization can be tied together atoms surrounded by three electron groups can be said to have a trigonal planar geometry and sp hybridization the unhybridized pz orbital is perpendicular to the plane of the trigonal planar
