carbon remains the unhybridized pz orbitals on each carbon overlap to a Ï€ bond pi the orbital overlap is commonly written as pzcpzc in general multiple bonds in molecular compound are formed by the overlap of unhybridized p orbitals it should be noted that the carboncarbon double bond in ethlene is made up of two different types of bond a sigma and a pi overall ethylene is said to contain five sigma bonds and one pi bond pi bonds tend to be weaker than sigma bonds because the sidebyside overlap the p orbitals give a less effective orbital overlap when
