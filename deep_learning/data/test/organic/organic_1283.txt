bond in ethylene is both shorter pm and almost twice as strong kjmol than the carbon carbon single bond in ethylene pm kjmol each of the four carbonhydrogen bond in ethylene are equivalent has have a length of pm rigidity in ethene because they are the result of sidebyside overlap rather then endtoend overlap like a sigma bond pi bonds are not free to rotate if rotation about this bond were to occur it would involve disrupting the sidebyside overlap between the two pz orbitals that make up the pi bond if free rotation were to occur the porbitals would
