following diagram a describe the orbitals which overlap to the carbonnitrogen sigma bond and pie bond in the molecule below b what kind of orbital holds the nitrogen lone pair for the following molecule please indicate with atoms are being held in the same plane by the carboncarbon double bond solutions a sp b sp c sp with the lone pairs present d sp a the carbon and nitrogen atoms are both sp hybridized the carbonnitrogen double bond is composed of a sigma bond formed from two sp orbitals and a pi bond formed from the sidebyside overlap of two
