soderberg university of minnesota morris bonding in ethaneexercisequestionssolutionscontributors and attributions objective after completing this section you should be able to describe the structure of ethane in terms of the sp hybridization of the two carbon atoms present in the molecule ethane bonding in ethane the simplest molecule with a carboncarbon bond is ethane ch in ethane chch both carbons are sphybridized meaning that both have four bonds with tetrahedral geometry an sp orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an sp orbital of the second carbon atom to form a carboncarbon Ïƒ bond this orbital overlap is
