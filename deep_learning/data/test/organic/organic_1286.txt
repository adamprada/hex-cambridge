bonds are free to rotate this means in the case of ethane molecule that the two methyl ch groups can be pictured as two wheels on a hub each one able to rotate freely with respect to the other in section we will learn more about the implications of rotational freedom in sigma bonds when we discuss the conformation of organic molecules how did they know the tetrahedral geometry of carbon was predicted as far back as but how did they know a question came up when looking at ethane with a bromine substituent chbr when looking at the possible
