structural formulas above represent a single substance but how a brilliant solution to the problem came when j h vant hoff proposed that all four bonds of carbon are equivalent and directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron if we redraw the structures for chbr with both carbons having tetrahedral geometry we see that there is only one possible arrangement this theory hints at the idea of free rotation around sigma bonds which will be discussed later there was a serious problem as to whether these formulas represent the same or different compounds all that was known in the
