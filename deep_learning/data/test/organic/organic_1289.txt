four other atoms note that the tetrahedral bond angle of cesfhch is valence bond theorys use of overlapping atomic orbitals to explain how chemical bonds form works well in simple diatomic molecules such as h however when molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds we require a more detailed model a good example is methane ch according to valence bond theory the structure of a covalent species can be depicted using a lewis structure experimentally it has been shown that the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the methane molecule are identical meaning they have the same bond energy and
