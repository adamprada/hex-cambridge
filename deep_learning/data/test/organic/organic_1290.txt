are only unpaired electrons to share with hydrogens instead of the needed to create methane also the px and py orbitals are at o to each other they would form perpendicular bonds instead of the tetrahedral o bond angle predicted by vsepr and experimental data lastly there are two different orbitals s and p which would create different types of ch bonds as noted earlier experimentally the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the methane molecule are identical hybrid orbitals an answer to the problems posed above was offered in by linus pauling he showed mathematically that an s orbital and three
