equivalent in shape and energy the type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom create the molecular geometry as predicted by the vsepr theory hybrid orbitals overlap to form Ïƒ bonds lone pair electrons are often contained in hybrid orbitals sp hybridization in methane in order to explain this observation valence bond theory relies on a concept called orbital hybridization in this picture the four valence orbitals of the carbon one s and three p orbitals combine mathematically remember orbitals are described by equations to form four equivalent hybrid orbitals which are named sp orbitals because they are formed
