called an sphybridized carbon atom the larger lobes of the sp hybrids are directed towards the four corners of a tetrahedron meaning that the angle between any two orbitals is o bonding in methane each ch bond in methane then can be described as an overlap between a halffilled s orbital in four hydrogen atoms and the larger lobe of one of the four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals form a four equivalent sigma Ïƒ bond this orbital overlap is often described using the notation spcsh the formation of sp hybrid orbitals successfully explains the tetrahedral structure of methane and the
