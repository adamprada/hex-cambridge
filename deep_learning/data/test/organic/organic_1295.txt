to be expected in given organic compounds if necessary review sections and account for the differences in bond length bond strength and bond angles found in compounds containing sp sp and sphybridized carbon atoms such as ethane ethylene and acetylene key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below sp hybrid orbital study notes the bond angles associated with sp sp and sphybridized carbon atoms are approximately and respectively bonding in acetylene finally the hybrid orbital concept applies well to triplebonded groups such as alkynes and nitriles consider for example the structure of
