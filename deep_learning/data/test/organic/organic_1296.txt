the overlap of one sp orbital from each of the carbons while the two ch sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of the second sp orbital on each carbon with a s orbital on a hydrogen each carbon atom still has two halffilled py and pz orbitals which are perpendicular both to each other and to the line formed by the sigma bonds these two perpendicular pairs of p orbitals form two pi bonds between the carbons resulting in a triple bond overall one sigma bond plus two pi bonds acetylene is said to have three sigma bonds and
