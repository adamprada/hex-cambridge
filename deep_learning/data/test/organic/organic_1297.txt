to double and triple bonds are progressively shorter and stronger than normal single bonds such as the one in a simple alkane the carboncarbon bond in ethane structure a below results from the overlap of two sp orbitals in propene b however the carboncarbon single bond is the result of overlap between an sp orbital and an sp orbital while in propyne c the carboncarbon single bond is the result of overlap between an sp orbital and an sp orbital these are all single bonds but the single bond in molecule c is shorter and stronger than the one in
