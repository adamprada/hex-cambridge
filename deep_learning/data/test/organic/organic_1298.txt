sp overlap as in alkene b bonds involving spspoverlap as in alkane a are the longest and weakest of the group because of the p character of the hybrids hybridization summary a single bond is a sigma bond a double bond is made up of a sigma bond and a pi bond a triple bond is made up of a sigma bond and two pi bonds sigma bonds are made by the overlap of two hybrid orbitals or the overlap of a hybrid orbital and a s orbital from hydrogen pi bonds are made by the overlap of two unhybridized
