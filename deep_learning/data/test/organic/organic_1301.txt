have similar heats of hydrogenation kjmol and kjmol respectively and are therefore of similar stability however they are both less stable than trans cesfchchchch kjmol you may wonder why an sp sp bond is stronger than an spsp bond bond strength depends on the efficiency with which orbitals can overlap in general s orbitals overlap more efficiently than do p orbitals therefore the ss bond in the hydrogen molecule is stronger than the pp bond in fluorine in hybrid orbitals the greater the s character of the orbital the more efficiently it can overlap an sp orbital which has a
