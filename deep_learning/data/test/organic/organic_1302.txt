sigma bond with one of the hydrogen atoms in h with the pi bond broken the other carbon the one that did not newly receive a hydrogen is left with a positive formal charge this is the carbocation intermediate the remaining unreacted hydrogen is now a hydride anion as it was left with two electrons previously in the hh sigma bond next the electrons of the negatively charged hydride ion form a bond with the positively charged carbon this reaction is exothermic it will occur but it is very slow without a catalyst the catalyst a catalyst increases the reaction
