figure below the bond of the alkene weakens as it also interacts with the metal see below since both the reactants are bound to the metal catalyst the hydrogen atoms can easily add one at a time to the previously doublebonded carbons see and below the position of both of the reactants bound to the catalyst makes it so the hydrogen atoms are only exposed to one side of the alkene this explains why the hydrogen atoms add to same side of the molecule called synaddition figure hydrogenation takes place in the presence of a metal catalyst note the catalyst
