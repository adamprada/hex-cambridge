than less substituted ones due to hyperconjugation they have a lower heat of hydrogenation the following illustrates stability of alkenes with various substituents in disubstituted alkenes trans isomers are more stable than cis isomers due to steric hindrance also internal alkenes are more stable than terminal ones see the following isomers of butene figure transbutene is the most stable because it has the lowest heat of hydrogenation note in cycloalkenes smaller than cyclooctene the cis isomers are more stable than the trans as a result of ring strain references fox marye anne and james k whitesell organic chemistry rd ed
