strain torsional strain ring strain heat of combustion heat of combustion as a measure of bond strength the combustion of carbon compounds especially hydrocarbons has been the most important source of heat energy for human civilizations throughout recorded history the practical importance of this reaction cannot be denied but the massive and uncontrolled chemical changes that take place in combustion make it difficult to deduce mechanistic paths using the combustion of propane as an example we see from the following equation that every covalent bond in the reactants has been broken and an entirely new set of covalent bonds have
