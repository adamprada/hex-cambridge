example heat of combustion is useful in determining the relative stability of isomers pentane has a heat of combustion of kcalmol while that of its isomer dimethylpropane neopentane is kcalmol these values indicate that dimethylpentane is kcalmol more stable than pentane since it has a lower heat of combustion ring strain table lists the heat of combustion data for some simple cycloalkanes these cycloalkanes do not have the same molecular formula so the heat of combustion per each ch unit present in each molecule is calculated the fourth column to provide a useful comparison from the data cyclopropane and cyclobutane
