cyclopentane which have a much lower ring strain because the bond angle between the carbons is much closer to o changes in chemical reactivity as a consequence of angle strain are dramatic in the case of cyclopropane and are also evident for cyclobutane in addition to angle strain there is also steric transannular strain and torsional strain in many cycloalkanes transannular strain exists when there is steric repulsion between atoms because cycloalkane lack the ability to freely rotate torsional eclipsing strain exists when a cycloalkane is unable to adopt a staggered conformation around a cc bond torsional strain is especially
