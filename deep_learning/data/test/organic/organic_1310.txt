will be discussed in more detail in the next section the types of strain which contribute to ring strain in cycloalkanes angle strain the strain caused by the increase or reduction of bond angles torsional strain the strain caused by eclipsing bonds on adjacent atoms steric strain the strain caused by the repulsive interactions of atoms trying to occupy the same space exercise transdimethylcyclobutane is more stable than cisdimethylcyclobutane explain this observation answer the trans form does not have eclipsing methyl groups therefore lowering the energy within the molecule it does however have hydrogenmethyl eclipsing interactions which are not as
