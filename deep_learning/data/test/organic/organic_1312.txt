two or more are called epimers dglucose and dgalactose can therefore be refered to as epimers as well as diastereomers the epimer term is useful because in biochemical pathways compounds with multiple chiral centers are isomerized at one specific center by enzymes known as epimerases two examples of epimerasecatalyzed reactions are below now lets extend our analysis to a sugar molecule with three chiral centers going through all the possible combinations we come up with eight total stereoisomers four pairs of enantiomers lets draw the rrr stereoisomer being careful to draw the wedge bonds correctly so that they match the
