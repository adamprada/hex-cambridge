the chiral centers lets invert the configuration at chiral center and but leave chiral center unchanged this gives us the ssr configuration one more definition at this point diastereomers which differ at only a single chiral center are called epimers for example rrr and srr are epimers the rrr and ssr stereoisomers shown earlier are diastereomers but not epimers because they differ at two of the three chiral centers example draw the structure of the enantiomer of the srs stereoisomer of the sugar used in the previous example list using the xxx format not drawing the structures all of the
