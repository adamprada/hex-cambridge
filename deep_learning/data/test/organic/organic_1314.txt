configuration at both of its chiral centers draw dthreonine its enantiomer and its two diastereomers answer solutions to exercises comparing stereoisomerism with structural isomerism dglucose and dfructose are not stereoisomers because they have different bonding connectivity glucose has an aldehyde group while fructose has a ketone the two sugars do however have the same molecular formula so by definition they are constitutional isomers dglucose and dribose are not isomers of any kind because they have different molecular formulas exercise identify the relationship between each pair of structures your choices are not isomers constitutional isomers diastereomers but not epimers epimers enantiomers
