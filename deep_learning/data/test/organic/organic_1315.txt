equal amounts so the mixture is optically inactive what would occur if we carried out a similar reaction on a chiral alkene consider smethylpentene reacting with water acid catalyzed proton addition produces a carbocation intermediate that is chiral denotes stereogenic centre that intermediate does not have a plane of symmetry and therefore attack by water is not equal from the top and bottom this ultimately produces r and s products in a non ratio exercises questions q predict the products of the following reaction showing stereochemistry solutions s the products markovnikov are diastereomers of one another contributors and attributions dr
