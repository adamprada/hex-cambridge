objective discern the stereochemical differences between the ear of chiral and achiral alkenes stereochemistry the subtle details in the previous section the addition of water to the achiral alkene produced a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric alcohols they are produced in equal amounts so the mixture is optically inactive what would occur if we carried out a similar reaction on a chiral alkene consider smethylpentene reacting with water acid catalyzed proton addition produces a carbocation intermediate that is chiral denotes stereogenic centre that intermediate does not have a plane of symmetry and therefore attack by water is not equal from
