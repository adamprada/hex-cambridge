is expected to be most stable in the planar configuration section e and hence should lead to exactly equal amounts of the two enantiomers regardless of the chiral configuration of the starting material figure however the extent of configuration change that actually results in an reaction depends upon the degree of shielding of the front side of the reacting carbon by the leaving group and its associated solvent molecules if the leaving group does not get away from the carbocation before the productdetermining step takes place there will be some preference for nucleophilic attack at the back side of the
