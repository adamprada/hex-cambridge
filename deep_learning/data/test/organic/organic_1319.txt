solvent usually has a large influence on the stereochemical results of reactions because the stability and lifetime of the carbocations depend upon the nature of the solvent section f an orbital picture of ionization leading to a racemic product may be drawn as follows it should be clear that complete racemization is unlikely to be observed if stays in close proximity to the side of the positive carbon that it originally departed from we can say that shields the front side thereby favoring a predominance of inversion if gets far away before comes in then there should be no favoritism
