frontside orientation the stereochemistry of the product remains the same that is we have retention of configuration backside orientation in a backside orientation the nucleophile approachss the electrophilic center on the side that is opposite to the leaving group with backside orientation the stereochemistry of the product does not stay the same there is inversion of configuration for example if the substrate is an r enantiomer a frontside nucleophilic orientation results in retention of configuration and the formation of the r enantiomer a backside nucleophilic orientation results in inversion of configuration and the formation of the s enantiomer conversely if
