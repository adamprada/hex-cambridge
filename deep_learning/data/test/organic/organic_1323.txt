tertiary halides seems best accounted for by steric hindrance to the backside approach of an attacking nucleophile by the alkyl groups on the reacting carbon pertinent data which show how alkyl groups affect reactivity toward iodide ion are given in table not only do alkyl groups suppress reactivity when on the same carbon as the leaving group as in tertbutyl bromide but they also have retarding effects when located one carbon away from the leaving group this is evident in the data of table for bromodimethylpropane neopentyl bromide which is very unreactive in reactions scale models indicate the retardation to
