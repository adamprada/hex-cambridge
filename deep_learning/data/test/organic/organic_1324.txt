that of reactions this is evident from the data in table which lists the relative rates of hydrolysis of some alkyl bromides only the secondary and tertiary bromides react at measurable rates and the tertiary bromide reacts some times faster than the secondary bromide why do tertiary alkyl compounds ionize so much more rapidly than either secondary or primary compounds the reason is that tertiary alkyl cations are more stable than either secondary or primary cations and therefore are formed more easily you will appreciate this better by looking at the energy diagram of figure which shows the profile of
