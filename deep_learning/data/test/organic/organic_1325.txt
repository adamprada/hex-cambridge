to that of the reactants actually the energy of the transition state is only slightly higher than the energy of the ionic intermediates thus to a first approximation we can say that the rate of ionization of will depend on the energies of the ions formed now if we compare the rates for a series of compounds all having the same leaving group but differing only in the structure of their relative rates of ionization will correspond to the relative stabilities of the lower energy of the faster will be the rate of ionization therefore the experimental results suggest that
