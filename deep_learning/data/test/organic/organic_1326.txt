carbon to the alkyl groups thereby spreading the charge over a greater volume this constitutes electron delocalization which results in enhanced stability see section a an alternative way of explaining how the cationic charge is spread over the alkyl groups of a tertiary cation such as the tertbutyl cation is to write the cation as a hybrid of the following structures other organohalogen compounds besides secondary and tertiary alkyl compounds can react by mechanisms provided they have the ability to form reasonably stabilized carbon cations examples include propenyl allylic and phenylmethyl benzylic compounds which on ionization give cations that have
