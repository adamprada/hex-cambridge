evidently then unsaturated carbon cations such as phenyl or ethenyl are appreciably less stable more difficult to form than tertalkyl cations reasons for this will be considered in section b steric hindrance is relatively unimportant in reactions because the rate is independent of the nucleophile in fact steric acceleration is possible in the solvolysis of highly branched alkyl halides through relief of steric compression between the alkyl groups in the halide by formation of a planar cation along with the effect has on the rate at which an alkyl compound reacts by an mechanism the group also affects the nature
