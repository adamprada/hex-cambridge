neutral molecule to play a major role in determining how good or poor is as a leaving group the stability of is indeed important the problem is that there are several factors that contribute to the stavility and hence the lability of the leaving group for the purpose of initially identifying good and poor leaving groups consider development of a practical synthesis of diethyl ether one route is by way of displacement using an ethyl compound and ethoxide ion many compounds have groups that are quite unsatisfactory in this reaction they include compounds such as ethane propane ethanol ethyl methyl
