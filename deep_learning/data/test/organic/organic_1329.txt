is with the strength of as an acid this is very reasonable because the ease of loss of as from in an reaction would be expected to be related to some degree at least to the ease of ionization of to and therefore the stronger is as an acid the better will be as a leaving group thus is a relatively weak acid and is not a very good leaving group is a very strong acid and is a good leaving group the usual order of reactivity of alkyl halides when is the same group throughout is in accord with
