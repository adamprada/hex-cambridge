very fundamental explanation unless we can explain why some acids are strong acids and others are weak acids one factor is the strength of the bond but here we need to remember that the usual bond strengths are for dissociation to radicals or atoms not ions and for the gas not for solutions if we write the steps relating the bonddissociation energy to the energy of ionic dissociation in solution we see that for variations in in addition to the bond energy the electron affinity of the solvation energy of and the solvation energy of also will be contributing factors
