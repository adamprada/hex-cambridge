catalysis in general a leaving group that leaves as a neutral molecule is a much better leaving group than one that leaves as an anion alcohols are particularly unreactive in reactions because is a very poor leaving group however if a strong acid is present the reactivity of the alcohol is enhanced greatly the acid functions by donating a proton to the oxygen of the alcohol thereby transforming the hydroxyl function into which has a much better leaving group in place of the reactions of ethers and esters are acidcatalyzed for the same reason heavymetal salts particularly those of silver
