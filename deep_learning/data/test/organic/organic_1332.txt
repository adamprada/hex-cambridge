heating that complexes actually are formed between organic halides and silver ion is indicated by an increase in water solubility in the presence of silver ion for those halides that are slow in forming carboncations e the nucleophilic reagent the nucleophilicty of a particular reagent or can be defined as its ability to donate an electron pair to another atom see section in fact the reactivity of a reagent toward a methyl derivative can be taken to measure its nucleophilicty toward carbon the relative reaction rates of some nucleophiles toward methyl bromide are listed in order of increasing nucleophilicity in
