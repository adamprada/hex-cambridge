as the poorer is as a leaving group the better it is as an entering group for nucleophiles of different atomic numbers nucleophilicity usually does not parallel basicity for example for the halogens the reactivity sequence is opposite to the sequence for basicity similarly sulfur anions such as are better nucleophiles but weaker bases than corresponding oxyanions such as a number of nucleophilic agents which are very reactive in reactions are of the type where both atoms have unshared electron pairs examples include and all of which are more reactive than the closely related nucleophiles and why is the correlation
