will become attached to begin forming a bond sloughing off solvent molecules will be less favorable for a small ion than a large ion consequently we expect to be less reactive than strong evidence for solvation effects on reactivity is provided by the fact that chloride ion is more reactive than iodide in solvents that have low solvation energies for anions see section f furthermore in the gas phase where solvation effects are absent is more reactive than any of the other halide ions toward chloromethane it should be recognized that reactions may be reversible when both the leaving group
