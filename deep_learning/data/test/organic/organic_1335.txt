factors are relevant in regard to the ionizing ability of solvents first a high dielectric constant increases ionizing power by making it easier to separate ions this is because the force between charged particles varies inversely with the dielectric constant of the medium thus water with a dielectric constant of is times more effective than a hydrocarbon with a dielectric constant of second and usually more important is the ability of the solvent to solvate the separated ions cations are solvated most effectively by compounds of elements in the first row of the periodic table that have unshared electron pairs
