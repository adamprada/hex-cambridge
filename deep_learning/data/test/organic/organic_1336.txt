six or as small as one the most effective ionizing solvents are those that effectively solvate both anions and cations water strikes an excellent compromise with regard to the structural features that make up ionizing power that is dielectric constant and solvating ability from this we expect tertbutyl chloride to ionize much more readily in water than in ether because ethers can solvate only cations effectively whereas water can solvate both anions and cations the fact is that ionizations usually are so difficult that reactions seldom occur in solvents that cannot effectively solvate both anions and cations even if the
