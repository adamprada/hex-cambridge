profoundly the reactivity of a given nucleophile thus anions such as and which are weakly nucleophilic in hydroxylic solvents and in poor ionizing solvents such as propanone acetone become very significantly nucleophilic in polar aprotic sovlents such as the reason is that for salts such as and the aprotic solvent preferentially solvates the cation leaving the anion relatively bare this dissociation of the anion from the cation together with its poor solvation makes the anion abnormally reactive as a nucleophile the greek letters are used here not as nomenclature but to designated the positions along a carbon chain from a
