with few exceptions carbon compounds can be formulated with four covalent bonds to each carbon regardless of whether the combination is with carbon or some other element the twoelectron bond which is illustrated by the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane or ethane and the carboncarbon bond in ethane is called a single bond in these and many related substances each carbon is attached to four other atoms there exist however compounds such as ethene ethylene in which two electrons from each of the carbon atoms are mutually shared thereby producing two twoelectron bonds an arrangement which is called a double bond
