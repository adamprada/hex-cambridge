in a structural formula for instance cyclopentane often is represented as a regular pentagon in which it is understood that each apex represents a carbon atom with the requisite number of hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of carbon likewise cyclopropane cyclobutane and cyclohexane are drawn as regular polygons although this type of line drawing is employed most commonly for cyclic structures its use for open chain acyclic structures is becoming increasingly widespread there is no special merit to this abbreviation for simple structures such as butane butene or butadiene but it is of value in representing more complex molecules such
