below are two drawings of a carbon molecule with two chlorines and two bromines attached carbon molecule with chlorines and bromines carbon molecule with chlorines and bromines both drawings look like they represent the same molecule however if we add dashes and wedged we will see that two different molecules could be depicted the two molecules above are different prove this to yourself by building a model an easier way to compare the two molecules is to rotate one of the bonds here it is the bond on the right notice how the molecule on the right has both bromines
