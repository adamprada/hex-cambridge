acetylene three electrons from each carbon atom are mutually shared producing three twoelectron bonds called a triple bond in which each carbon is attached to only two other atoms of course in all cases each carbon has a full octet of electrons carbon also forms double and triple bonds with several other elements that can exhibit a covalence of two or three the carbonoxygen or carbonyl double bond appears in carbon dioxide and many important organic compounds such as methanal formaldehyde and ethanoic acid acetic acid similarly a carbonnitrogen triple bond appears in methanenitrile hydrogen cyanide and ethanenitrile acetonitrile by
