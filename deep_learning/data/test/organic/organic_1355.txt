conformers are the same molecule shown with different sigma bond rotations newman projections are one way to communicate bond rotation ethane conformations although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations in order to better visualize these different conformations it is convenient to use a drawing convention called the newman projection in a newman projection we look lengthwise down a specific
