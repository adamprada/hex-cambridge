which all of the ch bonds on the front carbon are positioned at dihedral angles of relative to the ch bonds on the back carbon in this conformation the distance between the bonds and the electrons in them is maximized if we now rotate the front ch group clockwise the molecule is in the highest energy eclipsed conformation where the hydrogens on the front carbon are as close as possible to the hydrogens on the back carbon this is the highest energy conformation because of unfavorable interactions between the electrons in the front and back ch bonds the energy of
