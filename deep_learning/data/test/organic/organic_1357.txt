however at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other state free rotations do not exist in ethane the carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate there is indeed a small kcalmol barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another this rotational barrier is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at extremely cold temperatures however at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one
