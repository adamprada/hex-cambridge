physical properties similar to alkanes and alkenes alkynes dissolve in organic solvents have slight solubility in polar solvents and are insoluble in water compared to alkanes and alkenes alkynes have slightly higher boiling points for example ethane has a boiling point of c while ethene is c and ethyne has a higher boiling point of c exercise arrange ethane ethene and acetylene in order of decreasing carboncarbon length how many pi bonds and sigma bonds are involved in the structure of ethyne what contribute to the weakness of the pi bonds in an alkyne arrange the following hydrocarbons in order
