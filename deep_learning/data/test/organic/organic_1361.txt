above give the possible reactants for the following formations propose a synthetic route to produce pentene from propyne and an alkyl halide answer assuming the pka of pentyne is about then the difference in pkas is since pentyne is more acidic the formation of the acetylide will be favored at equilibrium so the equilibrium constant for the reaction is about contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state university william reusch professor emeritus michigan state u virtual textbook of organic chemistry prof paul g wenthold purdue university steroisomerism in alkenesgeometric isomers
