requires that the carbon atoms of a double bond and the two atoms bonded to each carbon atom all lie in a single plane and that each doubly bonded carbon atom lies in the center of a triangle this part of the molecules structure is rigid rotation about doubly bonded carbon atoms is not possible without rupturing the bond in dichloroethene restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond become significant this leads to a special kind of isomerism the isomer in which the two chlorine cl atoms
