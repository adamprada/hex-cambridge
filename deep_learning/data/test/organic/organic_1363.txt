are offwhite and the chlorines are green in dichloroethane a free rotation about the cc bond allows the two structures to be interconverted by a twist of one end relative to the other in dichloroethene b restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond are significant geometric isomers have different physical properties consider the alkene with the condensed structural formula chchchch we could name it butene but there are actually two such compounds the double bond results in cistrans isomerism cisbutene has both methyl groups on the same
