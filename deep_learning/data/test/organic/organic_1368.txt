may be donated in bonding to an electrophile nucleophile nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond in both laboratory and biological organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates more specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide n anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles enolate ions are the most common carbon nucleophiles in biochemical reactions while the cyanide ion cn is just one example
