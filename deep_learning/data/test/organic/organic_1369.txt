the vast majority of polar reactions the electrophilic atom is a carbon atom bonded to an electronegative atom usually oxygen nitrogen sulfur or a halogen the concept of electrophilicity is relatively simple an electronpoor atom with partial positive charge is an attractive target an electronrich nucleophile electrophiles can be challenging to recognize because their partial positive charge is hidden in polar bonds andor resonance allkyl halides and carbonyl groups are useful electrophiles for synthetic organic chemistry electrophilicity of alkyl halides with respect to electronegativity halogens are more electronegative than carbons this results in a carbonhalogen bond that is polarized as
