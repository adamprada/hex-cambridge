length bond strength and molecular size as we progress down the periodic table from fluorine to iodine molecular size increases as a result we also see an increase in bond length conversely as molecular size increases and we get longer bonds the strength of those bonds decreases you might have thought that either of these would be more effective in the case of the carbonfluorine bond with the quite large amounts of positive and negative charge already present but thats not so quite the opposite is true the thing that governs the reactivity is the strength of the bonds which
