of carbonyl groups carbonyl chemistry is studied in greater detail in the second semester of organic chemistry exercise recognizing organic compounds as nucleophiles or electrophiles is an important first step in recognizing and learning patterns of chemical reactivity classify the following compounds as nucleophiles or electrophiles a methoxide cho b formaldehye cho c bromocyclopentane d water e sodium cyanide f methanamine chnh answer a charged nucleophile b electrophile carbonyl carbon has partial positive charge c electrophile alkyl halides are always electrophiles one reason they are an ochem students best friend d neutral nucleophile e charge nucleophile dont let the cation
