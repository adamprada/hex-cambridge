able to unambiguously describe the configuration of a compound the convention that is used to designate the configurations of chiral carbons of naturally occurring compounds is called the system to use it we view the molecule of interest according to the following rules the main carbon chain is oriented vertically with the lowest numbered carbon at the top the numbering used for this purpose must follow the iupac rules next the structure must be arranged at the particular chiral carbon whose configuration is to be assigned so the horizontal bonds to that carbon extend toward you and the vertical bonds
