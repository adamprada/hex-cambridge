the chiral carbon connected to the horizontal bonds are amino and hydrogen the amino substituent is taken to be the main substituent when this is on the left the acid has the configuration and when it is on the right the configuration all of the amino acids that occur in natural proteins have been shown to have the configuration glyceraldehyde which has one chiral carbon bonded to an aldehyde function hydrogen hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl is of special interest as the simplest chiral prototype of sugars carbohydrates perspective views and fischer projections of the and forms correspond to and respectively where
