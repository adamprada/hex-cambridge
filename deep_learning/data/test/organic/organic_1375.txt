or less simultaneously with the formation of the double bond and the loss of bromide ion from the neighboring carbon the abbreviation for this mechanism is for elimination and for bimolecular there being two reactants involved in the transition state b structural effects structural influences on reactions have been studied in some detail like the competing process a good leaving group is necessary and of these the most commonly used are the halides and sulfonate esters and onium ions such as ammonium and sulfonium rather strong bases generally are required to bring about the reaction the effectiveness of a series
