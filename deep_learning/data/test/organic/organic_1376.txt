the ease of elimination follows the order tertiary secondary primary unlike reactions which are not observed for tertiary alkyl compounds because of steric hindrance to the approach of the nucleophile to carbon the related reaction usually occurs readily with tertiary compounds the reason is that little or no steric hindrance is likely for the approach of a base to a hydrogen unless the base is exceptionally bulky the reactivity order also appears to correlate with the bond energy inasmuch as the tertiary alkyl halides both are more reactive and have weaker carbonhalogen bonds than either primary or secondary halides see
