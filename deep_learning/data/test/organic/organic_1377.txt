reaction temperature generally leads to an increase in elimination at the expense of substitution in fact surprisingly good yields of alkene or alkyne can be obtained by adding a halogen compound directly to molten or very hot with no solvent present whereupon the product is formed rapidly and distills immediately from the hot reaction mixture c orientation effects in elimination reactions with halides having unsymmetrical groups such as chloromethylbutane it is possible to form two or more different alkenes the proportion depending on the relative rates at which the different hydrogens are removed most eliminations of alkyl halides with common
