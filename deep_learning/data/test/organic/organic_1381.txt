as explained above normal kies for the deuterium effect are around to or large effects are seen because the percentage mass change between hydrogen and deuterium is great heavy atom isotope effects involve the substitution of carbon oxygen nitrogen sulfur and bromine with effects that are much smaller and are usually between and the difference in kie magnitude is directly related to the percentage change in mass large effects are seen when hydrogen is replaced with deuterium because the percentage mass change is very large mass is being doubled while smaller percent mass changes are present when an atom like
