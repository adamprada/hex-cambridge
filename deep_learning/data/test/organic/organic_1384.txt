higher atomic number now look at c the right end of the double bond similarly the atoms are c and h with c being higher priority we see that the higher priority group is down at c and down at c since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together therefore this is zbutene now look at the right hand structure the trans isomer in this case the priority group is down on the left end of the double bond and up on the right end
