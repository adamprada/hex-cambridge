two isomers of an alkene with four different groups on the double bond bromochlorofluoroiodoethene it should be apparent that the two structures shown are distinct chemicals however it is impossible to name them as cis or trans on the other hand the ez system works fine consider the left hand structure on c the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are br and i by the cip priority rules i is higher priority than br higher atomic number now look at c the atoms are cl and f with cl being higher
