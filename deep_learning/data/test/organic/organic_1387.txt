geometric isomerism at the second double bond at because it has h at its far end what about the first double bond at on the left hand end there is h and cl cl is higher priority by atomic number on the right hand end there is chch an ethyl group and chch a vinyl or ethenyl group both of these groups have c as the first atom so we have a tie so far and must look further what is attached to this first c for the ethyl group the first c is attached to c h and h
