left end the br and down on the right end the choch this means that the isomer shown is opposite entgegen e and what is the name the name feature of chemsketch says it is ebromoethylidenepentynyl methyl ether example the configuration about double bonds is undoubtedly best specified by the cistrans notation when there is no ambiguity involved unfortunately many compounds cannot be described adequately by the cistrans system consider for example configurational isomers of fluoro chloro bromoiodoethene and there is no obvious way in which the cistrans system can be used a system that is easy to use and
