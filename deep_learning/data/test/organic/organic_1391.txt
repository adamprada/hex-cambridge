or the substitution of a single hydrogen on the alkane for a single halogen to form a haloalkane this reaction is very important in organic chemistry because it opens a gateway to further chemical reactions introduction while the reactions possible with alkanes are few there are many reactions that involve haloalkanes in order to better understand the mechanism a detailed look at the step by step process through which a reaction occurs we will closely examine the chlorination of methane when methane ch and chlorine cl are mixed together in the absence of light at room temperature nothing happens however
