given off in the reaction than was put in the δh is negative the reaction is said to be exothermic and is considered favorable the figure below illustrates the difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions δh can also be calculated using bond dissociation energies δh lets look at our specific example of the chlorination of methane to determine if it is endothermic or exothermic since the δh for the chlorination of methane is negative the reaction is exothermic energetically this reaction is favorable in order to better understand this reaction we need to look at the mechanism a detailed step
