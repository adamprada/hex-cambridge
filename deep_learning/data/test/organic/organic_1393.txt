this step is not energetically favorable after this step the reaction can occur continuously as long as reactants provide without input of more energy it is important to note that this part of the mechanism cannot occur without some external energy input through light or heat step propagation the next two steps in the mechanism are called propagation steps in the first propagation step a chlorine radical combines with a hydrogen on the methane this gives hydrochloric acid hcl the inorganic product of this reaction and the methyl radical in the second propagation step more of the chlorine starting material
