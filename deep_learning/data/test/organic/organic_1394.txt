chcl more reactant cl and even combinations of the two methyl radicals to form a side product of ethane chch limitations of the chlorination the chlorination of methane or any other alkane does not necessarily stop after one chlorination it may actually be very hard to get a monosubstituted chloromethane instead di tri and even tetrachloromethanes are formed one way to avoid this problem is to use a much higher concentration of methane or other alkane in comparison to chloride this reduces the chance of a chlorine radical running into a chloromethane and starting the mechanism over again to form
