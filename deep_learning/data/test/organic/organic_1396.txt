are often very interested in trying to learn about what the transition state for a given reaction looks like but addressing this question requires an indirect approach because the transition state itself cannot be observed in order to gain some insight into what a particular transition state looks like chemists often invoke the hammond postulate which states that a transition state resembles the structure of the nearest stable species for an exergonic reaction therefore the transition state resembles the reactants more than it does the products if we consider a hypothetical exergonic reaction between compounds a and b to form
