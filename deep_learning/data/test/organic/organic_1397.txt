about the stability of a related species since the formation of a reactive intermediate is very reliably endergonic arguments about the stability of reactive intermediates can serve as proxy arguments about transition state stability the hammond postulate and the sn reaction the hammond postulate suggests that the activation energy of the ratedetermining first step will be inversely proportional to the stability of the carbocation intermediate the stability of carbocations was discussed earlier and a qualitative relationship is given below carbocation stability ch chch chch chchch chch chc consequently we expect that ºalkyl halides will be more reactive than their º
