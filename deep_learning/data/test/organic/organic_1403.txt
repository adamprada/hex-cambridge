of such a molecular unit is chiral and the structure may exist in either a righthanded configuration or a lefthanded configuration one the mirror image of the other this type of configurational stereoisomerism is termed enantiomorphism and the nonidentical mirrorimage pair of stereoisomers that result are called enantiomers in the general figure below a and b are nonsuperposable mirror images of one another and thus are a pair of enantiomers the structural formulas of lactic acid and carvone are drawn on the right with the asymmetric carbon colored red consequently we find that these compounds exist as pairs of enantiomers
