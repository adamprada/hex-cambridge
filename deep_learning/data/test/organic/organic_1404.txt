useful first step in examining structural formulas to determine whether stereoisomers may exist is to identify all stereogenic elements a stereogenic element is a center axis or plane that is a focus of stereoisomerism such that an interchange of two groups attached to this feature leads to a stereoisomer stereogenic elements may be chiral or achiral an asymmetric carbon is often a chiral stereogenic center since interchanging any two substituent groups converts one enantiomer to the other alkenes having two different groups on each double bond carbon constitute an achiral stereogenic element since interchanging substituents at one of the carbons
