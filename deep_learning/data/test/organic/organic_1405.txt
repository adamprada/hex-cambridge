the similar structure of compound e does not have such a symmetry plane and the carbon bonded to the chlorine is a chiral center the two ring segments connecting this carbon are not identical structure g is essentially flat all the carbons except that of the methyl group are sp hybridized and therefore trigonalplanar in configuration compounds c d h have more than one chiral center and are also chiral remember all chiral structures may exist as a pair of enantiomers other configurational stereoisomers are possible if more than one stereogenic center is present in a structure in the s
