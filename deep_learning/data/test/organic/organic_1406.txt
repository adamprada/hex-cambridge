different isomeric forms one of the isomers is an effective medication the other caused the side effects both isomeric forms have the same molecular formula and the same atomtoatom connectivity so they are not constitutional isomers where they differ is in the arrangement in threedimensional space about one tetrahedral sphybridized carbon these two forms of thalidomide are stereoisomers note that the carbon in question has four different substituents two of these just happen to be connected by a ring structure tetrahedral carbons with four different substituent groups are called stereocenters example locate all of the carbon stereocenters in the molecules
