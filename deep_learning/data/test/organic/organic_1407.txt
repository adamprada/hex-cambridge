are not superimposable if we pick up molecule a flip it around and place it next to molecule b we see that the two structures cannot be superimposed on each other they are different molecules if you make models of the two stereoisomers of thalidomide and do the same thing you will see that they too are mirror images and cannot be superimposed it well help to look at a color version of the figure below thalidomide is a chiral molecule something is considered to be chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its own mirror image in other words
