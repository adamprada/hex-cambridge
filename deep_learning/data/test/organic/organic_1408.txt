right hands are also a pair of enantiomers here are some more examples of chiral molecules that exist as pairs of enantiomers in each of these examples there is a single stereocenter indicated with an arrow many molecules have more than one stereocenter but we will get to that that a little later here are some examples of molecules that are achiral not chiral notice that none of these molecules has a stereocenter it is difficult to illustrate on the two dimensional page but you will see if you build models of these achiral molecules that in each case there
