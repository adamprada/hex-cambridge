of symmetry in a molecule is useful but often difficult in practice in most cases the easiest way to decide whether a molecule is chiral or achiral is to look for one or more stereocenters with a few rare exceptions see section b the general rule is that molecules with at least one stereocenter are chiral and molecules with no stereocenters are achiral carbon stereocenters are also referred to quite frequently as chiral carbons when evaluating a molecule for chirality it is important to recognize that the question of whether or not the dashedsolid wedge drawing convention is used is
