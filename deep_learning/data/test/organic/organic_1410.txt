how researchers in order to investigate the stereochemistry of reactions at the phosphate center incorporated sulfur andor o and o isotopes of oxygen the normal isotope is o to create chiral phosphate groups phosphate triesters are chiral if the three substituent groups are different asymmetric quaternary ammonium groups are also chiral amines however are not chiral because they rapidly invert or turn inside out at room temperature example label the molecules below as chiral or achiral and locate all stereocenters answer exercises questions q identify the chiral centers in each of the following solutions s contributors and attributions dr dietmar
