requires about however the heat of ionic dissociation of methyl chloride in aqueous solution is estimated to be and while this reaction is still substantially endothermic it requires about less energy than in the gas phase the reason is that ions are much more stable in water than in the gas phase for example the transfer of a chloride ion from the gas to water is exothermic by the value for the corresponding transfer of a methyl cation is not known with certainty but is about these ionic solvation energies are clearly large in contrast the for solution of methyl
