the ones used by paterno section d fill this purpose admirably a bond angles and ballandstick models it is well established that the normal carbon atom forms its four single bonds in compounds of the type so that the four attached atoms lie at the corners of a regular tetrahedron the bond angles are and this value is the normal valence angle of carbon for many purposes ballandstick models of organic compounds give useful information about the spatial relationships of the atoms and for the angles between sticks are set at figure organic molecules strongly resist deformation forces that alter
