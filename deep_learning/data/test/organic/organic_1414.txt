to form the double bonds figure but the angles are inaccurate because they are rather than the observed to ethyne has been established experimentally to be a linear molecule that is the bond angle is this geometry also results with ballandstick models if the triple bond is constructed of three flexible couplings or bent sticks as shown in figure structural units that have valence angles substantially less than the tetrahedral value include double and triple bonds and small rings such as cyclopropane several bent bonds are required to construct models of compounds containing these units interestingly such compounds are much
