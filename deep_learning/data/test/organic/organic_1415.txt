of both atoms the type of bonding single double or triple and the nature of other atoms or groups bonded to the two atoms in question these effects are apparent in the data of table which lists the bond lengths in several simple organic compounds multiple bonds double or triple clearly are shorter than single bonds and it can be stated as a general observation that the more bonding electrons in a given bond the shorter and stronger the bond the lengths of single bonds also vary significantly depending on what other atoms or groups are attached to the carbons
