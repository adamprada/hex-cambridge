cut to any desired length while the ballandstick models of molecules are very useful for visualizing the relative positions of the atoms in space they are unsatisfactory whenever we also want to show how large the atoms are actually atomic radii are so large relative to the lengths of chemical bonds that when a model of a molecule such as methyl chloride is constructed with atomic radii and bond lengths both to scale the bonds connecting the atoms are not clearly evident none theless such spacefilling models made with truncated balls held together with snap fasteners are used widely to
