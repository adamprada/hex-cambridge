that figure cpk spacefilling models of organic compounds it should simulate the type of motions available to the molecule particularly bond rotation for example it is known that rotation normally occurs about single bonds in openchain compounds but is restricted about double bonds motions of this kind are demonstrated easily with ballandstick models but are not at all obvious with the spacefilling type for this reason ballandstick models or their equivalent are more generally useful than the spacefilling models for visualizing structures and the positions of the atoms relative to one another the angstrom unit likely will be replaced eventually
