sn reactions draw and interpret reaction energy diagrams for sn reactions introduction in many ways the proton transfer process of a br√∏nstedlowry acidbase reaction can be thought of as simply a special kind of nucleophilic substitution reaction one in which the electrophile is a hydrogen rather than a carbon in both reaction types we are looking at very similar players an electronrich species the nucleophilebase reacts with an electronpoor species the electrophileproton driving off the leaving groupconjugate base in the next few sections we are going to be discussing some general aspects of nucleophilic substitution reactions and in doing so
