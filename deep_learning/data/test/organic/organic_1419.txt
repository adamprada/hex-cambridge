functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates more specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide n anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles when thinking about nucleophiles the first thing to recognize is that for the most part the same quality of electronrichness that makes a something nucleophilic also makes it basic nucleophiles can be bases and bases can be nucleophiles it should not be surprising then that most of the trends in basicity that we have already discussed also apply to nucleophilicity some confusion in distinguishing basicity base strength and nucleophilicity nucleophile strength is inevitable
