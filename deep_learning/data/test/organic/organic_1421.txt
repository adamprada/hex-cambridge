bases when comparing the reactivity of electrophiles that vary only in their leaving groups then leaving group stability plays a dominant role the electrophile with the more stable leaving group will be favored the lower the electron density of the leaving group the more stable it is neutral leaving groups are favoring over charged leaving groups when comparing charged leaving groups apply the concepts used to determine the relative stability of conjugate bases identity or identities of the atoms holding the charge delocalization of the charge via resonance inductive effects orbital hybridization what is an electrophile e an electrophile accepts
