out as a c here then is the generalized picture of a concerted singlestep nucleophilic substitution reaction to recognize neutral electrophiles we will need to identify polarity andor resonance with compounds to create a partial positive charge to attract the nucleophile the electrophilicity of alkyl halides comes from the polar carbonhalogen bond the common halogens being fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine with the exception of iodine these halogens have electronegativities significantly greater than carbon consequently this functional group is polarized so that the carbon is electrophilic and the halogen is nucleophilic as shown in the drawing on the right two
