carboncarbon bond and the bonds to the other halogens are weaker still the bond to iodine being about weaker the second factor to be considered is the relative stability of the corresponding halide anions which is likely the form in which these electronegative atoms will be replaced this stability may be estimated from the relative acidities of the hx acids assuming that the strongest acid releases the most stable conjugate base halide anion with the exception of hf pka all the hydrohalic acids are very strong small differences being in the direction hcl hbr hi exercise since everything is relative
