approach from the front side simply doesnt work the electron rich leaving group blocks the way with electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance the result of this backside penetration is that the stereochemical configuration at the central carbon inverts as the reaction proceeds in a sense the molecule is turned inside out at the transition state the electrophilic carbon and the three r substituents all lie on the same plane what this means is that sn reactions whether enzyme catalyzed or not are inherently stereoselective when the substitution takes place at a stereocenter we can confidently predict the stereochemical configuration of
