an sphybridized carbon bonds on sphybridized carbons are inherently shorter and stronger than bonds on sphybridized carbons meaning that it is harder to break the cx bond in these substrates sn reactions of this type are unlikely also because the hypothetical electrophilic carbon is protected from nucleophilic attack by electron density in the p bond sn reactions are highly unlikely because the resulting carbocation intermediate which would be sphybridized would be very unstable well discuss the relative stability of carbocation intermediates in a later section of this module for future reference when discerning between substitution and elimination reactions evaluating the
