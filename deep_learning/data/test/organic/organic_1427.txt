do not normally undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions unless other functional groups perturb the double bonds exercise predict which alkyl halides can undergo a sn reaction a chbr b chchchbr c chchbr d chchchchbrch solutions a no aryl halide b yes primary alkyl halide c no vinyl halide d yes secondary alkyl halide sn reaction kinetics in the term sn the s stands for substitution the n stands for nucleophilic and the number two stands for bimolecular meaning there are two molecules involved in the rate determining step the rate of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions depends on the concentration of both
