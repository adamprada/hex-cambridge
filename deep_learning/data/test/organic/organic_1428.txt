fast as the initial rate the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction follows secondorder kinetics that is the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of two firstorder reactants in the case of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution these two reactants are the haloalkane and the nucleophile for further clarification on reaction kinetics the following links may facilitate your understanding of rate laws rate constants and secondorder kinetics exercise the reaction below follows the sn mechanism a write the rate law for this reaction b determine the value of the rate coefficient k if the initial concentrations are m chcl m naoh and
