σbonds in the substrate decreases and new πbonds are often formed substitution reactions as the name implies are characterized by replacement of an atom or group y by another atom or group z aside from these groups the number of bonds does not change a rearrangement reaction generates an isomer and again the number of bonds normally does not change the examples illustrated above involve simple alkyl and alkene systems but these reaction types are general for most functional groups including those incorporating carbonoxygen double bonds and carbonnitrogen double and triple bonds some common reactions may actually be a combination
