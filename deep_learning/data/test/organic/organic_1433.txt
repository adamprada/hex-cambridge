molecules into smaller and more useful bits this is achieved by using high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst the source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum these fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking the hydrocarbons are mixed with a very fine catalyst powder these days the catalysts are zeolites complex aluminosilicates these are more efficient than the older mixtures of aluminium oxide and
