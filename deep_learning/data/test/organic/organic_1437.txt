example in the propane gas burner or as propellants in aerosol sprays butane in used in cigarette lighters where the pressure at room temperature is about bar cc the alkanes from pentane to octane are highly volatile liquids and good solvents for nonpolar substances they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines cc alkanes from nonane to hexadecane are liquids of higher viscosity being used in diesel and aviation fuel kerosene the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too viscous cc alkanes with to carbon
