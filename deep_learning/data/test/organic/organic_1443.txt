layer of copper hexadecachlorophthalocyanine molecules the molecules are tilted about from the horizontal plane courtesy jeol ltd virtually all parts of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from x rays lo radio waves have some practical application for the study of organic molecules the use of xray diffraction for determination of the structures of molecules in crystals is of particular value and in the past ten years this technique has become almost routine figure shows the detailed arrangement of the carbons hydrogens and bromines in bisbromomethylnaphthalene as determined by xray diffraction the apparatus and techniques used are highly complex and are
