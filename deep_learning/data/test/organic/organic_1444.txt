crystal has the bromines on opposite sides of the naphthalene ring the diffraction methods can be used to determine complete structures of organic molecules but they are not sufficiently routine to be utilized generally in practical organic laboratory work for this reason in the remainder of this chapter we will emphasize those forms of spectroscopy that are generally available for routine laboratory use as will be seen these methods are used by organic chemists in more or less empirical ways in general spectroscopic methods depend on some form of excitation of molecules by absorption of electromagnetic radiation and as we
