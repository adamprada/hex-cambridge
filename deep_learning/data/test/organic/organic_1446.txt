in electromagnetic wavelengths that differ by as much as a factor of because the velocity of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum is constant at the frequencies will differ by the same factor figure the span of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation used in spectroscopic investigations of organic compounds along with comparison of some of the various units commonly employed for wavelength and energy of the radiation on log scales units commonly used for wavelength are meters centimeters nanometers and microns in the past angstroms and millimicrons also were used rather widely frequency units are in cycles per second cps or
