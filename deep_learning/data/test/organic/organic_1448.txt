from the fact that it forms strong carboncarbon bonds that also are strong when in combination with other elements for example the combination of hydrogen with carbon affords a remarkable variety of carbon hydrides or hydrocarbons as they usually are called in contrast none of the other secondrow elements except boron gives a very extensive system of stable hydrides and most of the boron hydrides are much more reactive than hydrocarbons especially to water and air carbon forms bonds not only with itself and with hydrogen but also with many other elements including strongly electronattracting elements such as fluorine and
