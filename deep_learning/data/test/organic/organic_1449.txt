repulsion between the electrons customarily carbon completes its valenceshell octet by sharing electrons with other atoms in compounds with shared electron bonds or covalent bonds such as methane ethane or tetrafluoromethane each of the bonded atoms including carbon has its valence shell filled as shown in the following electronpair or lewis structures in this way repulsions between electrons associated with completion of the valence shell of carbon are compensated by the electronattracting powers of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms to which the carbon is bonded however the electrons of a covalent bond are not necessarily shared equally by
