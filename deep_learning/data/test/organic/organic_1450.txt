known are given below lithium hydride can be regarded as a saltlike ionic compound electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in the crystal lattice are strong thereby causing lithium hydride to be a highmelting nonvolatile solid like sodium chloride lithium fluoride and so on methane is at the other extreme it boils at which is about lower even than the melting point of lithium hydride because carbon and hydrogen have about the same electronattracting power bonds have little ionic character and methane may be characterized as a nonpolar substance as a result there is relatively little electrostatic attraction between methane
