these intermolecular electrostatic attractions hence the boiling point is high compared to liquid methane hydrogen fluoride is best characterized as a polar but not ionic substance although the and bonds of water and ammonia have somewhat less ionic character than the bonds of hydrogen fluoride these substances also are relatively polar in nature and also associate through hydrogen bonding in the same way as does hydrogen fluoride the chemical properties of lithium hydride methane and hydrogen fluoride are in accord with the above formulations thus when the bond to the hydrogen is broken we might expect it to break in
