of covalent compounds and will not at all resemble the chemistry of inorganic salts such as sodium chloride you also may anticipate that the major differences in chemical and physical properties of organic compounds will arise from the nature of the other elements bonded to carbon thus methane is not expected to nor does it have the same chemistry as other onecarbon compounds such as methyllithium or methyl fluoride g n lewis the renowned us chemist was the first to grasp the significance of the electronpair in molecular structure he laid the foundation for modern theory of structure and bonding
