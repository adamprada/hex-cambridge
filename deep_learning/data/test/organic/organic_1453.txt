and minor products of elimination reactions zaisevs rule and regioselectivity the prefix regio indicates the interaction of reactants during bond making andor bond breaking occurs preferentially by one orientation because the betacarbons of an alkyl halide may not be equivalent there can be more than one possible elimination product zaitsevs rule can be used to predict the regiochemistry of elimination reactions zaitsevs or saytzevs anglicized spelling rule is an empirical rule used to predict regioselectivity of betaelimination reactions occurring via the e or e mechanisms it states that in a regioselective e or e reaction the major product is the
