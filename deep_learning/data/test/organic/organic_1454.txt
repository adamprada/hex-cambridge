each possible elimination was the same we might expect the amounts of the isomeric elimination products to reflect the number of hydrogens that could participate in that reaction for example since there are three ºhydrogens red and two ºhydrogens magenta on betacarbons in bromobutane statistics would suggest a ratio of butene and butene in the products this is not observed and the latter predominates by this departure from statistical expectation is even more pronounced in the second example where there are six ºbetahydrogens compared with one ºhydrogen these results point to a strong regioselectivity favoring the more highly substituted product
