the equilibrium constant for such a reaction takes the form as is the case for all thermodynamic equilibrium constants the concentrations are replaced by activities and the equilibrium constant is unitless however if all species behave ideally have unit activity coefficients the units can be used as a very useful guide in solving problems example acetic acid what is the ph of a m hoac acetic acid solution ka x m solution an ice table will come in very handy here initial m change x x x equilibrium m x x x the equilibrium problem can then be set up
