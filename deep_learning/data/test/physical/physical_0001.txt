than with other ions in solution in many cases but water also dissociates into ions through the reaction the equilibrium constant governing this dissociation is highly temperature dependent the data below are presented by bandura and lvov bandura lvov t c pkw from these data a vant hoff plot can be constructed figure vant hoff plot for the autoionization of water there is some curvature to the line suggesting some albeit small temperature dependence for for equation refeqa however from the fit of these data a value of can be determined to be kjmol of particular note is that the
