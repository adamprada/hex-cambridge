is only neutral at c at higher temperatures neutral ph is a lower value due to the endothermic nature of the autoionization water while it has a nigher concentration it also has a higher and at the same level so it is still technically neutral the hydrolysis of a weak base hydrolysis is defined as a reaction with water that splits a water molecule the hydrolysis of a weak base defines the equilibrium constant kb for this reaction the equilibrium constant is given by the concentration or activity of the pure compound ho is not included in the equilibrium expression
