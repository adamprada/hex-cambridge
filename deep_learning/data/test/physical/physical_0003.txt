in order here initial m change x x x equilibrium m x x x so the expression for is in this case the small value of insures that the value of x will be negligibly small compared to m in this limit the value of which is equal to oh so is given by and the ph is given by equation refeq note the ph of this salt solution is slightly basic this is to be expected as kf can be thought of being formed in the reaction of a weak acid hf with a strong base koh in the
