based on these quantities and and since activities and fugacities are unitless thermodynamic equilibrium constants are unitless as well further it can be noted that the activities of solids and pure liquids are unity assuming ideal behavior since they are in their standard states at the given temperature as such these species never change the magnitude of the equilibrium constant and are generally omitted from the equilibrium constant expression thermodynamic equilibrium constants are unitless kp and kc oftentimes it is desirable to express the equilibrium constant in terms of concentrations or activities for systems that deviate from ideal behavior to
