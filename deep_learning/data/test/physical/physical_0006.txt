oconnor robertson pierresimon laplace laplace modeled the compression waves using the adiabatic compressibility defined by since the entropy is defined by it follows that any adiabatic pathway is also isentropic or proceeds at constant entropy adiabatic pathways are also isentropic a couple of interesting conclusions can be reached by following the derivation of an expression for the speed of sound where the sound waves are modeled as adiabatic compression waves we can begin by expanding the description of by using partial derivative transformation type ii applying this the adiabatic compressibility can be expressed or by using transformation type i using
