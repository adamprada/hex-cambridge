before noting that the relationships in equations refnote and refnote equation refeq can be simplified to or defining equation refeq can be easily rearranged to the righthand derivative is easy to evaluate if we assume a specific equation of state for an ideal gas substitution yields which is now looking like a form that can be integrated separation of variables yields and integration assuming that g is independent of volume yields or which is easily manipulated to show that or which is what we previously determined for the behavior of an ideal gas along an adiabat finally it should be
