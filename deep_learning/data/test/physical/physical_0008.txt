chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers consider an ideal gas that undergoes a reversible adiabatic expansion from an initial state specified by known values and to a new state in which the value of the volume is known but the value of the temperature is not known for an adiabatic reversible process and since we have so that for any gas we can assume that is approximately constant over a small temperature range taking to be constant in the interval we have we obtain the enthalpy change from where we use our idealgas result from section while
