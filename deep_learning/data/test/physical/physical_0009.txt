for a monatomic ideal gas we have so that monatomic ideal gas reversible adiabatic expansion for the spontaneous adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas against a constant applied pressure we have so that and given the initial conditions we can find the final temperature from spontaneous adiabatic process the changes in the remaining state functions can then be calculated from the relationships above in this spontaneous adiabatic process all of the other thermodynamic quantities are different from those of a reversible adiabatic process that reaches the same final volume a few ideas from formal logic last updated save as pdf
