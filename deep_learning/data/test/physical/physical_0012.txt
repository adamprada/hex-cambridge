that is is true in this case must be false if is true it must also be that is true using our notation we can express this fact as equivalently we can write that is and are equivalent propositions if one is true the other must be true is called the contrapositive of the equivalence of the conditional and its contrapositive is a theorem that can be proved rigorously in an axiomatic formulation of logic in our later reasoning about thermodynamic principles we use the equivalence of the conditional and the contrapositive of and the equivalence of the conditional and
