when we talk about comparing predictions of the theory to the results of experiment we mean that the changes that occur in the model when we apply the rules of the theory should parallel the changes that occur in the real world when we do the corresponding experiment the idea is analogous to the mathematical concept of a homomorphism a dictionary definition of a homomorphism is a mapping of a mathematical group ring or vector space onto another in such a way that the result obtained by applying an operation to elements of the domain is mapped onto the result
