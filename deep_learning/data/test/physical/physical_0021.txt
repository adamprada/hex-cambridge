true and sentence b is true the proposition is false unless both a and b are true now consider the performance of an electrical circuit that consists of a battery switches a and b and a light bulb all connected in series the light is off unless both a and b are on there is a perfect correspondence between the elements of the logical structure and the performance of the circuit see figure in fact this is a special case of a much more extensive parallelism for any sentence in propositional logic there is a corresponding circuitinvolving batteries switches and
