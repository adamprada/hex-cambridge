the ordered values where is the smallest by the argument that we develop in the previous section the probability of observing a value less than is about if we were to make a large number of additional measurements a fraction of about of this large number of additional measurements would be less than this fraction is just so we reason that the probability of observing a value between and is also about so the probability of observing a value less than is about and we expect in general the probability of observing a value between and is also about and
