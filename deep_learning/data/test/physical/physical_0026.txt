domain of values all possible values of were equally likely we would expect the difference between successive observed values of to be roughly constant which would make the plot look approximately linear at any value of the slope of the curve is just the probabilitydensity function these ideas mean that we can test whether the experimental data are described by any particular mathematical model say to do so we use the mathematical model to predict each of the n rank probability values that is to say we calculate if describes the data well we will find for all graphically we
