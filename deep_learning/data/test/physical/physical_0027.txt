do essentially the same test without benefit of special graph paper by calculating the average and the estimated standard deviation from the experimental data calculating and is discussed below using and as estimates of and we can find the modelpredicted probability of observing a value of the random variable that is less than this value is for a normal distribution whose mean is and whose standard deviation is we can find by using standard tables usually called the normal curve of error in mathematical compilations by numerically integrating the normal distributions probability density function or by using a function embedded
