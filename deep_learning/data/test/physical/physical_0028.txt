a large number of samples from the distribution our definitions of probability and the probability density function mean that about of the values we draw will lie in the interval we expect the percentage to become closer and closer to as the total number of samples drawn becomes very large the same would be true of any other interval where the area under the curve in the interval is if we draw exactly four samples from this distribution the values can be anywhere in the domain of however if we ask what arrangement of four values best approximates the result
