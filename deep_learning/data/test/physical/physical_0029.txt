of information to the contrary the best assumption we can make about a set of values of a random variable is that each represents an equally probable outcome if our entire store of information about a distribution consists of four data points drawn from the distribution the best description that we can give of the probability density function is that onefourth of the area under the curve lies above a segment of the domain that is associated with each point if we have points the best estimate we can make of the distribution from which the points are drawn is
