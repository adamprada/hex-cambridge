label the resulting simultaneous eigenstates of and as according to the corresponding eigenvalues these eigenfunctions of and of will not in general be eigenfunctions of either or of this means that any measurement of or will necessarily change the wave function if it begins as an eigenfunction of the above expressions for and can be mapped into quantum mechanical operators by substituting and as the corresponding coordinate operators and and for and respectively the resulting operators can then be transformed into spherical coordinates the results of which are properties of general angular momenta there are many types of angular momenta
