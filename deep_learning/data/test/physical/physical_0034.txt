ie the hamiltonian may or may not contain terms that refer simultaneously to two or more of these angular momenta for example the ion which has a ground electronic state its electronic configuration is has electronic spin electronic orbital and molecular rotational angular momenta the full hamiltonian contains terms that couple the electronic spin and orbital angular momenta thereby causing them individually to not commute with in such cases the eigenstates of the system can be labeled rigorously only by angular momentum quantum numbers and belonging to the total angular momentum operators and the total angular momentum of a collection
