with all three of its components it is useful to also introduce two combinations of the three fundamental operators and and to refer to them as raising and lowering operators for reasons that will be made clear below these new operators can be shown to obey the following commutation relations using only the above commutation properties it is possible to prove important properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of and let us assume that we have found a set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of and the fact that these two operators commute tells us that this is possible let us label
