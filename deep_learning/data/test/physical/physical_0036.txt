summarized i there is a maximum and a minimum eigenvalue for because all of the components of are hermitian and because the scalar product of any function with itself is positive semidefinite the following identity holds langle jmtextbfjx textbfjyjmrangle langle textbfjxlangle jm textbfjxjmrangle langle textbfjylangle jm textbfjyjmrangle ge however is equal to so this inequality implies that which in turn implies that must be less than or equal to hence for any value of the total angular momentum eigenvalue the zprojection eigenvalue must have a maximum and a minimum value and both of these must be less than or equal
