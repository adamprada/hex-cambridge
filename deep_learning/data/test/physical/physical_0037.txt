one unit of h higher or lower in eigenvalue it is for this reason that we call raising and lowering operators notice that although is indeed an eigenfunction of with eigenvalue is not identical to it is only proportional to explicit expressions for these coefficients will be obtained below notice also that because the and hence have the same eigenvalue as in fact sequential application of can be used to show that all for all have this same eigenvalue the eigenvalue must be independent of m for this reason can be labeled by one quantum number j iii the eigenvalues
