define the quantum number to be we see that the eigenvalues are given by we also see that from which it follows that iv the quantum number can be integer or halfinteger the fact that the values run from to in unit steps because of the property of the operators there clearly can be only integer or halfinteger values for in the former case the quantum number runs over in the latter runs over only integer and halfinteger values can range from to in steps of unity species whose intrinsic angular momenta are integers are known as bosons and those
