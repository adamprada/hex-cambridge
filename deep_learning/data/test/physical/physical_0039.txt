as follows i and have complete sets of simultaneous eigenfunctions we label these eigenfunctions they are orthonormal in both their m and jtype indices ii these eigenfunctions obey iii the raising and lowering operators act on to yield functions that are eigenfunctions of with the same eigenvalue as and eigenfunctions of with eigenvalue of iv when acts on the extremal states or respectively the result is zero the results given above are as stated general any and all angular momenta have quantum mechanical operators that obey these equations it is convention to designate specific kinds of angular momenta by specific
