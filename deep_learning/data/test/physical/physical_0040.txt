produce a total angular momentum the latter is designated by and coupling of angular momenta if the hamiltonian under study contains terms that couple two or more angular momenta then only the components of the total angular momentum and the total will commute with it is therefore essential to label the quantum states of the system by the eigenvalues of and and to construct variational trial or model wave functions that are eigenfunctions of these total angular momentum operators the problem of angular momentum coupling has to do with how to combine eigenfunctions of the uncoupled angular momentum operators which
