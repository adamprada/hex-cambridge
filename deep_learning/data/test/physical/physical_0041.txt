the quantum numbers when coupling pairs of angular momenta and the total angular momentum states can be written according to what we determined above as where the coefficients are called vector coupling coefficients because angular momentum coupling is viewed much like adding two vectors and to produce another vector and where the sum over and is restricted to those terms for which it is more common to express the vector coupling or socalled clebschgordon cg coefficients as and to view them as elements of a matrix whose columns are labeled by the coupledstate quantum numbers and whose rows are labeled
