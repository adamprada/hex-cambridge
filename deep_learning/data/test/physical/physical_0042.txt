can also be looked up in books where they have been tabulated eg see table of r n zare angular momentum john wiley new york here we will demonstrate the technique by which the cg coefficients can be obtained but we will do so for rather limited cases and refer the reader to more extensive tabulations for more cases the strategy we take is to generate the state ie the state with maximum value and to then use to generate after which the state ie the state with one lower value is constructed by finding a combination of the product
