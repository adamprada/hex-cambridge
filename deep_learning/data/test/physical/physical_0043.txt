contributes to the sum in the above cg series the state with the minimum value is also given as a single product state notice that these states have values given as since this is the maximum value it must be that the value corresponding to this state is ii states with one lower mvalue but the same value applying to and expressing as the sum of lowering operators for the two individual angular momenta gives this result expresses as follows that is the state which has is formed from the two product states and that have this same value iii
