process to generate the states and as combinations of the product states with these product states are and notice that there are precisely as many product states whose values add up to the desired value as there are total angular momentum states that must be constructed there are three of each in this case the steps needed to find the state are analogous to those taken above one first applies to and to to obtain and respectively as combinations of and one then constructs as a linear combination of the and that is orthogonal to the combinations found for and
