which have complete sets of orthonormal eigenfunctions this is why the cg coefficient matrix is unitary because it maps one set of orthonormal functions to another with both sets containing the same number of functions d an example example let us consider an example in which the spin and orbital angular momenta of the si atom in its ground state can be coupled to produce various states in this case the specific values for and are and we could of course take and but the final wave functions obtained would span the same space as those we are about to
