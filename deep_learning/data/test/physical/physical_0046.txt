the two openshell electrons the result above can therefore be continued as so the function is given by which can be rewritten as writing the result in this way makes it clear that is a combination of the product states the terms containing and the terms containing there is a good chance that some readers have noticed that some of the terms in the function would violate the pauli exclusion principle in particular the term places two electrons into the same orbitals and with the same spin indeed this electronic function would indeed violate the pauli principle and it should
