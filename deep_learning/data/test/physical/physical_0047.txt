to generate wave functions for the states of si the same analysis as shown above would pertain except that now the state would have a contribution from this contribution does not violate the pauli principle and its slater determinant does not vanish so for the remainder of this treatment of the states of si dont worry about terms arising that violate the pauli principle they will not contribute because their slater determinants will vanish to form the other function with the state we must find another combination of and that is orthogonal to and is normalized since we immediately see
