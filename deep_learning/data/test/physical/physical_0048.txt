has been used in which the product stated have been represented by their quantum numbers with the spin function always appearing first in the product to finally express all three of these new functions in terms of spinorbital products it is necessary to give the products with in terms of these products for the spin functions we have for the orbital product function we have e coupling angular momenta of equivalent electrons if equivalent angular momenta are coupled eg to couple the orbital angular momenta of a or configuration there is a tool one can use to determine which of
