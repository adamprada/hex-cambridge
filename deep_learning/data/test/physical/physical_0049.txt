which can be obtained from the state by replacing a by b and replacing by given the box entries one can identify those term symbols that arise by applying the following procedure over and over until all entries have been accounted for one identifies the highest value this gives a value of the total spin quantum number that arises in the box for the above example the answer is for all product states of this value one identifies the highest value this gives a value of the total orbital angular momentum that can arise for this for the above example
