is this illustrates the calculation of the probability of alternative events the probability of the particular route is and we calculate the same probability for any other route from first to fourth this illustrates the calculation of the probability of a compound event if he crosses bridge the probability that his route will be is zero of course the probability of an event that has already occurred is and the probability of any alternative is zero if he crosses bridge and given that a traveler has used bridge the probability of the route becomes the probability of path which is
