the first die shows while the second die shows is also the probability that one die shows and the other shows is four different outcomes correspond to the event that the score is therefore the probability of rolling is the probability of rolling a score of three or less is the probability of rolling plus the probability of rolling which is suppose we roll the dice one at a time and that the first die shows the probability of rolling when the second die is thrown is now because only rolling a can make the score and there is a
