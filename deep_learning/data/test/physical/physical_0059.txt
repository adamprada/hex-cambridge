heat we mean that the transfer of heat energy can be initiated by bringing the two bodies into contact with one another or by enabling the transmission of radiant energy between them the surroundings do no work and exchange no heat with either reservoir there is no change of any sort in the surroundings we can show that the entropybased statement and the temperaturebased statement of the second law are equivalent given the definition of entropy one implies the other let us begin by showing that the entropybased statement implies the temperaturebased statement of the second law that is we
