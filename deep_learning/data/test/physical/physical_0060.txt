portions of the universe that are affected let the entropy changes for the warmer and colder bodies be and respectively to find and we must find a reversible path to effect the same changes this is straightforward we can effect identically the same change in the warmer body by transferring heat to it through contact with some third body whose temperature is infinitesimally greater than this process is reversible and the entropy change is similarly the entropy change for the colder body is it follows that however if for a spontaneous process the second law must be false we have
