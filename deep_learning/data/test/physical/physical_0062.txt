law constant is the same for any gas or from the fact that the charles law constants and are the same for any gas however this entails a significant circularity these experiments can show that and are the same for any gas only if we know how to find the number of moles of each gas that we use to do so we must know the molar mass of each gas avogadros hypothesis is crucially important in the history of chemistry avogadros hypothesis made it possible to determine relative molar masses this made it possible to determine molecular formulas for
