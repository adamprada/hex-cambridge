arrange these building blocks in a regular lattice as shown in the figure figure the energy levels arising from and an infinite number of orbitals in the top four rows of this figure we show the case with and building blocks to the left of each row we display the energy splitting pattern into which the building blocks orbitals evolve as they overlap and form delocalized molecular orbitals not surprisingly for one finds a bonding and an antibonding orbital for one has a bonding one nonbonding and one antibonding orbital finally in the bottom row we attempt to show what
