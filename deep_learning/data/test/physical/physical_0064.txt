orbitals notice that when the energy gap between the building block and orbitals is larger than is the dispersion spread in energy within the band of or band of orbitals a band gap occurs between the highest member of the band and the lowest member of the band the splitting between the and orbitals is a property of the individual atoms comprising the solid and varies among the elements of the periodic table for example we teach students that the energy gap in c is smaller than the gap in si which is smaller than the gap in ge the
