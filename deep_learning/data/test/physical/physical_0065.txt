how many valence electrons each building block contributes the various bands formed by overlapping the buildingblock orbitals of the constituent atoms will be filled to various levels for example if each building block orbital shown above has a single valence electron in an sorbital eg as in the case of the alkali metals the sband will be half filled in the ground state with a and b paired electrons such systems produce very good conductors because their partially filled bands allow electrons to move with very little eg only thermal excitation among other orbitals in this same band on the
