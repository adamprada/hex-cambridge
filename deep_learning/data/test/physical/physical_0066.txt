the isolated na atoms in contrast the and bands show greater dispersion ie are wider and the band is even wider the and bands are full but the band is half filled as a result of which solid na is a good electrical conductor figure a example of sodium atoms and orbitals splitting into filled and partially filled bands in sodium metal in describing the band of states that arise from a given atomic orbital within a solid it is common to display the variation in energies of these states as functions of the number of sign changes in the
