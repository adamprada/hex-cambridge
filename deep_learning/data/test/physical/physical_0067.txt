sign changes as the index runs over the sites of the onedimensional lattice for larger n there are more sign changes thus thinking of the quantum number as labeling the number of sign changes and plotting the energies of the orbitals on the vertical axis versus on the horizontal axis we would obtain a plot that increases from to in fact such plots tend to display quadratic variation of the energy with this observation can be understood by drawing an analogy between the pattern of sign changes belonging to a particular value of and the number of nodes in the
