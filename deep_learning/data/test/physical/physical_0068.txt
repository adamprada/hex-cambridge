the orbitals the lowestenergy orbital is because this alternation in signs allows each orbital on one site to overlap in a bonding fashion with the orbitals on neighboring sites therefore the highestenergy orbital in the band is and is totally antibonding the intervening members of this band have orbitals given by with low corresponding to highenergy orbitals having few interatom sign changes but antibonding character and high to lowenergy orbitals having many interatom sign changes so in contrast to the case for the sband orbitals plotting the energies of the orbitals on the vertical axis versus on the horizontal axis
