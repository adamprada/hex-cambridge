with elements labeled by the ratio whose value characterizes the number of interatom sign changes for lattices containing many atoms is very large so ranges from zero to a very large number thus the ratio ranges from zero to unity in small fractional steps so it is common to think of these ratios as describing a continuous parameter varying from zero to one moreover it is convention to allow the index to range from to so the argument in the cosine function introduced above varies from to in two or threedimensions the vector has two or three elements and can
