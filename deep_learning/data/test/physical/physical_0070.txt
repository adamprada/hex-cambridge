underlying crystal lattice that is as one moves within the threedimensional space by specifying values of the indices and one can move throughout the lattice in different symmetry directions it is convention in the solidstate literature to plot the energies of these bands as these three indices vary from site to site along various symmetry elements of the crystal and to assign a letter to label this symmetry element the band that has no interatom sign changes is labeled as sometimes g in such plots of band structures in much of our discussion below we will analyze the behavior of
