the carbon atoms while those having energies near ev at the point derive from carbon bonding interactions the parabolic increase with for the based and decrease with for the based orbitals is clear and is expected based on our earlier discussion of how and bands vary with the band having energy near ev at the point involves orbitals involved in bonding interactions and this band shows a parabolic increase with as expected as we move away from the point these are the delocalized orbitals of the graphene sheet the antibonding band decreases quadratically with and has an energy of ca
