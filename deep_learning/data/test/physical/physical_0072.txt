antibonding band it is interesting to contrast the band structure of graphene with that of diamond which is shown in figure c figure c band structure of diamond carbon the band having an energy of ca ev at the point derives from bonding interactions and the three bands near ev at the point come from bonding interactions again each of these bands displays the expected parabolic behavior as functions of in diamonds two interpenetrating face centered cubic structure there are two carbon atoms per unit cell so we have a total of eight valence electrons to fill the four bonding
