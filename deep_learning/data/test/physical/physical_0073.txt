al and ag for al and ag there is one atom per unit cell so we have three valence electrons sp and eleven valence electrons ds respectively to fill the bands shown in figure d focusing on the points in the al and ag band structure plots we can say the following for al the based band near ev is filled and the three based bands near ev have an occupancy of ie on average there is one electron in one of these three bands each of which can hold two electrons the and bands are parabolic with positive and
