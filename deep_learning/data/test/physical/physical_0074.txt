valence electrons fill the five bands and the eleventh resides in the sbased bonding band if the five based bands are ignored the remainder of the ag band structure looks a lot like that for al there are numerous band crossings that include in particular the halffilled band these crossings and the partial occupancy of the band cause ag to have metallic character one more feature of band structures that is often displayed is called the band density of states an example of such a plot is shown in figure e for the tin crystal figure e energies of orbital
