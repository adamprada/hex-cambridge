highest occupied bands and the lowest unoccupied bands play central roles in determining whether the sample is an insulator a conductor or a semiconductor gaps in the density of states suggest what frequencies of light will be absorbed or reflected via interband electronic transitions the bands of orbitals arising in any solid lattice provide the orbitals that are available to be occupied by the number of electrons in the crystal systems whose highest energy occupied band is completely filled and for which the gap in energy to the lowest unfilled band is large are called insulators because they have no
