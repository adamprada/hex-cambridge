conduction is illustrated in figure figure the valence and conduction bands and the band gap with a small enough gap to allow thermal excitation to excite electrons and create holes in a previously filled band systems whose highestenergy occupied band is partially filled are also conductors because they have little spacing among their occupied and unoccupied orbitals so electrons can flow easily from one to another al and ag are good examples to form a semiconductor one starts with an insulator whose lower band is filled and whose upper band is empty as shown by the broad bands in fig
