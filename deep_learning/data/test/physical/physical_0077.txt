excited either thermally or by light from the filled band of the insulator into the dopants empty band once electrons enter the dopant band charge can flow because the insulators lower band is no longer filled and the system thus becomes a conductor another case is illustrated in the b part of figure here the dopant has a filled band that lies close in energy to the empty band of the insulator excitation of electrons from this dopant band to the insulators empty band can induce current to flow because now the insulators upper band is no longer empty contributors
