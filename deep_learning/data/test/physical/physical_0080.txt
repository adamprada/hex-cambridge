a representation that focuses attention on the proportion of automobiles with various speeds the shape of the bar graph remains the same all that changes is the scale we use to label the ordinate see figure figure number of cars versus speed insofar as any repetition of this experiment gives nearly the same results this is a useful change however the fundamental limitations of the graph remain for example if we want to use the graph to estimate how speeds are distributed in any other set of intervals we have to read values off the ordinate and manipulate them in
