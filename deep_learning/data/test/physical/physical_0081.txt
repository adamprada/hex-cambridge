rather than the height of the bar in the present case the only visible change to the graph is another change in the numerical values on the ordinate in figure the area of a bar represents the fraction of automobiles with speeds in the given interval as the speed interval is made smaller any of these bar graphs looks increasingly like a continuous curve see figure the histogram has the advantage that as the curve becomes continuous the interpretation remains constant the area under the curve between any two speeds always represents the fraction of automobiles with speeds in this
