area under the graph from to then represents the probability that the speed of a randomly selected automobile will lie between and for any and b the probability that lies in the interval is the function is called the cumulative probability distribution function because its value for any is the fraction of automobiles that have a speed less than is the frequency with which we observe values of the random variable that are less than equivalently we can say that is the probability that any randomly selected automobile will have a speed less than if we let the width of
