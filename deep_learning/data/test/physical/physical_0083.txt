inversely proportional to one another if the temperature t is held constant we can imagine rediscovering boyles law by trapping a sample of gas in a tube and then measuring its volume as we change the pressure we would observe behavior like that in figure we can represent this behavior mathematically as where we recognize that the constant is actually a function of the temperature and of the number of moles of gas in the sample that is the product of pressure and volume is constant for a fixed quantity of gas at a fixed temperature a little thought convinces
