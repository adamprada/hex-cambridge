molecules in the container be we imagine that we follow the trajectory of one particular molecule as it moves to hit the wall somewhere within we begin our observations at time and suppose that the collision occurs at time figure trajectory of a molecule colliding with a wall of its container as sketched in figure we erect a cartesian coordinate system with its origin at the location in space of the molecule at time we orient the axes of this coordinate system so that the plane is parallel to the plane of and the zaxis is pointed toward the wall
