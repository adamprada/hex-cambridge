of thecomponent the perpendicular distance from the plane of a to the plane of the cartesian system is we assume that the collision is perfectly elastic before collision the velocity component perpendicular to the wall is afterward it is only this change in the component contributes to the force on the wall within the and components are not changed by the collision during the collision the molecules momentum change is during our period of observation the average force on the molecule is thus the force that the molecule exerts on the wall is and hence the contribution that this particular
