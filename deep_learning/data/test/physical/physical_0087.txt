the number of the molecules in the container that can reach within time by considering a tubular segment of the interior of the container the long axis of this tube is parallel to the velocity vector of the selected molecule the sides of this tube cut the container wall along the perimeter of this tube also cuts the plane the plane of our coordinate system in such a way as to make an exact replica of in this plane call this replica the area of is the plane of is parallel to the plane of and the perpendicular distance between
