of molecules however the molecular velocities are not all the same and the pressure contribution is made only by that fraction of the molecules whose velocity components lie in the intervals and this fraction is so that the pressure contribution from molecules whose velocity components lie in these ranges is the total pressure at is just the sum of the contributions from molecules with all possible combinations of velocities and to find this sum we integrate over all possible velocity vectors the allowed values of are there are no constraints on the values of we have however since all of
