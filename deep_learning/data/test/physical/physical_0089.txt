is boyles law equating this pressurevolume product to that given by the ideal gas equation we have so that finally the maxwellboltzmann equation becomes and the probability density becomes this derivation can be recast as a computation of the expected value of the pressurepressureexpected value to do so we rephrase our description of the system a molecule whose velocity components are creates a pressure on the area with a probability of the latter term is the probability that a molecule whose velocity is is at time in a location from which it can reach within time if the molecule is
