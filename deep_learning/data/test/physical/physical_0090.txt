view the maxwellboltzmann equation as the product of a term called the boltzmann factorboltzmann factorand a preexponential term that is proportional to the number of ways that a molecule can have a given velocity if there were no constraints on a molecules speed we would expect that the number of molecules with speeds between and would increase as increases because the probability that a molecule has a speed between and is proportional to the volume in velocity space of a spherical shell of thickness the volume of a spherical shell of thickness is which increases as the square of however
