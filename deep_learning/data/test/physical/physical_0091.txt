in various processes can be understood in terms of acidbase equilibrium a buffer is created in a solution which contains both a weak acid and its conjugate base this creates to absorb excess h or supply h to replace what is lost due to neutralization the calculation of the ph of a buffer is straightforward using an ice table approach example what is the ph of a solution that is m in kf and m in hf solution the reaction of interest is lets use an ice table initial m m change x x x equilibrium m x x m
