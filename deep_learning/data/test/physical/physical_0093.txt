by and so example entropy change for a gas expansion calculate the entropy change for mol of an ideal gas expanding isothermally from a volume of l to l solution recognizing that this is an isothermal process we can use equation refisotherms isobaric changes for changes in which the initial and final pressures are the same the most convenient pathway to use to calculate the entropy change is an isobaric pathway in this case it is useful to remember that so integration from the initial to final temperature is used to calculate the change in entropy if the heat capacity
