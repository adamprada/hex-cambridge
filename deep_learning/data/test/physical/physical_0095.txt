the surrounding to drop measuring the temperature change in the surroundings allows for the determination of how much heat was released or absorbed in the reaction bomb calorimetry bomb calorimetry is used predominantly to measure the heat evolved in combustion reactions but can be used for a wide variety of reactions a typical bomb calorimetry set up is shown here the reaction is contained in a heavy metallic container the bomb forcing the reaction to occur at constant volume as such the heat evolved or absorbed by the reaction is equal to the change in internal energy durxn the bomb
