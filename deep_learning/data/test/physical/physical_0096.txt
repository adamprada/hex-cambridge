a wire embedded in the sample because this calorimeter operates at constant volume the heat released is not precisely the same as the enthalpy change for the reaction cc bysanc anonymous by request the calorimeter must be calibrated by carrying out a reaction for which is well known so that the resulting temperature change can be related to the amount of heat released or absorbed a commonly used reaction is the combustion of benzoic acid this makes a good choice since benzoic acid reacts reliably and reproducibly under normal bomb calorimetry conditions the water equivalent of the calorimeter can then
