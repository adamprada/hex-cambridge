the temperature change created upon combustion of a known quantity of the substance the experiment above is known as isothermal bomb calorimetry as the entire assembly sits in a constant temperature laboratory another approach is to employ adiabatic bomb calorimetry in which the assembly sits inside of a water jacket the temperature of which is controlled to match the temperature of the water inside the insulated container by matching this temperature there is no thermal gradient and thus no heat leaks into or out of the assembly during an experiment and hence the experiment is effectively adiabatic finding the enthalpy
