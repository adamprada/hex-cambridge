the same gas sample at a higher pressure we observe a second linear relationship between the volume and the temperature of the gas if we extend these lines to their intersection with the temperature axis at zero volume we make a further important discovery both lines intersect the temperature axis at the same point figure gas volume versus temperature we can represent this behavior mathematically as where we recognize that both the slope and the vaxis intercept of the graph depend on the pressure of the gas and on the number of moles of gas in the sample a little
