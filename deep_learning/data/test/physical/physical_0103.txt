scientist chemistry at university of utah experimental probes of chemical change theoretical simulation of chemical changecontributors and attributions experimental probes of chemical change many of the same tools that are used to determine the structures of molecules can also be used to follow the changes that the molecule undergoes as it is involved in a chemical reaction specifically for any reaction in which one kind of molecule is converted into another kind one needs to have the ability to identify via some physical measurement the experimental signatures of both and the ability to relate the magnitude of these experimental signals
