for ca second or more to obtain a useable signal likewise a mass spectroscopic analysis of a mixture of reacting species may require many second or minutes to carry out these restrictions in turn limit the rates of reactions that can be followed using these experimental tools eg one can not use nmr of mass spectroscopy to follow a reaction that occurs on a time scale of s especially for very fast reactions and for reactions involving unstable species that can not easily be handled socalled pumpprobe experimental approaches are often used for example suppose one were interested in studying
