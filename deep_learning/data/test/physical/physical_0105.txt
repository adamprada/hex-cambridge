tuned to a transition that will cause the xcl precursor to undergo rapid photodissociation hnu xcl rightarrow x cltag because the pump light source used to prepare the radicals is of very short duration and because the xcl dissociation is prompt one knows to within the time at which the cl radicals begin to react with the ozone the initial concentration of the radicals can be known if the quantum yield for the hnu xcl rightarrow x cl reaction is known this means that the intensity of photons the probability of photon absorption by xcl and the fraction of excited
