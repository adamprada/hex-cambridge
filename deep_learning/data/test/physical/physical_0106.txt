at a series of time delays the result of which is the determination of the concentrations of some product or reactant species at various times after the initial pump event created the reactive radicals in this way one can monitor for example the concentration as a function of time after the begins to react with the if one has reason to believe that the reaction occurs in a single bimolecular event as one can then extract the rate constant k for the reaction by using the following kinetic scheme if the initial concentration of is large compared to the amount
