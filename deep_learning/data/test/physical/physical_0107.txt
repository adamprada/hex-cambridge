is a highly reactive species such as a radical there is another kind of experiment that can be used to probe very fast reactions if the reaction and its reverse reaction can be brought into equilibrium to the extent that reactants and products both exist in measurable concentrations for example consider the reaction of an enzyme e and a substrate s to form the enzymesubstrate complex es at equilibrium the forward rate kf eeq seq tag and the reverse rate are equal kf eeq seq kr eseq tag the idea behind so called perturbation techniques is to begin with a
