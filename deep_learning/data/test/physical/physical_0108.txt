equilibrium constant can be changed by rapidly heating the sample eg with a fast laser pulse that is absorbed and rapidly heats the sample and using to calculate the change in and thus the changes in concentrations caused by the sudden heating alternatively if the polarity of the reactants and products is substantially different one may use a rapidly applied electric field to quickly change the concentrations of the reactant and product species in such experiments the concentrations of the species is shifted by a small amount as a result of the application of the perturbation so that es eseq
