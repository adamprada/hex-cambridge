constants so by quickly perturbing an equilibrium reaction mixture for a short period of time and subsequently following the concentrations of the reactants or products as they return to their equilibrium values one can extract the effective rate coefficient doing this at a variety of different initial equilibrium concentrations eg and and seeing how changes one can then determine both the forward and reverse rate constants both the pumpprobe and the perturbation methods require that one be able to quickly create or perturb concentrations of reactive species and that one have available an experimental probe that allows one to follow
