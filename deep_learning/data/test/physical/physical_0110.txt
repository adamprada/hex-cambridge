contains few atoms such a surface could be computed using the methods discussed in chapter at a large number of molecular geometries and then fit to an analytical function of the or variables denoted knowing as a function of these variables one can then compute the forces fj dfracpartialepartialqj tag along each coordinate and then use the newton equations to follow the time evolution of these coordinates and hence the progress of the reaction the values of the coordinates at a series of discrete times constitute what is called a classical trajectory to simulate a chemical reaction one begins the
