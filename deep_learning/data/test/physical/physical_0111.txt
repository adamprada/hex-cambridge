these trajectories over this ensemble of initial conditions more about how one carries out such ensemble averaging is discussed in chapters and if the molecule contains more than or atoms it is more common to not compute the bornoppenheimer energy at a set of geometries and then fit this data to an analytical form instead one begins a trajectory at some initial coordinates and with some initial momenta and then uses the newton equations usually in the finitedifference form qj qj dfracpjmj dt tag to propagate the coordinates and momenta forward in time by a small amount here denotes the
