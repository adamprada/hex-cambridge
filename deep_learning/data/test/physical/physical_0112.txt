trajectory simulation of a chemical reaction there are other issues that must be addressed in particular as mentioned above one can essentially never use any single trajectory to simulate a reaction carried out in a laboratory setting one must perform a series of such trajectory calculations with a variety of different initial coordinates and momenta chosen in a manner to represent the experimental conditions of interest for example suppose one were to wish to model a molecular beam experiment in which a beam of species having a well defined kinetic energy collides with a beam of species having kinetic energy
