distance of closest approach in the collision shown on the left the and come together closely however in the left collision the a molecule is moving away from the region where would strike it before has reached it these two cases can be viewed from a different perspective that helps to clarify their differences in figure we illustrate these two collisions viewed from a frame of reference located on the molecule figure same two close and distant collisions viewed from sitting on and in the case of no attractive or repulsive interactions in this figure we show the location of
