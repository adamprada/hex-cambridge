figure same two close and distant collisions viewed from sitting on a now in the case of repulsive interactions in both of these trajectories repulsive intermolecular forces cause the trajectory to move away from its initial path which defines the respective impact parameters so even in this molecular beam example in which both colliding molecules have well specified velocities one must carry out a number of classical trajectories each with a different impact parameter b to simulate the laboratory event in practice the impact parameters can be chosen to range from ie a head on collision to some maximum value
