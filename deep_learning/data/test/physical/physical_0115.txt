for the reactants andor one must follow trajectories with velocities in this range and weigh the outcomes ie reaction or not of such trajectories appropriately eg with a maxwellboltzmann weighting factor and if the reactant molecules have internal bond lengths angles and orientations one must follow trajectories with different initial values of these variables and properly weigh each such trajectory eg using the vibrational states coordinate probability distribution as a weighting factor for the initial values of that coordinate as a result to properly simulate a laboratory experiment of a chemical reaction it usually requires one to follow a very
