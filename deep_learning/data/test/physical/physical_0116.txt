cases one is faced with the reactive trajectories being very rare among the full ensemble of trajectories needed to properly simulate the laboratory experiment certainly one can apply the trajectoryfollowing technique outlined above but if one observes for example that only one trajectory in produces a reaction one may not have adequate statistics to determine the reaction probability one could subsequently run trajectories chosen again to represent the same experiment and see whether or or of these trajectories react thereby increasing the precision of your reaction probability however it may be computationally impractical to perform times as many trajectories to
