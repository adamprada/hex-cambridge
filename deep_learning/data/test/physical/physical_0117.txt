answer to the first question posed above involves computing the quasiequilibrium fraction of reacting species that reach the barrier region in terms of the partition functions of statistical mechanics this step becomes practical if the chemical reactants can be assumed to be in some form of thermal equilibrium which is where these kinds of models are useful in the simplest form of tst the answer to the second question posed above is taken to be all trajectories that reach the barrier react in more sophisticated variants other models are introduced to take into consideration that not all trajectories that cross
