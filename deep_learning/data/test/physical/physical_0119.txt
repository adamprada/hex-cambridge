products is the same thing as being able to predict what reaction will occur if there is no single reaction whose position of equilibrium is much further in the direction of its products than that of any other reaction multiple reactions can occur simultaneously this twostep procedure corresponds to the sense in which chemical thermodynamics enables us to predict reaction products we measure values for certain characteristic thermodynamic functions for all relevant compounds given the values of these functions for all of the compounds involved in a hypothesized reaction we calculate the position of equilibrium that we must begin by
