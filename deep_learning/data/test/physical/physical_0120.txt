reaction is at any time in particular this rate equation must remain true at arbitrarily long timestimes at which the reaction has reached equilibrium and at which therefore at equilibrium we have where the concentrationterm subscripts serve to emphasize that the concentration values correspond to the reaction being in a state of equilibrium we see that the ratio of rate constants characterizes the equilibrium state this constant is so useful we give it a separate name and symbol the equilibrium constant now let us consider the possibility that the reaction is not an elementary process but instead proceeds by a
