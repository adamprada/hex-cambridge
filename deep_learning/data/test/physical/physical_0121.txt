of different rate constants equation refeqa vs equation refeqa for the general reaction we see that any sequence of elementary reactions will give rise to the same concentration expression for the equilibrium system whatever the mechanism reactant must appear times more often on the left side of elementary reactions than it does on the right product must appear times more often on the right side of elementary reactions than it does on the left any intermediates must appear an equal number of times on the left and on the right in the various elementary reactions as a result when we
