observe experimentally that the amount of the pure phase present in the reaction mixture does not affect the position of equilibrium the composition of the reaction solution is the same so long as the solution is in contact with a finite amount of the pure phase this means that we can omit the concentration of the substance that makes up the pure phase when we write the equilibriumconstant expression in writing the equilibrium constant expression we can take the concentration the substance to be an arbitrary constant unity is usually the most convenient choice for this constant to rationalize this
