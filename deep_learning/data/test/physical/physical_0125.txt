for a reaction mixture in terms of the reaction quotient the reaction quotient can be expressed as where are the stoichiometric coefficients for the products and are those for the reactants or if the stoichiometric coefficients are defined by expressing the reaction as a sum where refers to one of the species in the reaction and is then the stoichiometric coefficient for that species it is clear that will be negative for a reactant since its concentration or partial pressure will reduce as the reaction moves forward and positive for a product since the concentration or partial pressure will be
