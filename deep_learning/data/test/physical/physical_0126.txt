of spontaneous change for a chemical reaction is dependent on the composition of the reaction mixture similarly the magnitude of the equilibrium constant is insufficient to determine whether a reaction will spontaneously form reactants or products as the direction the reaction will shift is also a function of not just the equilibrium constant but also the composition of the reaction mixture example based on the data below at k calculate the value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction kjmol solution first calculate the value of from the data and now use the value to calculate using equation reftriangle note
