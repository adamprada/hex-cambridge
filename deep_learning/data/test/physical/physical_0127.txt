thermodynamics that a particular reaction can occur we still do not know whether it will occur in a millisecondor so slowly that no change is detectable the science of thermodynamics builds on the idea that a particular chemical system can be characterized by the values of certain thermodynamic functions these state functions include such familiar quantities as pressure temperature volume concentrations and energy as well as some that are not so well known notably enthalpy entropy gibbs free energy helmholtz free energy chemical potential fugacity and chemical activity we can think of a state function as a quasimathematical function whose
