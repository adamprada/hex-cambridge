arrangement of ropes and pulleys a falling object can be used to lift another object kinetic energy can also be convertedor as we often say degradedinto heat by the effects of friction we view such processes as the conversion of the kinetic energy of a large object into increased kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules that comprise the warmed objects we can say that easily visible mechanical motions are converted into invisible mechanical motions the idea that heating an object increases the kinetic energy of its component atoms is called the kinetic theory of heat it is often convenient
