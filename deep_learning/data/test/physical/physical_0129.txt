of molecularlevel processes the brownian motion of a colloidal particle suspended in a liquid medium is noteworthy because this relationship is visible viewed with an optical microscope a suspended macroscopic colloidal particle is seen to undergo a rapid and random jiggling motion each jiggle is the accumulated effect of otherwise invisible collisions between the particle and the molecules of the liquid each collision imparts momentum to the particle over long times the effects average out momentum transfer is approximately equal in every direction during the short time of a given jiggle there is an imbalance of collisions such that more
