order to produce a given quantity of work sadi carnot was the first to analyze this problem theoretically in doing so he discovered the idea that we call the second law of thermodynamics the interconversion of heat and work involves an important asymmetry we readily appreciate that the conversion of kinetic energy to heat can be complete because we have seen countless examples of objects coming to a complete standstill as the result of frictional forces however ordinary experience leaves us less prepared to deal with the question of whether heat can be completely converted into work possibly we remember
