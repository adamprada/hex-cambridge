work will be just equal to the thermal energy added to the gas we call this process a reversible isothermal expansion this process does not involve a cycle the volume of the gas at the end of the process is greater than its volume at the start what carnot realized is that an engine must operate in a cyclic fashion and that no devicenot even an idealized frictionless deviceoperating around a cycle can convert heat to work with efficiency carnot analyzed the process of converting heat into work in terms of an ideal engine that accepts thermal energy heat at
