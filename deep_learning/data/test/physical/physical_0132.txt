engine and the flow of water through a water wheel in this view the temperature of the steam entering and leaving the engine is analogous to the altitude of the water entering and leaving the wheel such considerations are obviously relevant if we are interested in building engines but we are interested in chemical reactivity how does chemical change relate to engines and the conversion of heat into work well rather directly actually after all a chemical reaction usually liberates or absorbs heat if we can relate mechanical work to heat and we can relate the amount of heat liberated
