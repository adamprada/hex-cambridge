is often better able to understand interpret and simulate such condensedmedia systems moreover most experiments do not probe such shorttime dynamical properties of single molecules instead their signals report on the behavior of many molecules lying within the range of their detection device eg laser beam stm tip or electrode it is when one want to describe the behavior of collections of molecules under such conditions that the power of statistical mechanics comes into play the distribution of energy among levels one of the most important concepts of statistical mechanics involves how a specified total amount of energy can be
