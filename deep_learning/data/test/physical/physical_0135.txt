is the whole collection of interacting molecules in its quantum state where is the energy of this quantum state is the temperature in k is the degeneracy of the state and the denominator is the socalled partition function the classical mechanical equivalent of the above quantum boltzmann population formula for a system with a total of coordinates collectively denoted they would be the internal and intermolecular coordinates of the molecules in the system and momenta denoted is where is the classical hamiltonian is plancks constant and the classical partition function is this probability density expression which must integrate to unity
