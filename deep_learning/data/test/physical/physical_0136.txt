is a competition between state degeneracy which tends to grow as the states energy grows and which decreases with increasing energy if the number of particles is huge the degeneracy grows as a high power lets denote this power as of because the degeneracy is related to the number of ways the energy can be distributed among the molecules in fact grows at least as fast as as a result of growing as the product function has the form shown in fig for for illustrative purposes figure probability weighting factor as a function of for by taking the derivative of
