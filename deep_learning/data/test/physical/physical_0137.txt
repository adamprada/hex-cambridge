of molecules in the sample grows which as discussed earlier causes to grow the energy probability function becomes more and more sharply peaked about the most probable energy this in turn suggests that we may be able to model aside from infrequent fluctuations which we may also find a way to take account of the behavior of systems with many molecules by focusing on the most probable situation ie those having the energy and ignoring or making small corrections for deviations from this case it is for the reasons just shown that for macroscopic systems near equilibrium in which and
