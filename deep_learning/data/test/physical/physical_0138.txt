in the sample is large we consider a system composed of identical containers each having volume v and each made out a material that allows for efficient heat transfer to its surroundings eg through collisions of the molecules inside the volume with the walls of the container but material that does not allow any of the molecules in each container to escape these containers are arranged into a regular lattice as shown in figure in a manner that allows their thermally conducting walls to come into contact finally the entire collection of such containers is surrounded by a perfectly insulating
