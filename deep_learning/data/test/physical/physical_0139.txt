likely to be occupied this is called the assumption of equal a priori probability for such energyallowed quantum states the quantum states relevant to this case are not the states of individual molecules nor are they the states of of the molecules in one of the containers of volume they are the quantum states of the entire system comprised of molecules because our system consists of identical containers each with molecules in it we can describe the quantum states of the entire system in terms of the quantum states of each such container it may seem foolish to be discussing
