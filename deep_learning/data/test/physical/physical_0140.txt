the lowestenergy state of molecules in the container of volume labels the second such state and so on as i said above i understand it may seem daunting to think of how one actually finds these molecule eigenstates however we are just deriving a general framework that gives the probabilities of being in each such state in so doing we are allowed to pretend that we know these states in any actual application we will of course have to use approximate expressions for such energies assuming that the walls that divide the containers play no role except to allow for
