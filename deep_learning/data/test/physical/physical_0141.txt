energy as several other container states for example and have the same energy although they are different individual states what differs among these distinct states is which box occupies which singlebox quantum state the above example illustrates that an energy level of the container system can have a high degree of degeneracy because its total energy can be achieved by having the various singlecontainer states appear in various orders that is which container is in which state can be permuted without altering the total energy the formula for how many ways the container states can be permuted such that there
