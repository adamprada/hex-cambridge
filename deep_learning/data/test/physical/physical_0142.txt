examine at its maximum and compare its value at values of the parameters changed only slightly from the values that maximized as we will see is very strongly peaked at its maximum and decreases extremely rapidly for values of that differ only slightly from the optimal values it is this property that gives rise to the very narrow energy distribution discussed earlier in this chapter so lets take a closer look at how this energy distribution formula arises we want to know what values of the variables make a maximum however all of the variables are not independent they must
