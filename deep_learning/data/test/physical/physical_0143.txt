of the factorial of a large number to approximate as follows this expression will prove useful because we can take its derivative with respect to the variables which we need to do to search for the maximum of to impose the constraints and we use the technique of lagrange multipliers that is we seek to find values of that maximize the following function notice that this function is exactly equal to the function we wish to maximize whenever the variables obey the two constraints so the maxima of and of are identical if the have values that obey the constraints
