first constraint equation gives which allows us to solve for in terms of doing so and substituting the result into the expression for gives where notice that the are as we assumed earlier large numbers if is large because is proportional to notice also that we now see the appearance of the partition function and of exponential dependence on the energy of the state that gives the boltzmann population of that state it is possible to relate the lagrange multiplier to the total energy of the containers by summing the number of containers in the kth quantum state multiplied by
