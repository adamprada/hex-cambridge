varies with appreciable probability let us consider not just the degeneracy of that set of variables that makes maximum but also the degeneracy for values of differing by small amounts from the optimal values expanding as a taylor series in the parameters and evaluating the expansion in the neighborhood of the values we find we know that all of the first derivative terms vanish because has been made maximum at to evaluate the second derivative terms we first note that the first derivative of is so the second derivatives needed to complete the taylor series through second order are using
