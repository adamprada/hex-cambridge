the ratio that appears in the above exponential has an mdependence that allows to be written as where and are the fraction and fractional deviation of containers in state and the purpose of writing in this manner is to explicitly show that in the socalled thermodynamic limit when approaches infinity only the most probable distribution of energy need to be considered because only is important as approaches infinity fluctuations lets consider this very narrow distribution issue a bit further by examining fluctuations in the energy of a single container around its average energy we already know that the number of
