shown to be related to the kelvin temperature as the above expression can be rewritten as recognizing the formula for the constantvolume heat capacity allows the fractional fluctuation in the energy around the mean energy to be expressed as what does this fractional fluctuation formula tell us on its lefthand side it gives a measure of the fractional spread of energies over which each of the containers ranges about its mean energy on the right side it contains a ratio of two quantities that are extensive properties the heat capacity and the mean energy that is both and will be
