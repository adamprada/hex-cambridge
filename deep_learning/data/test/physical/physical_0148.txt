bit more detail for a system that is small but still contains quite a few particlesa cluster of ar atoms at temperature if we assume that each of the ar atoms in the cluster has of kinetic energy and that the potential energy holding the cluster together is small and constant so it cancels in will be and will be so in a nanodroplet of diameter Ã¥ with each ar atom occupying a volume of ca there will be ca ar atoms so the average fractional spread in the energy that is even for a very small nanodroplet the fluctuation
