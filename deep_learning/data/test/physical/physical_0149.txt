that we already examined which expresses the probability for finding the molecule system in its quantum state having energy sometimes this expression is written as where now the index is used to label an energy level of the system having energy and degeneracy it is important for the student to be used to either notation a level is just a collection of those states having identical energy system partition functions using this result it is possible to compute the average energy sometimes written as of the system and as we saw earlier in this chapter to show that this quantity
