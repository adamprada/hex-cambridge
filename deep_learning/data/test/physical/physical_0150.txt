the volume of the container by a small amount multiplied by the probability for accessing that quantum state summed over all such states one can show realizing that only not or depend on the volume that if you wonder why the energies should depend on the volume think of the case of gasphase molecules occupying the container of volume v you know that the translational energies of each of these molecules depend on the volume through the particleinabox formula changing can be accomplished by changing the box length this makes it clear why the energies do indeed depend on the
