in terms of derivatives of partition functions and thus as derivatives of other properties for example the fluctuation in the energy was shown above to be given by the text statistical mechanics d a mcquarrie harper and row new york has an excellent treatment of these topics and shows how all of these expressions are derived so if one were able to evaluate the partition function for molecules in a volume at a temperature t either by summing the quantumlevel degeneracy and factors or by carrying out the phasespace integral over all of the coordinates and momenta of the system
