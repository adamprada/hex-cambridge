to systems with specified volume temperature and chemical potential rather than particle number to obtain the partition function from which all thermodynamic properties are obtained in this case one considers maximizing the same function introduced earlier but now considering each quantum labeled j as having an energy that depends on the volume and on how may particles occupy this volume the variables are now used to specify how many of the containers introduced earlier contain particles and are in the quantum state these variables have to obey the same two constraints as for the canonical ensemble but they also are
