so now the probability of the system having particles and being in the quantum state is very much as was shown earlier for the canonical ensemble one can then express thermodynamic properties eg etc in terms of derivatives of the text statistical mechanics d a mcquarrie harper and row new york goes through these derivations in good detail so i will not repeat them here because we showed how to do so when treating the canonical ensemble to summarize them briefly one again uses finds that g is related to the chemical potential as and obtains the formulas look very
