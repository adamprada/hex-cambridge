using for states of a system having specified and or using for the grand canonical case of any quantity is equal to the longtime average of this quantity ie the value one would obtain by monitoring the dynamical evolution of this quantity over a very long time this second postulate implies that the dynamics of an isolated system spends equal amounts of time in every quantum state that has the specified and this is known as the ergodic hypothesis lets consider a bit more what the physical meaning or information content of partition functions is canonical ensemble partition functions represent
