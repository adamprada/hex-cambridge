the boltzmann population not of a given energy but of a specified amount of free energy for the microcanonical ensemble the probability of occupying each state that has the specified values of and is equal where is the total number of such states in the microcanonical ensemble case plays the role that plays in the canonical ensemble case it gives the number of quantum states accessible to the system individualmolecule partition functions keep in mind that the energy levels and degeneracies and discussed so far are those of the full molecule system in the special case for which the interactions
