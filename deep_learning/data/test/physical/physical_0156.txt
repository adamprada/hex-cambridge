state and is the partition function of an individual molecule here is the energy of the lth level of the molecule and is its degeneracy the molecular partition functions in turn can be written as products of translational rotational vibrational and electronic partition functions if the molecular energies can be approximated as sums of such energies of course these approximations are most appropriate to gasphase molecules whose vibration and rotation states are being described at the lowest level the following equations give explicit expressions for these individual contributions to in the most usual case of a nonlinear polyatomic molecule translational
