we encountered these statedensity issues in chapter rotational where and are the three principal moments of inertia of the molecule ie eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor is the symmetry number of the molecule defined as the number of ways the molecule can be rotated into a configuration that is indistinguishable from its original configuration for example is for or for for and for the magnitudes of these partition functions can be computed using bond lengths in Ã¥ and masses in amu and in using vibrational where is the frequency of the harmonic vibration of the molecule of which
