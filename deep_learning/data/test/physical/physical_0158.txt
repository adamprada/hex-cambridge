of the ground electronic state and is the energy required to dissociate the molecule into its constituent atoms all in their ground electronic states notice that the magnitude of the translational partition function is much larger than that of the rotational partition function which in turn is larger than that of the vibrational function moreover note that the dimensional translational partition function is larger than the dimensional which is larger than the dimensional these orderings are simply reflections of the average number of quantum states that are accessible to the respective degrees of freedom at the temperature which in turn
