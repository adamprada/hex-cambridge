following classical phasespace integral phase space is the collection of coordinates and conjugate momenta as we discussed in chapter in this integral one integrates over the internal eg bond lengths and angles orientational and translational coordinates and momenta of the molecules if each molecule has internal coordinates translational coordinates and orientational coordinates the total number of such coordinates per molecule is one can then compute all thermodynamic properties of the system using this in place of the quantum in the equations given above for etc the classical partition functions discussed above are especially useful when substantial intermolecular interactions are present
