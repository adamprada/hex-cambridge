as follows the factor would be the partition function if the hamiltonian contained no intermolecular interactions the factor arises from the integration over all of the translational coordinates if is absent the other factor contains all the effects of intermolecular interactions and reduces to unity if the potential vanishes if as the example considered here assumes only depends on the positions of the centers of mass of the molecules ie not on molecular orientations or internal geometries the partition function can be written in terms of the molecular translational rotational and vibrational partition functions shown earlier because all of the
