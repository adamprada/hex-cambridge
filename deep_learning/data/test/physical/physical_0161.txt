thermodynamics arises in the relation giving the equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction or for a physical transformation eg adsorption of molecules onto a metal surface or sublimation of molecules from a crystal in terms of molecular partition functions specifically for any chemical or physical equilibrium eg the former could be the equilibrium the latter could be one can relate the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of numbers of molecules per unit volume or per unit area depending on whether species undergo translational motion in or dimensions in terms of the partition functions of these molecules for example in the
