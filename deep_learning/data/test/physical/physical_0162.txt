of these moleculelevel properties notice that the above equilibrium constant expressions equate ratios of species concentrations in numbers of molecules per unit volume to ratios of corresponding partition functions per unit volume because partition functions are a count of the number of quantum states available to the system ie the average density of quantum states this means that we equate species number densities to quantum state densities when we use the above expressions for the equilibrium constant in other words statistical mechanics produces equilibrium constants related to numbers of molecules ie number densities not molar or molal concentrations contributors and
