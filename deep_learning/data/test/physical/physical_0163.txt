a solution with the largest mole fraction solute any component of a solution that is not the solvent solutions can exist in solid alloys of metals are an example of solidphase solutions liquid or gaseous aerosols are examples of gasphase solutions forms for the most part this discussion will focus on liquidphase solutions freezing point depression in general and as will be discussed in chapter in more detail a liquid will freeze when as such the freezing point of the solvent in a solution will be affected by anything that changes the chemical potential of the solvent as it turns
