that in the case of the solvent freezing is the enthalpy of the pure solvent in solid form and is the enthalpy of the solvent in the liquid solution so equation refbigeq then becomes or separating the variables puts the equation into an integrable form inttot dfracdelta hfusrt dt int d ln chia labelint where is the freezing point of the pure solvent and is the temperature at which the solvent will begin to solidify in the solution after integration of equation refint dfracdelta hfusr left dfract dfracto right ln chia labelint this can be simplified further by noting that
