for the solvent gives the magnitude of the reduction of freezing point for the solution since and are properties of the solvent the freezing point depression property is independent of the solute and is a property based solely on the nature of the solvent further since was introduced as it represents the sum of the mole fractions of all solutes present in the solution it is important to keep in mind that for a real solution freezing of the solvent changes the composition of the solution by decreasing the mole fraction of the solvent and increasing that of the solute
