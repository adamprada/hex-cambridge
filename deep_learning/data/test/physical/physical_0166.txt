increase in the boiling point can be expressed as where is called the ebullioscopic constant and like the cryoscopic constant is a property of the solvent that is independent of the solute or solutes a very elegant derivation of the form of the models for freezing point depression and boiling point elevation has been shared by f e schubert schubert cryoscopic and ebullioscopic constants are generally tabulated using molality as the unit of solute concentration rather than mole fraction in this form the equation for calculating the magnitude of the freezing point decrease or the boiling point increase is or
