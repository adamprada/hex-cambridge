number for moles of solute the ratio of mass to moles yields the final answer vapor pressure lowering for much the same reason as the lowering of freezing points and the elevation of boiling points for solvents into which a solute has been introduced the vapor pressure of a volatile solvent will be decreased due to the introduction of a solute the magnitude of this decrease can be quantified by examining the effect the solute has on the chemical potential of the solvent in order to establish equilibrium between the solvent in the solution and the solvent in the vapor
