law a more formal derivation would use the fugacities of the vapor phases but would look essentially the same also as in the case of freezing point depression and boiling point elevations this derivation did not rely on the nature of the solute however unlike freezing point depression and boiling point elevation this derivation did not rely on the solute being dilute so the result should apply the entire range of concentrations of the solution example consider a mixture of two volatile liquids a and b the vapor pressure of pure a is torr at some temperature and that of
