through a semipermeable membrane a membrane through which solvent can pass but not solute from an area of low solute concentration to a region of high solute concentration the osmotic pressure is the pressure that when exerted on the region of high solute concentration will halt the process of osmosis the nature of osmosis and the magnitude of the osmotic pressure can be understood by examining the chemical potential of a pure solvent and that of the solvent in a solution the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution before any extra pressure is applied is given by and
