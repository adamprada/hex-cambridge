the pressure dependence of the chemical potential is needed in addition to understanding the effect the solute has on lowering the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution the magnitude therefore of the increase in chemical potential due to the application of excess pressure p must be equal to the magnitude of the reduction of chemical potential by the reduced mole fraction of the solvent in the solution we already know that the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution is reduced by an amount given by and the increase in chemical potential due to the application of
