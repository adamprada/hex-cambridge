write a simplified version of the expression which can be used in the case of very dilute solutions when a pressure exceeding the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution can be made to exceed that of the pure solvent on the other side of the membrane causing reverse osmosis to occur this is a very effective method for example for recovering pure water from a mixture such as a saltwater solution contributors and attributions patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay collisions between gas
