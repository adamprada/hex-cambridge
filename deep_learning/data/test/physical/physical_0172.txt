molecules collide with one another we turn now to some of these properties for these considerations we need to describe the motion of one molecule relative to another we need the probability density function for the relative velocity of two particles to describe the relative velocity of two particles we introduce relative velocity coordinates let us begin by considering a cartesian coordinate frame with and zaxes whose origin is at a point we will use to designate this set of axes we specify the location of particle by the vector and that of particle by we let the location of
