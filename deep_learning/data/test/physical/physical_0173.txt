transform the locations as specified by and to the same locations as specified by and and vice versa to accomplish this we write the equation defining the component of the center of mass which we rearrange to corresponding relationships can be written for the and components it proves to be useful to introduce the reduced mass defined by using the reduced mass we can express the coordinates of the center of mass in terms of the coordinates of the individual particles that is since by definition we also have we have developed the transformation from and to and the inverse
