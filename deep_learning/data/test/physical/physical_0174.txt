particularly useful for analyzing interactions between colliding particles figure the particleone centered frame for our purposes a third cartesian coordinate frame which we will denote the frame is more useful it is sketched in figure the and axes of are parallel to the corresponding axes of but their origin is always at the point occupied by particle in this reference frame the coordinates of particles and are and the coordinates of the center of mass are the frame is sometimes called the center of mass frame also to avoid confusion we call the particleone centered frame in the particleone centered
