the same information as the vectors and the vectors and contain the same information as and since a parallel displacement leaves a vector unchanged each of these vectors is the same in any of the three reference frames in we find the probability density function for the magnitude of the scalar relative velocity since the probability is independent of direction the probability that two molecules have relative velocity is the same as that they have relative velocity in spherical coordinates if then the probability and magnitude of the relative velocity are independent of which particleif eitherwe choose to view as
