we find where since we have while we have the frequency of collisions between molecules of the same substance becomes the mean time between collisions is and the mean free path when we consider the rate of collisions between all of the molecules of type in a container there is a minor complication if we multiply the collision frequency per molecule by the number of molecules available to undergo such collisions we count each collision twice because each such collision involves two type molecules to find the collision rate among like molecules we must divide this product by that is
