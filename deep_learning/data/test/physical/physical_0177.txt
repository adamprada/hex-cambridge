to first define the conditions under which collisions will occur for convenience consider all of the molecules to be spherical and in fixed in position except for one which is allowed to move through a sea of other molecules a molecular collision will occur every time the center of the moving molecule comes within one molecular diameter of the center of another molecule one can easily determine the number of molecules the moving molecule will hit by determining the number of molecules that lie within the collision cylinder because we fixed the positions of all but one of the molecules
