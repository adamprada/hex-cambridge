given by perhaps a more useful value is the mean free path which is the distance a molecule can travel on average before it collides with another molecule this is easily derived from the collision frequency how far something can travel between collisions is given by the ratio of how fast it is traveling and how often it hits other molecules thus the mean free path is given by the mere fact that molecules undergo collisions represents a deviation from the kinetic molecular theory for example if molecules were infinitesimally small then the mean free path would be infinitely long
