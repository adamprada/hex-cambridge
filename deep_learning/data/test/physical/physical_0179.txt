and attributions modeling the dependence of the gibbs and helmholtz functions behave with varying temperature pressure and volume is fundamentally useful but in order to do that a little bit more development is necessary to see the power and utility of these functions it is useful to combine the first and second laws into a single mathematical statement in order to do that one notes that since for a reversible change it follows that and since for a reversible expansion in which only pv works is done it also follows that since this is an extraordinarily powerful result this differential
