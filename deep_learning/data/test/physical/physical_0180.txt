see that or this is an example of a maxwell relation these are very powerful relationship that allows one to substitute partial derivatives when one is more convenient perhaps it can be expressed entirely in terms of andor for example a similar result can be derived based on the definition of differentiating and using the chain rule on yields making the substitution using the combined first and second laws for a reversible change involving on expansion pv work this expression can be simplified by canceling the terms and much as in the case of internal energy this suggests that the
