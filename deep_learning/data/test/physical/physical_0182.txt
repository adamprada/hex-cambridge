and while its component lies between and and its component lies between and becomes we found the same result in section of course we can find the probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity by eliminating the dependence on the angular components to do this we need only sum up at a given value of the contributions from all possible values of and recalling that and this sum is just since and we again obtain the maxwellboltzmann probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity unlike the distribution function for the cartesian components of velocity the maxwellboltzmann distribution for scalar velocities is not
