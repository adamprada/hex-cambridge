as is needed for a process without changing temperature as such it is oftentimes a very good approximation to consider the changes to the surroundings as happening isothermally even though it may not be the case for the system which is generally smaller example consider g mol of ice melting at k in a room that is k calculate ds for the ice the surrounding room and of the universe dhfus kjmol solution for the process under constant pressure for the ice for the room for the universe note is positive which is characteristic of a spontaneous change example a
