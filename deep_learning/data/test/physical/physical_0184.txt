it follows that a bit of algebra determines the final temperature to be to get the entropy changes use the expression so for the water and for the metal beginalign delta smetal gjg c ln left dfrackk right pt jk endalign for the system beginaligndelta ssys delta swater delta smetal pt jk jk jk endalign note the total entropy change is positive suggesting that this will be a spontaneous process this should make some sense since one expects heat to flow from the hot metal to the cool water rather than the other way around also note that the sign
