its volume will respond to changes in temperature again gases respond profoundly to changes in temperature think charles law whereas solids and liquid will have more modest but not negligible responses to changes in temperature for example if mercury or alcohol didnt expand with increasing temperature we wouldnt be able to use those substances in thermometers the definition of the isobaric thermal expansivity or sometimes called the expansion coefficient is as was the case with the compressibility factor the term is needed to make the property intensive and thus able to be tabulated in a useful fashion in the case
