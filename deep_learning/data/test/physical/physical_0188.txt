equation refeq if the system undergoes a change following a pathway where is held constant this expression simplifies to and so for changes for which this reciprocal rule is very convenient in the manipulation of partial derivatives but it can also be derived in a straightforward albeit less rigorous manner begin by writing the total differential for equation refeq now divide both sides by and constrain to constant noting that and equation refeq becomes or this formal method of partial derivative manipulation is convenient and useful although it is not mathematically rigorous however it does work for the kind of
