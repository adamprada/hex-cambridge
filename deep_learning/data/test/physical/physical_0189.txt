by writing the total differential of now divide both sides by and constrain to constant note that and equation refeq becomes which is easily rearranged to this type of transformation is very convenient and will be used often in the manipulation of partial derivatives in thermodynamics example expanding thermodynamic functions derive an expression for in terms of derivatives of thermodynamic functions using the definitions in equations refcompress and refexpand solution substituting equations refcompress and refexpand into the equation refe simplifying canceling the terms and using transformation type i to invert the partial derivative in the denominator yields applying transformation type
