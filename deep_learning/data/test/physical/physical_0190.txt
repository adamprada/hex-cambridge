and we will refer to the envelope function as the probability density function the probability density function is the derivative with respect to the random variable of the cumulative distribution function this is an immediate consequence of the fundamental theorem of calculus if is the antiderivative of a function we have and the fundamental theorem of calculus asserts that the area under from to is in the present instance so that and the envelope function and are the same function this point is also apparent if we consider the incremental change in the area under a histogram as the variable
