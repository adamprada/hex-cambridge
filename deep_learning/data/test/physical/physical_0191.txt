density that varies from point to point in the space the mass enclosed in any particular volume is given by the integral of the density function over the volume enclosed that is conversely the density at any given point is the limit as the enclosing volume shrinks to zero of the enclosed mass divided by the magnitude of the enclosing volume similarly for any value of the random variable the probability density is the limit as an interval spanning the value of the random variable shrinks to zero of the probability that the random variable is in the interval divided
