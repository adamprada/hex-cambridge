is as shown in figure a cooling curve for a sample that begins at the temperature and composition given by point a is shown in figure figure a cooling of a twocomponent system from liquid to solid b cooresponding cooling curve for this process as the sample cools from point a the temperature will decrease at a rate determined by the sample composition and the geometry of the experiment for example one expects more rapid cooling is the sample has more surface area exposed to the cooler surroundings and the temperature difference between the sample and the surroundings when the
