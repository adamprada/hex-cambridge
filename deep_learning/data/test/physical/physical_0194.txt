removed and increasing the total chemical potential of the phase into which the material is being deposited so for each pair of phases present and the following must be true gibbs phase rule the gibbs phase rule describes the number of compositional and phase variables that can be varied freely for a system at equilibrium for each phase present in a system the mole fraction of all but one component can be varied independently however the relationship places a constraint on the last mole fraction as such there are compositional degrees of freedom for each phase present where is the
