equation refphase is the gibbs phase rule example show that the maximum number of phases that can coexist at equilibrium for a single component system is solution the maximum number of components will occur when the number of degrees of freedom is zero beginalign p pt p endalign note this shows that there can never be a quadruple point for a single component system because a system at its triple point has no degrees of freedom the triple point makes a very convenient physical condition at which to define a temperature for example the international practical temperature scale of ipt
