in the single determinant model last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack simonsprofessor emeritus and henry eyring scientist chemistry at university of utah electron correlationessential configuration interaction to achieve reasonable chemical accuracy eg kcalmole in eas or ips or bond energies in electronic structure calculations one can not describe the wavefunction in terms of a single determinant the reason such a wavefunction is inadequate is because the spatial probability density functions are not correlated this means the probability of finding one electron at position r is independent of where the other electrons are which is absurd because
