of the probability density for finding one electron at r times the density of finding another electron at clearly has no correlation in it that is the probability of finding one electron at r does not depend on where the other electron is this product form for is a direct result of the singledeterminant form for y so this form must be wrong if electron correlation is to be accounted for electron correlation now we need to ask how should be written if electron correlation effects are to be taken into account as we now demonstrate it turns out that
