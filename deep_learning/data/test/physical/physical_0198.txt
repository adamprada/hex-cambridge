it it allows one to interpret the combination of two determinants that differ from one another by a double promotion from one orbital to another as equivalent to a singlet coupling ie having spin function of two different orbitals and that comprise what are called polarized orbital pairs in the simplest embodiment of such a configuration interaction ci description of electron correlation each electron pair in the atom or molecule is correlated by mixing in a configuration state function csf in which that electron pair is doubly excited to a correlating orbital a csf is the minimum combination of determinants
