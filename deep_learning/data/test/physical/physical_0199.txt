overall symmetry in this case and give rise to angular correlation of the electron pair such a pair of polarized orbitals is shown in figure figure angularly polarized orbital pairs more specifically the following four determinants are found to have the largest amplitudes in for be the fact that the latter three terms possess the same amplitude is a result of the requirement that a state of symmetry is desired it can be shown that this function is equivalent to psi cong frac c salphasbeta sapxalphasapxbeta sapxbetasapxalpha sapyalphasapybeta sapybetasapyalpha sapzalphasapzbeta sapzbetasapzalpha where here two electrons occupy the orbital with opposite
