with large ratios polarized orbital pairs iilater in this chapter you will learn how to evaluate hamiltonian matrix elements between pairs of antisymmetric wavefunctions if you are anxious to learn this now go to the subsection entitled the slatercondon rules and read that before returning here in each of the three equivalent terms in the alkaline earth wavefunction one of the valence electrons moves in a orbital polarized in one direction while the other valence electron moves in the orbital polarized in the opposite direction for example the first term describes one electron occupying a polarized orbital while the other
