triplet by applying to the triplet in each case the spin quantum number its zaxis projection and the quantum number are given in the conventional term symbol notation as the distance between the x and y fragments is changed from near its equilibrium value of and approaches infinity the energies of the and orbitals vary in a manner well known to chemists as depicted in figure if x and y are identical figure orbital correlation diagram showing two type orbitals combining to form a bonding and an antibonding molecular orbital if x and y are not identical the and orbitals
