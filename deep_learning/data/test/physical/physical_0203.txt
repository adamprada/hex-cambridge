energy ordering for the determinants that is appropriate to the region it is useful to express each such function in terms of the fragment orbitals and that comprise and to do so the lcaomo expressions for and and are substituted into the slater determinant definitions given above here and are the normalization constants the parameter is in the homonuclear case and deviates from in relation to the and orbital energy difference if lies below then if lies above let us examine the case to keep the analysis as simple as possible the process of substituting the above expressions for and
