more spinorbitals are identical vanishes the result of decomposing the mobased determinants into their fragmentorbital components is as follows these decompositions of the six valence determinants into fragmentorbital or valence bond components allow the energies of these states to specified for example the fact that both and contain ionic and covalent structures implies that as both of their energies will approach the average of the covalent and ionic atomic energies the energy approaches the purely ionic value as the energies of and all approach the purely covalent value as the behaviors of the energies of the six valence determinants as
