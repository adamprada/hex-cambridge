essential configuration interaction occurs specifically for the example the and determinants undergo essential ci coupling to form a pair of states of symmetry the csf cannot partake in this ci mixing because it is of ungerade symmetry the states can not mix because they are of triplet spin symmetry the ci mixing of the and determinants is described in terms of a x secular problem leftbeginarraycc langle sigma h sigma rangle langle sigma h sigma rangle langle sigma h sigma rangle langle sigma h sigma rangle endarrayright leftbeginarraycabendarrayright eleftbeginarraycabendarrayright the diagonal entries are the determinants energies depicted in figure the
