change in when the system pressure is equal to the applied pressure and both are constant when these conditions are satisfied we usually denote the heat accepted by the system as if all of the work is pressurevolume work we have if these conditions are satisfied the enthalpy change is the same thing as the heat added to the system when we want to express the requirement that the system and applied pressures are equal and constant we often just say that the process occurs at a constant pressure this is another convenient figure of speech it also reflects our
