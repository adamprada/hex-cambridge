overall process described by the sum of the chemical reactions this amounts to saying that heat is a state function as it stands this is a contradiction the resolution is of course that hesss law was formulated for a series of chemical reactions that occur at the same constant pressure then the heat involved in each step is the enthalpy change for that step and since enthalpy is a state function there is no contradiction modern statements of hesss law frequently forego historical accuracy in favor of scientific accuracy to assert that the enthalpy change for a series of reactions
