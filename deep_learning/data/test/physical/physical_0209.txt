to define enthalpy we use the energy and entropy functions to define two more state functions that also prove to have useful properties these are the helmholtz and gibbs free energies the helmholtz free energy is usually given the symbol and the gibbs free energy is usually given the symbol we define them by and note that and all have the units of energy the sense of the name free energy is that a constanttemperature process in which a system experiences an entropy increase is one in which the systems ability to do work in the surroundings is increased by
