california state university east bay contributors and attributions reactions such as the one in the previous example involve the dissociation of a molecule such reactions can be easily described in terms of the fraction of reactant molecules that actually dissociate to achieve equilibrium in a sample this fraction is called the degree of dissociation for the reaction in the previous example the degree of dissociation can be used to fill out an ice table if the reaction is started with moles of and a is the fraction of molecules that dissociate the ice table will look as follows initial change
