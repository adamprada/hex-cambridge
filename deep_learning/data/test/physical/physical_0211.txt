ice tables at the top of the page for the dissociation of beginalign kp dfrac alphaalpha ptot pt atm dfrac alphaalpha atm endalign solving for note since a represents the fraction of no molecules dissociated it must be a positive number between and example consider the gasphase reaction a reaction vessel is initially filled with mol of a and mol of b at equilibrium the vessel contains mol c and a total pressure of atm at k how many mol of a and b are present at equilibrium what is the mole fraction of a b and c at equilibrium
