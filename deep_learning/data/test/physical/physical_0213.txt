energy levels that grows with increasing and whose spacing between neighboring energy levels also grows as a result of which the state density decreases with increasing however in and dimensions the pattern of energy level spacing displays a qualitatively different character especially at high quantum number consider first the dimensional case and for simplicity lets use a box that has equal length sides in this case the total energy is times nx ny nz the latter quantity can be thought of as the square of the length of a vector having three components now think of three cartesian axes labeled
