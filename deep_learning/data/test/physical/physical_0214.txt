state density increases as increases this means that in the dimensional case the number of quantum states per unit energy grows in other words the spacing between neighboring state energies decreases very unlike the dimensioal case where the spacing between neighboring states grows as and thus grows this growth in state density in the dimensional case is a result of the degeneracies and neardegeneracies that occur for example the states with and and are degenerate and those with or or or or or are degenerate and nearly degenerate to those having quantum numbers or or in the dimensional case degeneracies
