and thus lower state density as one goes to higher energies these findings about densities of states in and dimensions are important because in various problems one encounters in studying electronic states of extended systems such as solids chains and surfaces one needs to know how the number of states available at a given total energy varies with a similar situation occurs when describing the translational states of an electron or a photo ejected from an atom or molecule into the vacuum here the dimensional density of states applies clearly the state density depends upon the dimensionality of the problem
