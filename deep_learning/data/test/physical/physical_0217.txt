electrons are highly delocalized eg metallic clusters and conjugated organics for example for electrons residing on the surface of any of the three graphene tubes shown in figure b one expects quantum states i labeled with an angular momentum quantum number and characterizing the electrons angular motions about the long axis of the tube but also ii labeled by a longaxis quantum number characterizing the electrons energy component along the tubes long axis for a threedimensional tubeshaped nanoparticle composed of metallic atoms one expects the quantum states to be i labeled with an angular momentum quantum number and a radial
