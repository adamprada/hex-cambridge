this derivation assumes that gas molecules behave like point masses that do not interact with one another the pressure of the gas results from collisions of the gas molecules with the walls of the container the contribution of one collision to the force on the wall is equal to the change in the molecules momentum divided by the time between collisions the magnitude of this force depends on the molecules speed and the angle at which it strikes the wall each such collision makes a contribution to the pressure that is equal to the force divided by the area of
