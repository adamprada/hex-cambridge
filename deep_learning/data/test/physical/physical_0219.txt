experience of the collisions or each pair of opposing walls will experience of the collisions instead of averaging over all of the possible angles at which a molecule could strike a wall and all of the possible times between collisions we assume that the molecules travel at constant speed back and forth between opposite faces of the box since they are point masses they never collide with one another if we suppose that of the molecules go back and forth between each pair of opposite walls we can expect to accomplish the same kind of averaging in setting up our
