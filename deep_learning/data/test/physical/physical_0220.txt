trip the distance traversed in a round trip is the magnitude of the momentum change for a molecule in one collision is the magnitude of the force on the wall from one collision is and the pressure contribution from one collision on the wall of area is so that we have from the collision of one molecule with one wall if the number of molecules in the box is of them make collisions with this wall so that the total pressure on one wall attributable to all molecules in the box is or since the ideal gas equation can be
