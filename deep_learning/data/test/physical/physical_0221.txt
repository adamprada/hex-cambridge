have a simple mechanical model that explains boyles law as the logical consequence of pointmass molecules colliding with the walls of their container by combining this result with the ideal gas equation we find that the average speed of ideal gas molecules depends only on the temperature from this we have the very important result that the translational kinetic energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature since our noninteracting pointmass molecules have no potential energy arising from their interactions with one another their translational kinetic energy is the whole of their energy because two such molecules neither attract
