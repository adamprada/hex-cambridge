on temperature however the molar energy of such a gas is greater than because of the energy associated with these additional motions we make extensive use of the conclusion that the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature as it turns out this conclusion follows rigorously from the second law of thermodynamics in chapter we show that for a substance that obeys the ideal gas equation at constant temperature the energy of an ideal gas is independent of the volume and independent of the pressure so long as pressure volume and temperature are the only variables needed to
