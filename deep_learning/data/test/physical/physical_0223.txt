the original experimental basis for the kinetic theory of heat among joules early experiments was an attempt to measure the heat absorbed by a gas as it expanded into an evacuated container a process known as a free expansion no absorption of heat was observed which implied that the energy of the gas was unaffected by the volume change however it is difficult to do this experiment with meaningful accuracy subsequently joule collaborated with william thomson lord kelvin on a somewhat different experimental approach to essentially the same question the joulethomson experiment provides a much more sensitive measure of the
