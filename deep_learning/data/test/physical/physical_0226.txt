a function only of it is the arbitrary constant in the integration with respect to which we carry out with held constant to complete the proof we must find a function such that this satisfies the conditions the validity of condition in equation refgrindeq follows immediately from the facts that the order of differentiation and integration can be interchanged for a continuous function and that is a function only of so that to find such that condition in equation refgrindeq is satisfied we observe that but since this becomes hence condition in equation refgrindeq is satisfied if and only if
