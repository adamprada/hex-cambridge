is approximately constant letting be the substance that is distributed we find for the distribution equilibrium the equilibrium constant where varies with temperature and pressure for example iodineiodine is slightly soluble in water and much more soluble in chloroform since water and chloroform are essentially immiscible a system containing water chloroform and iodine will contain two liquid phases if there is not enough iodine present to make a saturated solution with both liquids the system will reach equilibrium with all of the iodine dissolved in the two immiscible solvents experimentally the equilibrium concentration ratio is approximately constant whatever amounts of
