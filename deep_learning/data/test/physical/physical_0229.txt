direction in which it is moving equivalently we can say that the components of the velocity of a gas molecule are independent of one another knowing the value of one component of a molecules velocity does not enable us to infer anything about the values of the other two components when we use cartesian coordinates maxwells assumptionmaxwells assumption means also that the same mathematical model must describe the distribution of each of the velocity components since the velocity of a gas molecule has three components we must treat the velocity distribution as a function of three random variables to understand
