a table however there is no doubt that at every instant every gas molecule can be characterized by a set of such velocity components the values exist even if we cannot measure them we imagine that we have such data only as a way to clarify the properties of the distribution functions that we need table molecular velocity components molecule number v these data have several important features the scalar velocity ranges from to and range from to in we see that varies from to and ranges from to each column represents data sampled from the distribution of the corresponding
