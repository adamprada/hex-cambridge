the distribution of while redundant it is convenient to introduce additional symbols to represent these probability density functions we define and when we find these onedimensional distribution functions by modeling the experimental data in this way each datum that we use in our analysis comes from an observation on a molecule and is associated with particular and values these values of and can be anything from to this is a significant point the functions and are independent of and we can also say that describes the distribution of when and are averaged over all the values it is possible for
