that a molecule has the velocity for any velocity there is a value of this value is just a number if we want the probability of finding a velocity within some small volume of velocity space around we can find it by multiplying by this volume from the onedimensional probabilitydensity functions the probability that the component of a molecular velocity lies between and is just whatever the values of and the probability that the component lies between and is just whatever the values of and the probability that the component lies between and is just whatever the values of and
