independently of and then from maxwells assumption that the three onedimensional probabilities are independent we find alternatively we could take maxwells assumption to be that the threedimensional probability density function is expressible as a product of three onedimensional probability densities in this case the relationships of and to the onedimensional cumulative probabilities etc must be deduced from the properties of as emphasized above our deduction of from experimental data uses values that are associated with all possible values of and that is what we determine in our hypothetical experiment is from which it follows that figure the differential volume element
