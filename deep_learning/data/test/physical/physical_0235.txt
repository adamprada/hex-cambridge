the same pressure and the same temperature since the change is reversible the interior pressure is arbitrarily close to the pressure applied to the system by the surroundings if the reversibly changing system can exchange heat with its surroundings the temperature of the surroundings is arbitrarily close to the temperature of the system if a process takes place in a system that cannot exchange heat with its surroundings we say that the process is adiabatic we can measure the pressure temperature and volume of such a system without knowing anything about its composition for a system composed of a known
