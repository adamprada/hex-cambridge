of the pure gas specifying the pressure and temperature of this system is not sufficient to specify its state however if we specify the temperature of this system the pressure is fixed by the equilibrium condition and if we specify the volume of the system we can find how much water is in each phase from the known molar volumes of the pure substances at the system pressure and temperature for the waterwatervapor equilibrium system we can write in each of these cases we can view one of the variables as a function of the other two and represent it
