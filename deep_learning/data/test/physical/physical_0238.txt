and we consider the particular pairs of variables that can be used for now let us consider a proof of duhems theorem for a system in which the pressure temperature volume and composition can vary we consider systems in which only pressurevolume work is possible let the number of chemical species present be and the number of phases be the number of component in the phase rule and differ by the number of stoichiometric constraints that apply to the system is less the number of stoichiometric constraints we want to know how many variables can be changed independently while the
