can change we require only that any change be reversible and a reversible process can change the number of phases for example reversible vaporization can convert a twophase system to a gaseous onephase system we want to impose a change on an initial state of a closed system this initial state is an equilibrium state and we want to impose a change that produces a new gibbsian equilibrium state of the same system this means that the change we impose can neither eliminate an existing chemical species nor introduce a new one a given phase can appear or disappear but
