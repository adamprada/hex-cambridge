the temperature is the same in each phase there are temperature constraints the volume of each phase is determined by the pressure the temperature and the number of moles of each species present in that phase in chapter we find that the volume of a phase is given rigorously by the equation where and are the number of moles and the partial molar volume of the species in that phase the depend only on pressure temperature and composition for phases there are constraints one for the volume of each phase to completely specify the system the concentration of each species
