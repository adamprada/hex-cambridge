number of variables we find that there are independent variables for a reversible process in a closed system if all work is pressurevolume work the number of independent variables is constant it is independent of the species that are present and the number of phases it is important to appreciate that there is no conflict between duhems theorem and the phaserule conclusion that degrees of freedom are required to specify an equilibrium state of a system containing specified phases when we say that specifying some pair of variables is sufficient to specify the state of a particular closed system undergoing
