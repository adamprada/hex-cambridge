of the system is an equilibrium state to illustrate the compatibility of these ideas and the distinction between them let us consider a closed system that contains nitrogen hydrogen and ammonia gasammonia gases in the presence of a catalyst the reaction occurs for simplicity let us assume that these gases behave ideally if the gases do not behave ideally the argument remains the same but more complex equations are required to express the equilibrium constant and the system pressure as functions of the molar composition this system has two components and three degrees of freedom when we say that the
