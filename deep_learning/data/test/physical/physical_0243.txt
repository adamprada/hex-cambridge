equilibrium constant the pressure of the system can also be expressed as a function of and we have if we know the system pressure and we know that the system is at equilibrium we can solve the equations for and simultaneously to find the unknowns and from these we can calculate the molar composition of the system and the partial pressure of each of the gases we discuss idealgas equilibrium calculations in detail in chapter thus if we know that the system is at equilibrium knowledge of the pressure and temperature is sufficient to determine its composition and all of
