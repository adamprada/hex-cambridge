of the equilibrium constant we could accomplish this goal by measuring the values of several different combinations of three intensive variables a convenient combination is pressure temperature and ammonia concentration when we rearrange the equation for the system pressure to it is easy to see that knowing p t and enables us to find the volume of the system given the volume we can find the molar composition of the system and the partial pressure of each of the gases with these quantities in hand we can determine whether the equilibrium condition is satisfied electron tunneling last updated save as
