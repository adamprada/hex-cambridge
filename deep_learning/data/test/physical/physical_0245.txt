think of an electron a particle that we likely would use quantum mechanics to describe moving in a direction we will call under the influence of a potential that is infinite for this could for example represent a region of space within a solid material where the electron experiences very repulsive interactions with other electrons constant and negative for some range of between and this could represent the attractive interaction of the electrons with those atoms or molecules in a finite region or surface of a solid constant and repulsive ie positive by an amount for another finite region from
