in the range an especially interesting class of solutions exists these socalled resonance states occur at energies that are determined by the condition that the amplitude of the wave function within the barrier ie for be large let us now turn our attention to this specific energy regime which also serves to introduce the tunneling phenomenon the piecewise solutions to the schrödinger equation appropriate to the resonance case are easily written down in terms of sin and cos or exponential functions using the following three definitions the combination of and that solve the schrödinger equation in the inner region and
