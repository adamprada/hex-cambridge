use the sin and cos functions because one of them could be thrown away since it could not meet the boundary condition of vanishing at in this large region either set is acceptable we choose to use the and set because each of these functions is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator this allows us to discuss amplitudes for electrons moving with positive momentum and with negative momentum so in this region the most general solution is psi c expikr d expikr hspacecm textfor rrm max delta le r infty there are four amplitudes and that can be expressed in
