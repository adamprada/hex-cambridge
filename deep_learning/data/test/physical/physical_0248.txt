especially instructive to consider the value of that results from solving this set of four equations in four unknowns because the modulus of this ratio provides information about the relative amount of amplitude that exists inside the barrier in the attractive region of the potential compared to that existing in the asymptotic region as incoming flux the result of solving for is to simplify this result in a manner that focuses on conditions where tunneling plays a key role in creating the resonance states it is instructive to consider this result under conditions of a high large and thick large
