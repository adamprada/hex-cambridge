not enter let alone penetrate this region so such a particle could never end up in the inner region likewise a classical particle that begins in the inner region can never penetrate the tunneling region and escape into the large region were it not for the fact that electrons obey a schr√∂dinger equation rather than newtonian dynamics tunneling would not occur and for example scanning tunneling microscopy stm which has proven to be a wonderful and powerful tool for imaging molecules on and near surfaces would not exist likewise many of the devices that appear in our modern electronic tools
