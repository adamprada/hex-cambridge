similar to the energy quantization condition that arises when bound states of a finite potential well similar to that shown above but with the barrier between and missing and with below there is however a difference in the boundstate situation two energyrelated parameters occur and in the case we are now considering is the same but k sqrtdfracmu dedelta vehbar rather than occurs so the two equations involving are not identical but they are quite similar another observation that is useful to make about the situations in which becomes very large can be made by considering the case of a
