penetrate into classically forbidden regions it showed that at certain socalled resonance energies tunneling is much more likely than at energies that are offresonance in our model problem this means that electrons impinging on the surface with resonance kinetic energies will have a very high probability of tunneling to produce an electron that is highly localized ie trapped in the region likewise it means that an electron prepared eg perhaps by photoexcitation from a lowerenergy electronic state within the region will remain trapped in this region for a long time ie will have a low probability of tunneling outward in
