that is trapped will not escape quickly whenever one has a barrier on a potential energy surface at energies above the dissociation asymptote but below the top of the barrier here one can expect resonance states to occur at special scattering energies as we illustrated with the model problem these socalled resonance energies can often be approximated by the boundstate energies of a potential that is identical to the potential of interest in the inner region but that extends to infinity beyond the top of the barrier ie beyond the barrier it does not fall back to values below the
