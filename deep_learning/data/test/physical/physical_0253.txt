to dissociation is determined by the rate of tunneling through the barrier figure radial potential for nonrotating molecule and for rotating molecule in this case one speaks of rotational predissociation of the molecule the lifetime t can be estimated by computing the frequency n at which flux that exists inside strikes the barrier at nu frachbar kmu rrm max hspacecm rm sec and then multiplying by the probability that flux tunnels through the barrier from to the result is that tau frachbar kmu rrm max expkappadelta with the energy entering into and being determined by the resonance condition kappasinkrrm maxkcoskrrm
