the underlying neutral molecules dipole quadrupole and induced electrostatic moments as well as a centrifugal potential of the form whose magnitude depends on the angular character of the orbital the extra electron occupies when combined the above attractive and centrifugal potentials produce an effective radial potential of the form shown in figure for the case in which the added electron occupies the orbital which has character when viewed from the center of the nn bond again tunneling through the barrier in this potential determines the lifetimes of such shape resonance states figure effective radial potential for the excess electron in
