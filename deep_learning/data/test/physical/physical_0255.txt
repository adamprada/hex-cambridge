curvature along s is negative while all other curvatures are positive and all forces vanish onward to product materials where again all curvatures are positive and all forces vanish a prototypical trace of the energy variation along such a reaction coordinate is in figure figure energy profile along a reaction path showing the barrier through which tunneling may occur near the transition state at the top of the barrier on this surface tunneling through the barrier plays an important role if the masses of the particles moving in this region are sufficiently light specifically if or atoms are involved in
