the enthalpy function is useful in chemistry is that many processes are carried out at conditions constant pressure only work where the enthalpy change is synonymous with the heat exchanged the heat exchanged in a process is frequently an important consideration if we want to carry out an endothermic process we must provide means to add sufficient heat if we want to carry out an exothermic process we may have to make special arrangements to safely transfer the heat evolved from the system to its surroundings one of our principal objectives is to predict whether a given process can occur
