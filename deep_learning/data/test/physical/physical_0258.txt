in addition to learning that the efficiency of a carnot engine depends only on the high and low temperatures more interesting things can be derived through the exploration of this system for example consider the total heat transferred in the cycle making the substitution the total heat flow can be seen to be given by it is clear that the two terms do not have the same magnitude unless this is sufficient to show that is not a state function since its net change around a closed cycle is not zero as any value of a state function must be
