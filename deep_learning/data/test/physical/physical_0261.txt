are what make the entropy function useful if we can calculate for a prospective process we know whether the system is at equilibrium with respect to that process whether the process is possible or whether the process cannot occur if we find for a process we can conclude that the process is possible however we cannot conclude that the process will occur indeed many processes can occur spontaneously but do not do so for example hydrocarbons can react spontaneously with oxygen most do so only at elevated temperatures or in the presence of a catalyst the criteria are completely general
