reversible process the changes that occur in the system are imposed by the surroundings reversible change occurs only because the system responds to changes in the conditions imposed on it by its surroundings a reversible process is driven by the surroundings in contrast a spontaneous process is driven by the system nevertheless when a spontaneous process occurs under some specific set of imposed conditions specific values of the temperature and pressure for example the systems equilibrium state depends on these conditions to specify a particular spontaneous change we must specify enough constraints to fix the final state of the system
