systems and values do not necessarily attain the imposed values and become constant until equilibrium is reached an example is in order a system whose original pressure and temperature are and can undergo a spontaneous change while the surroundings impose a constant pressure and the system is immersed in constant temperature bath at the pressure and temperature of the system may be indeterminate as the process occurs but the equilibrium pressure and temperature must be and if the surroundings operate to impose particular values of and on the system then the position at which the system eventually reaches equilibrium is
