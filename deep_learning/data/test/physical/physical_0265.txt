system may not have a meaningful value on the other hand we can always carry out the process so that the temperature of the surroundings is known at every point in the process indeed if the system is in thermal contact with its surroundings as the process occurs we cannot specify the conditions under which the process occurs without specifying the temperature of the surroundings along this path figure describes a spontaneous process whose path can be specified by the values of thermodynamic variable and the temperature of the surroundings as a function of time let us denote the curve
