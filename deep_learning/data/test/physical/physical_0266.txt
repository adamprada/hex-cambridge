such a way that the change in the surroundings occurs reversibly then and since it follows that this is the clausius inequality it plays a central role in the thermodynamics of spontaneous processes when we make the intervals arbitrarily short we have to demonstrate that we can measure the entropy change in the surroundings during a spontaneous process let us use a conceptual device to transfer the heat that must be exchanged from the surroundings at temperature to the system as sketched in figure we imagine a very small reversible idealgas carnot engine whose hightemperature reservoir is also very small
