operate the carnot engine for a large integral number of cycles such that and do so at a rate that just matches the rate at which heat passes from the hightemperature reservoir to the system when the system passes from pathsegment to pathsegment we alter the steps in the reversible carnot cycle to maintain the hightemperature reservoir at the new surroundings temperature the lowtemperature heat reservoir for this carnot engine is always at the constant temperature let the heat delivered from the hightemperature reservoir to the carnot engine within be we have let the heat delivered from the lowtemperature reservoir
