reservoir is zero no change occurs in the hightemperature reservoir we have the reversible carnot engine completes an integral number of cycles so that the low temperature reservoir accepts heat at the fixed temperature during the reversible operation of the carnot engine so that the entropy change in the surroundings as the system passes through is so that as we observed above since can be any part of path c and can be made arbitrarily short we have for every increment of any spontaneous process occurring in a closed system that can exchange heat with its surroundings and if the
