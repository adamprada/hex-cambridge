of science mathematics no headers in section we consider the entropy changes in a system and its surroundings when the process is reversible we consider now the diametrically opposite situation in which an isolated system undergoes a spontaneous change from the entropybased statement of the second law we know how the entropy of this system and its surroundings change since the system is isolated no change occurs in the surroundings thus and since we have let us attempt to develop these conclusions from the machinebased statement of the second law since the process occurs irreversibly we cannot use the heat
