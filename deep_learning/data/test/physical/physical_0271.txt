b occurs irreversibly and therefore it does not necessarily correspond to a path that we can specify on this diagram the dashed line drawn for this transition is supposed to remind us of this fact we can readily devise a reversible path from b back to a first we reversibly and adiabatically return the temperature of the system to its original value in this step the system does work on the surroundings or vice versa the system reaches point c on the diagram then we reversibly and isothermally add or remove heat from the system to return to the original
