reversible process therefore it must be an equilibrium state we bridge this contradiction by refining our definition of the initial state the final state a is an equilibrium state with welldefined state functions what we have in mind is that these final equilibriumstate values also characterize the initial nonequilibrium state evidently the initial state a that we have in mind is a hypothetical state this hypothetical state approximates the state of a real system that undergoes spontaneous change by invoking this hypothetical initial state we eliminate the contradiction between our descriptions of initial state a and final state a given
