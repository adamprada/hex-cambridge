a partition the real gas of a pure substance occupies the space on one side of the partition the space on the other side of the partition is evacuated we suppose that this vessel is isolated the real gas is at equilibrium we can measure its state functions including its pressure volume and temperature now suppose that we puncture the partition as soon as we do so the gas expands spontaneously to fill the entire vessel reaching a new equilibrium position at a new pressure volume and temperature the gas undergoes a free expansion as defined in section at the
