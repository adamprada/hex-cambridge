of the initial state returning to the general cycle depicted in figure we see that there are some important conditions on the heat and work terms in the individual steps since the system is isolated while it undergoes the transition from a to b it exchanges no heat or work with the surroundings in this step for the reversible adiabatic transition from b to c in every incremental part of the path the transition from c to a occurs reversibly and isothermally letting the heat of this step be the entropy changes for these reversible steps are from the defining
