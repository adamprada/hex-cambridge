remains constant at throughout the process the heat extracted by the system is converted entirely into work this result contradicts the machinebased statement of the second law hence is false it follows that and that for the entropy change in the spontaneous process in the isolated system we have now we introduce the premise that if this is true the entropy change in the spontaneous process in the isolated system becomes the converse is also true that is implies that the premise that is independent of the machinebased statement of the second law which requires only that as we just
