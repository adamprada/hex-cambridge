system can be taken from state a to state b by the reversible process a above we see that if we have in we introduce duhems theorem which asserts that two thermodynamic variables are sufficient to specify the state of a closed reversible system in which only pressurevolume work is possible we gave a proof of duhems theorem when the two variables are chosen from among the pressure temperature and composition variables that describe the system we avoided specifying whether other pairs of variables can be used if we assume now that specifying the variables energy and entropy is always
