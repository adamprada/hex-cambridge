for which the machinebased statement of the second law would be violated for every incremental part of any spontaneous change in any isolated system we have and these are pivotally important results we explore their ramifications below before doing so however let us again consider a system in which only pressurevolume work is possible there is an alternative way to express the idea that such a system is isolated since an isolated system cannot interact with its surroundings in any way it cannot exchange energy with its surroundings its energy must be constant since it cannot exchange pressurevolume work its
