on the ball would be the same however the forces would be fixed and we would say that the ball is at equilibrium we can further illustrate this distinction by returning to the waterwatervapor system if an unchanging waterwatervapor mixture is enclosed in a container whose dimensions are fixed like a sealed glass bulb we say that the system is at equilibrium if a piston encloses the same collection of matter and the surroundings apply a force on the piston that balances the pressure exerted by the mixture we can say that the system is changing reversibly in section we
