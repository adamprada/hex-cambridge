involving chemical reactions share important characteristics with phase and distribution equilibria in chapter we develop the equilibrium constant expression from ideas about reaction rates for the present comparison let us consider the equilibrium between the gases nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide suppose that we trap a quantity of pure in a cylinder closed with a piston if we fix the temperature and volume of this system the dissociation reaction occurs until equilibrium is achieved at some system pressure for present purposes let us assume that both and behave as ideal gases the equilibrium system pressure will be equal to the
