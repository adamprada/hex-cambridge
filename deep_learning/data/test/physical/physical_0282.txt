value the position of the chemical equilibrium will change at the new equilibrium position the new and partial pressures will satisfy the total pressure relationship when we repeat this experiment we find that whatever the total pressure the equilibrium partial pressures are related to one another as sketched in figure figure equilibrium compositions for dissociation at a fixed temperature we find that the experimental data fit the equation where is the equilibrium constant for the reaction pressure is a measure of gas concentration later we see that the equilibrium constant can be expressed more rigorously as a ratio of fugacitiesor
