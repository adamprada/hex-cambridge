we are calling classical thermodynamics is often called equilibrium thermodynamics or reversible thermodynamics as we discuss further in chapter any change that we can actually observe in a real system must be the result of a spontaneous process in a reversible process both the initial and the final states are equilibrium states in a spontaneous process the initial state of the system is not an equilibrium state a spontaneous process begins with the system in a nonequilibrium state and proceeds until an equilibrium state is reached the domain of classical thermodynamicsreversible processesis distinct from the domain of real observations because
