can be very good for other nonequilibrium states notably those whose individual phases are markedly inhomogeneous these approximations may be very poor equilibrium and reversibility phase equilibria last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers to review the general characteristics of phase equilibria let us consider a familiar system suppose that we have a transparent but very strong cylinder sealed with a frictionless piston within which we have trapped a quantity of pure liquid water at some high pressure we can fix the pressure of the liquid
