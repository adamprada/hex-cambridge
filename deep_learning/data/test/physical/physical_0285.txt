impose still further volume increases the pressure of the system remains constant additional liquid passes from the liquid to the gas phase and we find that we must supply substantial amounts of heat in order to keep the temperature of the system constant if we continue to force volume increases in this manner vaporization continues until all of the liquid evaporates if we impose a decrease in the volume of the twophase system we see the process reverse the pressure of the system remains constant some of the gas condenses to liquid and the system gives up heat to the
