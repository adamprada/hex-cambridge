decrease at the equilibrium temperature and pressure changing the imposed volume by an arbitrarily small amount from to is sufficient to reverse the direction of the change that occurs in the system we call any process whose direction can be reversed by an arbitrarily small change in a thermodynamic state function a reversible process evidently there is a close connection between reversible processes and equilibrium states if a process is to occur reversibly the system must pass continuously from one equilibrium state to another in this description the reversible constanttemperature vaporization of water is driven by arbitrarily small volume changes
