process occurs while the system pressure and the applied pressure are equal literally of course there can be no change when these pressures are equal to cause water to vaporize at a constant temperature and pressure we must add heat energy to the system this heat is called the latent heat of vaporization or the enthalpy of vaporization and it must be supplied from some entity in the surroundings when water vapor condenses this latent heat must be removed from the system and taken up by the surroundings the enthalpy change for vaporizing one mole of a substance is usually
