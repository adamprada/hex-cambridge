a final state where and are the initial numbers of moles of liquid and gas respectively and is the incremental number of moles vaporized the initial pressure and temperature are the same as the final pressure and temperature effecting this change requires that a quantity of heat be added to the system without changing the temperature of the system this introduces another requirement that a reversible process must satisfy if the reversibly vaporizing water is to take up an arbitrarily small amount of heat the system must be in contact with surroundings that are hotter than the system the temperature
