the reversible process occurs while the system temperature and the surroundings temperature are equal if we repeat the waterincylinder experiment with the temperature held constant at a slightly different value we get similar results there is again a pressure at which the process of converting liquid to vapor is at equilibrium at this temperature and pressure both liquid and gaseous water can be present in the system and so long as no heat is added or removed from the system the amount of each remains constant when we hold the pressure of the system constant at the equilibrium value and
