a smooth curve which is sketched in figure this curve represents the combinations of pressure and temperature at which liquid water and gaseous water are in equilibrium figure water liquidvapor equilibrium below an equilibrium system containing only liquid and gaseous water cannot exist at high pressures a twophase equilibrium system contains solid and liquid at sufficiently low pressures it contains solid and gas above the distinction between liquid and gaseous water vanishes the water exists as a single dense phase this is the critical temperature above the critical temperature there is a single fluid phase at any pressure if we
