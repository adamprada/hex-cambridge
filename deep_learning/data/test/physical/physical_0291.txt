continuous line of pressuretemperature points that are liquidice equilibrium points figure the phase diagram for water note that the ordinate values for the solid liquid and liquid gas equilibria are severely compressed as sketched in figure the liquidice equilibrium line intersects the liquidvapor equilibrium line at this intersection liquid water ice and water vapor are all in equilibrium with one another there is only one such point it is called the triple point of water the ice point or melting point of water is the temperature at which solid and liquid water are in equilibrium at one atmosphere in the
