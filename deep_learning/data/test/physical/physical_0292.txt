the enthalpy of fusion for one mole of a substance is usually denoted it varies slightly with temperature and pressure tables usually give experimental values of the equilibrium melting temperature at a pressure of bar or atm then they give the enthalpy of fusion at this temperature and pressure at low pressures and temperatures ice is in equilibrium with gaseous water a continuous line of pressuretemperature points represents the conditions under which the system contains only ice and water vapor as the temperature increases the icevapor equilibrium line ends at the triple point the conversion of a solid directly into
