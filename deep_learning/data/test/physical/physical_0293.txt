differential over very short paths like paths a and b in section let us evaluate the integral between and over the paths a and b sketched in figure figure alternative paths from to path a has two linear segments the first segment is the portion of the line as goes from to along the first segment the second segment is the portion of the line as goes from to along the second segment path b has two linear segments also the first segment is the portion of the line as goes from to along the first segment the second segment
