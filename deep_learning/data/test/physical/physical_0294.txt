mixed second partial derivative of is independent of the order of differentiation we also write these second partial derivatives as and to summarize these points if is a continuous function of and all of the following are true represents a surface in a threedimensional space is a state function the total differential is the total differential is exact the line integral of between two points is independent of the path of integration the line integral of around any closed path is zero the mixed secondpartial derivatives are equal that is experimental determination of rate laws last updated save as pdf
