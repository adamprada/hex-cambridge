is consistent with this concentrationversustime data if the reaction is the only process that affects direct measurement of the reaction rate can be effected by measuring over a short time interval in which the concentrations and do not change appreciably this is often difficult to implement experimentally primarily because it is difficult to measure small values of with the necessary accuracy at known values of and method of initial rates the method of initial rates is an experimentally simple method in which the reaction rate is measured directly initialrate measurements are extensively used in the study of enzymecatalyzed reactions direct
