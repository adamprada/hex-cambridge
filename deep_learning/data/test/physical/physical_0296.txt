experiment the data from such an experiment are a set of concentrations and the times at which they are measured to find the rate law corresponding to these concentrationversustime data we employ a trialanderror procedure we guess what the rate law is likely to be we then obtain a general solution for this differential equation this solution predicts the dependence of concentrations versus time as a function of one or more rate constants if we can obtain a satisfactory fit of experimental concentrationversustime data to the concentrationversustime equation predicted by the rate law we conclude that the rate law is
