firstorder rate equation can be written as which we rearrange and integrate between the limits and as to give it is easy to test whether concentration versus time data conform to the firstorder decay model if they do a plot of or versus time is a straight line for a reaction we would want to test a rate law rate of the form if the initial concentration of is zero and at any time the rate law can be written as and rearranged and integrated as to give or if concentrationversustime data conform to this secondorder rate law a plot
