a way that makes it more convenient to test experimentally in the case we are considering we can often arrange to carry out the reaction with the initial concentration of much greater than the initial concentration of then the change that occurs in the concentration of during the reaction has much less effect on the reaction rate than the change that occurs in the concentration of in the rate equation it becomes a good approximation to let at all times for a fuller consideration of this point see problem the secondorder rate equation simplifies to where since the simplified rate
