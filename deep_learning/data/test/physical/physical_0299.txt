plot is the secondorder rate constant flooding works by simplifying the rate law that is observed in a given experiment similar simplification can be achieved by designing the experiment so that the initial concentrations of two or more reactants are proportional to their stoichiometric coefficients for the reaction and the expected rate law we would initiate the experiment with equal concentration of reactants and letting and the concentrations of and at longer times become the rate law becomes effectively second order experimental probes of electronic structure last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack simonsprofessor emeritus and henry
