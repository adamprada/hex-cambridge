such transitions occur the initial and final states generally differ in their electronic vibrational and rotational energies because any change to the electrons orbital occupancy will induce changes in the bornoppenheimer energy surface which in turn governs the vibrational and rotational character excitations of innershell and core orbital electrons may require even higher energy photons as would excitations that eject an electron the interpretation of all such spectroscopic data relies heavily on theory as this section is designed to illustrate the electronic transition dipole and use of point group symmetry the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with a molecules electrons and
