electronic ye a vibrational and a rotational function we realize that the electronic integral appearing in this rate expression involves a transition dipole matrix element between the initial and final electronic wave functions this element is a function of the internal vibrational coordinates of the molecule and is a vector locked to the molecules internal axis frame molecular pointgroup symmetry can often be used to determine whether a particular transitions dipole matrix element will vanish and as a result the electronic transition will be forbidden and thus predicted to have zero intensity if the direct product of the symmetries of
