is of symmetry and the orbital is of symmetry so the slater determinant in which both the and orbitals are singly occupied has its symmetry dictated by the direct product which is figure electronic transition from the nonbonding orbital to the antibonding orbital of formaldehyde the transition thus involves ground and excited states whose direct product is of symmetry this transition thus requires that the electric dipole operator possess a component of symmetry a glance at the point groups character table shows that the molecular axis is of symmetry thus if the lights electric field has a nonzero component along
