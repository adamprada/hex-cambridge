such experiments can be used to infer the symmetries of the electronic states and hence of the orbitals occupied in these states it is in this manner that this kind of experiment probes electronic structures the franckcondon factors beyond such electronic symmetry analysis it is also possible to derive vibrational selection rules for electronic transitions that are allowed it is conventional to expand the transition dipole matrix element in a power series about the equilibrium geometry of the initial electronic state since this geometry is characteristic of the molecular structure prior to photon absorption and because the photon absorption takes
