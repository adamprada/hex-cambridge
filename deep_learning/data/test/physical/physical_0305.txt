to higher values the energy spacing between the states evf evf decreases this of course reflects the anharmonicity in the excitedstate vibrational potential for the above example the transition to the state has the largest franckcondon factor this means that the overlap of the initial states vibrational wave function is largest for the final states function with as a qualitative rule of thumb the larger the geometry difference between the initial and final state potentials the broader will be the franckcondon profile as shown in figure and the larger the value for which this profile peaks differences in harmonic frequencies
