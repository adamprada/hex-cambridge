other nearby molecules this of course is especially true in condensedphase experiments these collisions cause the excited molecule to lose some of its vibrational and rotational energy thereby relaxing it to lower levels on the excited electronic surface this relaxation process is illustrated in figure figure absorption followed by relaxation to lower vibrational levels of the upper state subsequently the electronically excited molecule can undergo photon emission also called fluorescence to return to its ground electronic state as shown in figure figure fluorescence from lower levels of the upper surface the franckcondon principle discussed earlier also governs the relative intensities
