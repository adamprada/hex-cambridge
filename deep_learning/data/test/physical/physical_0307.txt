the ground state to various levels of the upper state these relationships are shown in figure figure absorption to high states on the upper surface relaxation and emission from lower states of the upper surface the second difference relates to the spacings among the vibrational lines in emission these spacings reflect the energy spacings between vibrational levels of the ground state whereas in absorption they reflect spacings between vibrational levels of the upper state the above examples illustrate how vibrationallyresolved visibleuv absorption and emission spectra can be used to gain valuable information about athe vibrational energy level spacings of the
