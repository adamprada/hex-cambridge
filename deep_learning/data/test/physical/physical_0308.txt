initial and final electronicvibrationalrotational states of the molecule there are situations in which these states simply cannot be reliably known for example the higher vibrational states of a large polyatomic molecule or the states of a molecule that strongly interacts with surrounding solvent molecules are such cases in such circumstances it is possible to recast the golden rule formula into a form that is more amenable to introducing specific physical models that lead to additional insights specifically by using socalled equilibrium averaged time correlation functions it is possible to obtain rate expressions appropriate to a large number of molecules that
