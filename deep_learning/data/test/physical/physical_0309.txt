particular initial state and a specific final state is rewritten as rif fracpihbar int fomegatextbfe cdot langle phif boldsymbolmu phii rangle deltaomegafiomegadomega here the function is used to specifically enforce the resonance condition which states that the photons frequency must be resonant with the transition frequency the following integral identity can be used to replace the function by a form that is more amenable to further development then the statetostate rate of transition becomes if this expression is then multiplied by the equilibrium probability that the molecule is found in the state and summed over all such initial states and
