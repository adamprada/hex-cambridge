dependence has been reduce to that of an equilibrium averaged ie as reflected in the sumi rhoi langle phii phiirangle expression time correlation function involving the component of the dipole operator along the external electric field at and this component at a different time if is positive ie in the photon absorption case the above expression will yield a nonzero contribution when multiplied by and integrated over positive values if is negative as for stimulated photon emission this expression will contribute when multiplied by for negative values in the latter situation is the equilibrium probability of finding the molecule in
