be reasonable albeit challenging to model the systems time evolution prof eric heller at harvard has pioneered the use of timedomain methods for treating molecular spectroscopy his web site offers access to further information and insight into this subject it turns out that a very wide variety of spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties eg light scattering intensities diffusion coefficients and thermal conductivity can be expressed in terms of molecular time correlation functions the text statistical mechanics d a mcquarrie harper and row new york has a good treatment of many of these cases lets now examine how such time evolution issues
