phijrangle langle chiiv chifvrangle here is the rotational partition function i being the molecules moment of inertia and being the molecules rotational energy for the state with quantum number and degeneracy is the vibrational partition function being the vibrational frequency is the degeneracy of the initial electronic state is the translational partition function for the molecules of mass moving in volume and is the adiabatic electronic energy spacing the origins of such partition functions are treated in chapter of this text the functions describe the time evolution of the electronic transition dipole vector for the rotational state in a freerotation
