the former function peaks are predicted to occur at and in the latter at omega omegafviv omegaj with the intensities governed by the time independent factors in the corresponding expressions for in experimental measurements such sharp function peaks are of course not observed even when very narrow bandwidth laser light sources are used ie for which is an extremely narrowly peaked function spectral lines are found to possess finite widths let us now discuss several sources of line broadening some of which will relate to deviations from the unhindered rotational motion model introduced above a doppler broadening in the above
