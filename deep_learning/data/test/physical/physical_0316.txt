by relative movement of the light source and the molecule as follows here is the frequency of the unmoving light source seen by unmoving molecules is the velocity of relative motion of the light source and molecules is the speed of light and wobserved is the dopplershifted frequency ie the frequency seen by the molecules the second identity is obtained by expanding in a power series the factor and is valid in truncated form when the molecules are moving with speeds significantly below the speed of light for all of the cases considered earlier a function is subjected to fourier
