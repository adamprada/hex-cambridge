equilibrium this average is characterized by the wellknown maxwellboltzmann velocity distribution here is the mass of the molecules and and label the velocities along the labfixed cartesian coordinates defining the axis as the direction of propagation of the lights photons and carrying out the averaging of the doppler factor over such a velocity distribution one obtains intinftyinfty explefti t omegabigdfracvzcbigright leftfracmpi ktrightexpbiggfracm vxvyvzktbigg dvx dvy dvz expiomega tintinftyinfty leftfracmpi ktright expleftitomega dfracvzcrightexpbigdfracmvzktbigdvz this result when substituted into the expressions for yields expressions identical to those given for the three cases treated above but with one modification the translational motion average
