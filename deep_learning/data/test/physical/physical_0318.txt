such integrals can be carried out analytically and yield the result is a series of gaussian peaks in space centered at with widths determined by given the temperature and the mass of the molecules the hotter the sample the faster the molecules are moving on average and the broader is the distribution of doppler shifted frequencies experienced by these molecules the net result then of the doppler effect is to produce a line shape function that is similar to the unhindered rotation models series of functions but with each function peak broadened into a gaussian shape if spectra can be
