be probed by measuring doppler widths of absorption or emission lines arising from molecules in these gases b pressure broadening to include the effects of collisions on the rotational motion part of any of the above functions one must introduce a model for how such collisions change the dipolerelated vectors that enter into the most elementary model used to address collisions applies to gaseous samples which are assumed to undergo unhindered rotational motion until struck by another molecule at which time a kick is applied to the dipole vector and after which the molecule returns to its unhindered rotational movement
