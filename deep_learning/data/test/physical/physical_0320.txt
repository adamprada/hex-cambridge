and to decay to zero this memory point of view is based on viewing as the projection of along its value as a function of time t introducing this additional time dependence into produces when is fourier transformed to generate integrals of the form in the limit of very small doppler broadening the factor can be ignored ie set equal to unity and results this integral can be performed analytically and generates a pair of lorentzian peaks in space centered again at the full width at half height of these lorentzian peaks is one says that the individual peaks have
