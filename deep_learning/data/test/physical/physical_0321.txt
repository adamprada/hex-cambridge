gaussian and lorentzian peaks having identical widths and areas experimental measurements of line widths that allow one to extract widths originating from collisional broadening provide information through on the frequency of collisions and the strength of these collisions by determining at a series of gas densities one can separate the collisionfrequency dependence and determine the strength of the individual collisions meaning how effective each collision is in reorienting the molecules dipole vector c rotational diffusion broadening molecules in liquids and very dense gases undergo such frequent collisions with the other molecules that the mean time between collisions is short compared
