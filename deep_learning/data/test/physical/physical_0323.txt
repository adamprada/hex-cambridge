species undergoes one or more processes that depletes its numbers we say that it has a finite lifetime for example a species that undergoes unimolecular dissociation has a finite lifetime as does an excited state of a molecule that decays by spontaneous emission of a photon any process that depletes the absorbing species contributes another source of time dependence for the dipole time correlation functions discussed above this time dependence is usually modeled by appending in a multiplicative manner a factor this in turn modifies the line shape function in a manner much like that discussed when treating the rotational
