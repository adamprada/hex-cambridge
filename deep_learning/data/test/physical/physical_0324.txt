each and every molecule in the sample is affected in exactly the same manner by the broadening process for example one does not find some molecules with short lifetimes and others with long lifetimes in the heisenberg case the entire ensemble of molecules is characterized by a single lifetime in contrast doppler broadening is inhomogeneous in nature because each molecule experiences a broadening that is characteristic of its particular velocity that is the fast molecules have their lines broadened more than do the slower molecules another important example of inhomogeneous broadening is provided by socalled site broadening molecules imbedded in
