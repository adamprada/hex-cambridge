as illustrated in figure where homogeneous and inhomogeneous line shapes are compared figure illustration of homogeneous band showing absorption at several concentrations of the absorbing species left and of inhomogeneous band showing absorption at one concentration by numerous subpopulations the spectral line shape function is therefore further broadened when site inhomogeneity is present and significant these effects can be modeled by convolving the kind of function that results from doppler lifetime rotational diffusion and pressure broadening with a gaussian distribution that describes the inhomogeneous distribution of energy level splittings here is a line shape function such as those described earlier
