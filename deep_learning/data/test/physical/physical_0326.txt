the spectral line and an absorption spectrum is recorded given an absorption profile as shown in figure in the absence of the intense burning light source figure absorption profile in the absence of hole burning one expects to see a profile such as that shown in figure if inhomogeneous broadening is operative figure absorption profile with laser turned on to burn a hole the interpretation of the change in the absorption profile caused by the bright light source proceeds as follows in the ensemble of molecules contained in the sample some molecules will absorb at or near the frequency of
