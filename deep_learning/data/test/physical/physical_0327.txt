line profile until the probe light sources frequency matches upon which no absorption of the probe sources photons will be recorded because molecules that absorb in this frequency regime have had their transition saturated hence a hole will appear in the absorption spectrum recorded by the probe light sources detector in the region of unfortunately the technique of hole burning does not provide a fully reliable method for identifying inhomogeneously broadened lines if a hole is observed in such a burning experiment this provides ample evidence but if one is not seen the result is not definitive in the latter
