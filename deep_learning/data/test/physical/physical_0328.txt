light source usually a laser this sources photons when absorbed eject electrons whose intensity and kinetic energies are then measured subtracting the electrons from the photons energy gives the binding energy of the electron if the sample subjected to the pes experiment has molecules in a variety of initial states eg two electronic states or various vibrationalrotational levels of the ground electronic state having various binding energies one will observe a series of peaks corresponding to electrons ejected with a variety of kinetic energies as figure illustrates and as the energybalance condition requires the peak of electrons detected with the
