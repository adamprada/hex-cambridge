different progression of peaks in this case the electrons with highest kinetic energy arise from transitions leading to the lowestenergy state of the daughter as figure illustrates in that figure the lower energy surface belongs to the parent and the upper curve to the daughter figure photoelectron events showing detachment from one state of the parent to several states of the daughter an example of experimental photodetachment data is provided in figure showing the intensity of electrons detected when anion loses an electron vs the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons figure photoelectron spectrum of cu the peaks belong to
