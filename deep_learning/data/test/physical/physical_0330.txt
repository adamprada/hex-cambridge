this spectrum the peaks having electron binding energies near ev correspond to transitions in which groundstate in is detached to produce groundstate in various v levels the spacings between this group of peaks relate to the spacings in vibrational states of this electronic state the series of peaks with binding energies near ev correspond to transitions in which is detached to produce in its excited electronic state the spacings between peaks in this range relate to spacings in vibrational states of this state the spacing between the peaks near ev and those near ev relate to the energy difference between
