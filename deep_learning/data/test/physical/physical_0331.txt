to directly probe the orbitals of a molecule that lie in the continuum ie at energies higher than that of the parent neutral i ask that you reflect back on our discussion in chapter of tunneling and of resonance states that can occur when an electron experiences both attractive and repulsive potentials in such cases there exists a special energy at which the electron can be trapped by the attractive potential and have to tunnel through the repulsive barrier to eventually escape it is these kinds of situations that this spectroscopy probes this experiment is called electrontransmission spectroscopy ets in
