colliding electrons it is possible for an electron from the beam to be captured into such an orbital and to exist in this orbital for a considerable time of course in the absence of any collisions or other processes to carry away excess energy this anion will reemit an electron at a later time hence such anions are called metastable and their electronic states are called resonance states if the captured electron remains in this orbital for a length of time comparable to or longer than the time it takes for the nascent molecular anion to undergo vibrational or rotational
