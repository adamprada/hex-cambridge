levels of the anion in the latter one sees a reduction in the intensity of the beam that is transmitted directly through the sample and electrons that are scattered away from this direction such an ets spectrum is shown in figure for a gaseous sample of molecules in this spectrum the energy of the transmitted beams electrons is plotted on the horizontal axis and the derivative of the intensity of the transmitted beam is plotted on the vertical axis it is common to plot such derivatives in etstype experiments to allow the variation of the signal with energy to be
