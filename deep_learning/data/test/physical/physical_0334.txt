away from deg the bending allows the antibonding nature of this orbital to be reduced other examples of ets spectra are shown in figure figure ets spectra of several dna bases here again a derivative spectrum is shown and the vertical lines have been added to show where the derivative passes through zero which is where the ets absorption signal would have a peak these maxima correspond to electrons entering various virtual orbitals of the uracil and dna base molecules it is by finding these peaks in the ets spectrum that one can determine the energies of such continuum orbitals
