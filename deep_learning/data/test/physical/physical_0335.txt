and shape resonance energy levels for two values for example the orbital of shown in figure produces two counteracting contributions to the effective radial potential experienced by an electron occupying it figure antibonding orbital of showing its character first the two nitrogen centers exert attractive potentials on the electron in this orbital these attractions are strongest when the excess electron is near the nuclei but decay rapidly at larger distances because the other electrons coulomb repulsions screen the nuclear attractions secondly because the molecular orbital is comprised of atomic basis functions of etc symmetry it possesses nonzero angular momentum because
