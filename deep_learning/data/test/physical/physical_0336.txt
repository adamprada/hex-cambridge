potential is not as strong as is the case for the lesselectronegative nitrogen atoms in the energy of the orbital can lie above the asymptote in the latter cases we speak of metastable shaperesonance states they are metastable because their energies lie above the asymptote so they can decay by tunneling through the centrifugal barrier they are called shaperesonances because their metastability arises from the shape of their repulsive centrifugal barrier if one had inhand a reasonable approximation to the attractive shortrange potential and if one knew the lsymmetry of the orbital occupied by the excess electron one could form
