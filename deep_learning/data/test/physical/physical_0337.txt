that correspond to ie one varies the kinetic energy of the orbital containing the excess electron as the box size is varied one eventually notices eg by plotting the orbitals that one of the states possesses a significant amount of valence ie shortrange character that is one such state has significant amplitude not only at larger but also in the region of the two nitrogen centers it is this state that corresponds to the metastable shaperesonance state and it is the energy where significant valence components develop that provides the stabilization estimate of the state energy let us continue using
