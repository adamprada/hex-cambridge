or they could be and maybe orbitals centered at the midpoint of the nn bond one usually would not add just one such function rather several such functions each with an orbital exponent that characterizes its radial extent would be used let us assume for example that such functions have been used next using the conventional atomic orbital basis as well as the extra basis functions one carries out a calculation most often a variational calculation in which one computes many energy levels on the anion in this calculation one tabulates the energies of many say m of the electronic
