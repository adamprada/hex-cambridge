factor alphaj rightarrow eta alphaj and repeats the calculation of the energies of the m lowest energies of this scaling causes the extra basis orbitals to contract radially if or to expand radially if it is this basis orbital expansion and contraction that produces expansion and contraction of the box discussed above that is one does not employ a box directly instead one varies the radial extent of the most diffuse basis orbitals to simulate the box variation if the conventional orbital basis is adequate one finds that the extra orbitals whose exponents are being scaled do not affect appreciably
