energy of an anion state relative to the neutral molecules energy which is independent of grows with increasing h this hdependence arises from the hscaling of the extra diffuse basis orbitals because most of the amplitude of such basis orbitals lies outside the valence region the kinetic energy is the dominant contributor to such orbitals energy because enters into each orbital as and because the kinetic energy operator involves the second derivative with respect to r the kinetic energies of orbitals dominated by the diffuse basis functions vary as for small all of the diffuse basis functions have their amplitudes
