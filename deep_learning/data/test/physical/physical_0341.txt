substantial amounts of both valence and extradiffuse function character just to the left of the avoided crossing the lowerenergy state the third state for small contains predominantly extra diffuse orbital character while the higherenergy state the fourth state contains largely valence orbital character however at the special value of where these two states nearly cross the kinetic energy of the third state as well as its radial size and its de broglie wavelength are appropriate to connect properly with the fourth state by connect properly we mean that the two states have wave function amplitudes phases and slopes that match
