the magnitude of the energy splitting between the two states and the slopes of the two avoiding curves of the avoided crossings in a stabilization graph to compute the lifetimes of the metastable states basically the larger the avoided crossing energy splitting between the two states the shorter is the lifetime of the resonance state so the ets and pes experiments offer wonderful probes of the bound and continuum states of molecules and ions that tell us a lot about the electronic nature and chemical bonding of these species the theoretical study of these phenomena is complicated by the need
