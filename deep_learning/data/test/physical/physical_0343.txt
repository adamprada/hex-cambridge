one must have a means of monitoring the concentrations of reactant or product molecules as time evolves in the majority of current experiments that relate to reaction dynamics one uses some form of spectroscopic or alternative physical probe eg an electrochemical signature or a mass spectrometric detection of product ions to monitor these concentrations as functions of time of course in all such measurements one must know how the intensity of the signal detected relates to the concentration of the molecules that cause the signal for example in many absorption experiments as illustrated in figure light is passed through a
