molecules and measuring the ratio that this concentration produces in a cell of length for molecules and ions that are extremely reactive this calibration approach to determining is often not feasible because one cannot prepare a sample with a known concentration that remains constant in time long enough for the experiment to be carried out in such cases one often must resort to using the theoretical expressions given in chapter and discussed in most textbooks on molecular spectroscopy to compute in terms of the wave functions of the absorbing species in any event one must know how the strength of
