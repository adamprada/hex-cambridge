through a socalled pumpprobe experiment in which i a shortduration light pulse is used to excite reactant molecules to some specified initial state usually a tunable laser is used because its narrow frequency spread allows specific states to be pumped the time at which this pump laser thus prepares the excited reactant molecules in state defines ii after a delay time of duration t a second light source is used to probe the product molecules that have been formed in various final states often the frequency of this probe source is scanned so that one can examine populations of many
