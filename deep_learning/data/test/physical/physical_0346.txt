a function of time this kind of laser pumpprobe experiment is used not only to probe specific electronic or vibrationrotation states of the reactants and products but also when the reaction is fast ie complete in s or less in these cases one is not using the high frequency resolution of the laser but its fast time response because laser pulses of quite short duration can be generated these tools are well suited in such fast chemical reaction studies the reactions can be in the gas phase eg fast radical reactions in the atmosphere or in explosions or in solution
