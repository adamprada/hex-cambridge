can control the velocities and hence the collision energies of both reagents one can examine the product yield as a function of the angle through which the products are scattered one can probe the velocity of the products and by using spectroscopic methods one can determine the fraction of products generated in various internal electronicvibrationalrotational states such measurements allow one to gain very detailed information about how the reaction rate coefficient depends on collisional kinetic energy and where the total energy available to the products is deposited ie into product translational energy or product internal energy the angular distribution of
