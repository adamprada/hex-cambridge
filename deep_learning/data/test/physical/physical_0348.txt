occur instead the b molecules collide with a molecules in a variety of orientations and with a distribution of collision energies whose range depends on the maxwellboltzmann distribution of kinetic energies of the b molecules in the bulb the advantage of beambulb experiments is that one can achieve much higher collision densities than in crossedbeam experiments because the density of b molecules inside the bulb can be much higher than the densities achievable in a beam of b molecules there are cases in which the beambulb experiments can be used to determine how the reaction rate depends on collision energy
