collision energy in figure we illustrate the crosssection related to the bimolecular rate constant by where v is the relative collision speed for production of ions when a beam of uracil complexes having energy e the horizontal axis collides with a bulb containing xe atoms at room temperature in this case the reaction is simply the collisioninduced dissociation cid process in which the complex undergoes unimolecular decomposition after gaining internal energy in collisions with xe atoms narm uracil rightarrow na rm uracil the primary knowledge gained in this cid experiment is the threshold energy that is the minimum collision energy
