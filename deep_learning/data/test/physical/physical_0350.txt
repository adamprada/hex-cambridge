reacting species or pumpprobe techniques to generate and probe these molecules for slower chemical reactions one can use other methods for monitoring the relevant concentrations these methods include electrochemistry where the redox potential is the species signature and nmr spectroscopy where the chemical shifts of functional groups are the signatures both of whose instrumental response times are too slow for probing fast reactions in addition when the reactions under study do not proceed to completion but exist in equilibrium with a back reaction alternative approaches can be used the example discussed in chapter is one such case let us briefly
