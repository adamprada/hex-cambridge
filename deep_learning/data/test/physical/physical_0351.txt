deviations from equilibrium will return to equilibrium exponentially with an effective rate coefficient that is equal to a sum of terms so by following the concentrations of the reactants or products as they return to their equilibrium values one can extract the effective rate coefficient doing this at a variety of different initial equilibrium concentrations eg and and seeing how changes one can then determine both the forward and reverse rate constants contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and professor of chemistry u utah telluride schools on theoretical chemistry integrated by tomoyuki hayashi uc davis experimental test of
