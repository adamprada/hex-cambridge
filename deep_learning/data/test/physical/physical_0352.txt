as sketched in figure the gas is allowed to escape into a vacuum chamber through a very small hole in the side of the oven the escaping atoms impinge on one or more metal plates narrow slits cut in these plates stop any metal atoms whose flight paths do not pass though the slits this produces a beambeamof metal atoms of metal atoms whose velocity distribution is the same as that of the metalatom gas inside the oven the rate at which metal atoms arrive at a detector is measured various methods are used to translate the atomarrival rate into
