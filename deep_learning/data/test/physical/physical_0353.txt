a straight line while remaining in the middle of the groove all the way from one end of the drum to the other if the atom moves significantly faster or slower than this critical velocity it collides withand sticks toone side or the other of the groove figure device to select metal atoms having a specified velocity since the groove has a finite width atoms whose velocities lie in a narrow range about the critical velocity can traverse the groove without hitting one of the sides let us assume that the groove is cut so that the spiral travels half
