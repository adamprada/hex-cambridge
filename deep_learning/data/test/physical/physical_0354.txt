at u cyclessec the time required for the drum to make onehalf rotation is thus the atom will remain in the middle of the groove all the way through the drum if by varying the rotation rate we can vary the critical velocity because the groove has a finite width atoms whose velocities are in a range can successfully traverse the groove whether or not a particular atom can do so depends on its velocity where it enters the groove and the width of the groove let the width of the groove be and the radius of the drum be
