groove the time required for this rotation is the maximum time a particle can take to traverse the length so and a fast atom that enters the groove at the last possible momentwhen the trailing edge of the grove just leaves the beam of atomscan still traverse the groove if it does so in the time that it takes the trailing edge of the groove to travel a distance so and at a given rotation rate the drum will pass atoms whose speeds are in the range so that the fraction of the incident atoms that successfully traverse the groove
