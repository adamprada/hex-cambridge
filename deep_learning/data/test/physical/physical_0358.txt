of time so we can write separating variables to obtain and integrating between the limits at and at we obtain or comparing the two equations we have derived for continuous compounding we see that continuous compounding of interest is an example of firstorder or exponential growth other examples are found in nature the growth of bacteria normally follows such an equation reflection suggests that such behavior should not be considered remarkable it requires only that the increase per unit time in some quantity be proportional to the amount of that is already present since measures the number of items dollars
