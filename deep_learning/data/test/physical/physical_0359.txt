of the rate constant are the halflife of a chemical reaction is the time required for onehalf of the stoichiometrically possible change to occur for a firstorder decay the halflife is the time required for the concentration of the reacting species to decrease to onehalf of its value at time zero that is when the time is the concentration is substituting into the integrated rate law we find that the halflife of a firstorder decay is independent of concentration the halflife is free electron model of polyenes last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack simonsprofessor emeritus and
