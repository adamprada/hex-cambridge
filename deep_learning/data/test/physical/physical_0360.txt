electrons are reasonably well treated as moving freely rather than being tightly bound to a valence orbital on one of the constituent atoms or within chemical bonds localized to neighboring atoms free motion within a spherical volume such as we discussed in chapter gives rise to eigenfunctions that are also used in nuclear physics to describe the motions of neutrons and protons in nuclei in the socalled shell model of nuclei the neutrons and protons fill separate etc orbitals refer back to chapter to recall how these orbitals are expressed in terms of spherical bessel functions and what their energies
