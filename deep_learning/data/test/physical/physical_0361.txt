metallic nature of these species their valence electrons are essentially free to roam over the entire spherical volume of the cluster which renders this simple model rather effective in this model one thinks of each valence electron being free to roam within a sphere of radius ie having a potential that is uniform within the sphere and infinite outside the sphere the orbitals that solve the schr√∂dinger equation inside such a spherical box are not the same in their radial shapes as the etc orbitals of atoms because in atoms there is an additional attractive coulomb radial potential present in
