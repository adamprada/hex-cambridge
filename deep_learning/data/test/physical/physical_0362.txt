number of nodal surfaces the orbitals have none orbitals have one and orbitals have two analogous to how the number of nodes related to the total energy of the particle constrained to the plane the number of nodes in the angular wave functions indicates the amount of angular or orbital rotational energy orbitals of shape have no angular energy those of shape have less then do orbitals etc it turns out that the pattern of energy levels derived from this particleinasphericalbox model can offer reasonably accurate descriptions of what is observed experimentally in particular when a cluster or cluster ion
