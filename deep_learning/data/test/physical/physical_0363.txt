and with the energies of the orbitals given above in terms of the zeros of the spherical bessel functions spectral features of the nanoclusters are then determined by the energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital and can be tuned by changing the radius of the cluster or the charge ie number of electrons of the cluster another very useful application of the model problems treated in chapter is the onedimensional particleinabox which provides a qualitatively correct picture for electron motion along the orbitals of delocalized polyenes the one cartesian dimension corresponds to motion along the delocalized
