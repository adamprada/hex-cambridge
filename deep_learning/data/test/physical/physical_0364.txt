radical the ground electronic state would be represented by a total wave function consisting of a product in which the lowest four s are doubly occupied and the fifth is singly occupied the component spin angular momentum states of the electrons are labeled and as discussed earlier we write the total wave function above as a product wave function because the total hamiltonian involves the kinetic plus potential energies of nine electrons to the extent that this total energy can be represented as the sum of nine separate energies one for each electron the hamiltonian allows a separation of variables
