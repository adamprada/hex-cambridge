products of solutions to the two lowest excited states would correspond to states of the form and where the spinorbitals orbitals multiplied by or appearing in the above products depend on the coordinates of the various electrons for example denotes the electronic excitation energies from the ground state to each of the above excited states within this model would be deltae dfrac pi hbarm left dfracl dfraclright taga and it turns out that this simple model of electron energies provides a qualitatively correct picture of such excitation energies its simplicity allows one for example to easily suggest how a molecules
