to chemists as most of chemistry occurs at constant pressure for geologists however who are interested in processes that occur at very high pressures say under the weight of an entire mountain and expansion is not a possibility the constant volume expression of equation refchem may be of greater interest all of the above arguments can be made for systems in which the temperature is not constant by considering infinitesimal changes the resulting expressions are and the gibbs and helmholtz functions equation refchem suggests a very convenient thermodynamic function to help keep track of both the effects of entropy and
