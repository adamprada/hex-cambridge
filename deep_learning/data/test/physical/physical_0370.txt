favorable and proceeds with an increase in entropy also favorable due to the formation of fragments in the liquid phase more chaotic from a very ordered solid more ordered the second reaction is endothermic unfavorable but proceeds with an increase in entropy favorable so so long as the temperature is high enough the entropy term will overwhelm the enthalpy term and cause the process to be spontaneous the conditions for spontaneous processes at constant temperature and pressure can be summarized in table table spontaneity conditions for a process under constant temperature and pressure spontaneous at high t at no t
