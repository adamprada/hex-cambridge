in the case of enthalpy and unlike entropy free energy functions do not have an unambiguous zero to the energy scale so just like in the case of enthalpies of formation by convention the standard free energy of formation for elements in their standard states is defined as zero this allows for two important things to happen first can be measured and tabulated for any substance in principle at least is determined to be for the reaction that forms one mole of a compound from elements in their standard states similarly to how is defined secondly tabulated can be used
