the adiabatic expansion of a real gas against a constant applied pressurea process known as a joulethomson expansion we find that we must introduce a new parameterthe joulethomson coefficientin order to describe the behavior of a real gas in a free expansion the joulethomson coefficient varies with pressure and temperature literally an isothermal process is one in which the temperature of the system remains the same throughout the process however we often use the term to mean merely that the process occurs while the system is in thermal contact with constanttemperature surroundings the free expansion of a gas is an
