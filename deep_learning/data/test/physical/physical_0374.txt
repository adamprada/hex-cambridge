pressurevolume work is possible and the applied pressure is zero we have and where and are the temperatures of the substance before and after the expansion respectively at ordinary temperatures changes only slowly as the temperature changes over a short temperature range it is usually a good approximation to assume that is constant we have one mole of any gas or other substance for a monatomic ideal gas the energy change is exactly one mole of a monatomic ideal gas the enthalpy change for any process is if the system is one mole of an ideal gas we have because
