the pertinent time independent schrödinger equation is the task at hand is to solve the above eigenvalue equation to determine the allowed energy states for this electron because there are no terms in this equation that couple motion in the and directions eg no terms of the form or or separation of variables can be used to write as a product substitution of this form into the schrödinger equation followed by collecting together all dependent and all ydependent terms gives since the first term contains no dependence and the second contains no dependence and because the right side of the
