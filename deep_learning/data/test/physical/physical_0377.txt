conditions not the schr√∂dinger equation determine whether the eigenvalues will be discrete or continuous if the electron is entirely unconstrained within the plane the energies and can assume any values this means that the experimenter can inject the electron onto the plane with any total energy and any components and along the two axes as long as in such a situation one speaks of the energies along both coordinates as being in the continuum or not quantized in contrast if the electron is constrained to remain within a fixed area in the plane eg a rectangular or circular region then
