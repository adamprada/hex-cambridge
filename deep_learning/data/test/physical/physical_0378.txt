on metal surfaces this case could then represent a simple model of socalled corrals in which the particle is constrained to a finite region of space for example if motion is constrained to take place within a rectangular region defined by then the continuity property that all wave functions must obey because of their interpretation as probability densities which must be continuous causes to vanish at and at that is because must vanish for and must vanish for and because is continuous it must vanish at and at likewise must vanish at and at to implement these constraints for one
