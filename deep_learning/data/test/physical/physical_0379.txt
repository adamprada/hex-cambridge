is therefore unacceptable because it represents zero probability density at all points in space one concludes that the energies and can assume only values that obey or and and it is important to stress that it is the imposition of boundary conditions expressing the fact that the electron is spatially constrained that gives rise to quantized energies in the absence of spatial confinement or with confinement only at or or only at or quantized energies would not be realized in this example confinement of the electron to a finite interval along both the and coordinates yields energies that are quantized
