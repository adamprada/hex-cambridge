a situation that is especially interesting in this case one has two degenerate states one with the strong bond having high internal energy and the weak bond having low energy and a second with the strong bond having little energy and the weak bond having more than enough energy to rupture it although an experiment may prepare the molecule in a state that contains only the former component ie with coupling between the two degenerate functions induced by terms in the hamiltonian h that have been ignored in defining and can cause the true wave function to acquire a component
