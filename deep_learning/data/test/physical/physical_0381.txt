guarantee that is normalized normalization allows to be properly identified as a probability density for finding the electron at a point shown in figure are plots of four such two dimensional wave functions for and values of and respectively figure plots of the and wave functions note that the functions vanish on the boundaries of the box and notice how the number of nodes ie zeroes encountered as the wave function oscillates from positive to negative is related to the and quantum numbers and to the energy this pattern of more nodes signifying higher energy is one that we encounter
