numbers are not constant for large and ny values the quantum plots will again via the quantumclassical correspondence principle approach the constant classical form except near the classical turning points ie near the edges of the twodimensional box if instead of being confined to a rectangular corral the electron were constrained to lie within a circle of radius r the schrödinger equation is more favorably expressed in polar coordinates transforming the partial derivatives appearing in the schrödinger equation into polar coordinates and realizing that the potential depends on but not on gives again using separation of variables to substitute into
