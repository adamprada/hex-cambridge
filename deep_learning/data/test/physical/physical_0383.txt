the equation obeyed by socalled bessel functions the bessel functions labeled obey so our function is the full wave functions are then where is a normalization constant the energy eigenvalues cannot be expressed analytically as in the particleina box system where we used knowledge of the zeros of the sin function to determine however knowing that must vanish at we can use tables for example see kreyszig e advanced engineering mathematics th ed john wiley and sons inc new york that give the values of at which vanishes to determine the set of eigenvalues associated with each value of the
