are doubly degenerate the only difference between such pairs of states is the sense of the angular momentum terms these energy levels depend on both the angular momentum quantum number as well as the radial quantum number and they depend upon much like the particleinabox energies depend on the box length in figure a we show plots of the probability densities for and and for and to illustrate how the number of radial nodes increases as increases figure a plots of for top middle and bottom taken from ellison m d j chem educ the character of also changes with
