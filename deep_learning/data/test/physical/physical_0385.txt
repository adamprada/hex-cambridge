remain within a sphere of radius r we replace the three cartesian coordinates and by the spherical coordinates and doing so changes the schrödinger equations kinetic energy terms into what we show below taking the potential to be a constant for and infinite for we can again use separation of variables to progress in solving this three dimensional differential equation we substitute into the schrödinger equation and taking into account that the socalled spherical harmonic functions obey the following this reduces the schrödinger equation to an equation for the radial function again this equation is probably not familiar to you
