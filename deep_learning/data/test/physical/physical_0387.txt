if instead of being constrained to move within a circle of radius r the particle were constrained to move on the surface of the circle the twodimensional schr√∂dinger equation treated earlier would reduce to the solutions are the familiar functions with and the energies are note that the quantization of energy arises because the angular momentum is quantized to be this condition arose in turn by the condition that as with the case of a particle moving within the circular region the states with are doubly degenerate the difference between pairs of such states reflecting the sense of their angular
