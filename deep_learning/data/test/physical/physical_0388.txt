its wave function was forced to vanish at two locations and that quantized energy levels result when the particle is not so spatially trapped its energy will not be quantized you will see this behavior over and over as we explore other models for electronic vibrational and rotational motions in molecules quantized action can also be used to derive energy levels there is another approach that can be used to find energy levels and is especially straightforward to use for systems whose schr√∂dinger equations are separable the socalled classical action denoted of a particle moving with momentum p along a
