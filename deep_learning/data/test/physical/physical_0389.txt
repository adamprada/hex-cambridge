and will show how to apply the idea for systems for which the hamiltonian is separable the action integral decomposes into a sum of such integrals one for each degree of freedom in the twodimensional example the additivity of h means that and can be independently solved for in terms of the potentials and as well as the energies and associated with each separate degree of freedom the signs on and must be chosen to properly reflect the motion that the particle is actually undergoing at any instant of time substituting these expressions into the action integral yields the relationship
