to the socalled harmonic oscillator problem this serves as the simplest reasonable model for vibration of a diatomic molecule ab that we will study in quantum form later one expresses the total energy as the sum of kinetic and potential energies where is the reduced mass of the ab diatomic molecule is the force constant describing the bond between a and b is the bondlength displacement and p is the momentum associated with the bond length the quantized action requirement then reads this integral is carried out between and the left and right turning points of the oscillatory motion and
