momentum associated with rotation and is the reduced mass of the ab molecule solving for and inserting this into the actionquantization equation appropriate for motion along a closed loop gives solving for the energy then gives which is exactly the same result as we obtained earlier when solving the schr√∂dinger equation for the motion of a particle moving on a circle now lets apply action quantization to each of the independent coordinates of the twodimensional particle in a box problem the two separate action quantization conditions read notice that the sign of the momenta are positive in each of the
