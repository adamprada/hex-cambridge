quantized energy levels that arose when the wave function boundary conditions were matched at and in the schr√∂dinger equation approach the energy expressions did not have the factor that appears in the above actionbased result it turns out that for potentials that are defined in a piecewise manner as the particleinabox potential is ie the potential undergoes an infinite jump at and the action quantization condition has to be modified an example of how and why one has to make this modification is given in a paper from prof bill millers group j e adams and w h miller j
