tool it has allowed scientists to make great progress toward bridging the gap between classical and quantum descriptions of molecular dynamics in particular by using classical concepts such as trajectories and then imposing quantizedaction conditions people have been able to develop socalled semiclassical models of molecular dynamics in such models one is able to retain a great deal of classical understanding while building in quantum effects such as energy quantization zeropoint energies and interferences both at my theory page web site and from papers accessed on the web site of professor william h miller one of the pioneers of semiclassical
