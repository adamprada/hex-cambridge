eigenvalues the quantum mechanics angular momentum operator as we showed earlier this operator when computed as the component of can be written in polar coordinates as the eigenfunctions of this operator have the form and the eigenvalues are a h because geometries with azimuthal angles equal to or equal to are exactly the same geometries the function should be exactly the same as this can only be the case if a is an integer thus one concludes that only integral multiples of h can be allowed values of the component of angular momentum experimentally one measures the component of an
