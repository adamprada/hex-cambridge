because l is an integer is an odd integer both of these observations are consistent with the expectation that only integer values can occur for eigenvalues as obtained from action quantization and from the boundary condition however it has been observed that some species do not possess or or or component states but an even number of such states in particular electrons protons or neutrons are observed to have only two component eigenvalues this also is observed in for example the boron atom mentioned above if one examines the further splittings of the m and levels caused by the magnetic
