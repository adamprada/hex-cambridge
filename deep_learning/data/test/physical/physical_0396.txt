how can halfinteger angular momenta exist involves realizing that some angular momenta correspond not to the angular momenta of a physical mass rotating but instead are intrinsic properties of certain particles that is the intrinsic angular momenta of electrons protons and neutrons can not be viewed as arising from rotation of some mass that comprises these particles instead such intrinsic angular momenta are fundamental built in characteristics of these particles for example the two and angular momentum states of an electron usually denoted a and b respectively are two internal states of the electron that are degenerate in the absence
