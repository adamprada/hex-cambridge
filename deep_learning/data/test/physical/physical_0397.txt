momenta cannot and should not be described in terms of spinning masses action can also be used to generate wave functions action integrals computed from classical descriptions of motion on potential energy surfaces can also be used to generate approximate quantum wave functions so doing offers yet another avenue for making connection between the classical and quantum worlds to see how such a connection can arise directly from the schrödinger equation we begin with the timeindependent schrödinger equation for a single particle of mass moving on a potential that depends on the particles position coordinates then we express the complex
