this quantum mechanics equation to a classical result in which so substituting into the above equation for and gathering together all terms of a given power in produces equations for the various the first two of which read and to simplify further discussion of this socalled semiclassical wave function theory let us restrict attention to the case in which there is only one spatial coordinate for the two or threedimensional cases and are vector quantities and the solution of these equations is considerably more complicated especially if the potential can not be separated into additive contributions from each of the
