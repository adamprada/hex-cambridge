that the wave functions in the classically allowed regions have probability densities given by which is exactly the classical probability density we discussed earlier in this chapter the probability is inversely proportional to the speed of the particle at location r and has the same singularity as the classical probability at turning points where in contrast the probability densities in regions where either grow or decay exponentially within these classically forbidden regions lets see how these semiclassical wave functions can be applied to some of the model problems we discussed earlier for the one dimensional particleinabox problem the two exponentially
