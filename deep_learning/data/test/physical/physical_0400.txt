means that these energies are exactly the same as we found when we solved the schr√∂dinger equation for this model problem it is informative to note that these semiclassical wave functions which are not exact because they were obtained by retaining only terms up to the first power of were able to generate quantum nodal patterns ie interferences and quantized energy levels even though they contained classical concepts such as the momentum at various positions in space it was by superimposing two functions having the same energy that nodal patterns were obtained lets now consider what happens when we apply
