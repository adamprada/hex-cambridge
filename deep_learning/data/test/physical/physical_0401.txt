energy must be determined by i normalizing the total wave function to obey and by matching the wave functions and and their first derivatives at and the wave functions and and their first derivatives at before addressing how this wave function matching might be accomplished let me point out an interesting property of the factor entering into the exponential of the semiclassical wave function we first use the two expressions and given above for the first two components of and then make use of the harmonic form of next we evaluate the integral of for a closed classical path in
