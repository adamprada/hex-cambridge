the integral from to of this quantity can be carried out using the substitution as the evaluation of the integral remaining on the righthand side can be done using contour integration undergraduate students may not have encountered this subject within complex variable theory i refer them to pp methods of theoretical physics p m morse and h feshabach mcgrawhill new york or p applied complex variables j w dettman macmillan co new york the basic equation from contour integration says that an integral of the form where is a singularity is equal to our integral has singularities at and at
