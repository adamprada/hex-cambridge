be viewed as arising from the first quantum correction ie the term first order in to the semiclassical wave function recall that equating this classical action integral to gave the correct ie quantum energies for this harmonic oscillator problem we have seen how a semiclassical wave function can be defined what its spatial probability density is how it can build in interference to achieve proper nodal patterns and how quantizing its action can give the correct allowed energy levels however there is one issue we have not fully addressed to solve for the coefficients multiplying the semiclassical wave functions in
