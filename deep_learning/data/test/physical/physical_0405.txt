our discussion of the properties of a gas has implicitly assumed that the gas is pure we turn our attention now to mixtures of gasesgas samples that contain molecules of more than one compound mixtures of gases are common and it is important to understand their behavior in terms of the properties of the individual gases that make it up the idealgas laws we have for mixtures are approximations fortunately these approximations are often very good when we think about it this is not surprising after all the distinguishing feature of a gas is that its molecules do not interact
