ambiguity about what we mean by the pressure volume and temperature of the mixture we can measure these properties without difficulty given the nature of temperature it is both reasonable and unambiguous to say that the temperature of the sample and the temperature of its components are the same however we cannot measure the pressure or volume of an individual component in the mixture if we hope to describe the properties of the mixture in terms of properties of the components we must first define some related quantities that we can measure the concepts of a component partial pressure and
