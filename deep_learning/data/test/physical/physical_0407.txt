mixture as the volume occupied by the same number of moles of the pure component when the pressure is the same as the pressure of the mixture at the temperature of the mixture in a mixture of components etc it is customary to designate the partial volume of component as the partial volume of a real gas can only be determined by experiment daltons law of partial pressures asserts that the pressure of a mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of its components that is for a mixture of components a b c etc the pressure
