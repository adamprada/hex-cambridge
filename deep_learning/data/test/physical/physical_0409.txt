independent variables are sufficient to specify the state of an equilibrium system then specify an incrementally different equilibrium state of the same system this means that the number of degrees of freedom is also the number of intensive variables that can be varied independently while the system changes reversiblysubject to the condition that there is no change in either the number or kinds of phases present moreover if we keep the systems intensive variables constant we can change the size of any phase without changing the nature of the system this means that gibbs phase rule applies to any equilibrium
