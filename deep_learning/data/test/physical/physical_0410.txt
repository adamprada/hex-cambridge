prepare a system in such a way that it contains an arbitrary amount of each phase is not affected by phase equilibria however the number of componentsnumber of components is affected by chemical equilibria and by any other stoichiometric constraints that we impose on the system the number of components is equal to the number of chemical substances present in the system less the number of stoichiometric relationship among these substances let us consider an aqueous system containing dissolved acetic acid ethanol and ethyl acetate for this system to be at equilibrium the esterification reaction must be at equilibrium in
