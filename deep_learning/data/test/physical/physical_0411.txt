is the only way that the equalconcentration condition can be met exactly in this example there are four chemical substances the esterification reaction places one stoichiometric constraint on the amounts of these substances that can be present at equilibrium which means that we can change only three concentrations independently the existence of this constraint reduces the number of components from four to three an additional stipulation that the product concentrations be equal is a second stoichiometric constraint that reduces the number of independent components to two if we have a onephase system at equilibrium we see that the pressure the
