the number of intensive variables that are required to describe completely a system that contains components and phases if the phases are not at equilibrium with one another remember that the description we seek is complete except for a specification of the absolute amount of each phase present for the characterization of equilibrium that we seek these amounts are arbitrary in this case each phase is a subsystem in its own right each phase can have a pressure a temperature and a concentration for each component each of these properties can have a value that is independent of its value
