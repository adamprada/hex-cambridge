that etc there are only independent equations that relate these pressures to one another the temperature must be the same in each phase as for the pressure there are independent relationships among the temperature values the concentration of species in phase must be in equilibrium with the concentration of species in phase and so forth we can write an equation for phase equilibrium involving the concentration of in any two phases for example in chapter we will find that this requirement can be stated more rigorously using a thermodynamic function that we call the chemical potential at equilibrium the chemical
