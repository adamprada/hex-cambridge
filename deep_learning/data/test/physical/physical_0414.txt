on for each of the phases there are such relationships that are independent of one another if we subtract from the total number of relevant relationships the number of independent relationships that must be satisfied at equilibrium we find gibbs phase rule there are independent relationships or degrees of freedom needed to describe the equilibrium system containing components and phases a component may not be present in some particular phase if this is the case the total number of relationships is one less than the number that we used above to derive the phase rule the number of equilibrium constraints
