gas inside of a balloon over time the rate at which gases will effuse from a balloon is affected by a number of factors but one of the most important is the frequency with which molecules collide with the interior surface of the balloon since this is a function of the average molecular speed it has an inverse dependence on the square root of the molecular weight this can be used to compare the relative rates of effusion for gases of different molar masses the knudsen cell experiment a knudsen cell is a chamber in which a thermalized sample of
