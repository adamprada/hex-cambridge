effusion through the orifice will be proportional to the vapor pressure of the substance the vapor pressure can be related to the mass lost by the expression where is the mass lost is the area of the orifice is the time the effusion is allowed to proceed is the temperature and is the molar mass of the compound in the vapor phase the pressure is then given by a schematic of what a knudsen cell might look like is given below contributor patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay heat capacities for gases cv
