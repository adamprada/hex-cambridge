gas and the values of both and we can find the energy change between any two states of the gas because the same change of state can be achieved in two steps one at constant pressure and one at constant volume to see this we recognize that the state of any pure gas is completely specified by specifying its pressure temperature and volume any change of state necessarily involves changing at least two of these state functions any change of state that changes all three of them can be achieved in an alternate way that involves two changes each of
