hence for any substance the pressurevolume work is zero for any process in which the volume remains constant throughout therefore we have and one mole of any substance only pv work possible when we develop the properties of ideal gases by treating them as point mass molecules we find that their average translational kinetic energy is per mole or per molecule which clearly depends only on temperature translational kinetic energy is the only form of energy available to a pointmass molecule so these relationships describe all of the energy of any pointmass molecule in particular they describe all of the
