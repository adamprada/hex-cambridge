is that the energy of the collection of molecules is not affected by any interactions among the molecules we can get the energy of the collection by adding up the energies that the individual molecules would have if they were isolated from one another in our development of statistical thermodynamics we find that the energy of a collection of noninteracting molecules depends only on the molecules energy levels and the temperature the molecules energy levels are fixed this means that if we extend our idea of ideal gases to include noninteracting polyatomic compounds the energies of such gases still depend
