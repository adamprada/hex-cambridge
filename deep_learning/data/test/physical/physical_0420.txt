fixed temperature the average translational kinetic energy is the same for any ideal gas it is independent of the mass of the molecule and of the kinds of atoms in it to increase the temperature by one degree requires that the translational kinetic energy increase by and vice versa consider what happens when we add energy to a polyatomic ideal gas polyatomic gas molecules have energy in rotational and vibrational modes of motion when we add energy to such molecules some of the added energy goes into these rotational and vibrational modes to achieve the same increase in translational kinetic
