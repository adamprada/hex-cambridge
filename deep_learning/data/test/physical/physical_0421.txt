we have this information from at constant we have if reversible work is done on the ideal gas and any ideal gas that is when enough heat is added to increase the temperature of one mole of ideal gas by one degree kelvin at constant pressure units of work are done on the gas this is the energy change that occurs because of the increase in volume that accompanies the onedegree temperature increase since for any ideal gas we have one mole of any ideal gas for a monatomic ideal gas one mole of a monatomic ideal gas the heat
