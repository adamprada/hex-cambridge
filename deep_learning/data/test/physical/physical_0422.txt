to be constant over rather wide temperature ranges for real substances is a weak function of volume and is a weak function of pressure these dependencies are so small that they can be neglected for many purposes for ideal gases is independent of volume and is independent of pressure heat capacities of solids the law of dulong and petit last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers it is easy to maintain a constant pressure on a solid while varying its temperature to keep its volume rigorously
