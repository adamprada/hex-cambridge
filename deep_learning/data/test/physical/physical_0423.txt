called the law of dulong and petit in honor of the discoverers it played an important role in the establishment of correct atomic weights for the elements the value of the constant found by dulong and petit is about remarkably the law can be extended to polyatomic molecules containing only the heavier elements often the solidstate heat capacity of such molecules is about per mole of atoms in the molecule correlations that are more detailed have been developed these relate the heat capacity of a mole of a molecular solid to its molecular formula in such correlations the heat capacity
