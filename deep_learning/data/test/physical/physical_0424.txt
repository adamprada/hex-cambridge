zero the graph in figure shows the shape of the heat capacity versus temperature curve for solid mercury the shape of this curve can be predicted from a very simple model for the energy modes available to the atoms in a solid albert einstein developed this model in einsteins model for the heat capacity of a solid was an important milestone in the development of quantum mechanics since then the basic ideas have been extended and refined to create more detailed theories that achieve good quantitative agreement with the experimental results for particular substances we discuss einsteins treatment in section
