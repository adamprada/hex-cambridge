energy in the form of heat and transform it into an equivalent amount of work unfortunately such a device is impractical as it turns out nature prevents the complete conversion of energy into work with perfect efficiency this leads to an important statement of the second law of thermodynamics it is impossible to convert heat into an equivalent amount of work without some other changes occurring in the universe as such a more reasonable picture of the heat engine is one which will allow for losses of energy to the surroundings the fraction of energy supplied to the engine that
