isothermal and two of which are adiabatic isothermal expansion from p and v to p and v at th adiabatic expansion from p v th to p v tl isothermal compression from p and v to p and v at tl adiabatic compression from p v tl to p v th plotted on a pressurevolume diagram the carnot cycle looks as follows because this is a closed cycle the ending state is identical initial state any state function must have a net change of zero as the system moves around the cycle furthermore the efficiency of the engine can be
