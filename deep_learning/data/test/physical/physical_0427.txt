magnitude but opposite signs so the total work done is given by the efficiency of the engine can be defined as the total work produced per unit of energy provided by the high temperature reservoir or that expression has a lot of variables but it turns out that it can be simplified dramatically it turns out that by the choice of pathways connecting the states places a very important restriction on the relative values of v v v and v to understand this we must consider how the work of adiabatic expansion is related to the initial and final temperatures
