it should be noted that the heat engine can be run backwards by providing work to the engine it can be forces to draw heat from the low temperature reservoir and dissipate it into the high temperature reservoir this is how a refrigerator or heat pump works the limiting efficiency of such a device can also be calculated using the temperatures of the hot can cold reservoirs example what is the maximum efficiency of a freezer set to keep ice cream at a cool oc which it is operating in a room that is oc what is the minimum amount
