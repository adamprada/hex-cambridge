take most of it out again by venting the combustion products the exhaust gas so internal combustion engines have the great advantage that both of these steps can be fast steam engines are successful because we can get heat into the engine quickly by allowing steam to flow from a boiler into the engine we can remove heat from the steam engine quickly by venting the spent steam which is feasible because the working fluid is water the stirling engine is a type of external combustion engine that works by alternately heating expanding and cooling compressing an enclosed working fluid
