involve the exchange of heat between the system and the surroundings in chapter we make a number of important observations about the nature of any heat transfer that occurs during a reversible process let us review these ideas a system can undergo a change in which it accepts or liberates heat while its temperature remains constant if we boil a liquid at constant pressure a thermometer immersed in the liquid continues to show the same temperature even though we add more and more heat energy the added heat is used within the system to convert the liquid to its vapor
