a higher temperature than the portion in the interior of the vessel when we think about a constanttemperature system undergoing a reversible change while in thermal contact with its surroundings we imagine that heat can be transferred in either direction with equal facility if the system is taking up heat as the process proceeds we imagine that we can reverse the direction of the change simply by changing the direction of heat transfer heat will flow from the system to the surroundings and the process will run backwards we can reverse the direction of heat flow by changing the temperature
