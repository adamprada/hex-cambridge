occurs between two entitiesthe system and its surroundingsthat are arbitrarily close to thermal equilibrium such a process is an idealization as we have noted several times a reversible process is a creature of theory that is merely approximated in real systems a reversible process does not have to be a constanttemperature process if the temperatures of system and surroundings change simultaneously they can remain arbitrarily close to one another throughout the process nor must a system undergoing reversible change be in thermal contact with its surroundings a system can undergo a reversible change adiabatically finally we have noted that the
