important to appreciate that new approaches are always under development in all areas of theoretical chemistry in this section i want to introduce you to two tools that are proving to offer high precision in the treatment of electron correlation energies these are the socalled quantum quantum montecarlo and r approaches to this problem both methods currently are used when one wishes to obtain the absolute highest precision in an electronic structure calculation the computational requirements of both of these methods are very high so at present they can only be used on species containing fewer than ca electrons however
