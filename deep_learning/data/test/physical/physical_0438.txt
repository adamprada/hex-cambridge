source and sink term in the diffusion equation is related to the electronnuclear and electronelectron coulomb potential energies denoted v in regions of space where is large and negative ie where the potential is highly attractive is large and negative so is large and positive this causes the concentration of the diffusing material to accumulate in such regions likewise where is positive will decrease clearly by recognizing as the concentration variable in this analogy one understands that will accumulate where is negative and will decay where is positive as one expects so far we see that the trick of taking
