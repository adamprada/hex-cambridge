eg the trial wave function with which one begins to use montecarlo methods to propagate the diffusing function can be written in terms of the exact eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian as follows if the montecarlo method can in fact be used to propagate forward in time such a function but with then it will in principle generate the following function at such an imaginary time as increases the relative amplitudes of all states but the lowest state ie that with smallest will decay compared to the amplitude of the lowest state so the timepropagated wave function will at long enough
