converge to the lowestenergy state of the chosen symmetry and nodal structure so the method can be used on excited states also in chapter of this text you will learn how the montecarlo tools can be used to simulate the behavior of manybody systems eg the electron system we just discussed in a highly efficient and easily parallellized manner the method in this approach to electron correlation one employs a trial variational wave function that contains components that depend explicitly on the interelectron distances by so doing one does not rely on the polarized orbital pair approach introduced earlier in
