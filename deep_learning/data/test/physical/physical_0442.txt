atm to the sublimation pressure we use the virial equation and tabulated coefficients for water vapor to calculate we find see problem how the enthalpy change for a reaction depends on temperature last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers in section we see how to use tabulated enthalpies of formation to calculate the enthalpy change for a particular chemical reaction such tables typically give enthalpies of formation at a number of different temperatures so that the enthalpy change for a given reaction can also be calculated
