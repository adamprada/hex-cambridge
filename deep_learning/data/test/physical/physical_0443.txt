the enthalpy change associated with heating the methane this is not so the reason becomes immediately apparent if we consider a cycle in which we go from the elements to a compound at two different temperatures for methane this cycle is shown in figure figure a thermochemical cycle relating at two temperatures the difference between the standard enthalpies of formation of methane at k and k reflects the enthalpy change for increasing the temperatures of all of the reactants and products from k to k that is over the temperature range from k to k the heat capacities of carbon
