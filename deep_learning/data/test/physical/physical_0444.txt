reaction to be and as in the previous example we use the tabulated heatcapacity parameters to calculate the enthalpy change for increasing the temperature of one mole of each of these gases from k to k at bar we find and figure a thermochemical cycle relating at two temperatures the cycle is shown in figure inspecting this cycle we see that we can calculate the enthalpy change for warming one mole of methanol from k to k by summing the enthalpy changes around the bottom left side and top of the cycle that is this is j or about larger
