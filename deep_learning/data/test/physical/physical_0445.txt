time to make this concept more quantitative to begin consider two orbitals one on an atom labeled a and another on a neighboring atom labeled b these orbitals could be for example the orbitals of two hydrogen atoms such as figure illustrates figure two orbitals combine to produce a bonding and a antibonding molecular orbital however the two orbitals could instead be two orbitals on neighboring carbon atoms such as are shown in figure as they form bonding and antibonding orbitals figure two atomic orbitals form a bonding and antibonding molecular orbital in both of these cases we think of
