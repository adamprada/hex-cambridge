contrast the aos centered on the left atom a are supposed to be solutions of the schrödinger equation whose hamiltonian is and the aos on the right atom b have substituting into the mos schrödinger equation and then multiplying on the left by the complex conjugate of and integrating over the and coordinates of the electron produces recall that the dirac notation denotes the integral of and and denotes the integral of and the operator op acting on b in what is known as the hückel model in chemistry or the tightbinding model in solidstate theory one approximates the integrals
