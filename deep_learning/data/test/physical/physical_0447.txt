of course an analogous approximation is made for the diagonal integral involving these values are negative quantities because as is convention in electronic structure theory energies are measured relative to the energy of the electron when it is removed from the orbital and possesses zero kinetic energy the offdiagonal integrals are expressed in terms of a parameter which relates to the kinetic and potential energy of the electron while it resides in the overlap region in which both and are nonvanishing this region is shown pictorially above as the region where the left and right orbitals touch or overlap the
