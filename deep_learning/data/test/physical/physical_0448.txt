model the offdiagonal overlap integrals are neglected and set equal to zero on the right side of the matrix eigenvalue equation however in some hückel models overlap between neighboring orbitals is explicitly treated so in some of the discussion below we will retain with these hückel approximations the set of equations that determine the orbital energies and the corresponding lcaomo coefficients are written for the twoorbital case at hand as in the first matrix equations shown below left beginarraycc alpha beta beta alpha endarray right leftbeginarrayc cl cr endarray right varepsilon left beginarraycc s s endarray right leftbeginarrayc cl cr
