atoms if the left and right orbitals were not identical eg for bonding in heh or for the bonding in a co group their a values would be different and the h√ºckel matrix problem would look like left beginarraycc alpha beta beta alpha endarray right leftbeginarrayc cl cr endarray right varepsilon left beginarraycc s s endarray right leftbeginarrayc cl cr endarray right to find the mo energies that result from combining the aos one must find the values of e for which the above equations are valid taking the matrix consisting of e times the overlap matrix to the left
