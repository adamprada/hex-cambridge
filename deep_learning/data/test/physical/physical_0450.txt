values are usually negative so the lowest energy such solution is the solution which gives the energy of the bonding mo notice that the energies of the bonding and antibonding mos are not symmetrically displaced from the value a within this version of the h√ºckel model that retains orbital overlap in fact the bonding orbital lies less than b below a and the antibonding mo lies more than b above a because of the and factors in the respective denominators this asymmetric lowering and raising of the mos relative to the energies of the constituent aos is commonly observed in
