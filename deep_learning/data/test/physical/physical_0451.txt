is easier to use and offers qualitatively correct mo energy orderings so lets proceed with our discussion of the h√ºckel model in its simplified version to obtain the lcaomo coefficients corresponding to the bonding and antibonding mos one substitutes the corresponding a values into the linear equations left beginarraycc alphavarepsilon beta beta alphavarepsilon endarray right leftbeginarrayc cl cr endarray right leftbeginarrayc endarray right and solves for the coefficients actually one can solve for all but one and then use normalization of the mo to determine the final ca for example for the bonding mo we substitute into the above matrix
