mo is actually the solution of could also have yielded and then we would have these two solutions are not independent one is just times the other so only one should be included in the list of mos however either one is just as good as the other because as shown very early in this text all of the physical properties that one computes from a wave function depend not on but on so two wave functions that differ from one another by an overall sign factor as we have here have exactly the same and thus are equivalent in
