that someone came to you and asked what geometry you think such a cluster would assume in its ground electronic state one linear and one an equilateral triangle further assume that the nana distances in both such clusters are equal ie that the person asking for your theoretical help is willing to assume that variations in bond lengths are not the crucial factor in determining which structure is favored in figure i shown the two candidate clusters and their s orbitals figure linear and equilateral triangle structures of sodium trimer numbering the three na atoms valence s orbitals and we
