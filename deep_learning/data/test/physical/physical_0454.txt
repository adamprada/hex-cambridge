doing so generates and for the triangle case it produces the first cubic equation has three solutions that give the mo energies for the bonding nonbonding and antibonding mos respectively the second cubic equation also has three solutions so for the linear and triangular structures the mo energy patterns are as shown in figure figure energy orderings of molecular orbitals of linear and triangular sodium trimer for the neutral cluster about which you were asked you have three valence electrons to distribute among the lowest available orbitals in the linear case we place two electrons into the lowest orbital and
