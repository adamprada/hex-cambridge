to know to apply such a model to any set of atomic orbitals that overlap to form mos is the individual ao energies a which relate to the electronegativity of the aos the degree to which the aos couple the b parameters which relate to ao overlaps an assumed geometrical structure whose energy one wants to estimate this example and the earlier example pertinent to or the bond in ethylene also introduce the idea of symmetry knowing for example that ethylene and linear have a leftright plane of symmetry allows us to solve the h√ºckel problem in terms of symmetryadapted
