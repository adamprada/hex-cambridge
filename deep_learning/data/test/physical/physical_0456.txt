the primitive h端ckel matrix will give the correct answers even if you do not however using symmetry allows us to break the full x in this case h端ckel problem into separate h端ckel problems for each symmetry component one odd function and two even functions in this case so a x and a sub matrix while we are discussing the issue of symmetry let me briefly explain the concept of approximate symmetry again using the above h端ckel problem as it applies to ethylene as an illustrative example figure a ethylene molecules and orbitals showing the reflection plane that is a symmetry
