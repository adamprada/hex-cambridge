it might appear that symmetry would no longer be a useful tool in analyzing the properties of this molecules molecular orbitals fortunately this is not the case even if there is not perfect symmetry in the nuclear framework of this molecule the two atomic orbitals will combine to produce a bonding and antibonding orbital moreover these two molecular orbitals will still possess nodal properties similar to those shown in figure a even though they will not possess perfect even and odd character relative to the plane the bonding orbital will still have the same sign to the left of the
