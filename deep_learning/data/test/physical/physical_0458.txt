using the above results would you expect the cation to be linear or triangular what about the anion next i want you to substitute the mo energies back into the x matrix and find the and coefficients appropriate to each of the mos of the linear and of the triangular structure see if doing so leads you to solutions that can be depicted as shown in figure and see if you can place each set of mos in the proper energy ordering figure the molecular orbitals of linear and triangular sodium trimer note they are not energy ordered in this
