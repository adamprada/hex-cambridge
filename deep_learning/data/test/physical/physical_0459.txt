valence orbitals form an nxn matrix but this matrix is broken up into x blocks notice that this did not happen in the triangular na case where each ao touched two other aos for the ethlyene case the valence orbitals consist of a four equivalent c orbitals that are directed toward the four h atoms b four h orbitals c two c orbitals directed toward one another to form the cc bond and d two c orbitals that will form the cc bond this total of orbitals generates h√ºckel matrices as shown below the ethylene molecule figure ethylene molecule with
