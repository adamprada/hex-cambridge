and phi its antibonding partner with in all of these expressions the parameter is supposed to be that appropriate to the specific orbitals that overlap as shown in the matrices if you wish to practice this exercise of breaking a large molecule down into sets of interacting valence try to see what hückel matrices you obtain and what bonding and antibonding mo energies you obtain for the valence orbitals of methane shown in figure figure methane molecule with four ch bonds before leaving this discussion of the hückeltightbinding model i need to stress that it has its flaws because it
