mos however there is some splitting among these clusters of four mos the splittings can be interpreted within the hückel model as arising from couplings or interactions among for example one sp or orbital on a given c atom and another such orbital on the same atom such couplings cause the nxn hückel matrix to not blockpartition into groups of sub matrices because now there exist offdiagonal b factors that couple one pair of directed valence to another when such couplings are included in the analysis one finds that the clusters of mos expected to be degenerate are not but
