mass moving in a central potential one that depends only on the radial coordinate can be written as or introducing the shorthand notation frachbarmu nabla psi v psi epsi this equation is not separable in cartesian coordinates because of the way and appear together in the square root however it is separable in spherical coordinates where it has the form subtracting from both sides of the equation and multiplying by then moving the derivatives with respect to to the righthand side one obtains fracsinthetafracpartialpartial theta leftsinthetafracpartial psipartialtheta right fracsinthetafracpartial psipartialphi fracmu rhbarevr psi leftfracpartialpartial rleftrfracpartialpsipartial rrightright notice that except for
