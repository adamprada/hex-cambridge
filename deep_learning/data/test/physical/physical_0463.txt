side the right hand side contains only and dependence whenever one has isolated the entire dependence on one variable as we have done above for the dependence one can easily see that the left and right hand sides of the equation must equal a constant for the above example the left hand side contains no or dependence and the right hand side contains no dependence because the two sides are equal for all values of and they both must actually be independent of and dependence that is they are constant this again is what is done when one employs the
