we treated much earlier when we discussed zcomponent of angular momentum so its further analysis should also be familiar but for completeness i repeat much of it the above equation has as its most general solution because the wave functions of quantum mechanics represent probability densities they must be continuous and singlevalued the latter condition applied to our function means nb we used this in our earlier discussion of zcomponent of angular momentum that or this condition is satisfied only when the separation constant is equal to an integer this provides another example of the rule that quantization comes from
