fracfrqrlambda where a second separation constant has been introduced once the and dependent terms have been separated onto the right and left hand sides respectively we now can write the equation as fracsinthetafracpartial partial theta leftsinthetafracpartial thetapartialtheta right fracmthetasintheta lambdatheta where is the integer introduced earlier to solve this equation for we make the substitutions and so and fracpartial partial theta fracpartial zpartial thetafracpartial partial z sintheta fracpartial partial z the range of values for was le theta pi so the range for is the equation for when expressed in terms of and becomes fracddzleftzfracdpdzright fracmpz lambda p now we
