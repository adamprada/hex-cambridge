that a boundary condition ie that the wave function not diverge and thus be normalizable in this case give rise to quantization in this case the values of are restricted to before we saw that is restricted to since the above recursion relation links every other coefficient we can choose to solve for the even and odd functions separately choosing and then determining all of the even in terms of this followed by rescaling all of these to make the function normalized generates an even solution choosing and determining all of the odd in like manner generates an odd solution
