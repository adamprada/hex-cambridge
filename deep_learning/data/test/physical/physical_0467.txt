solutions are usually written as and are called spherical harmonics they provide the angular solution of the schr√∂dinger equation for any problem in which the potential depends only on the radial coordinate such situations include all oneelectron atoms and ions eg etc the rotational motion of a diatomic molecule where the potential depends only on bond length the motion of a nucleon in a spherically symmetrical box as occurs in the shell model of nuclei and the scattering of two atoms where the potential depends only on interatomic distance the functions possess varying number of angular nodes which as noted
