things considerably if we choose rescaled length and energy units because doing so removes the factors that depend on and we introduce a new radial coordinate and quantity as follows notice that if is negative as it will be for bound states ie those states with energy below that of a free electron infinitely far from the nucleus and with zero kinetic energy and are real on the other hand if is positive as it will be for states that lie in the continuum and will be imaginary these two cases will give rise to qualitatively different behavior in the
