small as the term will dominate over neglecting these other two terms we find that for small values of or the solution should behave like and because the function must be normalizable we must have since can be any nonnegative integer this suggests the following more general form for srho approx rhol earho this form will insure that the function is normalizable since as for all as long as is a real quantity if is imaginary such a form may not be normalized see below for further consequences turning now to the behavior of for large we make the substitution
