then substituting the power series expansion of and solving for the aks we arrive at a recursion relation for the ak coefficients for large the ratio of expansion coefficients reaches the limit which when substituted into gives the same behavior as the power series expansion of because the power series expansion of describes a function that behaves like for large the resulting function would not be normalizable because the efactor would be overwhelmed by this dependence hence the series expansion of must truncate in order to achieve a normalizable function notice that if is imaginary as it will be if
