that doing so is consistent with specifying a maximum order in the polynomial after which the value can run from in steps of unity up to substituting the integer for we find that the energy levels are quantized because is quantized equal to and the scaled distance turns out to be here the length is the socalled bohr radius which turns out to be Ã¥ it appears once the above eexpression is substituted into the equation for using the recursion equation to solve for the polynomials coefficients for any choice of and quantum numbers generates a socalled laguerre polynomial they
