you about the danger of trying to understand quantum wave functions or probabilities in terms of classical dynamics what kind of potential would give rise to for example the plot shown above classical mechanics suggests that should be large where the particle moves slowly and small where it moves quickly so the plot suggests that the radial speed of the electron has three regions where it is low ie where the peaks in are and two regions where it is very large ie where the nodes are this in turn suggests that the radial potential experienced by the electron is
