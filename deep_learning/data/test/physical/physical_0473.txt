the condition that the expansion of terminate does not arise the solutions of the radial equation appropriate to these scattering states which relate to the scattering motion of an electron in the field of a nucleus of charge are a bit outside the scope of this text so we will not treat them further here to review separation of variables has been used to solve the full schr√∂dinger equation for one electron moving about a nucleus of charge the and solutions are the spherical harmonics the boundstate radial solutions depend on the and quantum numbers and are given in terms
