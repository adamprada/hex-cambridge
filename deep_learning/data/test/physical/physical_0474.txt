l pauling and e b wilson for up to and including and up to ie for and orbitals there are both bound and continuum solutions to the radial schr√∂dinger equation for the attractive coulomb potential because at energies below the asymptote the potential confines the particle between and an outer classical turning point whereas at energies above the asymptote the particle is no longer confined by an outer turning point see figure this provides yet another example of how quantized states arise when the potential spatially confines the particle but continuum states arise when the particle is not spatially confined
