provide qualitative descriptions of orbitals of atoms with more than a single electron by introducing the concept of screening as a way to represent the repulsive interactions among the electrons of an atom an effective nuclear charge can be used in place of in the and to generate approximate atomic orbitals to be filled by electrons in a manyelectron atom for example in the crudest approximation of a carbon atom the two electrons experience the full nuclear attraction so for them whereas the and electrons are screened by the two electrons so for them within this approximation one then occupies
