simonsprofessor emeritus and henry eyring scientist chemistry at university of utah contributors and attributions as we will discuss in more detail in chapter there is a special path connecting reactants transition states and products that is especially useful to characterize in terms of energy surface gradients and hessians this is the intrinsic reaction path irp to construct an irp one proceeds as follows step once a transition state ts has been located its massweighted hessian matrix is formed and diagonalized the normalized eigenvector belonging to the one negative eigenvalue of this matrix defines the initial directions leading from the ts
