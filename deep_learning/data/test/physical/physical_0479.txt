forms the massweighted hessian at and identifies the eigenmode having negative curvature the gradient along this direction will no longer vanish as it did at the ts and the normalized eigenvector of this mode is now used to define the continuation of the direction along the irc step one then minimizes the energy along the or coordinates transverse to this can be done by expressing the energy in terms of the corresponding eigenmodes of the massweighted hessian where is the component of the gradient of the energy along the eigenmode and is the eigenvalue of the massweighted hessian for this
