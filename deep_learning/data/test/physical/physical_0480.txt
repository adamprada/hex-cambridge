process will cause its components transverse to to at least approximately vanish step eventually a geometry will be reached at which all or of the eigenvalues of the massweighted hessian are positive here one is evolving into a region where the curvature along the irc is positive and suggests one may be approaching a minimum however at this point there will be one eigemode the one whose eigenvalue just changed from negative to positive along which the gradient has its largest component this eigenmode will continue to define the ircs direction step one continues by taking a small step along
