the massweighted hessian at the ts proceeding along this path one generates the other branch of the irp the series of geometries leading from reactants through the ts to products defines the full irp at any point along this path the direction is the direction of the irc this process for generating the irp can be viewed as generating a series of cartesian coordinates lying along a continuous path that is the solution of the following differential equation where is the cartesian coordinate is the energy gradient along this cartesian coordinate is the norm of the total energy gradient and
