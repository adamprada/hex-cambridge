ensemble ie follows maxwellboltzmann distribution property speed kinetic energy most probable average rootmeansquare the ideal gas law the expression for the rootmeansquare molecular speed can be used to show that the kinetic molecular model of gases is consistent with the ideal gas law consider the expression for pressure replacing with the square of the rms speed expression yields which simplifies to noting that ntot nna where n is the number of moles and na is avogadros number or finally noting that thats kind of cool no the only assumptions beyond the postulates of the kinetic molecular theory is that the
