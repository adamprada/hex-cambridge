vx and is positive will collide with the wall that fraction of molecules is given by and the frequency of collisions with the wall per unit area per unit time is given by in order to expand this model into a more useful form one must consider motion in all three dimensions considering that and that it can be shown that or and so the factor of nv is often referred to as the number density as it gives the number of molecules per unit volume at atm pressure and k the number density for an ideal gas is approximately
