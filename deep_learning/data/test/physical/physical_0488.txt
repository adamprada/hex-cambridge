the lattice energy is defined as the enthalpy of the reaction ce nacls rightarrow nag clg with called the lattice energy the bornhaber cycle a very handy construct in thermodynamics is that of the thermodynamic cycle this can be represented graphically to help to visualize how all of the pieces of the cycle add together a very good example of this is the bornhaber cycle describing the formation of an ionic solid two pathways can be envisioned for the formation added together the two pathways form a cycle in one pathway the ionic solid if formed directly from elements in
