observable consequence of increasing temperatureadding heat must be a change in the pressure of the system the principle asserts that the system will respond so as to consume heat converting liquid to vapor consumes the latent heat of vaporization so the system can oppose the imposed addition of heat by converting liquid to vapor this increases the pressure of the vapor we can conclude from le chateliers principle that increasing the temperature of a system at liquidvapor equilibrium increases the equilibrium vapor pressure now suppose that we have the liquid and vapor phases of the same pure compound in a
