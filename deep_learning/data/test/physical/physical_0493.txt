is thermally isolated during this process the heat released must result in an increase in the temperature of the system while the pressure can decrease from the initial nonequilibrium value it cannot decrease to its originalequilibrium value evidently the new equilibrium pressure must be greater than the original pressure we again conclude that an increase in the equilibrium vapor pressure requires an increase in the temperature of the system if the volume decrease were imposed with the system immersed in a constant temperature bath the heat evolved would be transferred from the system to the bath the system would return
