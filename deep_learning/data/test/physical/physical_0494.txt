imposed change is a temperature increase or equivalently an addition of heat the principle asserts that the system will respond by consuming heat which it can do by converting ice to liquid since liquid water occupies less volume than the same mass of ice the system pressure will decrease we conclude that the pressure at which ice and water are at equilibrium decreases when the temperature increases that is the melting point increases as the pressure decreases again we can imagine that the equilibrium mixture of ice and water is contained in a thermally isolated cylinder that is closed by
