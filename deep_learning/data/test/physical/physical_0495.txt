outside the system which means that the temperature of the system must decrease while the pressure can decrease from its initial nonequilibrium value it cannot decrease to the value that it had in the original equilibrium position we again conclude that increasing the pressure results in a decrease in temperature that is the melting point of ice increases as the pressure decreases chemical reaction between gases chemical reaction between gases finally suppose that we have a chemical equilibrium involving gaseous reagents to be specific let us again consider the reaction we suppose that this system is initially at equilibrium at
