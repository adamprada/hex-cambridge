its pressure by decreasing the number of moles of gas present and it can do this by converting molecules to molecules we conclude that there will be less present at equilibrium at the higher pressure when we first encounter it le chateliers principle seems to embody a remarkable insight as indeed it does however as we think about it we come to see it as a logical necessity suppose that the response of an equilibrium system to an imposed change were to augment the change rather than oppose it then an imposed change would reinforce itself the slightest perturbation of
