the generalized eigenvalue equation on the left by to obtain this equation is then rewritten using and as this is a conventional eigenvalue problem in which the matrix is and the eigenvectors are the net result is that one can form and then find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors its eigenvalues will be the same as those of the original generalized eigenvalue problem its eigenvectors can be used to determine the eigenvectors of the original problem by multiplying by although the derivation of the matrix eigenvalue equations resulting from the linear variational method was carried out as a means of minimizing
