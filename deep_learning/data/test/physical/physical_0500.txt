become arbitrarily small the approximation becomes exact the limit of this sum is called the line integral of along the path between and whether is exact or inexact the line integral of is defined along any continuous path in the plane if the path is and it connects the points and in the plane we designate the value of the line integral as any differential expression however if is exact we know that in this case the line integral of along curve between these points has the value for exact differential because the value of the line integral depends only
