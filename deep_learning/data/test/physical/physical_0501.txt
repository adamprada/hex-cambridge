one dimension a line integral can always be expressed using a single variable of integration three approaches to the evaluation of line integrals are noteworthy if we are free to choose an arbitrary path we can choose the twosegment path along the first segment is constant at so we can evaluate the change in as along the second segment is constant at so we can evaluate the change in as then if the path is readily solved for as a function of say substitution converts the differential expression into a function of only integration of this expression from to gives
