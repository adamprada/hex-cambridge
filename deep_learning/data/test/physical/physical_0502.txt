of a differential along a particular path they illustrate also the pathindependence of the integral of an exact differential and the pathdependence of the integral of an inexact differential example an exact differential we begin by considering the function for which since exists must be exact let us integrate between the points and along four different paths sketched in figure that we denote as paths a b c and d figure paths a b c and d path a has two linear segments the first segment is the portion of the line from to along this segment the second segment
