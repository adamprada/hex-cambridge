be volatile and as such will enter the vapor phase when the temperature is increased to a high enough value provided they do not decompose first a volatile liquid is one that has an appreciable vapor pressure at the specified temperature an ideal mixture continuing at least one volatile liquid can be described using raoults law raoults law raoults law can be used to predict the total vapor pressure above a mixture of two volatile liquids as it turns out the composition of the vapor will be different than that of the two liquids with the more volatile compound having
