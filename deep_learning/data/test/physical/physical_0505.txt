included in the graphical representation in such a diagram the vapor which exists at higher temperatures is indicated at the top of the diagram while the liquid is at the bottom a typical temperature vs composition diagram is depicted in figure for an ideal mixture of two volatile liquids figure a typical temperature vs composition diagram in this diagram and represent the boiling points of pure compounds and if a system having the composition indicated by has its temperature increased to that indicated by point c the system will consist of two phases a liquid phase with a composition indicated
