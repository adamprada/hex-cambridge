the result leads to an equation in which the independent variables and are separated this means that each term must be equal to a constant which we take to be we find so that and from the first of these equations we obtain the probability density function for the distributions of onedimensional velocities see section the threedimensional probability density function can be deduced from the onedimensional function see section from the second equation we obtain the threedimensional probabilitydensity function directly integrating from where has a fixed value to an arbitrary scalar velocity where the scalarvelocity function is we have or
