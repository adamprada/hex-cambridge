amount of heat gained or lost by a known mass of copper in any subsequent experiment can be calculated from the change in its temperature joule developed the idea that mechanical work can be converted entirely into heat the quantity of heat that could be produced from one unit of mechanical work was called the mechanical equivalent of heat today we define the unit of heat in mechanical units that is we define the unit of energy the joule in terms of the mechanical units mass distance and time one joule is one newtonmeter or one one calorie is now
