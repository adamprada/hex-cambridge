it is useful to know how much the temperature increases when one unit of heat is added to various substances let us consider a general procedure for accumulating such information figure heat capacity is the slope of versus first we need to choose some standard amount of the substance in question after all if we double the amount it takes twice as much heat to effect the same temperature change one mole is a natural choice for this standard amount if we add small increments of heat to one mole of a pure substance we can measure the temperature after
