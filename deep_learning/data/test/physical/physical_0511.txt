molar heat capacity of the substance since this slope is also the derivative of the versus curve we have the temperature increase accompanying a given heat input varies with the particular conditions under which the experiment is done in particular the temperature increase will be less if some of the added heat is converted to work as is the case if the volume of the system increases if the volume increases the system does work on the surroundings for a given will be less when the system is allowed to expand which means that will be greater heat capacity measurements
