is done whenever a force in the surroundings applies pressure on the system while the volume of the system changes because chemical changes typically do involve volume changes pressurevolume work often plays a significant role perhaps the most typical chemical experiment is one in which we carry out a chemical reaction at the constant pressure imposed by the earths atmosphere when the volume of such a system increases the system pushes aside the surrounding atmosphere and thereby does work on the surroundings when a pressure is applied to a surface of area the force normal to the area is for
