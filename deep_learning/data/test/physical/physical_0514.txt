applied pressure moves the piston a distance the volume of the system changes by the magnitude of the work done in this process is therefore work is positive if it is done on the system we are using the convention that work is positive if it is done on the system this means that a compression of the system for which and does a positive quantity of work on the system therefore the work done on the system is or using our convention that unlabeled variables always characterize the system measuring work nonpressurevolume work last updated save as pdf page
