its surface area we can model this property by attributing a surfacearea minimizing force which we call the surface tension to the surface of the liquid we can think of the layer of molecules at the surface as a film that separates the bulk liquid from its surroundings to increase the area of a liquid system requires an expenditure of work by the surroundings against the surface tension of the film gravitational electrical and magnetic forces can all do work on particular systems in this book we give little attention to the details of the various kinds of nonpressurevolume work
