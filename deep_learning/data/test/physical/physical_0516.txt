kind of work is done on a system some change occurs in a thermodynamic variable that is characteristic of that kind of work for pressurevolume work this is the volume change for stretching a strip of rubber it is the change in length for gravitational work it is the displacement of a mass in a gravitational field for changing the shape of a liquid it is the change in surface area for electrical work it is the displacement of a charge in an electrical field for magnetic work it is the displacement of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field
