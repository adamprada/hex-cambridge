energy of the system associated with the displacement we can also write this as we can generalize this perspective need not be a vector and need not be a mechanical force so long as determines the energy change we have we call a potential if we let the energy increment becomes if multiple forms of work are possible we can distinguish them by their characteristic variables which we label for each of these characteristic variables there is a corresponding potential the total energy increment which we also call the nonpressurevolume work becomes for pressurevolume work the characteristic variable is volume
