works out in practice let us consider the particular case of electrical work the electrodes of an electrochemical cell can be at different electric potentials we usually designate the potential difference between the electrodes as we can also write when we want to keep our notation uniform the unit of electrical potential is the volt v one volt is one joule per coulomb we are usually interested in cases in which we can assume that is constant whenever a current flows in an electrochemical cell electrons flow through an external circuit from one electrode to the other by our definition
