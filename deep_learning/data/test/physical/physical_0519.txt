the same argument if ions of species carry charge then ions carry charge and the electrical work is if different species pass through the potential difference the total electrical work becomes mechanisms and elementary processes last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers to see what we mean by an elementary process let us consider some possible mechanisms for the base hydrolysis of methyl iodide in this reaction a carboniodide bond is broken and a carbonoxygen bond is formed while any number of reaction sequences sum to
