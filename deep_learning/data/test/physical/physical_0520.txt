mechanism c is that an intermediate is formed in the former but not in the latter nevertheless mechanism c clearly involves an intermediate structure in which both the incoming and the leaving group are bonded to the central carbon atom the distinction between mechanisms b and c depends on the nature of the intermediate structure in mechanism b we suppose that the intermediate is a bona fide chemical entity once a molecule of it is formed that molecule has a finite lifetime in c we suppose that the intermediate structure is transitory it does not correspond to a molecule with
