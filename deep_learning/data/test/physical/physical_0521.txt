of a normal molecule this means that the period of a highfrequency molecular vibration roughly s is the shortest time that a collection of atoms can remain together and still have all of the characteristics of a molecule if a structure persists for more than a few vibrations it is reasonable to call it a molecule albeit a possibly very unstable one in mechanism c the structure designated depicts a transitory arrangement of the constituent atoms the atomic arrangement does not persist long enough for the bond or the bond to undergo vibrational motion a structure with these characteristics is
