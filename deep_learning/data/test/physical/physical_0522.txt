is one in which there are no intermediates we can distinguish a small number of possible kinds of elementary reaction termolecular elementary reactions bimolecular elementary reactions and unimolecular reactions a single molecule can spontaneously rearrange to a new structure or break into smaller pieces two molecules can react to form one or more products three molecules can react to produce products or we can imagine that some larger number of molecules reacts we refer to these possibilities as unimolecular bimolecular termolecular and highermolecularity processes the stoichiometry of many reactions is so complicated as to preclude the possibility that they could
