ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers the principle of microscopic reversibility requires that parallel mechanisms give rise to the same expression for the concentrationdependence of the equilibrium constant that is the function that characterizes the equilibrium composition must be the same for each mechanism if for the reaction the equilibrium composition for mechanism is and that for mechanism is microscopic reversibility asserts that and in and of itself microscopic reversibility makes no assertion about the value of compared to that of while microscopic reversibility asserts that the same function characterizes the concentration relationships for parallel
