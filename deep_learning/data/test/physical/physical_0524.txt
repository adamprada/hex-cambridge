equilibrium means nevertheless it is of interest to show that we can arrive at this conclusion from a different perspective we can use an idealized machine to show that the second law of thermodynamics requires that parallel mechanisms must produce the same the equilibrium composition our argument is a proof by contradiction let us suppose that and are gases suppose that the reaction occurs in the absence of a catalyst but that reaction occurs in the opposite direction when a catalyst is present more precisely we assume that the position of equilibrium lies to the right in the absence of
