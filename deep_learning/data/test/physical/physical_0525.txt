given our assumptions we can build a machine consisting of a large cylinder closed by a frictionless piston the cylinder contains a mixture of and and a quantity of the catalyst we provide a container for the catalyst and construct the device so that the catalyst container can be opened and closed from outside the cylinder finally we immerse the entire cylinder in a fluid which we maintain at a constant temperature when the catalyst container is sealed so that the gaseous contents of the cylinder are not in contact with the catalyst reaction occurs according to and the piston
