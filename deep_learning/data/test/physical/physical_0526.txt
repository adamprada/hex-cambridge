mechanical device that converts the reciprocating motion of the piston into rotary motion we can wind a rope around an axle and thereby lift an attached weight figure a machine that violates the second law we can operate this machine as an engine by alternately opening and closing the catalyst container we can make the cylinder as large as we want so the energy we expend in opening and closing the catalyst container can be made arbitrarily small compared to the amount of work we get out of the machine in a given cycle all of this occurs with the
