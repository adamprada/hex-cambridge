the surroundings section our argument assumes that two reaction mechanisms are available in a particular physical system that they consume the same reactants that they produce the same products and that the equilibrium compositions are different these assumptions imply that the second law is false since we are confident that it is possible for some system to satisfy the first three of these assumptions the second law requires that the last one be false the equilibrium compositions must be the same we see that there is a complementary relationship between microscopic reversibility and this statement of the second law microscopic
