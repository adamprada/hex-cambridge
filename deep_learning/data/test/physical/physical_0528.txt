reversibility asserts that a unique function of concentrations characterizes the equilibrium state for any reaction mechanism but does not require that every mechanism reach the same state at equilibrium g n lewis gave an early statement of the principle of microscopic reversibility he called it the law of entire equilibrium and observed that it is a law which in its general form is not deducible from thermodynamics but proves to be compatible with the laws of thermodynamics in all cases where a comparison is possible it is worth noting that we have not shown that the existence of a unique
