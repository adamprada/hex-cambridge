example the initial coordinates could be chosen close to those of a local minimum on the energy surface and the initial momenta associated with each coordinate could be assigned values chosen from a maxwellboltzmann distribution characteristic of a specified temperature t in such cases it is common to then allow the md trajectory to be propagated for a length of time long enough to allow further equilibration of the energy among all degrees of freedom before extracting any numerical data to use in evaluating average values or creating interparticle distance histograms for example one usually does not choose just one
