describe how md is used to follow the time evolution for such simulations trajectory propagation with each coordinate having its initial velocity and its initial value specified one then uses newtons equations written for a time step of duration to propagate and forward in time according for example to the following firstorder propagation formula here mq is the mass factor connecting the velocity and the momentum pq conjugate to the coordinate q and is the force along the coordinate at the earlier geometry in most modern md simulations more sophisticated numerical methods can be used to propagate the coordinates and
