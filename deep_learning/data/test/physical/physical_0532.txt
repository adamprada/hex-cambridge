can be used in md each has strengths and weaknesses in the present section i will focus on describing the basic idea of how md simulations are performed while leaving treatment of details about propagation schemes to more advanced sources such as computer simulations of liquids m p allen and d j tildesley oxford u press new york the forces appearing in the md propagation algorithms can be obtained as gradients of a bornoppenheimer electronic energy surface if this is computationally feasible following this path involves performing what is called directdynamics md alternatively the forces can be computed from derivatives
