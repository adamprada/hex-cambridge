which various intramolecular and intermolecular interactions are introduced figure c depiction of a molecule in which bondstretching bondbending intramolecular van der waals and intermolecular solvation potentials are illustrated the total potential of a system containing one or more such molecules in the presence of a solvent eg water it typically written as a sum of intramolecular potentials one for each molecule in the system and itermolecular potentials the former are usually decomposed into a sum of covalent interactions describing how the energy varies with bond stretching bond bending and dihedral angle distortion as depicted in figure d figure d depiction
