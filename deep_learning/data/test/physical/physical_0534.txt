interactions among the solute and solvent moleulues are also often expressed in a form involving electrostatic and van der waals interations between pairs of atoms one on one molecule solute or solvent and the other on another molecule solute or solvent the cartesian forces on any atom within a solute or solvent molecule are then computed for use in the md simulation by using the chain rule to relate derivatives with respect to cartesian coordinates to derivatives of the above intramolecular and intermolecular potentials with respect to the interatomic distances and the angles appearing in them because water is such
