charges of the other water molecules and of solute molecules the more detail and complexity one introduces the more computational effort is needed to perform md simulations in particular water molecules that allow for polarization are considerably more computationally demanding because they often involve solving selfconsistently for the polarization of each molecule by the charge and dipole potentials of all the other molecules with each dipole potential including both the permanent and induced dipoles of that molecule professor john wampler has created a web page in which the details about molecular mechanics force fields introduced above are summarized this web
