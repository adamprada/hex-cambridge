energies vaporization energies diffusion constants or some combination of both it is important to observe that the kind of force fields discussed above have limitations beyond issues of accuracy in particular they are not designed to allow for bond breaking and bond forming and they represent the bornoppenheimer energy of one most often the ground electronic state there are force fields explicitly designed to include chemical bonding changes but most md packages do not include them when one is interested in treating a problem that involves transitions from one electronic state to another eg in spectroscopy or when the system
