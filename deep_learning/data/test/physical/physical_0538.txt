of the molecules at time t one generates a set of new coordinates and new velocities appropriate to the system at time using these new coordinates and momenta as and and evaluating the forces at these new coordinates one can again use the propagation equations to generate another finitetimestep set of new coordinates and velocities through the sequential application of this process one generates a sequence of coordinates and velocities that simulate the systems behavior by following these coordinates and momenta one can interrogate any dynamical properties that one is interested in for example one could monitor oxygenoxygen distances throughout
