depend on time such as how often two oxygen atoms come within a certain distance throughout the md simulation this kind of interrogation could not be achieved using mc because there is no sense of time in mc simulations in chapter i again discuss using classical molecular dynamics to follow the time evolution of a chemical system however there is a fundamental difference between the kind of simulations described above and the case i treat in chapter in the former one allows the nmolecule system to reach equilibrium ie either by carefully choosing initial coordinates and momenta or by waiting
