dynamics to monitor the outcome eg reaction or nonreactive collision unlike the mc method which is very amenable to parallel computation md simulations are more difficult to carry out in a parallel manner one can certainly execute many different classical trajectories on many different computer nodes however to distribute one trajectory over many nodes is difficult the primary difficulty is that for each time step all of the molecules undergo moves to new coordinates and momenta to compute the forces on all molecules requires of the order of calculations eg when pairwise additive potentials are used in contrast each mc
