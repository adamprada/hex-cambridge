of a polymer in the liquid state which might require s or longer one would have to carry out md steps this likely would render the simulation not feasible in the table below we illustrate the wide range of time scales that characterize various events that one might want to simulate using some form of md and we give a sense of what is practical using md simulations in the year examples of dynamical processes taking place over timescales ranging from s through hundreds of seconds each of which one may wish to simulate using md s s s s
