intramolecular motions by simply not including these coordinates and momenta in the netwonian dynamics eg as one does when using a rigidwater model discussed earlier in other words one simply freezes certain bond lengths and angles of course this is an approximation whose consequences must be tested and justified and would certainly not be a wise step to take if those coordinates played a key role in the dynamical process being simulated another approach called coarse graining involves replacing the fully atomistic description of selected components of the system by a muchsimplified description involving significantly fewer spatial coordinates and momenta
