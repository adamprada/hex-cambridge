range than the other two potentials this allows spatial cutoffs to be used ie to ignore interactions beyond much shorter distances efficiently for a system containing water molecules the tipp or tipp models require one to evaluate functions of the distances between or centers whereas the sws twobody component involves only interactions and the threebody component need only be evaluated for molecules and that are nearby molecule if for the atomistic models one wishes to treat the oh stretching and hoh bending motions md time steps of ca s must be employed for the sw model the fastest motions involve
