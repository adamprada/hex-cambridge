details about how successful coarse graining was in this case but i will not go further into it at this time i think the two examples we discussed in this section suffice for introducing the subject of coarse graining to the readers of this textin summary for this section md classical simulations are not difficult to implement if one has available a proper representation of the intramolecular and intermolecular potential energy v such calculations are routinely carried out on large biomolecules or condensedmedia systems containing thousands to millions of atomic centers there are however difficulties primarily connected to the time
