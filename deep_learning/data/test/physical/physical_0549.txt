efficient computer codes that allow such integrals to be computed for and even and basis functions after executing one of these socalled integral packages for a basis with a total of functions one has available usually on the computers hard disk of the order of oneelectron and and twoelectron integrals when treating extremely large atomic orbital basis sets eg or more basis functions modern computer programs calculate the requisite integrals but never store them on the disk instead their contributions to the matrix elements are accumulated on the fly after which the integrals are discarded this is usually referred to
