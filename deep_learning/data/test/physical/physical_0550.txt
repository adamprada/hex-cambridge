examples to see what i mean the first example is rather simple and pertains to two h atoms combining to form the molecule the valence aos on each h atom are the aos they combine to form the two valence mos and depicted in figure figure two hydrogen atomic orbitals combine to form a bonding and antibonding molecular orbital the bonding mo labeled s has lcaomo coefficients of equal sign for the two aos as a result of which this mo has the same sign near the left h nucleus a as near the right h nucleus b in contrast
