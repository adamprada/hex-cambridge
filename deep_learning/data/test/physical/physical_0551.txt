these mos clearly are dictated by the shapes of the aos that comprise them and the relative signs of the lcaomo coefficients that relate the mos to aos for the mo these coefficients have the same sign on the left and right atoms for the mo they have opposite signs i should stress that the signs and magnitudes of the lcaomo coefficients arise as eigenvectors of the hf scf matrix eigenvalue equation it is a characteristic of such eigenvalue problems for the lower energy eigenfunctions to have fewer nodes than the higher energy solutions as we learned from several examples
