tighter basis aos on this c atom this will make the bonding mo more radially compact in this region of space although its nodal character and gross shape will not change alternatively an electron donating group such as hc or tbutyl attached to one of the c centers will cause the mo to be more diffuse by making its lcaomo coefficients for more diffuse basis aos larger in addition to mos formed primarily of aos of one type ie for it is primarily stype orbitals that form the and mos for ethylenes bond it is primarily the c aos that
