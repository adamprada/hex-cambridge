diatomics involving firstrow atoms in this figure the core mos formed from the aos are not shown only those mos formed from and aos appear the clear trend toward lower orbital energies as one moves from left to right is due primarily to the trends in orbital energies of the constituent aos that is f being more electronegative than has a lowerenergy orbital than does b bonding antibonding nonbonding and rydberg orbitals as noted above when valence aos combine to form mos the relative signs of the combination coefficients determine along with the ao overlap magnitudes the mos energy and
