ignored in most elementary discussions of electronic structure all molecules have socalled rydberg orbitals these orbitals can be thought of as large diffuse orbitals that describe the regions of space an electron would occupy if it were in the presence of the corresponding closedshell molecular cation two examples of such rydberg orbitals are shown in figure on the left we see the rydberg orbital of and on the right that of the former species can be thought of as a closedshell ammonium cation around which a rydberg orbital resides the latter is protonated methyl amine with its rydberg orbital figure
