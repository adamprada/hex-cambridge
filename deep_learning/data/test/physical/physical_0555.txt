these connections that i wish to emphasize in the following discussion in particular i want to make it clear that experimental data can only be interpreted and thus used to extract molecular properties through the application of theory so theory does not replace experiment but serves both as a complementary component of chemical research via simulation of molecular properties and as the means by which we connect laboratory data to molecular properties rotational spectroscopy most of us use rotational excitation of molecules in our everyday life in particular when we cook in a microwave oven the microwave radiation which has
