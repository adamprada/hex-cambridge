microwave oven in a metal container or with some other metal material as shown in chapter the electrons in metals exist in very delocalized partially filled orbitals called bands these band orbitals are spread out throughout the entire piece of metal the application of any external electric field eg that belonging to the microwave radiation causes these metal electrons to move throughout the metal as these electrons accumulate more and more energy from the microwave radiation they eventually have enough kinetic energy to be ejected into the surrounding air forming a discharge this causes the sparking that we see when
