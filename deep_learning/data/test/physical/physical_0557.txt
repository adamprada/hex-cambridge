of matching the energy of the photons to the energy spacings of the molecule illustrates the concept of resonance and is something that is ubiquitous in spectroscopy as we learned in mathematical detail in chapter upon first hearing that the photons energy must match an energylevel spacing in the molecule if photon absorption is to occur it appears obvious and even trivial however upon further reflection there is more to such resonance requirements than one might think allow me to illustrate using this microwaveinduced rotational excitation example by asking you to consider why photons whose energies considerably exceed the energy
