they would feel an outofphase push in the opposite direction the net result is that over a long period of time they would feel random jerks from your arms and thus would not undergo smooth energy transfer from you this is why too high a frequency and hence too high an energy does not induce excitation let us now return to the case of rotational excitation by microwave photons as we saw in chapter for a rigid diatomic molecule the rotational energy spacings are given by where is the moment of inertia of the molecule given in terms of its
