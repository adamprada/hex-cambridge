quantum number is fold degenerate that is there are distinct energy states and wave functions that have energy and that are distinguished by a quantum number these states have identical energy but differ among one another by the orientation of their angular momentum in space ie the orientation of how they are spinning for polyatomic molecules we know from chapter that things are more complicated because the rotational energy levels depend on three socalled principal moments of inertia which in turn contain information about the molecules geometry these three principle moments are found by forming a x moment of inertia
