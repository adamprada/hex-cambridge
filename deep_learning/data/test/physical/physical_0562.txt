depend on the inverses of moments of inertia one must vibrationally average over the vibrational motion that characterizes the molecules movement for species containing stiff bonds the vibrational average of the inverse squares of atomic distances relative to the center of mass does not differ significantly from the equilibrium values of the same distances however for molecules such as weak van der waals complexes eg ho or arhcl that undergo floppy largeamplitude vibrational motions there may be large differences between the equilibrium and the vibrationally averaged values the proper treatment of the rotational energy level patterns in such floppy molecules
