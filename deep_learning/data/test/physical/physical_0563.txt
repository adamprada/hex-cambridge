can be used to treat large amplitude floppy motions eg by simulating the nuclear motions on a bornoppenheimer energy surface thereby allowing rotationally resolved spectra of such species to provide proper moment of inertia and thus geometry information vibrational spectroscopy the ability of molecules to absorb and emit infrared radiation as they undergo transitions among their vibrational energy levels is critical to our planets health it turns out that water and molecules have bonds that vibrate in the frequency range which is within the infrared spectrum as solar radiation primarily visible and ultraviolet impacts the earths surface it is absorbed
