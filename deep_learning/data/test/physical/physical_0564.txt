vapor and these ir photons would travel through the atmosphere and be lost into space the result would be that much of the energy provided by the suns visible and ultraviolet photons would be lost via ir emission however the water vapor and do not allow so much ir radiation to escape these greenhouse gases absorb the emitted ir photons to generate vibrationally hot water and molecules in the atmosphere these vibrationally excited molecules undergo collisions with other molecules in the atmosphere and at the earths surface in such collisions some of their vibrational energy can be transferred to translational
