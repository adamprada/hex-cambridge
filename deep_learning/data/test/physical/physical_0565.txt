can become very cold primarily because much of the days ir energy production is lost to radiative emission through the atmosphere and into space lets now learn more about molecular vibrations how ir radiation excites them and what theory has to do with this when infrared ir radiation is used to excite a molecule it is the vibrations of the molecule that are in resonance with the oscillating electric field molecules that have dipole moments that vary as its vibrations occur interact with the ir electric field via a potential energy of the form here denotes the change in the
