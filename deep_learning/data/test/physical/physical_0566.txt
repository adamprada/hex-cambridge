vibrational transitions occur at frequencies that characterize various functional groups in molecules eg oh stretching hnh bending nh stretching cc stretching etc as such a vibrational spectrum offers an important fingerprint that allows the chemist to infer which functional groups are present in the molecule however when the molecule contains soft floppy vibrational modes it is often more difficult to use information about the absorption frequency to extract quantitative information about the molecules energy surface and its bonding structure as was the case for rotational levels of such floppy molecules the accurate treatment of largeamplitude vibrational motions of such species
