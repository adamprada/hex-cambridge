spacings between energy levels in which one of the normalmode quantum numbers increases by unity are expressed as delta evj evj e vj hbaromegaj that is the spacings between successive vibrational levels of a given mode are predicted to be independent of the quantum number v within this harmonic model as shown in figure figure harmonic vibrational energy levels vs vibrational quantum number in chapter the details connecting the local curvature ie hessian matrix elements in a polyatomic molecules potential energy surface to its normal modes of vibration are presented experimental evidence clearly indicates that significant deviations from the harmonic
