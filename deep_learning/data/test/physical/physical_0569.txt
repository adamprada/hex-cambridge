the spacing between neighboring vibrational levels goes to zero this value max specifies the quantum number of the last bound vibrational level for the particular bondstretching mode of interest the dissociation energy can then be computed by adding to the zero point energy along this mode the sum of the spacings between neighboring vibrational energy levels from to so in the case of vibrational spectroscopy theory allows us to interpret observed infrared lines in terms of absorptions arising in localized functional groups extract dissociation energies if a long progression of lines is observed in a bondstretching transition and treat highly
