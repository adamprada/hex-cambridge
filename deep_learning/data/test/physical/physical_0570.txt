the xrays scatter most strongly from the innershell electrons of each atom the interatomic distances obtained from such diffraction experiments are more precisely measures of distances between high electron densities in the neighborhoods of various atoms the xrays interact most strongly with the innershell electrons because it is these electrons whose characteristic bohr frequencies of motion are nearly in resonance with the high frequency of such radiation for this reason xrays can be viewed as being scattered from the core electrons that reside near the nuclear centers within a molecule hence xray diffraction data offers a very precise and reliable
