for probing molecular structure nmr spectroscopy nmr spectroscopy probes the absorption of radiofrequency rf radiation by the nuclear spins of the molecule the most commonly occurring spins in natural samples are protons deuterons and nuclei in the presence of an external magnetic field along the axis each such nucleus has its spin states split in energy by an amount given by where is the component of the nucleus spin angular momentum along the axis is the strength of the external magnetic field and is a socalled gyromagnetic factor ie a constant that is characteristic of the nucleus this splitting of
