electronic environment of a nucleus in figure we display the chemical shifts of proton and nuclei in a variety of chemical bonding environments figure chemical shifts characterizing various electronic environments for protons and for carbon nuclei because the quantum number changes in steps of unity and because each photon possesses one unit of angular momentum the rf energy that will be in resonance with the nucleus zeemansplit levels is given by in most nmr experiments a fixed rf frequency is employed and the external magnetic field is scanned until the above resonance condition is met determining at what value a
