nearby nuclear spins these spinspin coupling interactions give rise to splittings in the energy levels of the nucleus that alter the above energy expression as follows where is the component of the nuclear spin angular momentum is the corresponding component of a nearby nucleus causing the splitting and is called the spinspin coupling constant between the two nuclei examples of how spins on neighboring centers split the nmr absorption lines of a given nucleus are shown in figs for three common cases the first involves a nucleus labeled a that is close enough to one other magnetically active nucleus labeled
