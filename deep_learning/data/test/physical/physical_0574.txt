for a group in the benzene molecule where a and x figure splitting pattern characteristic of case the splitting pattern shown if figure would for example arise in the spectrum of a group and illustrates the splitting of the a nucleus absorption line by the four spin states that the two equivalent x spins can occupy again the lines shown would be consistent with x and a both having spin because they each assume only two values figure splitting pattern characteristic of case in figure is the kind of splitting pattern that would apply to the nmr absorptions for a
