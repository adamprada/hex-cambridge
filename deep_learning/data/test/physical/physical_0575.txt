are split by their couplings to the other nuclei because of the spinspin couplings strong decay with internuclear distance the magnitude and pattern of the splitting induced on one nucleus by its neighbors provides a clear signature of what the neighboring nuclei are ie through the number of values associated with the peak pattern and how far these nuclei are through the magnitude of the constant knowing it is proportional to this nearneighbor data combined with the chemical shift functional group data offer powerful information about molecular structure an example of a full nmr spectrum is given in figure where
