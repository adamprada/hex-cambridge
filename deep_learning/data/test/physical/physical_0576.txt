protons in an pattern finally the protons peak is split by the neighboring groups three protons in an pattern figure proton nmr of ethanol showing splitting of three distinct protons as well as integrated intensities of the three sets of peaks in summary nmr spectroscopy is a very powerful tool that allows us to extract internuclear distances or at least tell how many nearneighbor nuclei there are and thus geometrical information by measuring coupling constants and subsequently using the theoretical expressions that relate values to values allows us to probe the local electronic environment of nuclei inside molecules by measuring
