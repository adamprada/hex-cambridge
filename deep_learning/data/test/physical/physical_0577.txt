information about a molecule as discussed in part of this text theory is also used to probe molecular structure in another manner that is not only does theory offer the equations that connect the experimental data to the molecular properties but it also allows one to simulate a molecule this simulation is done by solving the schr√∂dinger equation for the motions of the electrons to generate a potential energy surface after which this energy landscape can be searched for points where the gradients along all directions vanish an example of such a pes is shown in figure for a simple
