represent transition state structures that connect pairs of stable isomers once the stable isomers of a molecule lying within some energy interval above the lowest such isomer have been identified the vibrational motions of the molecule within the neighborhood of each such isomer can be described either by solving the schrödinger equation for the vibrational wave functions belonging to each normal mode or by solving the classical newton equations of motion using the gradient of the pes to compute the forces along each molecular distortion direction the decision about whether to use the schrödinger or newtonian equations to treat the
