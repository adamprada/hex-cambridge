of that isomer and whose eigenvectors describe the atomic motions that correspond to these vibrations moreover the solution of the electronic schr√∂dinger equation allows one to compute the nmr shielding values at each nucleus as well as the spinspin coupling constants between pairs of nuclei the treatment of these subjects is beyond the level of this text you can find it in molecular electronic structure theory by helgaker et al again using the vibrational motion knowledge one can average the and values over this motion to gain vibrationally averaged and values that best simulate the experimental parameters one carries out
