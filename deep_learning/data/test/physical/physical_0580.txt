known that is one compares the theoretical spectra of a variety of test molecules to the observed spectral features to attempt to identify the molecule that produced the spectra it is also common to use simulations to examine species that are especially difficult to generate in reasonable quantities in the laboratory and species that do not persist for long times reactive radicals cations and anions are often difficult to generate in the laboratory and may be impossible to retain in sufficient concentrations and for a sufficient duration to permit experimental characterization in such cases theoretical simulation of the properties of
