science in the group of prof mark johnson at yale infrared spectroscopy is carried out on gasphase ions in this particular experiment water cluster anions with one or more ar atoms attached to them were formed and using a mass spectrometer the ions of one specific mass were selected for subsequent study in the example illustrated here the cluster containing four water molecules was studied when infrared ir radiation impinges on the ions it can be absorbed if its frequency matches the frequency of one of the vibrational modes of this cluster if for example ir radiation in the cm
