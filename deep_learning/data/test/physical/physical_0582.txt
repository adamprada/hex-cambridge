the ion intensity loss of the ir absorption by the cluster ions when they carry out this kind of experiment using and scan the ir radiation in the cm frequency range they obtained the spectrum labeled a in figure a when they performed the same kind of experiment on and scanned in the cm frequency range which is where od stretching vibrations are known to occur they obtained the spectrum labeled b in figure a figure a infrared spectra of and respectively in the cm and cm frequency ranges what the experimentalists did not know however is what the geometrical
