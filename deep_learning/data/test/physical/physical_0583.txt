observed ir spectrum for example for the rather extended structure of they computed the ir spectrum shown in panel e and for in panel f of figure a alternatively for the cyclic structure of they computed the ir spectrum shown in panel c and for in panel d of figure a clearly the spectrum of panels c and d agrees much better with their experimental spectrum in panels a and b than does the spectrum of panels e and f based on these comparisons these scientists concluded that the ions in their and have the cyclic geometry not the extended
