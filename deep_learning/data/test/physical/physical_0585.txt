and polarizabilities that allow them to respond to changes in the internal charge distribution of the molecule or ion the locations of such partial charges and the magnitudes of their dipoles and polarizabilities are determined to make the resultant solvation potential reproduce known from experiment or other simulations solvation characteristics eg solvation energy radial distribution functions in a variety of calibration cases the book molecular modeling nd ed a r leach prentice hall englewood cliffs offers a good source of information about how these terms are added into the oneelectron component of the hamiltonian to account for solvation effects in
