the electronic energy of the solute molecule or ion which contains the interaction energy of the molecules electrons and nuclei with the surrounding medium plus ii the intramedium potential energy which is taken to be of a simple molecular mechanics mm force field character ie to depend on interatomic distances and internal angles in an analytical and easily computed manner again the book molecular modeling nd ed a r leach prentice hall englewood cliffs offers a good source of information about these matters if alternatively dynamical characteristics of the solvated species are to be simulated a classical molecular dynamics md
