carlo mc method this method allows one to evaluate the integrations appearing in the classical partition function described above by generating a sequence of configurations ie locations of all of the molecules in the system as well as of all the internal coordinates of these molecules and assigning a weighting factor to these configurations by introducing an especially efficient way to generate configurations that have high weighting the mc method allows us to simulate extremely complex systems that may contain millions of molecules to appreciate why it is useful to have a tool such as mc lets consider how one
