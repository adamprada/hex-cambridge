in a manner that would not allow substantial further approximations to be made one would thus be faced with evaluating an integral over spatial coordinates of a function that depends on all of these coordinates if one were to discretize each of the coordinate axes using say points along each axis the numerical evaluation of this integral as a sum over the coordinates would require computational effort scaling as kn even for ar atoms with each axis having points this is of the order of computer operations clearly such a straightforward evaluation of this classical integral would be foolish to
