simulation representative of liquid water at some density r and temperature t one begins by placing water molecules in a box of volume chosen such that reproduces the specified density to effect the mc process we must assume that the total intramolecular and intermolecular potential energy of these water molecules can be computed for any arrangement of the molecules within the box and for any values of the internal bond lengths and angles of the water molecules notice that as we showed above when considering the ar example does not include the kinetic energy of the molecules it is only
