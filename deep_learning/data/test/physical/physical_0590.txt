mc process this potential energy is evaluated for the current positions of the water molecules in its most common and straightforward implementation known as the metropolis montecarlo process a single water molecule is then chosen at random and one of its internal bond lengths or angle or external position or orientation coordinates is selected at random this one coordinate q is then altered by a small amount and the potential energy is evaluated at the new configuration the amount by which coordinates are varied is usually chosen to make the fraction of mc steps that are accepted by following the
