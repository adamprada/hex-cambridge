would alter the intramolecular oh bond energy and the hoh bending energy as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bonding energies to neighboring water molecules the intramolecular energy changes would likely be far in excess of unless a very small coordinate change were employed because it is important to the efficiency of the mc process to make displacements that produce ca acceptance it is better for the water case to make use of coordinates such as the center of mass and orientation coordinates of the water molecules for which larger displacements produce energy changes within a few and smaller displacements of
