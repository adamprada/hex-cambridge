the energy change is negative ie if the potential energy is lowered by the coordinate displacement the change in coordinate is allowed to occur and the resulting new configuration is counted among the mcaccepted configurations on the other hand if is positive the move from to is not simply rejected to do so would produce an algorithm directed toward finding a minimum on the energy landscape which is not the goal instead the quantity is used to compute the probability for accepting this energyincreasing move in particular a random number between for example and is selected if the random number
