or time information in this series this set of configurations has been shown to be properly representative of the geometries that the system will experience as it moves around at equilibrium at the specified temperature nb is the only way that information about the molecules kinetic energy enters the mc process but no time or dynamical attributes are contained in it as the series of accepted steps is generated one can keep track of various geometrical and energetic data for each accepted configuration for example one can monitor the distances r among all pairs of oxygen atoms in the water
