the normalized coordinate probability distribution function as the denominator in the definition of is of course proportional to the coordinatecontribution to the partition function in the mc process this average is computed by forming the following sum over the m mcaccepted configurations in most mc simulations millions of accepted steps contribute to the above averages at first glance it may seem that such a large number of steps represent an extreme computational burden however recall that straightforward discretization of the axes produced a result whose effort scaled as which is unfeasible even for small numbers of molecules so why do
