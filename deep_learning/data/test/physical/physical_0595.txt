is nonnegligible so it avoids configurations that are stupid and focuses on those for which the probability factor is largest this is why the mc method works the standard metropolis variant of the mc procedure was described above where its rules for accepting or rejecting trial coordinate displacements were given there are several other ways of defining rules for accepting or rejecting trial mc coordinate displacements some of which involve using information about the forces acting on the coordinates all of which can be shown to generate a series of mcaccepted configurations consistent with an equilibrium system the book computer
