is done and why it is needed suppose that one wanted to use the mc process to compute an average with as the weighting factor of a function that is large whenever two or more molecules have high ie repulsive intermolecular potentials for example one could have such a function could for example be used to monitor when pairs of molecules with centerofmass coordinates rj and ri approach closely enough to undergo a reaction that requires them to surmount a high intermolecular barrier the problem with using conventional mc methods to compute in such cases is that i favors those
