on values between and so it can be used as shown below to define a proper probability weighting function one then replaces in the mc algorithm by the product and uses this as a weighting function to see how this replacement works we rewrite the average that needs to be computed as follows the interpretation of the last identity is that can be computed by i using the mc process to evaluate the average of but with a probability weighting factor of to accept or reject coordinate changes and ii also using the mc process to evaluate the average of
