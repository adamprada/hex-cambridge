might want to use umbrella sampling techniques suppose one has one system for which the evaluation of the partition function and thus all thermodynamic properties can be carried out with reasonable computational effort and another similar system ie one whose potential does not differ much from the first for which this task is very difficult lets call the potential function of the first system and that of the second system the latter systems partition function can be written as follows where is the partition function of the first system and is the ensemble average of the quantity taken with respect
