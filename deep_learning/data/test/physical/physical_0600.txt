likely generate configurations representative of only the systems equilibrium existence near one local minimum rather than representative of its exploration of the full energy landscape however if one could identify those regions of coordinate space at which high barriers occur and construct a function that is large and positive only in those regions one could then use as the umbrella function and compute averages for the system having potential in terms of ensemble averages for a modified system whose potential is in figure a i illustrate how the original and modified potential landscapes differ in regions between two local minima
