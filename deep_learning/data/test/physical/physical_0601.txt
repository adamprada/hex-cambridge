characteristic of the many local minima which would be especially beneficial if the quantity emphasized those configurations this would be the case for example if measured the intramolecular and nearestneighbor oxygenhydrogen interatomic distances in a mc simulation of liquid water on the other hand if one wanted to use as a measure of the energy needed for a ion to undergo in a m aqueous solution of nacl a change in coordination number from to as illustrated in figure b one would need a sampling that is accurate both near the local minima corresponding to the and coordinate and the
