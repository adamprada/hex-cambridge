of umbrellas to connect the local minima to the transition states assuming that one has knowledge of the energies and local solvation geometries characterizing the two local minima and the transition state as well as a reasonable guess or approximation of the intrinsic reaction path refer back to section of chapter connecting these structures one proceeds as follows to generate a series of socalled windows within each of which the free energy of the solvated ion is evaluated using the full potential of the system to constitute the unaltered weighting function one multiplies this by an umbrella function to form
