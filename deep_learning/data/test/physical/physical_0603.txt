acceptance fraction and the configurations generated will allow for energy fluctuations uphill toward the ts of about this amount as the mc process is performed using the above weighting one constructs a histogram for how often the system reaches various values s along the irc of course the severe weighting caused by will not allow the system to realize any value of s outside of the window one then creates a second window that connects to the first window ie with and repeats the mc sampling using to generate a second histogram for how often the system reaches various values
