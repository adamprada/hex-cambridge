point one can scale ie multiply it by a constant to match at this common point to produce a new function this new function describes exactly the same relative probability within the second window but unlike it connects smoothly to because the second and third windows are connected at the point one can scale to match at this common point to produce a new function this process of scaling to match at is repeated until the final window connecting to upon completing this series of connections one has in hand a continuous probability function which can be normalized in this
