as the common composition of vapor and liquid when they have the same composition figure phase diagrams for left a maximum boiling point azeotrope and right ta maximum boiling point azeotrope azeotropes can be either maximum boiling or minimum boiling as show in figure regardless distillation cannot purify past the azeotrope point since the vapor and quid phases have the same composition if a system forms a minimum boiling azeotrope and also has a range of compositions and temperatures at which two liquid phases exist the phase diagram might look like figure figure phase diagram for a binary solution with
