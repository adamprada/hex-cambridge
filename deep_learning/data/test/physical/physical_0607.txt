mostly compound b single phase liquid mostly a and vapor single phase liquid mostly b and vapor vapor miscible at all mole fractions since it is a gas solution within each twophase region iii iv and the twophase liquid region the lever rule will apply to describe the composition of each phase present so for example the system with the composition and temperature represented by point b a singlephase liquid which is mostly compound a designated by the composition at point a and vapor with a composition designated by that at point c will be described by the lever rule
