of pressure the chemical potential expression becomes where is the fugacity fugacity is related to pressure but contains all of the deviations from ideality within it to see how it is related to pressure consider that a change in chemical potential for a single component system can be expressed as and so differentiating the expression for chemical potential above with respect to pressure at constant volume results in leftdfracpartial mupartial p rightt left dfracpartialpartial p left muo rt ln left dfracffo right right right which simplifies to leftdfracpartial mupartial p rightt rt left dfracpartial ln fpartial p rightt v multiplying
