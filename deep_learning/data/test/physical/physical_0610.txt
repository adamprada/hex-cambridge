the solute allows us to use the simple model for chemical potential by inserting the activity of a solute in place of its mole fraction the problem that then remains is the measurement of the activity coefficients themselves which may depend on temperature pressure and even concentration activity coefficients for ionic solutes for an ionic substance that dissociates upon dissolving the chemical potential of the cation can be denoted and that of the anion as for a solution the total molar gibbs function of the solutes is given by where where denotes the chemical potential of an ideal solution and
