its atoms the potential energy can be expressed approximately in terms of a taylor series expansion about any of the local minima of course different local minima ie different isomers will have different values for the equilibrium coordinates and for the derivatives of the energy with respect to these coordinates the taylor series expansion of the electronic energy is written as v gk v sumk leftdfracpartial vpartial qkright qk dfrac sumjk qj hjk qk here is the energy at the current geometry is the gradient of the energy along the coordinate is the secondderivative or hessian matrix and is the
