from the equilibrium geometry are of interest one has the socalled harmonic potential the classical mechanical equations of motion for the coordinates can be written in terms of the above potential energy and the following kinetic energy function where is the time rate of change of the coordinate and is the mass of the atom on which the cartesian coordinate resides the newton equations thus obtained are where the force along the coordinate is given by minus the derivative of the potential along this coordinate within the harmonic approximation these classical equations can more compactly be expressed in terms of
