a molecule one forms the massweighted hessian matrix and then finds the or nonzero eigenvalues as well as the corresponding eigenvectors it is useful to note that if this same kind of analysis were performed at a geometry corresponding to a transition state or of the values would be positive but one of them would be negative the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of the massweighted hessian points along a very important direction that we will discuss later it is the direction of the socalled intrinsic reaction coordinate irc when reporting the eigenvalues at such a transitionstate geometry one
