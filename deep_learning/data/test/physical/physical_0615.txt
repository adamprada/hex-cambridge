normal mode the corresponding total vibrational wave function psi prodjntext or psinuj xj is a product of or harmonic oscillator functions one for each normal mode the energy gap between one vibrational level and another in which one of the quantum numbers is increased by unity ie for fundamental vibrational transitions is delta enuj rightarrow nuj hbar omegaj the harmonic model thus predicts that the fundamental and hot band transitions should occur at the same energy and the overtone transitions should occur at exactly twice this energy one might wonder whether massweighted cartesian coordinates would be better or more appropriate
