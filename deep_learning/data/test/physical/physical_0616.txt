transition states on a given bornoppenheimer surface will be exactly the same regardless of what isotopes appear in the molecule for example for the reactions hcn rightarrow hnc or or or the geometries of the reactants products and transition states for each of the distinct reactions will not depend on the identity of the hydrogen isotopes however the harmonic vibrational frequencies will depend on the isotopes because the massweighted hessian differs from the hessian expressed in terms of nonmassweighted coordinates the use of symmetry symmetry adapted modes it is often possible to simplify the calculation of the normal mode harmonic
