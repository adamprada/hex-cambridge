right h in the positive y direction figure water molecule showing its two bond lengths and angle the equivalence of the pairs of cartesian coordinate displacements is a result of the fact that the displacement vectors are connected by the point group operations of the group in particular reflection of through the yz plane the two planes are depicted in figure produces and reflection of through this same plane yields figure two planes of symmetry of the water molecule more generally it is possible to combine sets of cartesian displacement coordinates into socalled symmetry adapted coordinates where the index labels
