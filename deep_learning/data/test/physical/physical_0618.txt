plane and means rotation about the molecules axis of course one will not obtain x independent symmetry adapted coordinates in this manner many identical combinations will arise and only will be independent the independent combinations of symmetry normalized to produce vectors of unit length are qa dfracsqrt xl xr qa dfracsqrt yl yr qa yo those of symmetry are qb dfracsqrt xl xr qb dfracsqrt yl yr qb xo and the combinations qb dfracsqrt zl zr qb zo are of symmetry whereas is of symmetry point group symmetry of the harmonic potential these nine symmetryadapted coordinates are expressed as unitary
