symmetry and one x matrix of symmetry for example the symmetry block his formed as follows leftbeginarrayccc dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt endarrayright leftbeginarrayccc mhdfracpartial vpartial xlmh mhdfracpartial vpartial xl partial xrmh mhdfracpartial vpartial xl partial yomh mhdfracpartial vpartial xr partial xlmh mhdfracpartial vpartial xrmh mhdfracpartial vpartial xr partial yomh mhdfracpartial vpartial yo partial xlmh mhdfracpartial vpartial yo partial xrmh mhdfracpartial vpartial yomh endarrayright leftbeginarrayccc dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt dfracsqrt endarrayright the and blocks are formed in a similar manner the eigenvalues of each of these blocks provide the squares of the harmonic vibrational frequencies the eigenvectors provide the coefficients of the
