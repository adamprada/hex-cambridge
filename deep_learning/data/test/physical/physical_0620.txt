figure of symmetry this rotation vector can be generated by applying the projection operator to or to the other two rotations are of and symmetry and involve spinning of the molecule about the and axes of the figure respectively so of the cartesian displacements are of symmetry of of and of of these there are three translations and and three rotations and a this leaves two vibrations of and one of symmetry for the example treated here the three nonzero eigenvalues of the massweighted hessian are therefore of and symmetry they describe the symmetric and asymmetric stretch vibrations and the
