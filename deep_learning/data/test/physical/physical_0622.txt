we say the thermodynamic variable has the same value at every point along the path of reversible change in the remainder of this chapter we develop criteria for spontaneous change these criteria are statements about the values of and for a system that can undergo spontaneous change under particular conditions in stating some of these criteria we specify the conditions by saying that the pressure or the temperature is constant as we develop these criteria we will see that these stipulations have specific meanings when we say that a process occurs at constant volume isochorically we mean that the volume
