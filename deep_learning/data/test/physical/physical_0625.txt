state than they are in the initial state while other state functions are the same in both states but not necessarily constant throughout the process in the next few chapters we develop properties of the state functions entropy enthalpy and gibbs free energy we define the gibbs free energy by the relationship to specify the relationship among the changes in these state functions when the final temperature is the same as the initial temperature we write here too we often say that this relationship relates the changes in and when the temperature is constant this is another useful but potentially
