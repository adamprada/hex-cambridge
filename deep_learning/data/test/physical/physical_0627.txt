energy computed as the dirac notation is used to represent the sixdimensional coulomb integral that describes the coulomb repulsion between the charge density for the electron in and the charge density for the electron in of course the sum over must be limited to exclude to avoid counting a selfinteraction of the electron in orbital with itself the total energy of the orbital is the sum of the above three contributions this treatment of the electrons and their orbitals is referred to as the hartreelevel of theory as stated above when screened hydrogenic aos are used to approximate the and
