expansion coefficients are the variables that are to be determined by solving the schrödinger equation after substituting the lcao expansion for into this schrödinger equation multiplying on the left by one of the basis aos and then integrating over the coordinates of the electron in one obtains this is a matrix eigenvalue equation in which the and appear as eigenvalues and eigenvectors the matrices and are called the hamiltonian and overlap matrices respectively an explicit expression for the former is obtained by introducing the earlier definition of he an important thing to notice about the form of the matrix hartree
