of those orbitals that are occupied are then used to form a new hamiltonian matrix after which the hartree equations are again solved for another generation of lcao coefficients and orbital energies this process is continued until the orbital energies and lcao coefficients obtained in successive iterations do not differ appreciably upon such convergence one says that a selfconsistent field has been realized because the coefficients are used to form a coulomb field potential that details the electronelectron interactions ao basis sets slatertype orbitals and gaussiantype orbitals as noted above it is possible to use the screened hydrogenic orbitals as
