for both types of aos the coordinates and refer to the position of the electron relative to a set of axes attached to the nucleus on which the basis orbital is located note that slatertype orbitals stos are similar to hydrogenic orbitals in the region close to the nucleus specifically they have a nonzero slope near the nucleus in contrast gtos have zero slope near because we say that stos display a cusp at that is characteristic of the hydrogenic solutions whereas gtos do not although stos have the proper cusp behavior near nuclei they are used primarily for atomic
