contracted gtos cgtos typically a series of radially tight medium and loose gtos are multiplied by contraction coefficients and summed to produce a cgto that approximates the proper cusp at the nuclear center although no such combination of gtos can exactly produce such a cusp because each gto has zero slope at although most calculations on molecules are now performed using gaussian orbitals it should be noted that other basis sets can be used as long as they span enough of the regions of space radial and angular where significant electron density resides in fact it is possible to use
