in widely available locations sets of sto or gto basis orbitals for maingroup elements and transition metals this ongoing effort is aimed at providing standard basis set libraries which yield predictable chemical accuracy in the resultant energies are cost effective to use in practical calculations are relatively transferable so that a given atoms basis is flexible enough to be used for that atom in various bonding environments eg hybridization and degree of ionization the fundamental core and valence basis in constructing an atomic orbital basis one can choose from among several classes of functions first the size and nature of
