basis has only one cgto to represent the innershell orbitals but uses two sets of cgtos to describe the valence orbitals a triplezeta tz basis in which three times as many cgtos are used as the number of core and valence atomic orbitals of course there are quadruplezeta and higherzeta bases also moreover there are vtz bases that treat the innershell orbitals with one cgto and the valence orbitals with three cgtos optimization of the orbital exponents zs or as and the gtotocgto contraction coefficients for the kind of bases described above has undergone considerable growth in recent years the
