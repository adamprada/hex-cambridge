higher angular momentum than appears in the atoms valence orbital space eg functions for c n and o and functions for h and they have exponents or which cause their radial sizes to be similar to the sizes of the valence orbitals ie the polarization orbitals of the h atom are similar in size to the orbital rather than to the valence orbital of hydrogen thus they are not orbitals which describe the atoms valence orbital with one higher lvalue such higherl valence orbitals would be radially more diffuse a primary purpose of polarization functions is to give additional angular
