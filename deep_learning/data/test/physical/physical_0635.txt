into regions between bonded atoms but they are also important in unstrained compounds when high accuracy is required diffuse functions when dealing with anions or rydberg states one must further augment the ao basis set by adding socalled diffuse basis orbitals the valence and polarization functions described above do not provide enough radial flexibility to adequately describe either of these cases the pnnl web site data base cited above offers a good source for obtaining diffuse functions appropriate to a variety of atoms as does the site of prof kirk peterson once one has specified an atomic orbital basis for
