bond to any of the reactants or products dissolved salts can affect reaction rates in a similar way such effects often occur when the degree of charge separation along the path of an elementary reaction is significantly different from that in the reactants isotopic substitution in a reactant can affect the reaction rate replacement of a hydrogen atom with a deuterium atom is the most common case the effect of an isotopic substitution on a reaction rate is called a kinetic isotope effect kinetic isotope effects can provide valuable information about the reaction mechanism a kinetic isotope effect is expected
