be important these include the stereochemistry of the product the walden inversion that accompanies s reactions at tetrahedral carbon centers is a notable example isotopic substitution that occurs incidental to a reaction can help establish that an intermediate is formed the effects of competing reactions are often significant the study of competing reactions is frequently helpful when the reaction involves a shortlived and otherwise undetectable intermediate the use of isotopic substitution and competing reactions is illustrated in section in which we review the base hydrolysis of cobalt iiicobalt pentaammine complexes other statements of the first law last updated save as
