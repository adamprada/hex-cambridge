this statement the fact that energy is conserved is taken to be implicit in the operational definition we can give an equally valid statement by saying energy is conserved in all processes in making this statement we assume that the definition of energy is understood and that the statefunction postulate is implicit in this definition to see that the postulate that energy is conserved and the postulate that energy is a state function are logically independent let us consider a system that undergoes a particular cyclic process which we call cycle a in cycle a the final state of the
