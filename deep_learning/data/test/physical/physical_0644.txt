the same mathematical representation if of many previous results have had a particular characteristic we expect that of a large number of future trials will have the same characteristic we also say that there is one chance in four that the next individual result will have this characteristic when we say this we mean that of a large number of future trials will have this characteristic and the next trial has as good a chance as any other to be among those that do the probability that an outcome will occur in the future is equal to the frequency with
