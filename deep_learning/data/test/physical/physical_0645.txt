in such a way that each outcome is in one and only one of the subsets we say that such assignments of outcomes to subsets are exhaustive because every possible outcome is assigned to some subset we say that such assignments are mutually exclusive because no outcome belongs to more than one subset we call each such subset an event when we partition the possible outcomes into exhaustive and mutually exclusive events we can say the same things about the probabilities of events that we can say about the probabilities of outcomes in our discussions the term events will always
