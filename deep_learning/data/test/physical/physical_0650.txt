the sun earth and moon have ever been solved exactly so what does one do when faced with trying to study real molecules using quantum mechanics there are two very powerful tools that one can use to sneak up on the solutions to the desired equations by first solving an easier model problem and then using the solutions to this problem to approximate the solutions to the real schr√∂dinger problem of interest for example to solve for the energies and wave functions of a boron atom one could use hydrogenic orbitals but with and hydrogenic and orbitals with to account
