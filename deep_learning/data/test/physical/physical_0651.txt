perturbation theory approach provides a set of analytical expressions for generating a sequence of approximations to the true energy and true wave function this set of equations is generated for the most commonly employed perturbation method rayleighschr√∂dinger perturbation theory rspt as follows first one decomposes the true hamiltonian into a socalled zerothorder part this is the hamiltonian of the model problem used to represent the real system and the difference which is called the perturbation and usually denoted it is common to associate with the perturbation a strength parameter which could for example be associated with the strength of the
