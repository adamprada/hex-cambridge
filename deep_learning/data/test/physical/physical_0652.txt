of and into this produces one equation whose right and left hand sides both contain terms of various powers in the perturbation for example terms of the form and and are all of third power also called third order next one equates the terms on the left and right sides that are of the same order this produces a set of equations each containing all the terms of a given order the zeroth first and secondorder such equations are given below it is straightforward to see that the nth order expression in this sequence of equations can be written as
