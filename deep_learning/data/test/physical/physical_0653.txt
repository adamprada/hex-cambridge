hydrogen atom when studying the electric fields effect on the state in the firstorder equation the unknowns are and recall that is assumed to be known because it is the difference between the hamiltonian one wants to solve and the model hamiltonian to solve the firstorder and higherorder equations one expands each of the corrections to the wave function of interest in terms of the complete set of wave functions of the zerothorder problem as noted earlier this means that one must solve not just for the zerothorder state one is interested in denoted above but for all of the
