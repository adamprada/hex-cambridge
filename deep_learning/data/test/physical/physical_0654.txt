the firstorder correction to the energy of the unperturbed state can be evaluated by computing the average value of the perturbation with respect to the unperturbed wave function returning to the firstorder equation and multiplying on the left by the complex conjugate of one of the other zerothorder functions gives using h the first term reduces to and the fourth term vanishes because is orthogonal to because these two functions are different eigenfunctions of this reduces the equation to the unknown in this expression is which is the expansion coefficient for the expansion of in terms of the zerothorder functions
