however if one or more of the zerothorder energies is equal to an additional step needs to be taken before the above expression for can be used if one were to try to solve without taking this extra step the values for those states with could not be determined because the first and third terms would cancel and the equation would read the way rspt deals with this paradox is realize that within a set of degenerate states any orthogonal combinations of these states will also be degenerate so rspt assumes that one has already chosen the degenerate sets of
