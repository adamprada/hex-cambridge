remains valid but the summation index is now restricted to exclude any members of the zerothorder states that are degenerate with to obtain the expression for the secondorder correction to the energy of the state of interest one returns to multiplying on the left by the complex conjugate of and integrating yields the intermediate normalization condition causes the fourth term to vanish and the first and third terms cancel one another recalling the fact that is normalized the above equation reduces to substituting the expression obtained earlier for allows to be written as where as before the sum over is
