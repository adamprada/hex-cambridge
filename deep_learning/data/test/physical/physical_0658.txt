recursively to obtain even highorder energy and wave function corrections and and are used to determine and as outlined above is determined from with and the expansion coefficients of are determined from the above equation with and higher are then determined from and the expansion coefficients of are determined from the above equation with this process can then be continued to higher and higher order although modern quantum mechanics uses highorder perturbation theory in some cases much of what the student needs to know is contained in the first and second order results to which i will therefore restrict our
