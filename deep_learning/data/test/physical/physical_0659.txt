can described by adding the perturbation to the zerothorder hamiltonian here is the position of the electron in the box is the electrons charge and is the length of the box the perturbation potential varies in a linear fashion across the box so it acts to pull the electron to one side of the box first we will compute the firstorder correction to the energy of the state and the firstorder wave function for the state in the wave function calculation we will only compute the contribution to made by this is just an approximation to keep things simple in
