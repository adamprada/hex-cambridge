that the firstorder correction to the energy vanishes could have been foreseen in the expression for the product is an even function under reflection of through the midpoint in fact this is true for all of the particleinabox wave functions on the other hand the perturbation is an odd function under reflection through thus the integral must vanish as its integrand is an odd function this simple example illustrates how one can use symmetry to tell ahead of time whether the integrals and contributing to the firstorder and higherorder energies and wave functions will vanish the contribution to the firstorder
