as the superposition function formed when the zerothorder and firstorder functions combine figure blue and red particleinabox zerothorder functions left and the perturbed function through first order right arising from the electric field polarization clearly the external electric field acts to polarize the wave function in a manner that moves its probability density toward the side of the box the degree of polarization will depend on the strength of the applied electric field for such a polarized superposition wave function there should be a net dipole moment induced in the system we can evaluate this dipole moment by computing the
