it is proportional to and we are interested in obtaining an expression for how the dipole varies linearly with the second and third integrals are identical and can be combined to give substituting our earlier expressions for and we obtain these integrals are familiar from what we did to compute doing them we finally obtain now lets compute the polarizability of the electron in the state of the box and try to understand physically why a should depend as it does upon the length of the box to compute the polarizability we need to know that using our induced moment
