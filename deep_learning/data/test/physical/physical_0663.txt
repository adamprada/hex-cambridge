an electric field its electrons and nuclei experience a perturbation v textbfe cdot esumn zn textbfrn e sumi textbfri where is the charge of the nucleus whose position is is the position of the electron and is the unit of charge the effect of this perturbation on the energies is termed the stark effect the firstorder change to the energy of this molecule is evaluated by calculating where is the unperturbed wave function of the molecule ie the wave function in the absence of the electric field the quantity inside the integral is the electric dipole operator so this integral
