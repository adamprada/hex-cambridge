perturbation theory one has to choose specific combinations that diagonalize the perturbation this means one needs to first form the x matrix leftbeginarraycc langle s v s rangle langle s v pz rangle langle pz v s rangle langle pz v pz rangle endarrayright where is taken to be the direction of the electric field the diagonal elements of this matrix vanish due to parity symmetry so the two eigenvalues are equal to these are the two firstorder because they are linear in and thus linear in energies so in such degenerate cases one can obtain linear stark effects the
