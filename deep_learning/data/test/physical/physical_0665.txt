for the stark perturbation consider the potential that an electron experiences within an atom or molecule close to a nucleus of charge it is of the form in atomic units where the energy is given in hartrees h ev and distances in bohr units bohr Ã¥ where the first term is the coulomb potential acting to attract the electron to the nucleus and the second is the electronfield potential assuming the field is directed along the direction in figure a we show this potential for a given value of the angle figure a potential experienced by valence electron showing attraction
