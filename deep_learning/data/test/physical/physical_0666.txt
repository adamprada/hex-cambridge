a at where ca ev in figure a and then decreases monotonically as r increases in fact this potential approaches as approaches as we see in the left portion of figure a the bottom line is that the total potential with the electric field present violates the assumptions on which perturbation theory is based however it turns out that perturbation theory can be used in such cases under certain conditions for example as applied to the stark effect for the degenerate and levels of a hydrogenic atom ie a oneelectron system with nuclear charge if the energy of the and
