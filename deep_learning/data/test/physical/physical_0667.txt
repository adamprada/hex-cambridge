through the barrier will be small so the state will have a long lifetime in such cases we can use perturbation theory to describe the effects of the applied electric field on the energies and wave functions of such metastable states but we must realize that we are only allowed to do so in the limit of weak fields and for states that lie significantly below the barrier in this case perturbation theory describes the changes in the energy and wave function in regions of space where the zerothorder wave function is bound but does not describe at all the
