along the direction thinking of as so is the integrals because is an even function of ie of because the angular dependence of the perturbation ie has no dependence matrix elements of the form also vanish this means that if one were to form the matrix representation of for the degenerate states belonging to a given all of its elements would be zero thus the rotational energies of polar diatomic or rigid linear polyatomic molecules have no firstorder stark splittings there will however be secondorder stark splittings in which case we need to examine the terms that arise in the
