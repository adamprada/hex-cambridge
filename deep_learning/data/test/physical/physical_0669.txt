the and factors arising from the product must match for the integral not to vanish because finally the terms will vanish because of the inversion symmetry is odd under inversion but is even using the fact that the perturbation is these two nonzero matrix elements can be used to express the secondorder energy for the level as etextbfelanglemurangleleftdfracdfracjmjjbj dfracdfracjmjjbjright where is plancks constant and is the rotational constant for the molecule for a diatomic molecule of reduced mass and equilibrium bond length before moving on to another example it is useful to point out some common threads that occur in
