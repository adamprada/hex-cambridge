certain firstorder energies are zero if vanishes so the lowestorder effect is in second order or if we want to examine higherorder corrections we consider evaluating before doing so explicitly we think about whether symmetry will limit the matrix elements entering into the expression for for example in the case just studied we saw that only other zerothorder states having or gave nonvanishing matrix elements in addition because contains energy denominators we may choose to limit our calculation to those other zerothorder states whose energies are close to our state of interest this assumes that such states will contribute a
