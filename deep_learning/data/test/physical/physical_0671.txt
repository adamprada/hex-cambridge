electrons occupy a orbital and one electron occupies a orbital to find a reasonable form for the radial parts of these two orbitals one could express each of them as a linear combination of i one orbital having hydrogenic form with a nuclear charge of and ii a second orbital of form but with a nuclear charge of to account for the screening of the nucleus by the two innershell electrons where the index i labels the and orbitals to be determined next one could determine the and expansion coefficients by requiring the fi to be approximate eigenfunctions of the
