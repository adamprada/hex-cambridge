and will be this models description of the orbital the higherenergy solution will have and is the approximation to the orbital using these and orbitals and the electron wave function they form as a zerothorder approximation how do we then proceed to apply perturbation theory the full threeelectron hamiltonian can be decomposed into a zerothorder part and a perturbation the zerothorder energy of the wave function is where each of the are the energies obtained by solving the x matrix eigenvalue equation shown earlier the firstorder energy of this state can be written as elangle phisralphaphisrbetaphisralphavphisralphaphisrbetaphisralpha rangle jssjss with the
