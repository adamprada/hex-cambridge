each of the coulomb integrals can be interpreted as being equal to the coulombic interaction between electrons one at location the other at averaged over the positions of these two electrons with their spatial probability distributions being given by and respectively although the example just considered is rather primitive it introduces a point of view that characterizes one of the most commonly employed models for treating atomic and molecular electronic structure the hartreefock hf meanfield model which we will discuss more in chapter in the hf model one uses as a zerothorder hamiltonian consisting of a sum of oneelectron terms
