twophase compositions at a variety of temperatures and compositions in this section we will consider several types of cases where the composition of binary mixtures are conveniently depicted using these kind of phase diagrams partially miscible liquids a pair of liquids is considered partially miscible if there is a set of compositions over which the liquids will form a twophase liquid system this is a common situation and is the general case for a pair of liquids where one is polar and the other nonpolar such as water and vegetable oil another case that is commonly used in the organic
