that shows this kind of behavior is that of methyl acetate and carbon disufide for which the critical temperature is approximately k at one atmosphere ferloni spinolo similar behavior is seen for hexanenitrobenzene mixtures for which the critical temperature is k figure another condition that can occur is for the two immiscible liquids to become completely miscible below a certain temperature or to have a lower critical temperature an example of a pair of compounds that show this behavior is water and trimethylamine a typical phase diagram for such a mixture is shown in figure some combinations of substances show
