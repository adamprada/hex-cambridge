which indicate the compositions of the two liquid phases point a indicates the mole faction of compound b in the layer that is predominantly a whereas the point c indicates the composition of the layer that is predominantly compound b the relative amounts of material in the two layers is then inversely proportional to the length of the tielines ab and bc which are given by and respectively in terms of mole fractions and the number of moles of material in the a layer and the number of moles in the b layer are inversely proportional to the lengths of
