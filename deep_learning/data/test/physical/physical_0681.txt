symmetry operations of the point group the matrix representation of h within the symmetryadapted basis will be block diagonal that is objects of different symmetry will not interact only interactions among those of the same symmetry need be considered to illustrate such symmetry adaptation consider symmetry adapting the orbital of and the three orbitals of the three h atoms we begin by determining how these orbitals transform under the symmetry operations of the point group the act of each of the six symmetry operations on the four atomic orbitals can be denoted as follows snsss overseterightarrow snsss hphantomsnsss oversetcrightarrow snsss
