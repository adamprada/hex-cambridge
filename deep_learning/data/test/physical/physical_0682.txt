can likewise write matrix representations for each of the symmetry operations of the point group dc leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright hspacept de leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright dsigmav leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright hspacept dsigmav leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright dsigmav leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright it is easy to verify that a rotation followed by a reflection is equivalent to a reflection alone in other words note that this same relationship is carried by the matrices dsigmavdc leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright dsigmav likewise we can verify that directly and we can notice that the matrices also show the same identity dcdsigmav leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright dsigmav in fact one
