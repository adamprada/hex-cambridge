not depend on the specific basis used to form the matrix that is they are invariant to a unitary or orthogonal transformation of the objects used to define the matrices as a result they contain information about the symmetry operation itself and about the space spanned by the set of objects the significance of this observation for our symmetry adaptation process will become clear later note that the characters of both rotations are the same as are the characters of all three reflections collections of operations having identical characters are called classes each operation in a class of operations has
