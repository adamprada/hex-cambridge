onedimensional set of matrices d e hspacept dc hspacept dc d sigmav hspacept dsigmav hspacept dsigmav again we have these six x matrices form another representation of the group in this basis each character is equal to unity the representation formed by allowing the six symmetry operations to act on the natom orbital is clearly not the same as that formed when the same six operations acted on the basis we now need to learn how to further analyze the information content of a specific representation of the group formed when the symmetry operations act on any specific set of
