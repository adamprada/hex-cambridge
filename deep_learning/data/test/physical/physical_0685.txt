dsigmav leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright the characters of are note that we would have obtained this representation directly if we had originally chosen to examine the basis alone also note that these characters are equal to those of minus those of a change in basis now let us convert to a new basis that is a linear combination of the original basis dont worry about how i constructed and yet as will be demonstrated later we form them by using symmetry projection operators defined below we determine how the basis functions behave under the group operations by allowing the operations to act
