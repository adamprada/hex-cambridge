the space spanned by the functions which is the same space as the span forms a reducible representation that can be decomposed into a one dimensional space and a two dimensional space via formation of the functions note that the characters traces of the matrices are not changed by the change in bases the onedimensional part of the above reducible threedimensional representation is seen to be the same as the totally symmetric representation we arrived at before the twodimensional representation that is left can be shown to be irreducible it has the following matrix representations de leftbeginarraycc endarrayright hspacept dc
