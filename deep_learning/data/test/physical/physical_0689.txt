of the irreducible representation commonly used bases we could take any set of functions as a basis for a group representation commonly used sets include cartesian displacement coordinates located on the atoms of a polyatomic molecule their symmetry treatment is equivalent to that involved in treating a set of p orbitals on the same atoms quadratic functions such as d orbitals as well as rotations about the and axes the transformation properties of these very commonly used bases are listed in the character tables shown in section summary the basic idea of symmetry analysis is that any basis of orbitals
