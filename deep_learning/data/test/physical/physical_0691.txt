same characters as the matrices obtained earlier when the displacement vectors were analyzed but the individual matrix elements are different because we used a different basis set here and above it was and this illustrates the invariance of the trace to the specific representation the trace only depends on the space spanned not on the specific manner in which it is spanned a shortcut a shortcut device exists for evaluating the trace of such representation matrices that is for computing the characters the diagonal elements of the representation matrices are the projections along each orbital of the effect of the
