hence and belong to or transform as the representation this is why is to the right of the row of characters for the representation in the character table shown in section in similar fashion the character table please refer to this table now states that and orbitals on nitrogen transform as e as do and but transforms as earlier we considered in some detail how the three orbitals on the hydrogen atoms transform repeating this analysis using the shortcut rule just described the traces characters of the x representation matrices are computed by allowing and to operate on and and
