symmetryadapted orbitals we make use of socalled symmetry projection operators and these operators are given in terms of linear combinations of products of characters times elementary symmetry operations as follows where ranges over and and the identity operation the result of applying to say is pa sh sh shshshshsh shshsh phia which is an unnormalized orbital having symmetry clearly this same orbital would be generated by acting on or hence only one orbital exists likewise which is one of the symmetry adapted orbitals having symmetry the other orbital can be obtained by allowing to act on or it might seem
