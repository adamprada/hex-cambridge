any given set of atomic orbitals atomcentered displacements or rotations can be used as a basis for the symmetry operations of the point group of the molecule the characters belonging to the operations of this point group within any such space can be found by summing the integrals over all the atomic orbitals or corresponding unit vector atomic displacements or rotations the resultant characters will in general be reducible to a combination of the characters of the irreducible representations to decompose the characters of the reducible representation to a sum of characters of the irreducible representation it is necessary to
