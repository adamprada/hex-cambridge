atomic orbitals how this is carried out was illustrated for the orbitals in our earlier discussion these tools allow a symmetry decomposition of any set of atomic orbitals into appropriate symmetryadapted orbitals before considering other concepts and grouptheoretical machinery it should once again be stressed that these same tools can be used in symmetry analysis of the translational vibrational and rotational motions of a molecule the twelve motions of three translations three rotations six vibrations can be described in terms of combinations of displacements of each of the four atoms in each of three directions hence unit vectors placed on
