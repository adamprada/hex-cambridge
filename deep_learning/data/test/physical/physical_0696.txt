trace unit zvectors on and remain unchanged as well as the corresponding yvectors however the xvectors on and are reversed in sign the total character for is thus this representation can be decomposed as follows from the information on the right side of the character table translations of all four atoms in the and directions transform as and respectively whereas rotations about the and axes transform as and e hence of the twelve motions three translations have and symmetry and three rotations have and symmetry this leaves six vibrations of which two have symmetry none have symmetry and two pairs
