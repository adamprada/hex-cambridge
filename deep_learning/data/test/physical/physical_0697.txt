the individual orbitals for example reflection of an orbital product through the plane in applies the reflection operation to all electrons just as the individual orbitals formed a basis for action of the pointgroup operators the configurations orbital products form a basis for the action of these same pointgroup operators hence the various electronic configurations can be treated as functions on which operates and the machinery illustrated earlier for decomposing orbital symmetry can then be used to carry out a symmetry analysis of configurations another shortcut makes this task easier since the symmetry adapted individual orbitals transform according to irreducible
