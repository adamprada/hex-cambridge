the form note lower case letters are used to denote the symmetry of electronic orbitals whereas capital letters are reserved to label the overall configurations symmetry in symmetry the following procedure is used for each of the six symmetry operations in the point group the product of the characters associated with each of the six spin orbitals orbital multiplied by á or â spin is formed in the specific case considered here and notice that the contributions of any doubly occupied nondegenerate orbitals eg and to these direct product characters are unity because for all operators for any onedimensional irreducible
