operators analogous to those introduced earlier for orbitals can be used to form symmetryadapted orbital products from the individual basis orbital products of the form where and denote the occupation or of the two degenerate orbitals and in appendix iii of electronic spectra and electronic structure of polyatomic molecules g herzberg van nostrand reinhold co new york ny the resolution of direct products among various representations within many point groups are tabulated when dealing with indistinguishable particles such as electrons it is also necessary to further project the resulting orbital products to make them antisymmetric for fermions or symmetric for
