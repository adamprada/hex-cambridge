hamiltonian in the absence of some external perturbation eg electromagnetic field or static electric field or potential due to surrounding ligands can be coupled by the perturbation only if the symmetries of and of the two wave functions obey a socalled selection rule in particular only if the coupling integral is nonvanishing will the two states be coupled by the role of symmetry in determining whether such integrals are nonzero can be demonstrated by noting that the integrand considered as a whole must contain a component that is invariant under all of the group operations ie belongs to the totally
