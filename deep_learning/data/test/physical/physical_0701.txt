way this is more often used in practice is that the integral will vanish unless the symmetry of the direct product matches the symmetry of only when these symmetries match will the triple direct product contain a nonzero component of the totally symmetric representation this is very much the same as what we saw earlier in this chapter when we discussed how angular momentum coupling could limit which states contribute to the secondorder perturbation theory energy the angular momenta of and of when coupled must have a component that matches the angular momentum of to see how this result is
