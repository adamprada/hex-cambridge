co moiety is of symmetry the direct product of the two wave function symmetries thus contains only symmetry the three components and of the dipole operator have respectively and symmetry thus the triple direct products give rise to the following possibilities there is no component of symmetry in the triple direct product so the integral vanishes the alternative way of reaching this same conclusion is to notice that the direct product of the symmetries of the orbital and the lone pair orbital is which does not match the symmetry of any component of the dipole operator either route allows us
