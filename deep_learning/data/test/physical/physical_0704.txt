at any time of each of the species in any proposed reaction mechanism this prediction can be compared to experimental observations to see whether they are consistent with the proposed mechanism to do the numerical integration it is necessary to know the initial concentrations of all of the chemical species and to know or assume values of all of the rate constants the initial concentrations are known from the procedure used to initiate the reaction however the rate constants must be determined by some iterative procedure in which initial estimates of the rate constants are used to predict concentrationversustime data
