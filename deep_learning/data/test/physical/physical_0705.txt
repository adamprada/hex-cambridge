and more than one differential equation may be needed to characterize the time rate of change of all of the species involved in the reaction we focus on conditions and approximations under which the rate of appearance of the final products in a multistep reaction mechanism can be described by a single differential equation the rate law we examine the application of these approximations to a particular reaction mechanism when we understand the application of these approximations to this mechanism the ways in which they can be used in other situations are clear consider the following sequence of elementary steps
