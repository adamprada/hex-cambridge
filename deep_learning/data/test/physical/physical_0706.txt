practice the approximate treatments we consider next are more expedient when we begin a kinetic study we normally have a working hypothesis about the reaction mechanism and we design our experiments to simplify the differential equations that apply to it for the present example we will assume that we always arrange the experiment so that and in consequence at all times also we restrict our considerations to experiments in which this exemplifies the use of flooding the practical effect is that the concentration of remains effectively constant at its initial value throughout the entire reaction which simplifies the differential equations
