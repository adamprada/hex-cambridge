steadystate approximation is applicable to see what we mean by these terms let us consider some particular relationships that can exist among the rate constants in the mechanism above case i suppose that and we often describe this situation by saying rather imprecisely that the reaction to convert to is very fast and that the reaction to convert back to and is very slowcompared to the reaction that forms from and when is produced in these circumstances it is converted to so rapidly that we never observe a significant concentration of in the reaction mixture the formation of a molecule
