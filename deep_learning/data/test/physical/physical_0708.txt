a ratedetermining step step is an approximation in general the consequence we have in mind when we invoke this approximation is that no intermediate species can accumulate to a significant concentration if it is produced by the ratedetermining step or by a step that occurs after the ratedetermining step we do not intend to exclude the accumulation of a species that is at equilibrium with another product thus in the mechanism we suppose that the conversion of to is ratedetermining and that the interconversion of and is so rapid that their concentrations always satisfy the equilibrium relationship for the purpose
