is different as in case iib the pseudofirstorder rate constant is a composite quantity but now its dependence on is more complex the result for case iic reduces to that for case iib if case iii in the cases above we have assumed that one or more reactions are intrinsically much slower than others are the differential equations for this mechanism can also become much simpler if all three reactions proceed at similar rates but do so in such a way that the concentration of the intermediate is always very small if the concentration of is always very small then
