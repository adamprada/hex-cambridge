that the timederivative of the intermediates concentration is negligible compared to the reaction rate so that it is a good approximation to set it equal to zero the idea is simply that if the concentration is always small its timederivative must also be small if the graph of the intermediates concentration versus time is always much lower than that of other participating species then its slope will be much less equating the time derivative of the steadystate intermediates concentration to zero produces an algebraic expression that involves the intermediates concentration solving this expression for the concentration of the steadystate intermediate
