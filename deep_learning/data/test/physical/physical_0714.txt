in terms of partial derivatives two important examples are the molar heat capacities and which can be expressed as and these are properties that can be measured experimentally and tabulated for many substances these quantities can be used to calculate changes in quantities since they represent the slope of a surface or in the direction of the specified path constant or this allows us to use the following kinds of relationships and delta h int leftdfracpartial hpartial trightp dt because thermodynamics is kind enough to deal in a number of state variables the functions that define how those variable change
