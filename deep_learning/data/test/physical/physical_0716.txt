these relationships depend on an important class of variables known as state variables state variables are those variables which depend only upon the current conditions affecting a system pressure temperature and molar volume are examples of state variables a number of variables required to describe the flow of energy in a system do depend on the pathway a system follows to come into its current state to illustrate the difference consider climbing a mountain you may choose to walk straight up the side of the mountain or you may choose to circle the mountain several times in order to get
