extraordinarily useful relationship since one of the terms is expressible entirely in terms of measurable quantities left dfracpartial vpartial t rightp valpha the pressure dependence of is given by the pressure derivative at constant temperature left dfracpartial gpartial p rightt v labelmax which is simply the molar volume for a fairly incompressible substance such as a liquid or a solid the molar volume will be essentially constant over a modest pressure range example gold under pressure the density of gold is gcm calculate for a g sample of gold when the pressure on it is increased from atm to atm
