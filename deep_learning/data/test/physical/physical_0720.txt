biochemistry at california state university east bay contributors and attributions since the equilibrium constant is a function of which is defined for a specific composition all reactants in their standard states and at unit pressure or fugacity changes in pressure have no effect on equilibrium constants for a fixed temperature however changes in pressure can have profound effects on the compositions of equilibrium mixtures to demonstrate the relationship one must recall daltons law of partial pressures according to this relationship the partial pressure of a component of a gasphase mixture can be expressed it is the combination of mole fractions
