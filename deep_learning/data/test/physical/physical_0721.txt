in order to maintain a constant value of example consider the following reaction at equilibrium in which direction will the equilibrium shift if the volume of the reaction vessel is decreased solution a decrease in the volume will lead to an increase in total pressure since the equilibrium constant can be expressed as an increase in pressure will lead to an increase in to maintain a constant value of so the reaction will shift to form more of the products and note this should make some sense since a shift to the side of the reaction with fewer moles of
