later section the principle of le chateliers can be used as a guide to predict how the equilibrium composition will respond to a change in pressure le chateliers principle when a stress is introduced to a system at equilibrium the system will adjust so as to reduce the stress le chatliers principle is fairly clear on how to think about the addition or removal of reactants or products for example the addition of a reactant will cause the system to shift to reduce the partial pressure of the reactant it can do this by forming more products an important exception
