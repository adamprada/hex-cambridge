of the container is doubled what are the equilibrium partial pressures and mole fractions of a and b if atm of ar an inert gas is introduced into the system described in b what are the equilibrium partial pressures and mole fractions of a and b once equilibrium is reestablished solution part a first we can use an ice table to solve part a a b initial atm change x x equilibrium atm x x so for convenience consider to have units of atm solving for yields values of clearly while a solution to the mathematical problem is not physically
