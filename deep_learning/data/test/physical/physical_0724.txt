the new equilibrium partial pressures are and the mole fractions are we can see that the mole fraction of decreased and the mole fraction increased this is the result expected by le chatliers principle since the lower total pressure favors the side of the reaction with more moles of gas part c we introduce atm of an inert gas the new partial pressures are and because the partial pressures of a and b are unaffected the equilibrium does not shift what is affected is the composition and so the mole fractions will change and since within roundoff error the value
