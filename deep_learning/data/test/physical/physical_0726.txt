one such measurement is very close to the average speed in any other such measurement we are now able to treat this question quantitatively for gas at k and bar roughly molecules collide with a square millimeter of wall every microsecond see problem the standard deviation of the velocity of an molecule is using the central limit theorem the standard deviation of the average of molecular speeds is the distribution of the average of molecular speeds is very narrow indeed similarly when molecular velocities follow the maxwellboltzmann distribution function we can show that the expected value of the pressure for
