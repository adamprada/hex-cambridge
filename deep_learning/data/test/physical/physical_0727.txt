with a particular molecular velocity is just a numbera number that depends only on the velocity given a velocity the probability density associated with that velocity must be independent of our choice of coordinate system we can express the threedimensional probability density using any coordinate system we turn now to expressing velocities and probability density functions using spherical coordinates just as we did for the cartesian velocity components we deduce the cumulative probability functions and for the sphericalcoordinate components our deduction of from the experimental data uses values that are associated with all possible values of and corresponding statements apply
