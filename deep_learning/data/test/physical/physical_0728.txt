spherical coordinates when and specify the velocity is the probability per unit volume at that velocity we want to use to express the probability that an arbitrarily selected molecule has a velocity vector whose magnitude lies between and while its component lies between and and its component lies between and this is just times the velocityspace volume included by these ranges of and when we change from cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates the transformation is see figure as sketched in figure an incremental increase in each of the coordinates of the point specified by the vector advances the vector to
