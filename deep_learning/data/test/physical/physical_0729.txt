maxwells argument by taking his assumption to mean that the threedimensional probability density function is expressible as a product of three onedimensional functions that is we take maxwells assumption to assert the existence of independent functions and such that the probability that the and components of velocity lie between and and and and becomes since and are independent it follows that moreover the assumption that velocity is independent of direction means that must actually be independent of that is must be a constant we let this constant be so by the same argument we set each of these probabilitydensity functions
