if we push the marble along the path in part d with a force just large enough to overcome the force of gravity what is the increment of work associated with an increment of motion f how much work must we do if we are to move the marble from to point along the path in part d using the force in part e what is the relationship between this amount of work and the change in the energy of the marble during this process g suppose that we push the marble up the surface from point to point along
