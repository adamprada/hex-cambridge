and for the gas in this process a mole sample of a monatomic ideal gas is expanded irreversibly from l to l at a constant applied pressure equal to the final pressure of the gas the initial and final temperatures are k how much work is done on the gas what are and for the gas in this process compare and for this process to the corresponding quantities for the process in problem compare the initial and final states of the gas to the corresponding states in problem a mole sample of a monatomic ideal gas is expanded reversibly and
