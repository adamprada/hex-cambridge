headers when we sample a particular distribution the value that we obtain depends on chance and on the nature of the distribution described by the function the probability that any given trial will produce in the interval is equal to we often find situations in which a second function of call it is also of interest if we sample the distribution and obtain a value of the random variable then the value of associated with that trial is the question arises given and the distribution function what should we expect the value of to be that is if we get
