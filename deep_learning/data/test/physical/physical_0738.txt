and the probability that the needle lands in or is in this new game the payoff is when the needle lands in either segment or segment we can use any of the arguments that we have made previously to see that the expected payoff game is now however the analysis that is most readily generalized recognizes that the payoff from this game is just the sum of the payout from the previous game plus the payout from a game in which the sole payout is whenever the needle lands in segment for the new game we have we can devise
