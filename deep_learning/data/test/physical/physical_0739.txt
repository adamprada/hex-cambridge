single trial is always the probabilityweighted sum over all possible outcomes of the value of each outcome a common notation uses angular brackets to denote the expected value for a function of the random variable the expected value of is for a discrete distribution with exhaustive mutuallyexclusive outcomes probabilities and outcome values payoffs we define the expected value expected value of to be now let us examine the expected value of from a slightly different perspective let the number of times that each of the various outcomes is observed in a particular sample of observations be we have the set
