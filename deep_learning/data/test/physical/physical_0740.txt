a second sample of observations produces a second estimate of if is small successive estimates of may differ significantly from one another if we make a series of observations multiple times we obtain multiple population sets in general the population set from one series of observations is different from the population set for a second series of observations if collecting such samples of a sufficiently large number of times must produce some population sets more than once and among those that are observed more than once one must occur more often than any other we call it the most probable
