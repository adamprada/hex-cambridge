a number that is much less than the number of possible outcomes we encounter this situation in our discussion of statistical thermodynamics in chapter we find that the number of molecules in a system can be much smaller than the number of outcomesobservable energy levelsavailable to any given molecule if many more than outcomes have about the same probability repeated collection of samples of observations can produce a series of population sets each population set different from all of the others in each of which every element is either zero or one when this occurs it may be that no
