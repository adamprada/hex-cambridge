is much less than the number of outcomes that have appreciable probability which is so let us take the number of trials to be if the value of for each of the middle outcomes is the same say for then our calculation of the expected value of will be regardless of which population set results from the four trials that is because all of the populations sets that have a significant chance to be observed have and for exactly four values of in the range all of the population sets that have a significant chance to be observed give rise
