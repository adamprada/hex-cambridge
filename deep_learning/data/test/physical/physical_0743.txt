be the lower limit of in the interval then the probability that a given trial yields a value of the random variable in the interval is and we can approximate the expected value of for the continuous distribution by the finite sum in the limit as becomes arbitrarily large and all of the intervals become arbitrarily small the expected value of for a continuous distribution becomes this integral is the value of where is the probability density function for the distribution if c is a constant we have if is a second function of the random variable we have rate
