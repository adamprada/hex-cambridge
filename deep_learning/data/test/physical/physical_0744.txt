the measured concentration change divided by the elapsed time the accuracy of initialrate measurements is often poor this can result from concentration variations associated with initiation of the reaction the actual mixing process is not instantaneous and significant reaction can occur before the mixture becomes truly homogeneous measuring small changes in concentration with sufficient accuracy can also be difficult enzymes are naturally occurring catalysts for biochemical reactions in the study of enzymecatalyzed reactions it is usually possible to select the enzyme concentration and other reaction conditions so that the initial rate can be measured with adequate accuracy for such studies
