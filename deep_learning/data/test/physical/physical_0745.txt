law and evaluate the rate constants that appear in it table hypothetical reaction rate data table presents data for a hypothetical reaction that serve to illustrate the basic concept we suppose that initial rates have been determined for four different combinations of initial concentrations comparison of the first and second experiments indicates that doubling doubles the reaction rate indicating that the rate depends on to the first power comparison of the first and third experiments indicates that doubling leaves the reaction rate unchanged implying that the rate is independent of comparison of the first and fourth experiments indicates that doubling
