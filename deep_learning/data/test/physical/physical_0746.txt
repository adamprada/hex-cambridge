an elementary bimolecular reaction rate law between molecules and we recognize that the reaction can occur only when the molecules come into contact they must collide before they can react so the probability that they react must be proportional to the probability that they collide and the number of molecules of product formed per unit time must be proportional to the number of collisions that occur in unit time in our development of the collision theory for bimolecular reactions in the gas phase to we find that the number of such collisions is proportional to the concentration of each reactant
