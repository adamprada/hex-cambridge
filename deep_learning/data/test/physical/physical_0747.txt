the number of collisions proportionately the number of collisions must also be proportional to the concentration of molecules we conclude that the rate for any bimolecular reaction between molecular substances and is described by the equations this is a secondorder rate law and the proportionality constant is called a secondorder rate constant in section we derive an equation for the frequency with which a type molecule collides with type molecules in the gas phase when the concentration of type molecules is and the kinetic energy along the line of centers exceeds a threshold value per molecule or per mole the
