same the difference being a factor of in the preexponential factor the effect of the term is usually small in comparison to the effect of temperature in the exponential term thus the temperature dependence predicted by collision theory which is a highly simplified theoretical model and that predicted by the arrhenius equation which is an empirical generalization usually used to describe data taken over a limited temperature range are in substantial agreement experimentally determined values of the preexponential factor for gasphase bimolecular reactions can approach the value calculated from collision theory however particularly for reactions between polyatomic molecules the experimental
