molecules have the relative orientation that is necessary for reaction to occur of course must be less than one taking this amplification of the collision model into account the relationship between the reaction rate and the collision frequency becomes when we consider reactions in solution we recognize that there are usually many more solvent molecules than reactant molecules as a result collisions of a reactant molecule with solvent molecules are much more frequent than collisions of a molecule of one reactant with a molecule of another reactant the high frequency of collisions with solvent molecules means that the net distance
