molecule and a molecule must be very close to one another at exactly the time that a molecule encounters the pair of them if the reactants are not very concentrated the probability that a given molecule is very close to a molecule during any short time interval is small the probability that this molecule will be hit by a molecule during the same time interval is also very small the probability that all three species will collide at the same time is the product of two small probabilities under any given set of conditions the number of collisions involving three
