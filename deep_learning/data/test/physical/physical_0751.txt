a molecule spontaneously undergoes a chemical change if we suppose that there is a constant probability that any given molecule undergoes reaction in unit time then the total number reacting in unit time is proportional to the number of molecules present let the average number of moles reacting in unit time be the number of molecules in the system be and the proportionality constant be we choose a unit of time that is small enough to insure that if the probability of reaction is constant we have since is the number of moles that react in unit time the number
