can react and that this excess energy must be in some specific internal motion before the reaction can occur molecules exchange energy by colliding with one another when a molecule acquires excess energy as the result of a collision redistribution of this energy among the motions available to the molecule is not instantaneous a characteristic length of time is required for excess energy to reach the specific internal motion that leads to reaction any given molecule can retain excess energy only for the short time between two collisions the molecule gains excess energy in one collision and loses it in
