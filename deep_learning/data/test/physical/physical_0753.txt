that intermolecular forces of attraction or repulsion have no effect on this rate when our goal is to predict rate laws from reaction mechanisms this assumption is almost always an adequate approximation however when we study chemical equilibria we often find that we must allow for the effects of intermolecular forces in order to obtain an adequate description in chemical thermodynamics we provide for the effects of such forces by introducing the idea of a chemical activity the underlying idea is that the chemical activity of a compound is the effective concentration of the compoundwe can view it as the
