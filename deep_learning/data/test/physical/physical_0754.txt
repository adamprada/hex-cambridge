portion of the reactor contents is continuously removed at the same volumetric flow rate because the addition and removal of material occur at the same rate the reactor is always filled with a fixed volume of reaction mixture the reaction vessel and its contents are maintained at a constant temperature the vessel contains a stirrer which operates continuously and at a high enough speed to keep the contents of the vessel homogeneous free of concentration and temperature gradients at all times figure a continuous stirredtank reactor the essential idea involved in the operation of a cstr is that after the
