the vessel at the same flow rate the amount of in the reactor is increased by the flow of fresh reactant solution into the reactor it is decreased both by reaction and by the flow of solution out of the reactor the steadystate reaction rate is the number of moles of reactant consumed by the reaction per unit time per unit volume of reaction vessel after all of the reagent concentrations have become constant since is a reactant this rate is where is the contribution that the reaction makes to the rate at which the number of moles of in
