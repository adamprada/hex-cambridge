with the feed is given by the number leaving with the effluent is given by in unit time the contribution that the reaction makes to the change in the number of moles of present is when the steady state is reached the number of moles entering plus the change due to reaction must equal the number of moles leaving or in unit time solving for we have we define reaction rate so that if is produced by the reaction the massbalance equation is as with the method of initial rates the rate law is determined by measuring reaction rates in
