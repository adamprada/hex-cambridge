measure changes it is impossible to measure an absolute value of the variable itself in these cases it is necessary to define a zero to the scale defining the variable for enthalpy the definition of a zero is that the standard enthalpy of formation of a pure element in its standard state is zero all other enthalpy changes are defined relative to this standard thus it is essential to very carefully define a standard state definition the standard state the standard state of a substance is the most stable form of that substance at atmosphere pressure and the specified temperature
