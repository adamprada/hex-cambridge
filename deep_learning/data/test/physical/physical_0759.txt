calculating reaction enthalpies becomes a snap consider the heat combustion of methane at c as an example the reaction can expressed as a sum of a combination of the following standard formation reactions with with with delta hfo kjmol the target reaction can be generated from the following combination of reactions with with hg og rightarrow hol with delta hfo colorred times left kjmol right kjmol chg og rightarrow cog hol with alternately the reaction enthalpy could be calculated from the following relationship where is the stoichiometric coefficient of a species in the balanced chemical reaction for the combustion of
