other hand have to be interpreted in a very specific way when examining a reaction like the combustion of methane with the correct interpretation is that the reaction of one mole of chg with two moles of og to form one mole of cog and two moles of hol releases kj at c ionization reactions ionized species appear throughout chemistry the energy changes involved in the formation of ions can be measured and tabulated for several substances in the case of the formation of positive ions the enthalpy change to remove a single electron at k is defined as the
