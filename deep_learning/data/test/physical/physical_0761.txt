negative electron affinities since the formation of a negative ion is very unfavorable for these species just as in the case of ionization potentials an atom can have several electron affinities with with average bond enthalpies in the absence of standard formation enthalpies reaction enthalpies can be estimated using average bond enthalpies this method is not perfect but it can be used to get ballpark estimates when more detailed data is not available a bond dissociation energy is defined by with in this process one adds energy to the reaction to break bonds and extracts energy for the bonds that
