the result may be off systematically due to these differences also since the bond enthalpies are averaged over a large number of molecules containing the particular type of bond the results may deviate due to the variance in the actual bond enthalpy in the specific molecule under consideration typically reaction enthalpies derived by this method are only reliable to within contributors and attributions patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay reaction rates and rate laws last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics
