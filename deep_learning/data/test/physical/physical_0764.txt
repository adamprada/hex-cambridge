a tubular reactor it is usually a good approximation to assume that the material injected during one short time interval does not mix with the material injected during the next time interval as they pass through the tube we view the contents of the reactor as a series of fluid plugs that traverse the reactor independently of one another and call this behavior plug flow in section we discuss another simple flow stirred tank called a continuous stirredtank reactor cstr or a capacityflow reactor a cstr consists of a single constantvolume vessel into which reactants are continuously injected and from
