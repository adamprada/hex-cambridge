specifying the number of moles of a reactant that are consumed or the number of moles of a product that are produced per second by that reaction if we do so the amount of chemical change depends on the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant or product that we choose moreover the rate is proportional to the size of the system since the properties of reaction rates that are of interest to us are usually independent of the size of the system we find it convenient to express reaction rates as moles per second per unit system size so that the
