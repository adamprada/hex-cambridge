for the stoichiometry of the reaction and is independent of the size of the system moreover we must distinguish the effect of the reaction on the number of moles of a reagent present from the effects of other processes because competing reactions and mechanical processes can affect the amount of a substance that is present to develop the basic idea underlying our definition of reaction rate let us consider a chemical substance that undergoes a single reaction in a closed system whose volume is for a gasphase reaction this volume can vary with time so that the volume of any
