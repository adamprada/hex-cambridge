which only one reaction occurs most of the discussion in this chapter is directed toward reactions in which these conditions are satisfied and the system comprises a single homogeneous phase in the typical case we mix reactants with a liquid solvent in a reactor and immerse the reactor in a constanttemperature bath under these conditions the rate at which a particular substance reacts is equal to the rate at which its concentration changes writing to designate the molarity of we have if we express a reaction rate as a rate of concentration change it is essential that both conditions be
