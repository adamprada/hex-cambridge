stoichiometry we can use the extent of reaction to define a unique reaction rate the amounts of reactants and products present at any time are fixed by the initial conditions and the stoichiometry of the reaction let us write to denote the number of moles of reagent present at an arbitrary time and to denote the number of moles of present at the time that the reaction is initiated we define the extent of reaction as the change in the number of moles of a product divided by the products stoichiometric coefficient or as the change in the number of
