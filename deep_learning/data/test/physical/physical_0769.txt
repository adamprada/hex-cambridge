meaning we call it the fractional conversion when is the stoichiometrically limiting reactant the fractional conversion is the extent of reaction and the fractional conversion are related as we have and the rate of a reaction usually depends on the concentrations of some or all of the substances involved the dependence of reaction rate on concentrations is the rate law it must be determined by experiment for reaction the observed rate law is often of the form where are small positive or negative integers or less often simple fractions we use a conventional terminology to characterize rate laws like this
