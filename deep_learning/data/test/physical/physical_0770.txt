reaction nevertheless it is often possible to approximate the rate of the overall chemical change by a single differential equation which may be a relatively complex function of the concentrations of the species present in the reaction mixture for the reaction above the experimental observation might be in such cases we continue to call the differential equation the rate law the concept of an overall order is no longer defined the constants and may or may not be rate constants for elementary reactions that are part of the overall process nevertheless it is common to call any empirical constant that
