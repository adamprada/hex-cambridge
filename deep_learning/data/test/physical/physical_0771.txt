reactions at equilibrium chemical reactions may be occurring rapidly however no concentration changes can be observed because each reagent is produced by one set of reactions at the same rate as it is consumed by another set for the most part we focus on reactions that occur in closed constantvolume systems real gases last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry at california state university east bay the van der waals equationthe virial equationthe leonardjones potentialthe boyle temperaturecritical behaviorthe principle of corresponding statescontributors and attributions while the ideal gas law is sufficient for
