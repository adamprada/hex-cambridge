and are variables of a given substance which can be measured and tabulated in general molecules with large intermolecular forces will have large values of and large molecules will have large values of b some van der waals constants are given in table table van der waals constants for select species gas frequency of collisions a atm l mol b lmol he n co ch the van der walls model is useful because it makes it so simple to interpret the parameters in terms of molecular size and intermolecular forces but it does have limitations as well as is the
