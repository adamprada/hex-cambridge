this is a simple power series expansion in which the higherorder terms contain all of the deviations from the ideal gas law in the limit that bt the second virial coefficient and ct are zero the equation becomes the ideal gas law also the molar volume of gases are small the contributions from the third fourth etc terms decrease in magnitude allowing one to truncate the series at a convenient point the second virial coefficient can be predicted from a theoretical intermolecular potential function by the quality of an intermolecular potential can be determined partially by the potentials ability to
