through which they will experience attractive forces the socalled soft wall of the potential surface and then at very small separations the repulsive forces will dominate pushing the molecules apart the socalled hard wall of the potential surface a commonly used intermolecular potential is the leonardjones potential this function has the form where governs the width of the potential well and governs the depth the distance between molecules is given by the repulsive interactions between molecules are contained in the first terms and the attractive interactions are found in the second term figure the estimation of lennardjones potential parameters for
