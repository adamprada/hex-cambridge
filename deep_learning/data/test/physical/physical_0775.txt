der waals equation can be written in terms of molar volume equation refvdw when multiplying the right hand side by where yields this expression can be talyor expanded to the first three terms about which corresponds to an infinite molar volume the coefficient terms that are needed for the expansion are dfracdpdu bigu left dfracrtbu dfracbrtubu au rightu rt dfracdpdu bigu dfrac left dfracbrtbu dfracbrtbu dfracbrtubu au rightu rt a and the virial equation can then be expressed in terms of the van der waals parameters as substituting and simplifying gives the desired result and the second virial coefficient is
