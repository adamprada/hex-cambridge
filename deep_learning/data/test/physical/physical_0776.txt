of pressure at the higher temperatures in general there is one temperature the boyle temperature at which a gas will approach ideal behavior as the pressure goes to zero asymptotically and thus behave ideally over a broad range of lower pressures the boyle temperature is found by solving or using the virial equation of state equation refviral the boyle temperature can be expressed in terms of the virial coefficients starting with the compression factor and then differentiating with respect to yields so it can be concluded that at the boyle temperature the second virial coefficient is equal to zero this
