the critical point in order to solve for expressions for the critical constants one requires three equations the equation of state provides one relationship the second can be generated by recognizing that the slope of the isotherm at the critical point is zero and finally the third expression is derived by recognizing that the isotherm passes through an inflection point at the critical point using the van der waals equation as an example these three equations can be generated as follows figure condensation of a van der waal gas solving these expressions for and yields the critical variables can be
