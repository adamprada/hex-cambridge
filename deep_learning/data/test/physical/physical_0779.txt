equations exactly in the previous section we call the combination of boyles law and charles law the ideal gas equation we call the hypothetical substances that obey this equation ideal gases sometimes we refer to the classical gas laws collectively as the ideal gas laws at very high gas densities the classical gas laws can be very poor approximations as we have noted they are better approximations the lower the density of the gas in fact experiments show that the pressurevolumetemperature behavior of any real gasreal gas becomes arbitrarily close to that predicted by the ideal gas equation in the
