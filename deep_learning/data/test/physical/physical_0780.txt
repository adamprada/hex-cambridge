between them if we assume that there are no intermolecular forcesintermolecular forces acting between gas molecules we can develop exact theories for the behavior of macroscopic amounts of the gas in particular we can show that such substances obey the ideal gas equation we shall see that a complete absence of repulsive forces implies that the molecules behave as point masses evidently the difference between the behavior of a real gas and the behavior it would exhibit if it were an ideal gas is just a measure of the effects of intermolecular forces the ideal gas equation is not the
