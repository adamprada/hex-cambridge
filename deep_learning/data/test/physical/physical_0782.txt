is a definite direction of spontaneous change at all points along the expansion imagine instead a case where the expansion has no spontaneous direction of change as there is no net force push the gas to seek a larger or smaller volume the only way this is possible is if the pressure of the expanding gas is the same as the external pressure resisting the expansion at all points along the expansion with no net force pushing the change in one direction or the other the change is said to be reversible or to occur reversibly the work of a
