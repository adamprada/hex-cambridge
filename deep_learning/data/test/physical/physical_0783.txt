can be extracted from the integral equation refisothermal is derived for ideal gases only a van der waal gas would result in a different version example gas expansion what is the work done by mol an ideal gas expanding reversibly from a volume of l to a volume of l at a constant temperature of k solution using equation refisothermal to calculate this note a reversible expansion will always require more work than an irreversible expansion such as an expansion against a constant external pressure when the final states of the two expansions are the same the work of expansion
