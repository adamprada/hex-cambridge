pressure of the reversible expansion in general it will always be the case that the work generated by a reversible pathway connecting initial and final states will be the maximum work possible for the expansion it should be noted although it will be proven in a later chapter that for an isothermal reversible process involving only pv work is for an ideal gas this is true because the internal energy u is a measure of a systems capacity to convert energy into work in order to do this the system must somehow store that energy the only mode in which
