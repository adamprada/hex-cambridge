the system temperature drop constant volume pathways one common pathway which processes can follow is that of constant volume this will happen if the volume of a sample is constrained by a great enough force that it simply cannot change it is not uncommon to encounter such conditions with gases since they are highly compressible anyhow and also in geological formations where the tremendous weight of a large mountain may force any processes occurring under it to happen at constant volume if reversible changes in which the only work that can be done is that of expansion socalled pv work
