refisochoric is applicable for an isochoric process assuming is independent of temperature since this a constant volume pathway constant pressure pathways most laboratorybased chemistry occurs at constant pressure specifically it is exposed to the constant air pressure of the laboratory glove box or other container in which reactions are taking place for constant pressure changes it is convenient to define a new thermodynamic quantity called enthalpy or for reversible changes at constant pressure for which only pv work is done and just as in the case of constant volume changes this implies an important definition for the constant pressure heat
