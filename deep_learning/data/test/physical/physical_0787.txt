pressure of atm to a volume of l and a pressure of atm solution since this is an isothermal expansion equationrefisothermal is applicable since this is an isothermal expansion where due to boyles law adiabatic pathways an adiabatic pathway is defined as one in which no heat is transferred under these circumstances if an ideal gas expands it is doing work against the surroundings provided the external pressure is not zero and as such the internal energy must drop and since is negative there must also be a decrease in the temperature how big will the decrease in temperature be
