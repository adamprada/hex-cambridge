integrand in the term on the right the result is or or or once is known it is easy to calculate and example mol of an ideal gas cv r initially occupies l at k the gas expands adiabatically and reversibly to a final volume of l calculate and for the expansion solution since the pathway is adiabatic using equation refeqalternative so for calculating work we integrate equation refadiabate to get the following table shows recipes for calculating and for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible change along the specified pathway table thermodynamics properties for a reversible expansion or compression
