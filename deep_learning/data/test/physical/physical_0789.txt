consider idealized models because we want to develop theories that capture the most important features of real systems we ignore less important features in the present example we know that the behavior of the bowling ball will be slightly influenced by its frictional interaction with the surrounding atmosphere we attribute these interactions to a property of air that we call viscosity we assume that this effect can be ignored this causes no difficulty so long as our experiments are too insensitive to observe the effects of this atmospheric drag if necessary of course we could do our experiments inside a
