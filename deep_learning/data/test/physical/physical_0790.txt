velocity and height as and we have and letting the gravitational acceleration be the gravitational force on the ball is to raise the ball we must apply a vertical force that makes the net force on the ball greater than zero that is we require so that if is constant is constant we find for the height and velocity of the ball at any later time and let us consider the state of the system when the ball reaches a particular height let the corresponding time velocity kinetic energy and potential energy at be and respectively since and we have
