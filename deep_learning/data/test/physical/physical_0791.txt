to reach when it arrives its velocity and kinetic energy are smaller and smaller however no matter how long it takes the ball to reach when it arrives its potential energy is now let us consider the energy change in a process in which the ball begins at rest at height zero and ends at rest at at the end we have to effect this change in a real system we must apply a net upward force to the ball to get it moving later we must apply a net downward force to slow the ball in such a way
