see that the hypothetical process is the limiting case in a series of real processes in which we make smaller and smaller in all of these processes the potential energy change is if the ball is stationary and the ball remains at rest whatever its height if we make the ball rises if we make the ball falls if and the ball is moving only slowly in either direction a very small change in can be enough to reverse the direction of motion these are the characteristics of a reversible process an arbitrarily small change in the applied force changes
