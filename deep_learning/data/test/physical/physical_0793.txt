the ball is equal to the work done on the ball we have gravitational potential energy is an important factor in some problems of interest in chemistry other forms of potential energy are important much more often typically our principal interest is in the potential energy change associated with a change in the chemical composition of a system we are seldom interested in the kinetic energy associated with the motion of a macroscopic system as a whole we can include effects that arise from gravitational forces or from the motion of the whole system in our thermodynamic models but we
