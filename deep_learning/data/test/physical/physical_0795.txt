greater than the gas pressure by any eversosmall amount the gas will be compressed conversely if the applied pressure is infinitesimally less than the gas pressure the gas will expand the work done under such conditions is reversible work an arbitrarily small change in the relative pressures can reverse the direction in which the piston moves we summarize these conditions by saying that reversible pressurevolume work can occur only if the system and its surroundings are at mechanical equilibrium now let us think about calculating the reversible work for isothermally compressing a gas by sliding a piston into a cylinder
