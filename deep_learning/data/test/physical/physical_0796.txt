reversible versus irreversible expansion of an ideal gas in contrast an irreversible expansion corresponds to movement of the piston when or equivalently therefore the work done on the gas is less in the reversible case than it is in the irreversible case both work terms are less than zero the absolute value of the reversible work is greater than the absolute value of the irreversible work from our definitions of reversible and irreversible pressurevolume work we have and so long as the initial and final states are the same in the irreversible process as they are in the reversible constanttemperature
