well defined only in the equilibrium state that precedes the irreversible pressure drop and in the equilibrium state that the system ultimately attains it is convenient to describe these two processes as a reversible process and a spontaneous process that take the system from the same initial state to the same final state however this language obscures a significant point in the initial state for the reversible process we have in the initial state for the spontaneous process we have and what we mean of course is that the values of all of the state functions for the hypothetical initial
