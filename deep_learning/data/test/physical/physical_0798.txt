law of thermodynamics finally let us consider a reversible process in which a system completes a pressurevolume cycle the system traverses a closed path in the pressurevolume plane such a path is depicted in figure we let the smallest and largest volumes reached during the cycle be and respectively the closed path is composed of a highpressure segment and a lowpressure segment that meet at and on each of these segments the pressure is a function of volume we let pressures on the high and lowpressure segments be and respectively in the interval we have at the limiting volumes we
