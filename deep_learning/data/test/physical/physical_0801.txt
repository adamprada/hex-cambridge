the system and the pressure applied to the system by the surroundings differ by an arbitrarily small amount to abbreviate these statements we customarily introduce a figure of speech and say that for a reversible process or and that or since a reversible process involves a complementary exchange of energy increments between system and surroundings it is evident that an isolated system cannot undergo a reversible change any change that occurs in an isolated system must be spontaneous by the contrapositive an isolated system that cannot undergo change must be at equilibrium while and are necessary conditions for a reversible
