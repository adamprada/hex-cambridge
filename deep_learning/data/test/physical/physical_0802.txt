formation of water to occur at an arbitrarily slow ratea rate so slow that the temperature and pressure gradients that occur in the neighborhood of the catalyst are arbitrarily small nevertheless the reaction is a spontaneous process not a reversible one if the process were reversible an arbitrarily small increase in the applied pressure would be sufficient to reverse the direction of reaction causing water to decompose to hydrogen and oxygen rotations of molecules last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack simonsprofessor emeritus and henry eyring scientist chemistry at university of utah rotational motion for rigid diatomic
