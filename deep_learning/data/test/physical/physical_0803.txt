psi e psi or where is the square of the total angular momentum operator expressed in polar coordinates above the angles and describe the orientation of the diatomic molecules axis relative to a laboratoryfixed coordinate system and is the reduced mass of the diatomic molecule the differential operators can be seen to be exactly the same as those that arose in the hydrogenlikeatom case discussed earlier in this chapter therefore the same spherical harmonics that served as the angular parts of the wave function in the hydrogenatom case now serve as the entire wave function for the socalled rigid rotor
