are of spectroscopic relevance because as shown in chapter angular momentum selection rules often restrict the changes in that can occur upon photon absorption to and are given by these energy spacings are of relevance to microwave spectroscopy which probes the rotational energy levels of molecules in fact microwave spectroscopy offers the most direct way to determine molecular rotational constants and hence molecular bond lengths the rigid rotor provides the most commonly employed approximation to the rotational energies and wave functions of linear molecules as presented above the model restricts the bond length to be fixed vibrational motion of the
