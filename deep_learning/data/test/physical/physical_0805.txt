energies at which these peaks occur should grow linearly with as shown above an example of such a progression of rotational lines is shown in the figure figure typical rotational absorption profile showing intensity vs value of the absorbing level the energies at which the rotational transitions occur appear to fit the formula rather well the intensities of transitions from level to level vary strongly with primarily because the population of molecules in the absorbing level varies with these populations are given when the system is at equilibrium at temperature in terms of the degeneracy of the jth level and
