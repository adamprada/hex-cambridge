jji hbar k leftfracia fraciright for prolate tops ejkm frachbar jji hbar k leftfracic fraciright for oblate tops again for and ie or and quantum numbers respectively ranging from to in unit steps since the energy now depends on these levels are only degenerate due to the different values that arise for each value notice that for prolate tops because is smaller than the energies increase with increasing for given in contrast for oblate tops since is larger than the energies decrease with for given the eigenfunctions are the same rotation matrix functions as arise for the sphericaltop case so
