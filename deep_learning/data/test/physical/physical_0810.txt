earlier this matrix will not be diagonal because the functions are not eigenfunctions of the asymmetric top however the matrix can be formed in this basis and subsequently brought to diagonal form by finding its eigenvectors and its eigenvalues the vector coefficients express the asymmetric top eigenstates as because the total angular momentum still commutes with each such eigenstate will contain only one value and hence can also be labeled by a quantum number psinj thetaphichi summ k cn jmk j m krangle to form the only nonzero matrix elements of within the basis one can use the following properties
