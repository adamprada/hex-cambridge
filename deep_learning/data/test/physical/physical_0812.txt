at which the amount of changes is if there are numerous such processes whose rates are the observed overall rate is if the volume is constant and to illustrate these ideas let us consider the base hydrolyses of methyl and ethyl iodide no intermediates are observed in these reactions if we carry out the base hydrolysishydrolysisethyl iodide of methyl iodide in a closed constantvolume system we can express the reaction rate in several equivalent ways if a mixture of methyl and ethyl iodide is reacted with aqueous base both hydrolysis reactions consume hydroxide ion and produce iodide ion the rates
