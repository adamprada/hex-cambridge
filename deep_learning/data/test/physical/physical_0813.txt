to undergo hydrolysis the extent of reaction becomes constant because ethyl acetate molecules are produced from acetic acid and ethanol at the same rate as they are consumed by hydrolysis evidently the rate of the forward reaction does not fall to zero even though the net reaction rate does let represent the number of moles of ethyl acetate undergoing hydrolysis per unit time per unit volume let represent the number of moles of ethyl acetate being produced per unit time per unit volume the net rate of consumption of ethyl acetate is at equilibrium and in such cases it can
