when the product concentrations are low under these conditions and from the rate law that we find and the equilibrium concentrations we can calculate the rate of the forward reaction at equilibrium likewise when the ethyl acetate concentration is low the rate of the hydrolysis reaction is negligible in comparison to that of the esterification reaction we have and and we can find the rate law for the esterification reaction by studying the rate of the esterification reaction when the concentration of ethyl acetate is negligible from this rate law we can calculate the rate of the reverse reaction at
