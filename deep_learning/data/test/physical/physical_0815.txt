the temperature will decrease over time as a sample is allowed to cool when the substance undergoes a phase change say from liquid to solid the temperature will stop changing while heat is extracted due to the phase change the temperature at which the halt occurs provides one point on the boundary at the temperature of the halt and the pressure at which the cooling curve was measured the same data can be obtained by heating the system using a technique such as scanning calorimetry in this experiment heat is supplied to a sample at a constant rate and the
