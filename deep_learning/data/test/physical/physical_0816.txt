mostly a and liquid a and b solid mostly b and liquid a and b single phase liquid a and b figure phase diagram of a twocomponent system that exhibits an eutectic point the unlabeled regions on the sides of the diagram indicate regions where one solid is so miscible in the other that only a single phase solid forms this is different than the twophase solid region where there are two distinct phases meaning there are regions crystals perhaps that are distinctly a or b even though they are intermixed within on another region i contains two phases a
