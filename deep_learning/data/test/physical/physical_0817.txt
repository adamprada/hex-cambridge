small regions on either side of the phase diagram are negligibly small a simplified diagram with a form similar to that shown in figure can be used in this case it is assumed that the solids never form a single phase the tinlead system exhibits such behavor figure a simplified phase diagram of a twocomponent system that exhibits an eutectic point another important case is that for which the two compounds a and b can react to form a third chemical compound c if the compound c is stable in the liquid phase does not decompose upon melting the phase
