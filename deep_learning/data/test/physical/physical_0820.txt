that of the pure solid solute since the mole fraction at saturation is of interest we can solve for the difference in the chemical potentials is the molar gibbs function for the phase change of fusion so this can be rewritten it would be convenient if the solubility could be expressed in terms of the enthalpy of fusion for the solute rather than the gibbs function change fortunately the gibbshelmholtz equation gives us a means of making this change noting that differentiation of the above expression for with respect to at constant yields separating the variables puts this into an
