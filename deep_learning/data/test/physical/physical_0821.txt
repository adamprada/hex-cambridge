at california state university east bay contributors and attributions the solubility of ionic compounds in water can also be described using the concepts of equilibrium if you consider the dissociation of a generic salt mx the equilibrium expression is is the solubility product and is the equilibrium constant that describes the solubility of an electrolyte and again the pure solid mx is not included in the expression since it has unit activity throughout the establishment of equilibrium example what is the maximum solubility of cus at c solution yup time for an ice table initial change x x equilibrium x
