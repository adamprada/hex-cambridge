valence orbitals in cv symmetry are a and e orbitals ii in water the only core orbital is the o s and this becomes an a orbital in cv symmetry placing the molecule in the yz plane allows us to further analyze the remaining valence orbitals as o pz a o py as b and o px as b the h s h s combination is an a whereas the h s h s combination is a b iii placing the oxygens of ho in the yz plane z bisecting the oxygens and the cis hydrogens distorted slightly in x
