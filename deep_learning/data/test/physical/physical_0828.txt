integrals can be evaluated to give cn llbflnp lbfxlnp cn cosnp cos cn l cosnp cosnp cn cn cn cn if n is even then cn if n is odd then cn the probability of making a measurement of the energy and obtaining one of the eigenvalues given by en is pen if n is even pen if n is odd g ohlfx cieecj since ejdij cjcjeje for other properties cieecj but does not necessarily ajdij because the yj are not eigenfunctions of a unless ah cicje therefore in general other properties are time dependent a the lowest energy level
