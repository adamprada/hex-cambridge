etotall e e for l ¹ l l v lll ll l vl etotall e e in comparing the total energy at constant volume of the undistorted box l l l versus the distorted box l ¹ l l it can be seen that as long as l ³ l c in order to minimize the total energy expression take the derivative of the energy with respect to l and set it equal to zero but since v lll ll then l vl this substitution gives l v l v ll l l l l d calculate energy upon distortion
