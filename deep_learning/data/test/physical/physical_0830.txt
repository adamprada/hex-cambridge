r so h cylindrical coordinates fixed r the schr√∂dinger equation for a particle on a ring then becomes hy ey ef f the general solution to this equation is the now familiar expression ff ceimf ceimf where m application of the cyclic boundary condition ff ffp results in the quantization of the energy expression e where m it can be seen that the m values correspond to angular momentum of the same magnitude but opposite directions normalization of the wavefunction over the region to p corresponding to or m will result in a value of for the normalization constant ff
