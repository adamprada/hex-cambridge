easily accomplished by an exponential expansion of the cos function yf the wavefunction is now written in terms of the eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator but they need to include their normalization constant yf once the wavefunction is written in this form in terms of the normalized eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator having mas eigenvalues the probabilities for observing angular momentums of and can be easily identified as the squares of the coefficients of the corresponding eigenfunctions p p p a mv ev v v x cmsec the length of the n molecule is Ã¥ x cm v
