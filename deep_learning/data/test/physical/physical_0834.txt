salcaos are formed from the ss and p n atomic orbitals it can be seen that there are sg su pux puy pgx and pgy salcaos the hamiltonian matrices fock matrices are given each of these can be diagonalized to give the following mo energies sg and hartrees su and pux puy pgx pgy it can be seen that the sg orbitals are bonding the su orbitals are antibonding the pux and puy orbitals are bonding and the pgx and pgy orbitals are antibonding using these approximate energies we can draw the following mo diagram this mo diagram is not
