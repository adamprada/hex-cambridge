s ms s ms the states will be bms bms bms and bms b remember that when coupling nonequivalent linear molecule angular momenta one simple adds the individual lz values and vector couples the electron spin so in this case pupu we have ml values of and and the term symbol d is used to denote the spatially doubly degenerate level ml and there are two distinct spatially nondegenerate levels denoted by the term symbol s ml again two unpaired electrons will result in a singlet s ms and three triplets s mss mss ms the states generated are then
