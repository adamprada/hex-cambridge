coupling nonequivalent angular momenta since vector coupling results in a range from the sum of the two individual angular momenta to the absolute value of their difference in this case dd l and s the term symbols are g g f f d d p p s and s the l and s angular momenta can be vector coupled to produce further splitting into levels j l s l s denoting j as a term symbol subscript one can identify all the levels and subsequent j states g states g states g states g states f states f states f
