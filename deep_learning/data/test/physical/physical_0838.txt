states f states d states p states p states p state and s state a once the spatial symmetry has been determined by multiplication of the irreducible representations the spin coupling gives the result b there are three states here aaba and abbb c aaab a all the slater determinants have in common the sasbsasb core and hence this component will not be written out explicitly for each case pmlms papa apza pmlms papa aa ipxapya pmlms papa apza as you can see the symmetries of each of these states cannot be labeled with a single irreducible representation of the
