d for example sgspy this indicates that a configuration correlation diagram must be drawn with a barrier near the d asymptote to represent the fact that a ch correlates with a mixture of d and s carbon plus hydrogen the c h state to which the lowest b snspp ch state decomposes would be sgspypx f if you follow the b component of the cp h since it leads to the groundstate products to b ch you must go over an approximately kcalmole barrier of course this path produces b ch product distortions away from cv symmetry for example to
