using thermodynamic information for the reaction ie slopes and asymptotic energies for example an early barrier would be obtained for a reaction with the characteristics and a late barrier would be obtained for a reaction with the characteristics this relation between reaction endothermicity or exothermicity and the character of the transition state is known as the hammond postulate note that the cp h ch reaction of interest here has an early barrier g the reaction cd h ch a should have no symmetry barrier this can be recognized by following the a cd h reactants down to the a ch
