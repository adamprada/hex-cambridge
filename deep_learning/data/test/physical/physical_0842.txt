chcl has cv symmetry and therefore is a symmetric top chcl has cv symmetry and therefore is an asymmetric top b ccl has such high symmetry that it will not exhibit pure rotational spectra because it has no permanent dipole moment chcl and chcl will both exhibit pure rotation spectra nh is a symmetric top oblate use the given energy expression e a b k b jj a cm b cm selection rules dj and the fact that lies along the figure axis such that dk to give de b j b b and b j and so lines are
