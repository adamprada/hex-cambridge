along z lab fixed and is along z the ci molecule fixed bond the angle between z and z is b emcosb emd so i dd sinbdbdgda emsinbdbdgda now use dd to obtain i emsinbdbdgda now use sinbdbdgda djjdmmdkn to obtain i emdjjdmmdkn emjmjmjkjk we use jkjk and jmjm to give i em empijmjk empimk the j symbols vanish unless k k and m m so i empimkdmmdkk b and vanish unless j j j j dj the k quantum number can not change because the dipole moment lies along the molecules c axis and the lights electric field thus
