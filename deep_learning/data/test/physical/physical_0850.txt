configurations are ps or ps these lead to p and s states respectively c the bond orders in both states are d the s is but gu symmetry cannot be specified since this is a heteronuclear molecule e only one excited state the p is spinallowed to radiate to the s consider symmetries of transition moment operators that arise in the electric dipole contributions to the transition rate z s xy p the p s is electric dipole allowed via a perpendicular band f since ionization will remove a bonding electron the bo bond is weaker than the bo bond
