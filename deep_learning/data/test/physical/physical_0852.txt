is fc sce in the ao basis the slater condon rule for zero spin orbital difference with n electrons in n spin orbitals is e if all orbitals are doubly occupied and we carry out the spin integration we obtain e where i and j now refer to orbitals not spinorbitals if the occupied orbitals obey ffk ekfk then the expression for e in problem can be rewritten as e we recognize the closed shell fock operator expression and rewrite this as e i will use the qmic software to do this problem lets just start from the beginning get
