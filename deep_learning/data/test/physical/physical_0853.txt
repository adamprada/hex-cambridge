for the unique one and two electron integrals and places a canonical list of these on disk in a file we choose to call aointegralsdat at this point it is useful for us to step back and look at the set of equations which we wish to solve fc sce the qmic software does not provide us with a socalled generalized eigenvalue solver one that contains an overlap matrix or metric so in order to use the diagonalization program that is provided we must transform this equation fc sce to one that looks like fc ce we do that in
