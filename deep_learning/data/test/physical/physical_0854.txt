the program functmat this program generates a function of a matrix this program will ask for the elements of the s array and write to disk a file name of your choice a good name might be shalf containing the sarray now we are ready to begin the iterative fock procedure a calculate the fock matrix f using program fock which reads in the mo coefficients from mocoefsdat and the integrals from aointegralsdat and writes the resulting fock matrix to a user specified file a good filename to use might be something like fock b calculate f sfsusing the program
