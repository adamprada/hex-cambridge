and e e using the slaterconden rules to obtain the matrix elements between configurations we obtain hz now yzy cthzc this can be accomplished with the program utmatu t and yzy cthzc t g using the converged coefficients the orbital energies obtained from solving the fock equations are e and e the resulting expression for the pt firstorder wavefunction becomes s s s s s s h as you can see from part c the matrix element shss this is also a result of the brillouin theorem and hence this configuration does not enter into the firstorder wavefunction i s
