in the first and fourth states and the su and su states as the second and third states also notice that the first sg state has coefficients note specifically the combination and the second sg state has the opposite coefficients with the same signs note specifically the combination the combination always gives a higher energy than the combination f atoms have ssp p ground electronic states that are split by spinorbit coupling into p and p states that differ by only ev in energy a the degeneracy of a state having a given j is j and the j state
