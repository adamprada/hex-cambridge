exp which is approximately k a the difference between a linear and bent transition state would arise in the vibrational and rotational partition functions for the linear ts one has n vibrations recall that one loses one vibration as a reaction coordinate but for the bent ts one has n vibrations for the linear ts one has rotational axes and for the bent ts one has so the ratio of rate constants will reduce to ratios of vibration and rotation partition functions in particular one will have klinearkbent qvibn qrotqvibnqrot qvibqrot b using qt qr qv i would expect klinearkbent
