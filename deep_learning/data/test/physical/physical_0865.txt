sasasb sasbsa sbsasa one can immediately identify the wavefunctions for two of the quartets they are single entries ssms sasasa ssms sbsbsb applying s to ssms yields sssms ssms ssms ssasasa so ssms applying s to ssms yields sssms ssms ssms ssbsbsb so ssms it only remains to construct the doublet states which are orthogonal to these quartet states recall that the orthogonal combinations for systems having three equal components for example when symmetry adapting the sp hybrids in cv or dh symmetry give results of and notice that the quartets are the combinations and therefore the doublets can be
