are carrying out a montecarlo simulation involving ar atoms further suppose that the potentials are pairwise additive and that your computer requires approximately floating point operations fpos eg multiply add divide etc to compute the interaction potential between any pair of atoms d for each mc move we must compute only the change in potential energy to do this we need to compute only the change in the pair energies that involve the atom that was moved this will require x fpos the being the number of atoms other than the one that moved so for a million mc steps
