energy accompanying a mc move is proportional to the number of other atoms so the calculation would take x seconds or about seconds or about hours g we would be taking s s per step md steps each step requires that we compute all forcesvrij between all pairs of atoms there are x such pairs so to compute all the forces would require xx fpos x fpos so we will need x fposstep x steps fpos per second x seconds or about hours h the graduate student is times slower than the mflop computer so it will take herhim times
