these are the working equations that allow one to compute thermodynamic properties of stable molecules ions and even reactive species such as radicals in terms of molecular properties such as geometries vibrational frequencies electronic state energies and degeneracies and the temperature pressure and volume einstein and debye models of solids these two models deal with the vibrations of crystals that involve motions among the neighboring atoms ions or molecules that comprise the crystal these interfragment vibrations are called phonons in the einstein model of a crystal one assumes that each atom ion or molecule from which the crystal is constituted
