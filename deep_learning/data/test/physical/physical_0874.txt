local well that traps it if the crystal is isotropic the force constants that characterize the harmonic potential along the and directions are equal if not these parameters may be unequal it is these force constants along with the masses of the atoms ions or molecules that determine the harmonic frequencies of the crystal the interspecies phonon vibrational partition function of the crystal is then assumed to be a product of partition functions one for each atom ion or molecule in the crystal with each partition function taken to be of the harmonic vibrational form there is no factor of
