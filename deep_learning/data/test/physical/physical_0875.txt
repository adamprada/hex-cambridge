above divided by to avoid double counting the interspecies interaction energies this partition function can be subjected to the thermodynamic equations discussed earlier to compute various thermodynamic properties one of the most useful to discuss for crystals is the heat capacity which is given by see the vibrational contribution to expressed in section at very high temperatures this function can be shown to approach which agrees with the experimental observation know as the law of dulong and petit however at very low temperatures this expression approaches which goes to zero as approaches zero but not in a way that is
