low in the debye model of phonons in crystals one abandons the view in which each atom ion or molecule vibrates independently about it own equilibrium position and replaces this with a view in which the constituent species vibrate collectively in wavelike motions each such wave has a wave length and a frequency that are related to the speed of propagation of such waves in the crystal by the speed is a characteristic of the crystals interspecies forces it is large for stiff crystals and small for soft crystals in a manner much like we used to determine the density
