to be made is that the density of waves is proportional to it is conventional to define the parameter a in terms of the maximum frequency that one obtains by requiring that the integral of over all allowed add up to the total number of interspecies vibrations that can occur this then gives the constant a in terms of and and allows to be written as the debye model uses this wave picture and computes the total energy of the crystal much as done in the einstein model but with the sum over vibrational modes replaced by a continuous integral
