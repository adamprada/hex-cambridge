as so the debye heat capacity does indeed vary as at low as careful experiments indicate for this reason it is appropriate to use the debye model whenever one is interested in properly treating the energy heat capacity and other thermodynamic properties of crystals at temperatures for which is small at higher temperatures it is appropriate to use either the debye or einstein models the major difference between the two lies in how they treat the spectrum of vibrational frequencies that occur in a crystal the einstein model says that only one or at most three if three different values
