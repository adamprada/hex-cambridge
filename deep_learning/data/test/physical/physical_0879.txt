be aware of the starting point of the model is to consider a lattice containing sites each of which has nearest neighbor sites nb clearly will depend on the structure of the lattice and to imagine that each of these sites can exist in either of two states that we label a and b before deriving the basic equations of this model let me explain how the concepts of sites and a and b states are used to apply the model to various problems the sites can represent binding sites on the surface of a solid and the two states
