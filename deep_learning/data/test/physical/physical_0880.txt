kinds of molecules a and b might occupy in a liquid or solid in which case a and b are used to label whether each site contains an a or a b molecule this is how we apply the lattice theories to liquid mixtures the sites can represent cis and trans conformations in linkages within a polymer and a and b can be used to label each such linkage as being either cis or trans this is how we use these models to study polymer conformations in figure i show a twodimensional lattice having sites of which are occupied by
