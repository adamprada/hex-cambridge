considered one can write the total interaction energy of any arrangement as where is the number of nearest neighbor pairs of type ij and is the interaction energy of an ij pair the example shown in figure has and the three parameters that characterize any such arrangement can be reexpressed in terms of the numbers and of a and b species and the number of nearest neighbors per site as follows nbb nab cnb note that the sum of these two equations states the obvious fact that twice the sum of aa bb and ab pairs must equal the number
