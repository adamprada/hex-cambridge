well mixed the total partition function of the a and b species arranged on the lattice is written as follows here and are the partition functions electronic vibrational etc of the a and b species as they sit bound to a lattice site and is the number of ways that species of type a and of type b can be arranged on the lattice such that there are ab type nearest neighbors of course is the interaction energy discussed earlier the sum occurs because a partition function is a sum over all possible states of the system there are no
