interactions are highly attractive phase separation can occur if is positive phase separation will not occur the problem with the above expression for the partition function is that no one has yet determined an analytical expression for the degeneracy factor therefore in the most elementary lattice theory known as the braggwilliams approximation one approximates the sum over by taking the following average value of in the expression for this average is formed by taking the number of a sites and multiplying by the number of neighbor sites c and by the fraction of these neighbor sites that would be occupied
