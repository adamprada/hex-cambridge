in the gas phase in this way one uses the equilibrium conditions equal chemical potentials in two phases to relate the vapor pressures of a and b which arise through the gasphase chemical potentials to the interaction energy let me now show you how this is done first we use to compute the a and b chemical potentials on the lattice this gives and an analogous expression for with replacing the expression for the gasphase chemical potentials and given earlier in this chapter has the form mu kt ln leftleftdfracpi mkthbarright dfracktpright kt lnleftdfracsqrtpisigma sqrtdfracpi iakthbar sqrtdfracpi ibkthbar sqrtdfracpi ickthbarright
