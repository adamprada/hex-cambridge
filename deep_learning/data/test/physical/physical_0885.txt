species a in a case where the mole fraction of a is unity this gives where is the vapor pressure of a that exists over the lattice in which only a species are present we equate the gas and latticephase chemical potentials of a for an arbitrary chemical potential and obtain which contains the vapor pressure of a over the lattice covered by a and b with being the mole fraction of a subtracting these two equations and rearranging we obtain an expression for how the vapor pressure of a depends on recall that the quantity is related to the
