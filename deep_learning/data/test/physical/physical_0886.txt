average of the aa and bb interactions the vapor pressure of a is found to deviate negatively from the raoults law prediction this means that the observed vapor pressure is lower than is that expected based solely on raoults law on the other hand when is negative the vapor pressure deviates positively from raoults law figure plots of vapor pressures in an a b mixture as predicted in the lattice model with the braggwilliams approximation an especially important and interesting case arises when the parameter is negative and has a value that makes be more negative than it turns out
