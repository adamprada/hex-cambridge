which the a and b species do not remain mixed on the lattice but instead gather into two distinct kinds of domains one domain will be rich in the a species having an value equal to that shown in the right dot in figure the other domains will be rich in b and have an value of that shown by the left dot as i noted in the introduction to this section lattice models can be applied to a variety of problems we just analyzed how it is applied within the braggwilliams approximation to mixtures of two species in this
