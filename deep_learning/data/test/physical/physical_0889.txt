surface sites or between empty surface sites and adsorbed molecules so we can make the following replacements in our earlier equations na rightarrow nad where is the number of nearest neighbor pairs of adsorbed species and is the pairwise interaction energy between such a pair the primary result obtained by equating the chemical potentials of the gasphase and adsorbed molecules is here is the partition function of the gasphase molecules per unit volume is the partition function of the adsorbed molecules which contains the adsorption energy as and is called the coverage ie the fraction of surface sites to which
