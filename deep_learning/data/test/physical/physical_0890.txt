overcome thermal factors to cause phaseseparation to occur the kind of phase separation on observes is the formation of islands of adsorbed molecules separated by regions where the surface has little or no adsorbed molecules there is another area where this kind of lattice model is widely used when studying magnetic materials one often uses the lattice model to describe the interactions among pairs of neighboring spins eg unpaired electrons on neighboring molecules or nuclear spins on neighboring molecules in this application one assumes that up or down spin states are distributed among the lattice sites which represent where the
