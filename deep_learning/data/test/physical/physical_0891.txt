arich centers and other islands of brich centers is or virial corrections to idealgas behavior recall from our earlier treatment of classical partition function that one can decompose the total partition function into a product of two factors q dfrachnmnint exp big dfrachy pktbig dy dp int exp bigdfracurktbig dr one of which is the result if no intermolecular potentials are operative the second factor qrm inter dfracvn int exp bigdfracurktbig dr thus contains all of the effects of intermolecular interactions recall also that all of the equations relating partition functions to thermodynamic properties involve taking and derivatives of so
