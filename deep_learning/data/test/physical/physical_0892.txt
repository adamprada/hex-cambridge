follows the last equality being what defines these functions are introduced because whenever the molecules and are distant from one another and thus not interacting vanishes so approaches unity and thus vanishes in contrast whenever molecules and are close enough to experience strong repulsive interactions is large and positive so approaches these properties make a useful measure of how molecules are interacting if they are not if they are repelling strongly and if they are strongly attracting is large and positive inserting the functions into the product expansion of the exponential one obtains expbigdfracuktbig prodij fij sumij fij sumij sumkl
