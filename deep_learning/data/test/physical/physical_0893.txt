the two molecules r and the position of their center of mass the integral over gives one more factor of and the above cluster integral reduces to with the coming from the angular integral over the relative coordinate because the total number of molecules is very large it is common to write the factor as the cluster integrals containing two factors can also be reduced however it is important to keep track of different kinds of such factors depending on whether the indices are all different or not for example terms of the form with and all unique reduce again
