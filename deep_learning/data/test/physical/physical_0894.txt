produces a factor of when carried out thus the above cluster integral reduces to there is a fundamental difference between cluster integrals of the type and those involving the former are called unlinked clusters because they involve the interaction of molecules and and a separate interaction of molecules and the latter are called linked because they involve molecule interacting simultaneously with molecules and although and need not be close enough to cause to be nonzero the primary differences between unlinked and linked cluster contributions are the total number of unlinked terms is proportional to while the number of linked terms
