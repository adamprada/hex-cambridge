noted that doubly excited configurations analogous to are the most important contributions beyond the single determinant and that quadruple excitations in the form of unlinked products of double excitations were next most important not triple excitations the unlinked nature in this case was related to the amplitudes of the quadruple excitations being products of the amplitudes of two double excitations so both in electronic structures and in liquid structure one finds that pair correlations followed by unlinked pair correlations are the most important to consider clearly the cluster expansion approach to can be carried to higher and higherlevel clusters eg
