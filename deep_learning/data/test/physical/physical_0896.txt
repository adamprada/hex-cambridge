the pressure which is calculated as using and inserting the above expression for produces the following result for the pressure where the socalled virial coefficients and are defined as the factors proportional to and respectively the second virial coefficients expression in terms of the cluster integrals is b pi int f r dr pi int bigexpbigdfracurktbig big r dr the third virial coefficient involves higher order cluster integrals the importance of such cluster analysis is that they allow various thermodynamic properties eg the pressure above to be expressed as one contribution that would occur if the system consisted of noninteracting
