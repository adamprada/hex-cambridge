oklahoma school of science mathematics the probability of alternative eventsthe probability of compound events if we know the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a trial we can calculate the probabilities for combinations of outcomes these calculations are based on two rules which we call the laws of probability if we partition the outcomes into exhaustive and mutually exclusive events the laws of probability also apply to events since as we define them events is a more general term than outcomes we call them the law of the probability of alternative events and the law of the probability of compound
