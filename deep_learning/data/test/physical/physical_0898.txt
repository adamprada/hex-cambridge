belong to the same distribution the law of the probability of compound events applies to events that can come from one or more distributions an important special case occurs when the compound events are successive samplings of a given distribution that we identify as the parent distribution if the random variable is a number and we average the numbers that we obtain from successive samplings of the parent distribution these averagesof themselves constitute a distribution if we know certain properties of the parent distribution we can calculate corresponding properties of the distribution of averagesof values obtained by sampling the parent
