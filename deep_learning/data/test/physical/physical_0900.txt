of the outcomes of the second distribution and these probabilities are independent of one another we can calculate the probability of any outcome that belongs to the third distribution we call the rule for this calculation the law of the probability of compound events we discuss it further below a similar situation occurs when we consider the outcomes of tossing two coins we assume that we can tell the two coins apart call them coin and coin we designate heads and tails for coins and as and respectively there are four possible outcomes in the distribution we call tossing two
