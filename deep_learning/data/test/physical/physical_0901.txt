of repeated trials which is a frequently encountered type of distribution in general we call such a distribution a distribution of events from a trial repeated n times and we view this distribution as being completely equivalent to n simultaneous trials of the same kind chapter considers the distribution of outcomes when a trial is repeated many times understanding the properties of such distributions is the single most essential element in understanding the theory of statistical thermodynamics the central limit theorem relates properties of the repeatedtrials distribution to properties of the parent distribution the probability of alternative events if we
