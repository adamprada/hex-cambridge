is independent of the outcome of the first trial then the probability that occurs in the first trial and occurs in the second trial is equal to the product of the individual probabilities to illustrate this using outcomes from dietossing let us suppose that event is tossing a and event is tossing a then and the probability of tossing a in a first trial and tossing a in a second trial is then if we want the probability of getting one and one in two tosses we must add to this the probability of tossing a first and a second
