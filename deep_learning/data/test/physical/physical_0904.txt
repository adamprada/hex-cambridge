designate as is given by if we have the enthalpies of formation we can compute the enthalpy change for the reaction we can demonstrate this by writing out the chemical equations corresponding to the formation of a b c and d from their elements when we multiply these chemical equations by the appropriately signed stoichiometric coefficient and add them we obtain the chemical equation for the indicated reaction of a and b to give c and d see below because enthalpy is a state function the enthalpy change that we calculate this way will be valid for any process that
