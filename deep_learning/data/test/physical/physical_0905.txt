oxidation to distinguish it from the nonselective oxidation that produces carbon dioxide and water if the catalyst were not inordinately expensive or shortlived and the operating pressure were sufficiently low this would be an economical method for the manufacture of methanol methanol is currently manufactured from methane however the process involves two steps and requires a substantial capital investment if the cost of manufacturing methanol could be decreased sufficiently it would become economically feasible to convert natural gas which cannot be transported economically unless it is feasible to build a pipeline for the purpose into liquid methanol which is readily
