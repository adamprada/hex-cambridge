heat than would be produced by burning the methane from which it was produced we want to know how much heat energy is lost in this way another reason is that a manufacturing plant will have to control the temperature of the oxidation reaction in order to maintain optimal performance if the temperature is too low the reaction rate will be too slow if the temperature is too high the catalyst may be deactivated in a short time and the production of carbon oxides will probably be excessive a chemical engineer designing a plant will need to know how much
