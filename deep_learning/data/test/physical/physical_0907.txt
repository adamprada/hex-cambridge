another aspect of the conventions that we have developed note that is the difference between the enthalpies of formation of the separated products and the enthalpies of formation of the separated reactants we often talk about as if it were the enthalpy change that would occur if we mixed moles of with moles of and the reaction proceeded quantitatively to yield a mixture containing moles of and moles of this is usually a good approximation however to relate rigorously the standard enthalpy of reaction to the enthalpy change that would occur in a real system in which this reaction took
