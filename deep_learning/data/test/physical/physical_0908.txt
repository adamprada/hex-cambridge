mix known amounts of methane and oxygen in a pressure vessel and initiate the reaction using an electrical spark we allow the temperature to return to the original temperature of the reactants there is an accompanying pressure change experimentally we measure the heat evolved as the mixed reactants are converted to the mixed products at the original temperature to complete the process corresponding to the standard enthalpy change however we must also separate the products and bring them to a pressure of bar that is the standard enthalpy of reaction and the enthalpy change we would measure are related by
