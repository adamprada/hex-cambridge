possible to find such a pressure because any gas behaves as an ideal gas at a sufficiently low pressure since the enthalpy of an ideal gas is independent of pressure we can also think of a substance in its ideal gas standard state as a hypothetical substance whose pressure is one bar but whose molar enthalpy is that of the real gas at an arbitrarily low pressure iii for any substance at any particular temperature we define the standard enthalpy of formation as the enthalpy change for a reaction in which the product is one mole of the substance and
