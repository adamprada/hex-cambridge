in this chapter we introduce ideas that underlie classical thermodynamics because the development of classical thermodynamics relies on the properties of reversible processes we have devoted considerable attention to specifying what we mean by a reversible process and to the relationship between reversible processes and the equilibrium states available to a system in section we develop this theory the development assumes that we can measure the heat and work exchanged between a system and its surroundings it assumes that we can measure the state functions volume pressure temperature and the amounts moles of chemical substances in a system we define
