real system whose behavior approximates the ideal of reversibility as closely as possible we express theapproximateresult of any such measurement as a number normally we view the approximate character of the number to be a consequence of experimental error when we say that we make measurements on a system that is undergoing a reversible change we mean that we are making the measurements on a process that satisfies our definition of reversibility closely enough for the purpose at hand there are two reasons for the fact that reversible processes play an essential role in the development of the equations of
