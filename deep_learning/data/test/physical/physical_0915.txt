of the contents of the cylinder at any given instant the pressure temperature and component concentrations vary from place to place within the cylinder in general no single value of any of these intensive variables is an adequate approximation for use in the thermodynamic equations that characterize the system as a whole to explore this idea further let us think about measuring changes in extensive state functions during a spontaneous process since we are free to define the system as we please we can choose a definition that makes the volume readily measurable in the pistonengine example there is no
