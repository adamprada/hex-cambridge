measurements we imagine dividing the system into a large number of macroscopic subsystems each of these subsystems has a welldefined volume we suppose also that each of them has welldefined thermodynamic functions at any given instant that is we assume that the pressure temperature and concentrations are approximately homogeneous within each of these subsystems if this condition is satisfied we can sum up the number of moles of a component in each of the subvolumes to obtain the number of moles of that component in the whole system we can make a similar argument for any extensive thermodynamic function so
