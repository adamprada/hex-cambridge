functions it is true that we could produce a weightedaverage value for the temperature by multiplying the temperature of each subsystem by the subsystem volume adding up the products and dividing the sum by the volume of the whole system however the result would not be an intensive property of the whole system for one thing we could produce a different average temperature for every extensive variable by using it rather than the volume as the weighting factor in the averagetemperature computation moreover no such weightedaverage temperature can reflect the fact that different temperatures in different subsystems result in grossly
