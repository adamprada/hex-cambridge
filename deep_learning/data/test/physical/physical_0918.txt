need not be homogenous we commonly encounter systems that are homogeneous to within some arbitrarily small deviation consider a closed and wellstirred system in which some chemical reaction is occurring slowly we immerse this system in a constanttemperature bath and arrange for the applied pressure to be constant from experience we know that the temperature and pressure within such a system will be essentially constant equal to the bath temperature and the applied pressure respectively and homogeneous throughout the system in such a system the temperature and the pressure of the system are at equilibrium with those imposed by the
