addition of terms that express the effects of changing composition in section we develop the fundamental equation which applies to any reversible process in a closed system in section we infer that the fundamental equation becomes for a spontaneous process in which and are the chemical potentialchemical potential and the change in the number of moles of component respectively the distinction between reversiblereversible process and spontaneous processspontaneous processes plays a central role in our theory we find a group of relationships that express this distinction and we call these relationships criteria for change in section we find that if and
