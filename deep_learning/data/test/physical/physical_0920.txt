example we can find relationships among the molar volume and other thermodynamic properties of liquid water liquid water does not exist at c and bar so we cannot undertake to measure its thermodynamic properties however by using our relationships among state functions and properties that we measure for liquid water where it does exist we can estimate the thermodynamic properties of liquid water at c and bar the results are two steps removed from reality they are the estimated properties of a hypothetical substancehypothetical substance nevertheless they have predictive value for example we can use them to predict that liquid
