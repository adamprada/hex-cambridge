consider such compositionbased criteria only for homogeneous systems an extensive theory has been developed to model spontaneous processes in systems that are not necessarily homogeneous this theory is often called irreversible thermodynamics or nonequilibrium thermodynamics development of this theory has led to a wide variety of useful insights about various molecular processes however much of what we are calling classical thermodynamics also describes irreversible processes even as we develop our theory of reversible thermodynamics we use arguments that apply the equations we infer from reversible processes to describe closely related systems that are not at equilibrium statistical thermodynamics last updated
