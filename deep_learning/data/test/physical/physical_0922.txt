development of statistical thermodynamics by using the energy levels of an individual molecule to find its molecular partition function and the thermodynamic properties of a system that contains noninteracting molecules of that substance later we see that the partition function of a system containing molecules that do interact with one another can be found by very similar arguments statistical thermodynamics has also been applied to the general problem of predicting reaction rates this application is called transition state theory or the theory of absolute reaction rates in principle we should be able to predict the rate of any reaction to
