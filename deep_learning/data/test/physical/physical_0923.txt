to give generally reliable reaction rate predictions the theory of absolute reaction rates is an important application of statistical thermodynamics however it is not included in this book quantum mechanical calculations are not the only way to obtain the energylevel information that is needed to evaluate partition functions particularly for small molecules these energy levels can be deduced from spectroscopic data in these cases the theory of statistical thermodynamics enables us to calculate thermodynamic properties from spectroscopic measurements excellent agreement is obtained between the values of thermodynamic functions obtained from classical thermodynamic thermochemical measurements and those obtained from statisticalthermodynamic calculations
