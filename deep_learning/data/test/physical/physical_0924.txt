the scalar velocity we find the meansquare speed or is the expected value of the velocity squared and the root meansquare speed is example figure the maxwellboltzmann distribution function for at k figure shows the velocity distribution k for nitrogen molecules at k solution finally let us find the variance of the velocity that is the expected value of for at k we calculate statistics the mean and the variance of a distribution last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers there are two important statistics associated
