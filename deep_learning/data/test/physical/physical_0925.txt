is the square root of the variance the greek letter is usually used to denote the standard deviation then denotes the variance and if we have a small number of points from a distribution we can estimate and by approximating these integrals as sums over the domain of the random variable to do this we need to estimate the probability associated with each interval for which we have a sample point by the argument we make in section the best estimate of this probability is simply where is the number of sample points we have therefore that is the best
