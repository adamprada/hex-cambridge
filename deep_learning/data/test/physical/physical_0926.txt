figure variance is analogous to a moment of inertia dividing by rather than compensates exactly for the error introduced by using rather than the mean is analogous to a center of mass the variance is analogous to a moment of inertia for this reason the variance is also called the second moment about the mean to show these analogies let us imagine that we draw the probability density function on a uniformly thick steel plate and then cut along the curve and the axis figure let be the mass of the cutout piece of plate is the mass below the
