follows that the cutouts moment of inertia about the line is the moment of inertia about the line is simply the mass per unit area times the variance of the distribution if we let we have we define the mean of as the expected value of it is the value of we should expect to get the next time we sample the distribution alternatively we can say that the mean is the best prediction we can make about the value of a future sample from the distribution if we know the best prediction we can make is if we have
