you are seeking here is the energy at the current geometry is the gradient of the energy along the coordinate is the secondderivative or hessian matrix and is the length of the step to be taken along this cartesian direction an example of an energy surface in only two dimensions is given in the figure where various special aspects are illustrated for example minima corresponding to stable molecular structures transition states first order saddle points connecting such minima and higher order saddle points are displayed figure twodimensional potential surface showing minima transition states and paths connecting them if the only
