desired precision ie one wants to assure that is not too large when second derivative data is available there are different approaches to predicting what step to take in search of a minimum and it is within such hessianbased strategies that the concept of stepping along independent modes arises we first write the quadratic taylor expansion in matrixvector notation with the elements collected into the column vector whose transpose is denoted introducing the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the symmetric matrix the above equation becomes because is diagonal we have where are the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix for nonlinear molecules
