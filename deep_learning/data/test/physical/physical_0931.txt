group in ethane has a very small energy barrier as a result of which the energy is very weakly dependent on this coordinate one has to be careful to properly identify the translationrotation and internal eigenvalues by examining the eigenvectors corresponding to all of the low hessian eigenvalues one can identify and thus separate the former from the latter in the remainder of this discussion i will assume that the rotations and translations have been properly identified and the strategies i discuss will refer to utilizing the remaining or eigenvalues and eigenvectors to carry out a series of geometry steps
