each of the directions in an independent manner with each step designed to lower the potential energy when we are searching for minima strategies for finding a transition state will be discussed below for each eigenmode direction one can ask for what size step would the quantity be a minimum differentiating this quadratic form with respect to and setting the result equal to zero gives that is one should take a step opposite the gradient but with a magnitude given by the gradient divided by the eigenvalue of the hessian matrix if the current molecular geometry is one that has
