a good estimate for the equilibrium geometries of ethylene and propene one could place these two molecules at a distance longer than the expected interfragment equilibrium distance in the van der waals complex formed when they interact because both fragments are near their own equilibrium geometries and at a distance at which longrange attractive forces will act to draw them together a strategy such as outlined above could be employed to locate the van der waals minimum on their energy surface this minimum is depicted qualitatively in figure a figure a van der waals complex upper right formed between ethylene
