molecules at optimal angles and you may not have guessed very well at optimal the equilibrium interfragment distance so it would probably be wisest to begin the energyminimization process by using gradient information to step downhill in energy until one reaches a geometry at which all of the hessian matrix eigenvalues are positive from that point on steps determined by both the gradient and hessian ie can be used unless one encounters a geometry at which one of the eigenvalues is very small in which case the step along this eigenmode could be unrealistically large in this case it would
