in a region of the energy surface that is not sufficiently close to a minimum to blindly follow the prescription along all modes if only one is negative one anticipates being near a transition state at which all gradient components vanish and all but one are positive with one negative in such a case the above analysis suggests taking a step along all of the modes having positive but taking a step of opposite direction eg unless is very small in which case a small step opposite is best along the direction having negative if one is attempting to move
