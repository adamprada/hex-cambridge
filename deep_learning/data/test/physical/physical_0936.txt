its minimum along all but one direction and the step will move the system uphill in energy along the direction having negative curvature exactly as one desires when walking uphill in a streambed toward a mountain pass however even the procedure just outlined for finding a transition state can produce misleading results unless some extent of chemical intuition is used let me give an example to illustrate this point lets assume that one wants to find begin near the geometry of the van der waals complex involving ethylene and propene and to then locate the transition state on the reaction
