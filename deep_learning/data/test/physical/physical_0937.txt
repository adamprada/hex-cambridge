one could move the ethylene radially a bit say Ã¥ closer to the propene to generate an initial geometry to begin the ts search this makes sense because one knows the reaction must lead to interfragment carboncarbon distances that are much shorter in the methylcyclobutane products than in the van der waals complex the first strategy suggested above will likely fail because the series of steps generated by walking uphill along the lowest hessian eigenmode will produce a path leading from eclipsed to staggered orientation of propenes methyl group indeed this path leads to a ts but it is not
