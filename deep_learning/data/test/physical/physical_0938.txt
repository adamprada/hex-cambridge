the displacement of the ethylene toward the propene were too small one would not have distorted the system enough to move it into a region where the energy surface has negative curvature along the reaction path as it must have as one approaches the ts so if the hessian eigenmodes whose eigenvectors possess substantial interfragment radial displacements are all positive one has probably not moved the two fragments close enough together probably the best way to then proceed would be to move the two fragments even closer or to move them along a linear synchronous path connecting the reactants and
