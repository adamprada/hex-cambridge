of the example is it is wise to try to first find a geometry close enough to the ts to cause the hessian to have a negative eigenvalue whose eigenvector has substantial character along directions that make chemical sense for the reaction path in either a series of steps toward a minimum or toward a ts once a step has been suggested within the eigenmode basis one needs to express that step in terms of the original cartesian coordinates so that these cartesian values can be altered within the software program to effect the predicted step given values for the
