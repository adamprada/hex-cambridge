energy varies little or as one moves from a region of negative curvature into a region of positive curvature or vice versa in such cases the curvature must move through or near zero for these situations the expression can produce a very large step along the mode having small curvature care must be taken to not allow such incorrect artificially large steps to be taken energy surface intersections i should note that there are other important regions of potential energy surfaces that one must be able to locate and characterize above we focused on local minima and transition states later
