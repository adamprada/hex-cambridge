surfaces do not intersect but instead undergo avoided crossings to understand the issue let us assume that we have two wave functions and both of which depend on coordinates these two functions are not assumed to be exact eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian but likely are chosen to approximate such eigenfunctions to find the improved functions and that more accurately represent the eigenstates one usually forms linear combinations of and from which a x matrix eigenvalue problem arises leftbeginarraycc he h h he endarrayright this quadratic equation has two solutions these two solutions can be equal ie the two state energies
