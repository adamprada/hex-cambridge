an analysis that one usually says that potential energy surfaces in dimensions may undergo intersections in spaces of dimension if the two states are of different symmetry eg one is a singlet and the other a triplet the offdiagonal element vanishes automatically so only one other condition is needed to realize crossing so we say that two states of different symmetry can cross in a space of dimension for a triatomic molecule with internal degrees of freedom this means that surfaces of the same symmetry can cross in a space of dimension ie along a line while those of different
