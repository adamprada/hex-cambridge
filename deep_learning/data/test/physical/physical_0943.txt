the it gives a state of symmetry and if it is directed parallel to the hh bond it generates a state of symmetry the state is as shown in the upper left of figure c repulsive as the al atoms s and p orbitals begin to overlap with the hydrogen molecules orbital at large values the state in which the occupied p orbital is directed sideways parallel to the hh bond leads to a shallow van der waals well at longr but also moves to higher energy at shorter values the ground state of the molecule has its five valence
