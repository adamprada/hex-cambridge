space in which two surfaces cross assuming one has available information about the gradients and hessians of both of these energy surfaces and there are two components of characterizing the intersection space within which one has to first locate one geometry lying within this space and then one has to sample nearby geometries eg that might have lower total energy lying within this subspace where to locate a geometry at which the difference function passes through zero one can employ conventional functional minimization methods such as those detailed earlier when discussing how to find energy minima to locate where but
