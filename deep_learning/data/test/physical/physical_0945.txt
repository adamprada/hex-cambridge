along the gradient of because requires having both and taking steps obeying these two constraints allows one to remain within the subspace where and are simultaneously obeyed of course it is a formidable task to map out the entire or dimensional space within which the two surfaces intersect and this is essentially never done instead it is common to try to find for example the point within this subspace at which the two surfaces have their lowest energy an example of such a point is labeled rmecp in figure c and would be of special interest when studying reactions taking
