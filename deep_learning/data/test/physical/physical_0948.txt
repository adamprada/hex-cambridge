he could create in his laboratory which was in a saturated brinewaterice slurry he then defined f as his own body temperature as a result using his temperature scale water has a normal melting point the temperature at atm pressure at which water ice melts of f similarly water boils again at atm pressure at a temperature of f the difference between these values is f anders celsius also thought a degree temperature scale made sense and was given the name the centigrade scale he defined c on his scale as the normal boiling point of water and c as
