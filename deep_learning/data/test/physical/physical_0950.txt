with this statement careful experiments with such thermometers produce results that deviate from charles law with sufficiently accurate volume measurements this occurs to some extent for any choice of the liquid in the thermometer if we make sufficiently accurate measurements the volume of a gas is not exactly proportional to the volume of any liquid or solid that we might choose as the working substance in our thermometer that is if we base our temperature scale on a liquid or solid substance we observe deviations from charles law there is a further difficulty with using a liquid as the standard
