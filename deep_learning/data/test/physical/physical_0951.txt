volumes of the two gases are proportional to each other over any range of temperature moreover this proportionality is observed for any choice of either gas this means that we can define temperature in terms of the expansion of any constantpressure gas that behaves ideally in principle we can measure the same temperature using any gas so long as the constant operating pressure is low enough when we do so our device is called the ideal gas thermometer in so far as any gas behaves as an ideal gas at a sufficiently low pressure any real gas can be used
