idealgas thermometer is used to calibrate other thermometers of course we have to calibrate the idealgas thermometer itself before we can use it we do this by assigning a temperature of k to the triple point of water it turns out that the melting point of ice isnt sufficiently reproducible for the most precise work recall that the triple point is the temperature and pressure at which all three phases of water are at equilibrium with one another with no air or other substances present the triplepoint pressure is pa or atm see section from both theoretical considerations and experimental
