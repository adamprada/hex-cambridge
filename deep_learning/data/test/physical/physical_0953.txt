and the triplepoint is c we will find two reasons for the fact that the melting point is lower than the triple point in section we find that the melting point of ice decreases as the pressure increases in section we find that solutes usually decrease the temperature at which the liquid and solid states of a substance are in phase equilibrium if we could use an ideal gas in our idealgas thermometer we could be confident that we had a rigorous operational definition of temperature however we note in section that any real gas will exhibit departures from ideal
