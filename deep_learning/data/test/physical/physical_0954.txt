know the integrand on the left as a function of temperature we can do the integration and find the temperature corresponding to any measured volume when the working fluid in our thermometer is a real gas we make measurements to find as a function of temperature here we encounter a circularity to find from pressurevolumetemperature data we must have a way to measure temperature however this is the very thing that we are trying to find in principle we can surmount this difficulty by iteratively correcting the temperature that we associate with a given realgas volume as a first approximation
