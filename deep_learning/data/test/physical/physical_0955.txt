we could repeat this process until successive temperature scales converge at the number of significant figures that our experimental accuracy can support in practice there are several kinds of idealgas thermometers and numerous corrections are required for very accurate measurements there are also numerous other ways to measure temperature each of which has its own complications our development has considered some of the ideas that have given rise to the concept that temperature is fundamental property of nature that can be measured using a thermodynamictemperature scale on which values begin at zero and increase to arbitrarily high values this thermodynamic
