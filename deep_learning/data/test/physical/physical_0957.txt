we see a system that can be integrated multiplying both sides by yields or for finite changes and and integration assuming the enthalpy change is constant over the temperature interval yields dfracdelta gtt dfracdelta gtt delta h left dfract dfract right labelgh equation refhg is the gibbshelmholtz equation and can be used to determine how changes with changing temperature the equivalent equation for the helmholtz function is dfracdelta att dfracdelta att delta u leftdfract dfract right labelgh example given the following data at k calculate at k for the following reaction compound kjmol kjmol chg cog hog solution and and
