a certain reaction has a value of at c and calculate the value of at c solution this is a job for the van t hoff equation t k t k k k so equation refvh becomes note the value of increased with increasing temperature which is what is expected for an endothermic reaction an increase in temperature should result in an increase of product formation in the equilibrium mixture but unlike a change in pressure a change in temperature actually leads to a change in the value of the equilibrium constant example given the following average bond enthalpies for
