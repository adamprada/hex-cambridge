is composed of an ideal gas and that its temperature is constant we can derive an equation for atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude imagine a cylindrical column of air extending from the earths surface to the top of the atmosphere figure the force exerted by this column at its base is the weight of the air in the column the pressure is this weight divided by the crosssectional area of the column let the crosssectional area of the column be consider a short section of this column let the bottom of this section be a distance from the
