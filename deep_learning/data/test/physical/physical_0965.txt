heavy nuclei ie even a h nucleus weighs nearly times what an electron weighs move ie vibrate and rotate more slowly than do the lighter electrons for example typical bond vibrational motions occur over time scales of ca s molecular rotations require times as long but electrons undergo periodic motions within their orbits on the s timescale if they reside within core or valence orbitals thus we expect the electrons to be able to promptly adjust their motions to the much more slowly moving nuclei this observation motivates us to consider solving the schr√∂dinger equation for the movement of the
