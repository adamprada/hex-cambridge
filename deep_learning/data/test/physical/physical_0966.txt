not apply as well to for example rydberg states of atoms and molecules as discussed earlier in such states the electron in the rydberg orbital has much lower speed and much larger radial extent than for typical core or valence orbitals for this reason corrections to the bo model are usually more important to make when dealing with rydberg states the electronic hamiltonian that pertains to the motions of the electrons in the presence of clamped nuclei produces as its eigenvalues through the equation energies that depend on where the nuclei are located ie the coordinates as its eigenfunctions one
