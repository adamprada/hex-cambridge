of with respect to both coordinates vanish and where the surface has positive curvature these points correspond as we will see toward the end of this introductory material to geometries of stable molecular structures the surface also displays two firstorder saddle points labeled transition structures a and b that connect the three minima these points have zero first derivative of with respect to both coordinates but have one direction of negative curvature as we will show later these points describe transition states that play crucial roles in the kinetics of transitions among the three stable geometries keep in mind that
