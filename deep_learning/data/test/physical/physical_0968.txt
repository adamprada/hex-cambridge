value of the index in are then found by solving a hamiltonian this bo model forms the basis of much of how chemists view molecular structure and molecular spectroscopy for example as applied to formaldehyde we speak of the singlet ground electronic state with all electrons spin paired and occupying the lowest energy orbitals and its vibrational and rotational states as well as the and electronic states and their vibrational and rotational levels although much more will be said about these concepts later in this text the student should be aware of the concepts of electronic energy surfaces ie the
