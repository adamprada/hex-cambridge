only on the internal coordinates moreover if the molecules energy does not depend on its orientation eg if it is moving freely in the gas phase the will also not depend on the orientational coordinates but only on the vibrational coordinates having been introduced to the concepts of operators wave functions the hamiltonian and its schrödinger equation it is important to now consider several examples of the applications of these concepts the examples treated below were chosen to provide the reader with valuable experience in solving the schrödinger equation they were also chosen because they form the most elementary chemical
