on specific examples consider how this particle would move if were of the forms shown in figure where the total energy is denoted by the position of the horizontal line figure three characteristic potentials showing left and right classical turning points at energies denoted by the horizontal lines the classical probability density i would like you to imagine what the probability density would be for this particle moving with total energy and with varying as the above three plots illustrate to conceptualize the probability density imagine the particle to have a blinking lamp attached to it and think of this
