lines touch the plots as shown in the central plot the probability density at any value of represents the fraction of time the particle spends at this value of ie within and think of forming this density by allowing the blinking lamp attached to the particle to shed light on a photographic plate that is exposed to this light for many oscillations of the particle between and alternatively one can express the probability that the particle spends between and by dividing the spatial distance by the velocity pm of the particle at the point because is constant throughout the particles
