this divergence of is a characteristic of the classical probability density that will be seen to be very different from the quantum probability density the bottom line is that the probability densities anticipated by analyzing the classical newtonian dynamics of this one particle would appear as the histogram plots shown in figure illustrate figure classical probability plots for the three potentials shown where the particle has high kinetic energy and thus lower it spends less time and is small where the particle moves slowly it spends more time and is larger for the plot on the right is constant within
