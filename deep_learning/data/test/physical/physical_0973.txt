by replacing by we then try to find solutions to that obey certain conditions these conditions are related to the fact that is supposed to be the probability density for finding the particle between and to keep things as simple as possible lets focus on the box potential shown in the right side of figure this potential expressed as a function of is for and for for between and the fact that is infinite for and for and that the total energy must be finite says that must vanish in these two regions for and for this condition means that
