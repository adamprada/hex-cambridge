for example one of the two potential shown on the left or middle of figure the potential smoothly changes as kinetic and potential energy interchange during the periodic motion in contrast when moving under the potential on the right of figure the potential undergoes a sudden change of direction when the particle hits either wall so even classically the particles momentum undergoes a discontinuity at such hardwall turning points these conditions of continuity of and its spatial first derivative and that must vanish in regions of space where the potential is extremely high were postulated by the pioneers of quantum
