because is infinite there and is continuous so it must vanish at the point means that the weighting amplitude of the term must vanish because at that is the amplitude of the term is not affected by the condition that vanish at since itself vanishes at so now we know that is really of the form the condition that also vanish at because it vanishes for where again is infinite has two possible implications either or must be such that the option would lead to an answer that vanishes at all values of and thus a probability that vanishes everywhere
