values in other words not all energy values are allowed in the sense that they can produce functions that are continuous and vanish in regions where is infinite if one uses an energy that is not one of the allowed values and substitutes this into the resultant function will not vanish at i hope the solution to this problem reminds you of the violin string that we discussed earlier recall that the violin string being tied down at and at gave rise to quantization of the wavelength just as the conditions that be continuous at and gave energy quantization substituting
