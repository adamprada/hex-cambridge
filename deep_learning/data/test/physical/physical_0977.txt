and t dependent wave functions are then given as notice that the spatial probability density is not dependent on time and is equal to because the complex exponential disappears when is formed this means that the probability of finding the particle at various values of is timeindependent another thing i want you to notice is that unlike the classical dynamics case not all energy values are allowed in the newtonian dynamics situation could be specified and the particles momentum at any value was then determined to within a sign in contrast in quantum mechanics one must determine by solving the
