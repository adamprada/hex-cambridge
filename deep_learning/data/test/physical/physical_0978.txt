to the flashing light way of monitoring the particles location that we discussed earlier figure the two lowest wave functions and probability densities a more complete set of wave functions for ranging from to are shown in figure figure seven lowest wave functions and energies notice that as the quantum number increases the energy also increases quadratically with in this case and the number of nodes in also increases also notice that the probability densities are very different from what we encountered earlier for the classical case for example look at the and densities and compare them to the classical
