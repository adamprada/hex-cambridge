low as approaches or l a similar analysis of the plot for would lead us to conclude that the particle for which this is the correct must experience a potential that is high midway between and high midway between and and low near and near and these conclusions are crazy because we know that the potential for which we solved the schr√∂dinger equation to generate both of the wave functions and both probability densities is constant between and that is we know the same applies to the particle moving in the and states whereas the classical motion analysis offered above
