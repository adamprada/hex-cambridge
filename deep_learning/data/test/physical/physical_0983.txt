the socalled local de broglie wavelength it can be shown that the classical and quantum probabilities will be similar in regions of space where this inequality will be true when is much larger than which is consistent with the view that high quantum states behave classically but it will not hold when is only slightly above ie for lowenergy quantum states and for any quantum state near classical turning points or when is smaller than ie in classically forbidden regions in summary it is a general result of quantum mechanics that the quantum distributions for large quantum numbers take on
