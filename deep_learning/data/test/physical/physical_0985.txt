mol correspond to relatively large quantum numbers for which one expects nearclassical behavior the data shown in the above table can also be used to estimate when quantum behavior such as boseeinstein condensation can be expected when constrained to particles in the amu mass range have translational energies in the cal mol range realizing that cal mol k this means that translational temperatures near k would be needed to cause these particles to occupy their ground state in contrast particles with masses in the range of amu even when constrained to distances of ca Ã¥ require to exceed ca before
