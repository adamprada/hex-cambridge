system that exists in an eigenstate having an energy the timedependent wave function is that can be generated by applying the socalled time evolution operator to the wave function at where an explicit form for is the function has a spatial probability density that does not depend on time because since however it is possible to prepare systems even in real laboratory settings in states that are not single eigenstates we call such states superposition states for example consider a particle moving along the x axis within the box potential but in a state whose wave function at some initial
