the largex region of the box than in the smallx region at now lets consider the superposition wave function and its density at later times applying the time evolution operator to generates this timeevolved function at time t the spatial probability density associated with this is at this function clearly reduces to that written earlier for notice that as time evolves this density changes because of the factor it contains in particular note that as moves through a period of time the cos factor changes sign that is for the factor is for the cos factor is for it returns
