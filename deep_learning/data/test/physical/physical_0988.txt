once again the difficulty with attempting to localize particles that are being described by quantum wave functions for example a particle that is characterized by the eigenstate is more likely to be detected near than near or because the square of this function is large near a particle in the state is most likely to be found near and but not near or the issue of how the particle in the latter state moves from being near to is not something quantum mechanics deals with quantum mechanics does not allow us to follow the particles trajectory which is what we
