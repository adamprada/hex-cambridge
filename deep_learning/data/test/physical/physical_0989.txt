the extent that we are satisfied with ascribing its location to the position of the major peak in its probability distribution that is we can not really follow its precise location but we can follow the location of where it is very likely to be found however notice that the time it takes the particle to move from right to left is dependent upon the energy difference between the two states contributing to the superposition state not to the energy of either of these states which is very different from what would expect if the particle were moving classically these
