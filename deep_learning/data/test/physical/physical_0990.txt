not require to be explicitly written as a sum of eigenstates this is important because for most systems of direct relevance to molecules one can not solve for the eigenstates it is simply too difficult to do so you can find a significantly more detailed treatment of the researchlevel treatment of this subject in my theory page web site and my qmic textbook however lets spend a little time on a brief introduction to what is involved the problem is to express where is some initial wave function but not an eigenstate in a manner that does not require one
