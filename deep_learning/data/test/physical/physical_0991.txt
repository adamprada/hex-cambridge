that depends on so for example is not equal to the fact that and do not commute is important because the most obvious attempt to approximate is to write this single exponential in terms of and however the identity is not fully valid as one can see by expanding all three of the above exponential factors as and noting that the two sides of the above equation only agree if one can assume that which as we noted is not true in most modern approaches to time propagation one divides the time interval into many ie of them small time
