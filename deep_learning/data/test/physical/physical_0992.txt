with propagating for very short time intervals so that the term can be neglected one can indeed use as an approximation for the propagator it can also be shown that the socalled split shorttime expression provides an even more accurate representation of the shorttime propagator because expansions of the left and righthand sides agree to higher orders in to progress further one then expresses acting on in terms of the eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy operator note that these eigenfunctions do not depend on the nature of the potential v so this step is valid for any and all potentials
