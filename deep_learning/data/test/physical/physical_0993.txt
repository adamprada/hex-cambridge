need to know any of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian to apply this method this is especially attractive when dealing with very large molecules or molecules in condensed media where it is essentially impossible to determine any of the eigenstates and where the energy spacings between eigenstates is extremely small however one does have to use this formula over and over again to propagate the initial wave function through many small time steps to achieve full propagation for the desired time interval because this type of time propagation technique is a very active area of research in the theory community
