is therefore we can generalize our consideration of heat engines to include any series of changes in which a closed system exchanges heat with its surroundings at more than one temperature delivers a positive quantity of work to the surroundings and returns to its original state we use the carnot cycle and the machinebased statement of the second law to analyze systems that deliver pressurevolume work to the surroundings we consider both reversible and irreversible systems we begin by considering reversible carnot cycles if any system reversibly traverses any closed path on a pressurevolume diagram the area enclosed by the
