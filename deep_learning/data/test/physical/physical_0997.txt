system traverses a carnot cycle reversibly figure an ideal gas carnot cycle note that the pressure axis is compressed in p is plotted vs v in figure we describe the operation of a reversible carnot engine in which the working fluid is an ideal gas we designate the systems initial pressure volume and temperature by and from this initial state we cause the ideal gas to undergo a reversible isothermal expansion in which it absorbs a quantity of heat from a hightemperature heat reservoir at we designate the pressure volume and temperature at the end of this isothermal expansion as
