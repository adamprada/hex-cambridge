the end of this isothermal compression by and during this step the ideal gas gives up a quantity of heat to the lowtemperature reservoir finally we reversibly and adiabatically compress the ideal gas to its original pressure volume and temperature for the hightemperature isothermal step we have and for the lowtemperature isothermal step we have for the adiabatic expansion and compression we have the corresponding energy and work terms are for the adiabatic expansion and for the adiabatic compression the heatcapacity integrals are the same except for the direction of integration they sum to zero and we have the net
