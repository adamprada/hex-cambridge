the reversible carnot engine efficiency becomes equating our expressions for the efficiency of the reversible carnot engine we find from which we have since there is no heat transfer in the adiabatic steps and we can write this sum as if we divide the path around the cycle into a large number of very short segments the limit of this sum as the become very small is where the superscript serves as a reminder that the cycle must be traversed reversibly now we can define a new function by the differential expression in this expression is the incremental change in
