refrigerator the effects of operating them together cancel completely the refrigerator exactly consumes the work output of the engine the heat transfers to and from the heat reservoirs offset exactly now let us consider an idealgas carnot engine and any other reversible engine that extracts heat from a hightemperature reservoir and rejects a portion of it to a lowtemperature reservoir let us call these engines a and b we suppose that one is operated to produce work in its surroundings the other is operated to consume this work and transfer net heat energy from the lowtemperature to the hightemperature reservoir
