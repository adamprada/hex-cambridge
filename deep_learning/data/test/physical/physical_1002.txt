has returned to its original state figure matched heat engine and refrigerator and a system that combines them we can create a combined device that consists of a running as an engine b running as a refrigerator and the hightemperature reservoir figure also diagrams this combination when it executes one complete cycle the initial condition of the combined device is restored therefore since e is a state function we have where we use the constraint let us consider the possibility that that is the combined device does net work on the surroundings then implies that in this cyclic process the
