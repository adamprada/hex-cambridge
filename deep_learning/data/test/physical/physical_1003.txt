the combined machine has a running as a heat engine and b running as a refrigerator now suppose that we reverse their roles and let and represent the net work for the reversed combination applying the same argument as previously we conclude that but since the direction of operation is reversed for both machines we must also have and hence we have or we conclude therefore that for any two matched reversible engines operating around a carnot cycle this conclusion can be restated as a condition on the efficiencies of the two machines the individual efficiencies are and the efficiency
