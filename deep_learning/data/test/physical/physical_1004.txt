it follows that the integral of around a carnot cycle is zero for any reversible system the validity of these conclusions is independent of type of work that the engine produces if engine a is an idealgas engine engine b can be comprised of any system and can produce any kind of work in obtaining this result from the machinebased statement of the second law we make the additional assumption that pressurevolume work can be converted entirely to any other form of work and vice versa that is we assume that the work produced by engine a can reversibly drive
