the new partial derivatives are taken with held constant this is sometimes called the dividethrough rule the dividethrough rule is a reliable expedient for generating new relationships among partial derivatives as a further example dividing by and specifying that any other variable is to be held constant produces a valid equation letting w be the variable held constant we obtain where we recognize that the result is just the chain rule for when and that is when if we require that remain constant while and vary we can use the dividethough rule to obtain another useful relationship from the total
