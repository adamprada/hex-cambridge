state variables and and how they are related along phase boundaries first the chemical potentials of the two phases and in equilibrium with one another must be equal also any infinitesimal changes to the chemical potential of one phase must be offset by an infinitesimal change to the chemical potential of the other phase that is equal in magnitude taking the difference between these equations refeq and refeq shows that and since can be expressed in terms of molar volume and molar entropy it is clear that there will be constraints placed on changes of temperature and pressure while maintaining
