phase is smaller than that of the solid phase given that for a phase change the clapeyron equation is sometimes written example freezing water calculate the magnitude of the change in freezing point for water and the density of ice is while that for liquid water is for an increase in pressure of at solution the molar volume of ice is given by the molar volume of liquid water at oc is given by so for the phase change of which corresponds to an endothermic change is to find the change in temperature use the clapeyron equation equation refclap and
