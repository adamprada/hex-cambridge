further for phase equilibria involving the gas phase as one of the phases this is the case for either sublimation or vaporization in the case of vaporization the change in molar volume can be expressed since substances undergo a very large increase in molar volume upon vaporization the molar volume of the condensed phase liquid in this case is negligibly small compared to the molar volume of the gas ie so and if the vapor can be treated as an ideal gas substitution into the claperyron equation yields separating the variables puts the equation into an integrable form noting that
