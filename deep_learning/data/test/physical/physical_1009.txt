a plot of vs should yield a straight line the slope of which is provided that is independent of temperature over the range of temperatures involved this approach is very useful when there are several pairs of measurements of vapor pressure and temperature such a plot is shown below for water figure for water which has a very large temperature dependence the linear relationship of vs holds fairly well over a broad range of temperatures so even though there is some curvature to the data a straight line fit still results in a reasonable description of the data depending of
