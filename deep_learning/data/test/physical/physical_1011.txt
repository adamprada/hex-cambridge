that the system as a whole cannot be at equilibrium until all of these properties stop changing on the other hand we also recognize that the absence of observable change is not enough to establish that a system is at equilibrium with respect to all of the possible changes that it could undergo we know that hydrogen burns readily in oxygen to form water but a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen undergoes no change under ordinary conditions this unchanging mixture is plainly not at equilibrium with respect to the combustion reaction only when a catalyst or an ignition source is
