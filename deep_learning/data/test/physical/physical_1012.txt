the oxygenhydrogen reaction is not relevant to the phenomenon we are studying it is even possible to reach a nonequilibrium state in which the concentrations of the reactants and products are constant such a system is said to have reached a steady state in order for this to occur the reaction must occur in an open system that is one in which materials are being added or removed there must be continuous addition of reactants and continuous removal of products in chapter we discuss a simple system in which this can be achieved a closed system is one that can
