the net force acting on any macroscopic portion of the system is zero another way of describing such a situation is to say that the system does not move because of the presence of constraints that prevent movement two macroscopic objects are in thermal equilibrium if they are at the same temperature we take this to be equivalent to saying that if the two objects are in contact with one another no heat flows between them moreover if object a is in thermal equilibrium with each of two other objects b and c then we invariably find that objects b
