isolated similarly a saturated aqueous solution of copper sulfate is in equilibrium with solid copper sulfate if the system is isolated the amounts of solid and dissolved copper sulfate remain constant if a system is in phase equilibrium we can remove a portion of any phase without causing any change in the other phases at equilibrium the concentrations of species present in the various phases are independent of the absolute amount of each phase present it is only necessary that some amount of each phase be present to describe this property we say that the condition for equilibrium for is
