to the same vessel two immiscible liquid phases are formed elemental iodine is very sparingly soluble in water and substantially more soluble in chloroform if we add a small amount of iodine to the waterchloroform system some of the iodine dissolves in the water and the remainder dissolves in the chloroform layer we say that the iodine is distributed between the two phases when the iodine concentrations become constant we say that the system has reached distribution equilibrium in a chemical reaction one or more chemical substances reactants undergo a change to produce one or more new chemical substances products
