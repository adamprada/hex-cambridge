constant as a function of concentrations for the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate we find in general for the reaction we find that is at equilibrium the indicated function of reactant concentrations always computes to approximately the same numerical value when our concentration measurements are more accurate we find that we must introduce new quantities that we call chemical activities we can think of an activity as a corrected concentration the correction compensates for the effects of intermolecular attraction and repulsion denoting the activity of substance as we find that gives a fully satisfactory characterization of the equilibrium states that are
