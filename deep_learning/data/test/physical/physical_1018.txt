we call the idea of a static state of an isolated system the primitive equilibrium we also observe that change eventually ceases in a closed system that is not isolated but whose temperature pressure and volume are kept constant conversely if a system is at equilibrium its temperature pressure and volume are necessarily constant all interactions between such a system and its surroundings can be severed without changing any of the properties of the system we can view any particular equilibrium state as a primitive equilibrium state a system whose temperature pressure or volume is established by interactions between the
