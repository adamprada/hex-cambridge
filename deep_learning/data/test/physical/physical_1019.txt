think of this set of points as a surface or a manifold in the variable space every point in the set is a different primitiveequilibrium state of the system by imposing particular changes on some variables a particular equilibrium system can be made to pass continuously through a series of primitiveequilibrium states for reasons that become apparent as we proceed we use the name gibbsian equilibrium to denote this more general conception when we talk about equilibrium in thermodynamics we usually mean gibbsian equilibrium in chapter we see that the idea of gibbsian equilibrium is closely related to the idea
