would be useful to derive an expression for the difference as well as it turns out this difference is expressible in terms of measureable physical properties of a substance such as and in order to derive an expression lets start from the definitions and the difference is thus in order to evaluate this difference consider the definition of enthalpy differentiating this yields dividing this expression by and constraining to constant gives the last term is kind enough to vanish since at constant pressure after converting the remaining terms to partial derivatives this expression is starting to show some of the
