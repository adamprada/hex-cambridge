with the combined expression of the first and second laws now divide both sides by and constrain to constant the last term is unity so after conversion to partial derivatives we see a maxwell relation specifically the maxwell relation on can be used substituting this into equation refeq yields and since then now substituting this into the expression into equation refeq to get this can now be substituted into the equation refeq yields the terms will cancel and subtracting from both sides gives the desired result and this is a completely general result since the only assumptions made were those
