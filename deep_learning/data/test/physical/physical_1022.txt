you will need to find expressions for and and also utilize the maxwellrelation on solution begin with the definition of enthalpy differentiate the expression now divide by and constrain to constant as described in the instructions to generate the partial derivative definition of now what is needed is an expression for this can be derived from the total differential for by dividing by and constraining to constant this again is an example of partial derivative transformation type iii to continue we need an expression for this can be quickly generated by considering the total differential of its natural variables dividing
