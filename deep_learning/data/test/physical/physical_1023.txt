ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers in section we derive boyles law from newtons laws using the assumption that all gas molecules move at the same speed at a given temperature this is a poor assumption individual gas molecules actually have a wide range of velocities in chapter we derive the maxwellboltzmann distribution law for the distribution of molecular velocities this law gives the fraction of gas molecules having velocities in any range of velocities before developing the maxwellboltzmann distribution law we need to develop some ideas about distribution functions most of these ideas are
