mean any mathematical entity that we can calculate from data broadly speaking a distribution function is a statistic because it is obtained by fitting a mathematical function to data that we collect two other statistics are often used to characterize experimental data the mean and the variance the mean and variance are defined for any distribution we want to see how to estimate the mean and variance from a set of experimental data collected from a particular distribution we distinguish between discrete and continuous distributions a discrete distribution is a realworld source of data that can produce only particular data
