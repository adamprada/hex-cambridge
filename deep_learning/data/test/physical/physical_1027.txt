be investigated such as no and placed in a thermalized bath it is then allowed to come to equilibrium once equilibrium is established the stopcock is opened to allow gas to escape until the internal pressure is set to the pressure of the room the stopcock is then closed and the bulb weighed to determine the total mass of gas remaining inside the experiment is repeated at higher and higher temperatures so that at each subsequent measurement the larger degree of dissociation creates more molecules of gas and an increase in pressure in the bulb along with the higher temperature
