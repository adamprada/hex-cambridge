surroundings we have hence we have lettting we can express this as spontaneous process constant s if we introduce the further condition that the spontaneous process occurs while the volume of the system remains constant we have making this substitution and repeating our earlier result for a reversible process we have the parallel relationships spontaneous process constant s and v reversible process constant s and v if we introduce the still further requirement that only pressurevolume work is possible we have the parallel relationships become spontaneous process constant s and v only pv work reversible process constant s and v
