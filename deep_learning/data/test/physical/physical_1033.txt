apply to finite spontaneous changes these criteria are listed in the summary in section now the question arises what sort of system can undergo a change at constant entropy if the process is reversible and involves no heat the entropy change will be zero if we have a system consisting of a collection of solid objects at rest we can rearrange the objects without transferring heat between the objects and their surroundings for such a process the change in the energy of the system is equal to the net work done on the system evidently reversible changes in mechanical systems
