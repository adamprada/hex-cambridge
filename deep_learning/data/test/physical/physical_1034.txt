energy of a constanttemperature mechanical system a spontaneous change can occur in such a system if and only if the change in the systems energy is less than the net work done on it the excess work is degraded to heat that appears in the surroundings this convergence notwithstanding the principles of mechanics and those of thermodynamics while consistent with one another are substantially independent we address this issue briefly in section in the next section we develop spontaneouschange criteria based on the enthalpy change for a constantentropy process in subsequent sections we consider other constraints and find other criteria
