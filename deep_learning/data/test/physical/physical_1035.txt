we ask about the factors that determine whether such a reaction can occur there can be several possibilities we want to focus on one such factorthe violence of the collision we expect that a collision is more likely to result in a reaction the harder the two molecules hit one another when we try to formulate our basis for this expectation we see that the underlying idea is that a collision deforms the colliding molecules the more violent the collision the greater the deformation and the greater the likelihood of reaction becomes to proceed we need to be more precise
