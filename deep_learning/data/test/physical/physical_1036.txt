the line of centers cannot if the colliding molecules have complex shapes this may be a poor assumption we also need a way to specify how much deformation occurs in a collision if we want to specify the deformation by describing specific changes in the molecular structures this is a complex problem for a general model however we can avoid this level of detail to do so we recognize that any deformation can proceed only until the work done in deforming the molecules equals the energy that can be expended to do this work as the molecules are deformed their
