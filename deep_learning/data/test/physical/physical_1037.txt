of deformation reaction cannot occur if the available kinetic energy exceeds this minimum reaction takes place we call the minimum kinetic energy the activation energy and usually represent it by the symbol in discussing reaction rates we usually express the activation energy per mole and represent it as where we can apply these ideas to our model for collision between spherical molecules in section we develop relative velocity coordinates it follows that we can partition kinetic energy of the twoparticle system into a component that depends on the velocity of the center of mass and a component that depends on
