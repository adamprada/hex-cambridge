the line of centers must exceed for reaction to occur can now be expressed as the requirement that when we consider all possible collisions between molecules and the collision angle varies from to however only those collisions for which satisfies the inequality above will have sufficient kinetic energy along the line of centers for reaction to occur the smallest value of that can satisfy this inequality occurs when this minimum relative velocity is for relative velocities in excess of this minimum collisions are effective only when so that let us designate the frequency of collisions satisfying these constraints as recalling
