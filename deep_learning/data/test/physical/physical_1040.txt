approximation at all times then the change in the pressure volume product is making these substitutions the enthalpy inequality becomes spontaneous process constant s and from our earlier discussion of reversible processes we have the parallel relationship any reversible process constant s and if we introduce the still further requirement that only pressurevolume work is possible we have the parallel relationships become spontaneous process constant s and p only pv work reversible process constant s and p only pv work these equations state the criteria for change under conditions in which the entropy and pressure of the system remain constant
