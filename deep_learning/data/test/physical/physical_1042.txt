set of tiles approximates the path of the arbitrary curve since the tiling can be made as fine as we please the perimeter of the set of tiles can be made to approximate the path of the arbitrary curve as closely as we please figure tiling the pvplane with isotherms and adiabats suppose that we traverse the perimeter of each of the individual tiles in a clockwise direction adding up as we go segments of these perimeters fall into two groups one group consists of segments that are on the perimeter of the enclosing set of tiles the other group
