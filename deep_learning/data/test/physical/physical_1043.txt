each interior segment is traversed twice and the two contributions cancel exactly this set of tiles has another important property since each individual tile represents a reversible carnot cycle we know that around each individual tile since the sum around each tile is zero the sum of all these sums is zero it follows that the sum of around the perimeter of the enclosing set is zero by tiling the pressurevolume plane as densely as necessary we can make the perimeter of the enclosing set as close as we like to any closed curve the heat increments become arbitrarily small
