the tiling theorem asserts that every state of the variablepressure system can be reached along one and only one adiabat and one and only one isotherm from experience we infer that this statement remains true for any form of work that is every state of any reversible system can be reached by one and only one isotherm and by one and only one adiabat when any form of work is done if more than one form of work is possible there is an adiabat for each form of work if changing and changing change the energy of the system the
