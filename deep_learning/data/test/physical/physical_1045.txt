other form of work as a closed path with successive isothermal and adiabatic steps in space just as any closed path in pressurevolume space can be tiled or built up from arbitrarily small reversible carnot cycles so any closed path in space can be tiled by such cycles therefore the argument we use to show that for any closed reversible cycle in pressurevolume space applies equally well to a closed reversible cycle in which heat is used to produce any other form of work the entropy change for a spontaneous process at constant e and v last updated save as
