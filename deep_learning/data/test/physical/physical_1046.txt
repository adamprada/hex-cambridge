reversible process we have the parallel relationships spontaneous process constant and reversible process constant and for a reversible process if the spontaneous process occurs while is constant summing the incremental contributions to a finite change of state produces the parallel relationships spontaneous process constant and reversible process constant and constant corresponds to the common situation in chemical experimentation in which we place a reaction vessel in a constanttemperature bath if we introduce the further condition that only pressurevolume work is possible we have the parallel relationships become spontaneous process constant and only work reversible process constant and only work if
