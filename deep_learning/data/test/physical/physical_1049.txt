change for the augmented system is positive by the argument in the previous section denoting entropy changes for the system surroundings surroundings and the augmented system by and respectively we have and since the remote portion of the surroundings is unaffected by the change we have for any spontaneous change whether the system is isolated or not we have any spontaneous change figure expanding a system to create a new augmented isolated system this statement is an essential part of the entropybased statement of the second law we have now developed it from the machinebased statement of the second law
