the random variables of any number of distributions if is the random variable of distribution whose probability density function is the expected value of becomes and the expected value of becomes we are particularly interested in expected values for repeated trials made on the same distribution we consider distributions for which the outcome of one trial is independent of the outcome of any other trial the probability density function is the same for every trial so we have let the values obtained for the random variable in a series of trials on the same distribution be for each trial we
