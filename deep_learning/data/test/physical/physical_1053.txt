while we can measure the heat and work that a system exchanges with its surroundings neither the heat nor the work is necessarily zero when the system traverses a cycle heat and work are not state functions nevertheless adding heat to a system increases its energy likewise doing work on a system increases its energy if the system surrenders heat to the surroundings or does work on the surroundings the energy of the system is decreased in any change that a closed system undergoes the total energy change is where and can be either positive or negative for very small
