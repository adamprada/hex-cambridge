and surroundings we assume that any energy lost by the system is taken up by the surroundings and vice versa by definition we have and for any process this is the principle of conservation of energy which is usually stated for any change in any system the energy of the universe remains constant so conservation of energy is built into our energy accounting scheme it is a consequence of the thermodynamic perspective and our rules for keeping track of exchanges of heat and work between system and surroundings conservation of energy is an accounting convention but it is not arbitrary
