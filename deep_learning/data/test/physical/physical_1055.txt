component is an operational definition of energy an important aspect of this definition is that the principle of conservation of energy is embedded in it the second is an assertion that energy is a state function our operational definition of energy is openended an essential element of the postulate is that we can always identify work inputs that make the energy whose changes we compute as a state function the facts that energy is conserved and that energy is a state function are related properties of a single aspect energy of nature the relationship between these facts is a characteristic
