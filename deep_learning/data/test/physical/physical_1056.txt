process this statement of the first law does not deal explicitly with the mechanical energy of the system as a whole or with the energy effects of a transport of matter across the boundary of an open system because can include work that changes the position or motion of a system relative to an external reference frame increments of mechanical energy can be included in in chemical applications we seldom need to consider the mechanical energy of the system as a whole we can assume that the system has no kinetic or potential energy associated with the movement or location
