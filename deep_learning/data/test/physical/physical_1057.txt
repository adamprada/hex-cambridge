to represent changes in the system that result from various forms of nonpressurevolume work done on the system we let so that we can represent the incremental energy change that results from the nonpressurevolume work of all kinds as when both pressurevolume and nonpressurevolume work occur we have when a nonthermal process changes the energy of a closed constantvolume system we have we state the first law for a closed system extending the first law to open systems is straightforward the energy of a system depends on the substances that are present their amounts and their states at any specified
