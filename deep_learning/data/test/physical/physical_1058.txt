a specified state if matter crosses the boundary of a system the energy models for the separate collections of substances pretransfer must equate to that for the new system posttransfer finally we make a further simple but important observation we imagine that we can always identify an energy increment that crosses a system boundary as work or heat however the essence of the first law is that these increments lose their identitiesso to speakin the system the effect of a work input doesnt necessarily appear as an increase in the mechanical energy of the system a heat input doesnt necessarily
