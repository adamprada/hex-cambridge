interconversion of heat and work in the irreversible process we stir one gram of water that is thermally isolated the stirring generates heat in the system we supply the energy to drive the stirrer from the surroundings perhaps by allowing a spring to uncoil when of work from the surroundings has been frictionally dissipated in the system the state of the onegram system is the same as it was at the end of the reversible process in this irreversible process all of the energy traverses the system boundary as work nonthermal energy no heat traverses the system boundary we have
