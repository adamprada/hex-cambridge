isothermal expansion the temperature is constant so the transport of heat across the system boundary has no effect on the energy of the system the free energy changes for a spontaneous process at constant tË† last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers now let us consider the change in the helmholtz free energy when a system undergoes a spontaneous change while in thermal contact with surroundings whose temperature remains constant at we begin by considering an arbitrarily small increment of change in a process in which
