reversible processes we have the parallel relationships reversible isothermal process reversible process at constant and reversible process at constant and only work similarly under these conditions the change in the gibbs free energy for a spontaneous isothermal process is rearranging we have and since spontaneous process constant as we did when considering the enthalpy change for a spontaneous process we introduce the additional constraints that the system is subjected to a constant applied pressure and that throughout the process the irreversible pressurevolume work done by the surroundings on the system becomes and the change in the pressure volume product becomes
