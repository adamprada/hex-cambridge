spontaneous process constant and only work while the development we have just made assumes that the system temperature is strictly constant the validity of these finitechange inequalities is not restricted to the condition of strictly constant system temperature we can derive these finitechange inequalities by essentially the same argument from less restrictive conditions let us consider a spontaneous process in which a system goes from state b to state c while in contact with surroundings whose temperature remains constant at we suppose that in both state b and state c the system temperature is equal to the surroundings temperature that
