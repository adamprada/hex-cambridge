work is cancelling and rearranging we have and spontaneous process constant and if only pressurevolume work is possible spontaneous process constant and only work we find for any spontaneous process that occurs at constant pressure while the system is in contact with surroundings at the constant temperature and in which the initial and final system temperatures are equal to these are the most common conditions for carrying out a chemical reaction consider the situation after we mix nonvolatile reactants in an open vessel in a constanttemperature bath we suppose that the initial temperature of the mixture is the same as
