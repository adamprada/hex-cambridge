oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers thus far in our theoretical development of the properties of gases we have assumed that ideal gas molecules are point masses while they can collide with the walls of their container point masses cannot collide with one another as we saw in our discussion of van der waals equation the deviation of real gases from ideal gas behavior is one indication that an individual gas molecule occupies a finite volume to develop a model for molecular collisions we need to know the size and shape of the colliding molecules for a general model
