relative to the molecule of type from our development above we know both the probability density function for and the expected value both molecule and all of the molecules of type are moving with continuously varying speeds however it is reasonable to suppose thaton averagethe encounters between molecule and molecules of type are the same as they would be if all of the type molecules were fixed at random locations in the volume and molecule moved among them with a speed equal to the average relative velocity under this assumption a molecule travels a distance equal to in unit time
