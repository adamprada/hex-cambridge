type that experiences a collision with molecule in unit time letting be the frequency number of collision per unit time with which molecule collides with molecules of type we have two additional parameters that are useful for characterizing molecular collisions are the mean time between collisions and the mean distance that molecule travels between collisions with successive molecules of type is called the mean free path the mean time between collisions is simply the reciprocal of the collision frequency and the mean free path for molecule is the distance that molecule actually travels in this time which is not so
