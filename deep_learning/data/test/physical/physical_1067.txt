its volume is unchanged by these cuttings and rotations the volume of the kinked cylinder is the same as that of the straight cylinder thus our conclusions about the collision frequency the mean time between collisions and the mean free path are not affected by the fact that the trajectory of molecule changes at each collision figure the collision volume is unaffected by collisions the fundamental equation and other criteria for reversible change last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers to begin exploring the possibilities for
