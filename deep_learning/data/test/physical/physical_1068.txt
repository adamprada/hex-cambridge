it applies to any closed system that is undergoing reversible change it specifies a relationship among the changes in energy entropy and volume that must occur if the system is to remain at equilibrium while an increment of nonpressurevolume work is done on it the burden of our entire development is that any reversible process must satisfy this equation conversely any process that satisfies this equation must be reversible for a reversible process at constant entropy we have so that since is the reversible pressurevolume work and the sum is the net work we have reversible process constant s where
