condition for the process to be reversibleand hence to be continuously in an equilibrium state as the process takes placeis that reversible process and if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that entropy and volume are constant if we consider an arbitrary reversible process that occurs at constant energy and volume we have and and the fundamental equation reduces to reversible process and if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work in this case as noted in the system is isolated in we note that an isolated system in
