variables and is sufficient to specify the change in the system in particular if energy and entropy are constant the volume is also constant and the system is isolated thus the state of an equilibrium system whose energy and entropy are fixed is unique specifies a primitive equilibrium state we see that the internal consistency of our model passes a significant test from the entropybased statement of the second law we deduce the same proposition that we introduce in as a heuristic conjecture in chapter we expand on this idea starting from the fundamental equation we can find similar sets
