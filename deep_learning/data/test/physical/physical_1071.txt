entropy and pressure the process is reversible if and only if reversible process if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that entropy and pressure are constant if we consider an arbitrary reversible process that occurs at constant enthalpy and pressure we have and and the total differential for reduces to reversible process and if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work from we have using the fundamental equation to substitute for we have for a reversible process in which all of the work is pressurevolume work reversible process only
