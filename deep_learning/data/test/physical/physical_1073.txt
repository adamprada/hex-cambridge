we develop several criteria for reversible change stating these criteria as differential expressions since each of these expressions applies to every incremental part of a reversible change that falls within its scope corresponding expressions apply to finite changes for example we find for every incremental part of a reversible process in which the entropy has a constant value since we can find the energy change for a finite amount of the process by summing up the energy changes in every incremental portion it follows that reversible process each of the other differentialexpression criteria for reversible change also gives rise to
