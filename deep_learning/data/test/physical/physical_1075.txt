to find the frequency of collisions in which this angle lies between and when a collision occurs the distance between the molecular centers is we can say that the center of molecule is at a particular point on the surface of a sphere of radius circumscribed about molecule as sketched in figure we can rotate the line of centers around the velocity vector while keeping the angle between them constant at as we do so the line of centers traces out a circle on the surface of the sphere collisions that put the center of molecule at any two points
