this cylindrical shell collides with molecule at an angle between and molecule also collides with many other type molecules but those collisions are at other angles they have different orientations in unit time the length of the cylindrical shell is the volume of the cylindrical shell is its length times its crosssectional area figure the geometry of collisions between spheres the crosssection of the cylindrical shell is a circular annulus viewing the annulus as a rectangular strip whose length is the circumference of the shell and whose width is the radial thickness of the annulus the area of the annulus
