of type traveling at exactly and molecules of type in which the collision angle lies between and is we need to find the number of such collisions in which the relative velocity lies between and the probability of finding in this interval is let be the number of collisions made in unit time by a type molecule with molecules of type in which the collision angle is between and and the scalar relative velocity is between and this is just the number of collisions when the relative velocity is multiplied by the probability that the relative velocity is between and
