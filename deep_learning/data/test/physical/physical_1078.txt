hold this relationship places a compositional constraint upon any changes in the chemical potential in a mixture at constant temperature and pressure for a given composition this result is easily derived when one considers that represents the partial molar gibbs function for component and as with other partial molar quantities taking the derivative of both sides yields but can also be expressed as setting these two expressions equal to one another and after canceling terms one gets sumi ni d mui vdp sdt labeleq for a system at constant temperature and pressure substituting equation refeq into refeq results in the
