operation in which a pair of electrons have their labels i j permuted we say that commutes with the permutation operator this fact implies that any solution to must also be an eigenfunction of because permutation operators are idempotent which means that if one applies twice one obtains the identity it can be seen that the eigenvalues of must be either or that is if then but means that so or as a result of commuting with electron permutation operators and of the idempotency of the eigenfunctions must either be odd or even under the application of any such permutation
