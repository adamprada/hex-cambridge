column index labels the electron for example the be atom function produces the matrix whose determinant is shown below leftbeginarraycccc salpha salpha salpha salpha sbeta sbeta sbeta sbeta salpha salpha salpha salpha sbeta sbeta sbeta sbeta endarrayright nonumber clearly if one were to interchange any columns of this determinant one changes the sign of the function moreover if a determinant contains two or more rows that are identical ie if one attempts to form such a function having two or more spinorbitals equal it vanishes this is how such antisymmetric wavefunctions embody the pauli exclusion principle a convenient way to
