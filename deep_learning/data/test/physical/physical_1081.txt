which have exactly the same number of electrons occupying the same spinorbitals the only difference among the terms involves which electron occupies which spinorbital for example in the function appropriate to the excited state of he one has this function is clearly odd under the interchange of the labels of the two electrons yet each of its two components has one electron is a spinorbital and another electron in a spinorbital although having to make antisymmetric appears to complicate matters significantly it turns out that the schr√∂dinger equation appropriate to the spinorbitals in such an antisymmetrized product wavefunction is nearly
