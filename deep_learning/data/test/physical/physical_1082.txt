the coulomb and exchange terms cancel for the case this causes the artificial selfinteraction term that can appear in the hartree equations unless one explicitly eliminates it to automatically cancel with the exchange term in the hartreefock equations to derive the above hartreefock equations one must make use of the socalled slatercondon rules to express the hamiltonian expectation value as langlephiphicdots phinphinnhphiphicdots phinphinnrangle sumjnlanglephijrfracnablafracerphijrrangle fracsumjknleft langlephijrphikrfracerrphijrphikrrangle langlephijrphikrfracerrphikrphijrranglerightnonumber this expectation value is a sum of terms the kinetic energy and electronnuclear coulomb potentials that vary quadratically on the spinorbitals ie as plus another sum the coulomb and exchange electronelectron interaction terms
