of the last term the exchange integral the scf iterative procedure used to solve the hartree equations is again used to solve the hf equations it is useful to reflect on the physical meaning of the coulomb and exchange interactions between pairs of orbitals for example the coulomb integral appropriate to the two orbitals shown in figure represents the coulombic repulsion energy of two charge densities and integrated over all locations and of the two electrons figure an s and a p orbital and their overlap region in contrast the exchange integral can be thought of as the coulombic repulsion
