will be of the order of x such integrals with each integral requiring words of disk storage most integrals need to be evaluated in double precision this would require at least x mwords of disk storage even in the era of modern computers that possess gby disks this is a significant requirement one of the more important technical advances that is under much current development is the efficient calculation of such integrals when the product functions and that display the dependence on the two electrons coordinates r and r are spatially distant in particular socalled multipole expansions of these product
