where represents the kinetic and nuclear attraction energies respectively thus is the average value of the kinetic energy plus coulombic attraction to the nuclei for an electron in plus the sum over all of the spinorbitals occupied in of coulomb minus exchange interactions of these electrons with the electron in if is an occupied spinorbital the term disappears in the above sum and the remaining terms in the sum represent the coulomb minus exchange interaction of with all of the other occupied spinorbitals if is a virtual spinorbital this cancelation does not occur because the sum over does not include
