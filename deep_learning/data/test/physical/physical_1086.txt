the parent molecule are used to describe both species it is said that such a model neglects orbital relaxation ie the reoptimization of the spinorbitals to allow them to become appropriate to the daughter species within this model the energy difference between the daughter and the parent can be written as follows represents the particular spinorbital that is added or removed for electron detachment and for electron attachment lets derive this result for the case in which an electron is added to the spinorbital again using the slatercondon rules from section of this chapter the energy of the electron determinant
