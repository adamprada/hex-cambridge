estimating ips and eas and often yields results that are qualitatively correct ie ev orbital energies and the total energy the total hfscf electronic energy can be written as and the sum of the orbital energies of the occupied spinorbitals is given by these two expressions differ in a very important way the sum of occupied orbital energies double counts the coulomb minus exchange interaction energies thus within the hartreefock approximation the sum of the occupied orbital energies is not equal to the total energy this finding teaches us that we can not think of the total electronic energy of
