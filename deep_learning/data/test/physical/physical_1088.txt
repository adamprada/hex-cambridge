process we have and hence it follows that and earlier we found that the entropy changes for a spontaneous process in an isolated system are and the present system is not isolated since the change that occurs in the system is irreversible does not mean that the requirement that places no constraints on the temperature of the system or of the surroundings at any time before during or after the process occurs in section we find for any spontaneous process in a closed system if the entropy of the system is constant we have spontaneous process constant entropy for every
