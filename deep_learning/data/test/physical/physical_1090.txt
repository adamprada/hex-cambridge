single universal gas constant which turns out to be one of the most important fundamental constants in science the ideal gas law constant is of fundamental importance and can be expressed in a number of different sets of units value units atm l mol k j mol k cal mol k the ideal gas law as derived here is based entirely on empirical data it represents limiting ideal behavior as such deviations from the behavior suggested by the ideal gas law can be understood in terms of what conditions are required for ideal behavior to be followed or at least
