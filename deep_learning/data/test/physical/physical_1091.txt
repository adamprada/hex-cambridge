advantages that emerge as our development proceeds for permanent gasesgases whose behavior is approximately ideal anywaythere is a negligible difference between the enthalpy in the ideal gas state and the enthalpy at bar for volatile substances that are normally liquid or solid at bar the ideal gas standard state becomes a second standard state for such substances data tables frequently give the standard enthalpy of formation for both the condensed phase designated or and the ideal gas standard state designated for example the codata values for the standard enthalpies of formation for liquid and idealgas methanol are and respectively at
