vaporization the ordinary enthalpy of vaporization is the enthalpy change for the reversible vaporization of liquid methanol to real methanol vapor at a pressure of atm and the normal boiling temperature we write it without the superscript degree sign because methanol vapor is not produced in its standard state for methanol the normal boiling point and enthalpy of vaporization are and respectively we can devise a cycle that relates these two vaporization processes to one another summing the steps below yields the process for vaporizing liquid methanol in its standard state to methanol vapor in its standard state liq k
