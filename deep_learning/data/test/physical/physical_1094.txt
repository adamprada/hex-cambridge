underwent the expansion into an open space must also be zero in truth the gas did undergo a temperature change but it was too small to be detected within his experimental precision later we once we develop the maxwell relations will show that left dfracpartial upartial v rightt t left dfracpartial ppartial t rightv p labeleq application to an ideal gas for an ideal gas so it is easy to show that so combining equations refeq and refeq together to get left dfracpartial upartial v rightt dfracrtv p labeleq and since also becuase then equation refeq simplifies to so while
