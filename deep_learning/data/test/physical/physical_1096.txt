given pressure drop figure the apparatus is insulated so that no heat can be transferred in or out making the expansion isenthalpic figure the typical behavior of the joulethomson coefficient can be summarized in figure at the combinations of and for which inside the shaded region the sample will cool upon expansion at those and conditions outside of the shaded region where the gas will undergo a temperature increase upon expansion and along the boundary a gas will undergo neither a temperature increase not decrease upon expansion for a given pressure there are typically two temperatures at which changes sign
