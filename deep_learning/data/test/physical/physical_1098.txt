he elected to call degrees fahrenheits zero of temperature was achieved by mixing salt with ice and water this is not a very reproducible condition so the temperature of melting ice with no salt present soon became the calibration standard fahrenheits experiments put the melting point of ice at f the normal temperature for a healthy person is now taken to be f possibly fahrenheit had a slight fever when he was doing his calibration experiments in any case human temperatures vary enough so that fahrenheits degree point was not very practical either the boiling point of water which fahrenheits
