temperature scale when we extend the straight line in any of our volumeversustemperature plots it always intersects the zerovolume horizontal line at the same temperature since we cannot associate any meaning with a negative volume we infer that the temperature at zero volume represents a natural minimum point for our temperature scale let the value of at this intersection be substituting into our volumetemperature relationship we have or so that where we have created a new temperature scale temperature values on our new temperature scale t are related to temperature values on the old temperature scale by the equation when
