that the idea of an atomic or molecular picture really took hold in the scientific community in its modern form the kinetic molecular theory of gasses is based on five basic postulates gas particles obey newtons laws of motion and travel in straight lines unless they collide with other particles or the walls of the container gas particles are very small compared to the averages of the distances between them molecular collisions are perfectly elastic so that kinetic energy is conserved gas particles so not interact with other particles except through collisions there are no attractive or repulsive forces between
