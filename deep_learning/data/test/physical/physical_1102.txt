particles in a fixedvolume container with all of the particles traveling at the same velocity what implications would the kinetic molecular theory have on such a sample one approach to answering this question is to derive an expression for the pressure of the gas the pressure is going to be determined by considering the collisions of gas molecules with the wall of the container each collision will impart some force so the greater the number of collisions the greater the pressure will be also the larger force imparted per collision the greater the pressure will be and finally the larger
