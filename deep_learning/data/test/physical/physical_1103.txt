a collision volume where is the speed the molecules are traveling in the x direction is the time interval the product of gives the length to the collision volume box and a is the area of the wall with which the molecules will collide half of the molecules within this volume will collide with the wall since half will be traveling toward it and half will be traveling away from it the number of molecules in this collision volume will be given by the total number of molecules in the sample and the fraction of the total volume that is
