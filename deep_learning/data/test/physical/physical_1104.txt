per collision is given by and the total force imparted is since the pressure is given as the total force exerted per unit area the pressure is given by the question then becomes how to deal with the velocity term initially it was assumed that all of the molecules had the same velocity and so the magnitude of the velocity in the xdirection was merely a function of the trajectory however real samples of gases comprise molecules with an entire distribution of molecular speeds and trajectories to deal with this distribution of values we replace with the squared average of
