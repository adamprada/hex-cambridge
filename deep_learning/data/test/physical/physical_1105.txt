normalization constant can be found from the expression can be simplified by letting it is then more simply written a table of definite integrals says that so and thus the normalized distribution function is given by calculating an average from a probability distribution calculating an average for a finite set of data is fairly easy the average is calculated by but how does one proceed when the set of data is infinite or how does one proceed when all one knows are the probabilities for each possible measured outcome it turns out that that is fairly simple too where is
