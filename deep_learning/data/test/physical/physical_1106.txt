average velocity in the x direction this can be derived using the probability distribution as shown in the mathematical development box above the average value of is given by this integral will by necessity be zero this must be the case as the distribution is symmetric so that half of the molecules are traveling in the x direction and half in the x direction these motions will have to cancel so a more satisfying result will be given by considering the magnitude of which gives the speed in the x direction since this cannot be negative and given the symmetry
