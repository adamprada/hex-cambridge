be seen that since the direction of travel is random the velocity can have any component in x y or z directions with equal probability as such the average value of the x y or z components of velocity should be the same and so substituting this into the expression for pressure equation refpress yields all that remains is to determine the form of the distribution of velocity magnitudes the gas molecules can take one of the first people to address this distribution was james clerk maxwell in his paper maxwell illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases part on
