equation refmb took the following form this function has three basic parts to it a normalization constant a velocity dependence and an exponential term that contains the kinetic energy since the function represents the fraction of molecules with the speed the sum of the fractions for all possible velocities must be unity this sum can be calculated as an integral the normalization constant ensures that choosing the normalization constant as yields the final form of the maxwell distribution of molecular speeds at low velocities the term causes the function to increase with increasing but then at larger values of the
