earlier example example what is the average value of the squared speed according to the maxwell distribution law solution a table of integrals indicates that substitution noting that yields which simplifies to note the square root of this average squared speed is called the root mean square rms speed and has the value the entire distribution is also affected by molecular mass for lighter molecules the distribution is spread across a broader range of speeds at a given temperature but collapses to a smaller range for heavier molecules table figure maxwell distribution of speeds at k for different gasses of
