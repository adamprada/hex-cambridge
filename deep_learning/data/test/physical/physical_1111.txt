adopt the convention that heat and work are positive if they increase the energy of the system in a process in which a closed system accepts increments of heat and work from its surroundings we define the changes in the energy and the entropy of the system in terms of and the temperature the meaning of the first law is intimately related to a crucial distinction between the character of energy on the one hand and that of the variables heat and work on the other when we say that energy is a state function we mean that the energy
