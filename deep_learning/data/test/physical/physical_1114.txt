path as we have we review line integrals in the next chapter the energy change for the surroundings is the line integral of along the path followed by the surroundings during the same process for any process in which energy is exchanged with the surroundings the change in the systems energy is where and are the amounts of thermal and nonthermal energy delivered to the system we can compute from and whether the process is reversible or irreversible in contrast the definition of entropy change applies only to reversible processes in a process in which a system reversibly accepts an
