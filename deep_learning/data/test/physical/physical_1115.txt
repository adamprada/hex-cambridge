change is reversible the second law of thermodynamics in a reversible process in which a closed system accepts an increment of heat from its surroundings the change in the entropy of the system is entropy is a state function for any reversible process and conversely for any spontaneous process and conversely we define the entropy change of the universe by it follows that for any process in which a system passes from a state a to a state b whether the process is reversible or not since for every part of a reversible process we have for any reversible process
