if the entropy of each element in some crystalline state be taken as zero at the absolute zero of temperature every substance has a positive finite entropy but at the absolute zero of temperature the entropy may become zero and does so become in the case of perfect crystalline substances the lewis and randall statement focuses on the role that the third law plays in our efforts to express the thermodynamic properties of pure substances in useful ways to do so it incorporates a matter of definition when it stipulates that the entropy of each element be taken as zero
