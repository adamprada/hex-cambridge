is proportional to not and so the reaction rate depends on not we represent molecules with excess energy as and assume that all molecules undergo reaction with a constant probability molecules are formed in collisions between molecules and they are deactivated by subsequent collisions with molecules where is the products of the reaction the rate at which the number of moles of molecules changes is and since we suppose that is always very small the steadystate approximation applies so that and the reaction rate is given by when the rate of deactivating collisions between and is greater than the rate
