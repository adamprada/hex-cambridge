indicator of the nucleophilicity of in these substitution reactions the fact that the aquo complex is the predominant reaction product strongly suggests that the energetics of the reaction are dominated by the breaking of the bond formation of the new bond to the incoming ligand apparently has little effect whether the old bond has been completely broken so that is a true intermediate before the new bond has begun to form remains an issue on which it is possible to disagree mechanism there is a conspicuous exception to the description given above when the entering group is the hydroxide ion
