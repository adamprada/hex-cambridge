this reaction is reasonable only if we can explain why hydroxide is uniquely reactive in this case and not in others mechanism an alternative mechanism usually labeled the substitution nucleophilic firstorder in the conjugate base mechanism mechanism is also consistent with the secondorder rate law in this mechanism hydroxide removes a proton from one of the ammine ligands to give a sixcoordinate intermediate containing an amido ligand step this intermediate loses the leaving group in the rate determining step to form a fivecoordinate intermediate step this intermediate picks up a water molecule to give the aquo complex step in a
