that are bound to cobalt ie there are no moieties the evidence that is an intermediate is also persuasive when the base hydrolysis reaction is carried out in the presence of other possible entering groups the rate at which is consumed is unchanged but the product is a mixture of and if this experiment is done with a variety of leaving groups the proportions of and are constantindependent of which leaving group the reactant molecule contains these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that all reactants give the same intermediate the product distribution is always the same because it is
