found that an enzyme can discriminate between two very similar substrates greatly enhancing the reaction rate of one while having a much smaller effect on the rate of the other second the rate enhancements achieved by enzyme catalysis are often very large rate increases by a factor of are observed simple mechanistic and kinetic models are sufficient to explain these essential features of enzyme catalysis we consider the simplest case both the mechanisms and the rate laws for enzymatic reactions can become much more complex than the model we develop the literature of enzyme catalysis uses a specialized vocabulary problem
