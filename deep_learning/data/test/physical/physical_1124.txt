fit into the structure of its substrate just as a key is machined to match the arrangement of tumblers in the lock that it opens figure illustrates this idea figure the lock and key model the rates of enzymecatalyzed reactions can exhibit complex dependence on the relative concentrations of enzyme and substrate most of these features are explained by the michaelismenten mechanism which postulates a rapid equilibration of enzyme and substrate with their enzymesubstrate complex transformation of the substrate occurs within this complex the reaction products do not complex strongly with the enzyme after the substrate has been transformed the
