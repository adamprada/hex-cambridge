requires and most experiments are done with the substrate present at a much greater concentration than the enzyme in this case is negligible in the equation and the concentration of free substrate becomes the enzymesubstrate equilibrium imposes the relationship using this relationship to eliminate from the expression for gives the rate law for product formation becomes if the dependence on substrate cancels and the rate law becomes pseudozeroorder where the observed zeroorder rate constant depends on if the rate law becomes pseudofirstorder with pseudofirstorder rate constant if neither of these simplifications is applicable fitting experimental data to the integrated rate
