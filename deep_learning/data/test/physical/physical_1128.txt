equilibrium system consists of one or more homogenous phases two systems can be in the same equilibrium condition only if all of the phases present in one are also present in the other if a process changes the number of phases present in a system we consider that the system changes from one kind of equilibrium system to a second one we can describe one kind of equilibrium system by specifying a sufficient number of intensive variables this description will be complete to within a specification of the exact amount of each phase present if we apply these ideas to
