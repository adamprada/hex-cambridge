relates the values that we measure we call this an equation of state because it is a mathematical model that describes the state of the system in chapter we reviewed the ideal gas equation van der waals equation and the virial equation however we can devise many others whatever equation of state we develop we know that it must have a particular property at constant pressure and temperature the volume must be directly proportional to the number of moles this means that any equation of state can be rewritten as a function of concentration for the case of an ideal
