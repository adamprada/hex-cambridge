us to calculate the third variable viewed as a statement about our experimental observations this is true because so long as the changes are consistent with the system remaining a gas we can change any two of these variables independently that only two are independent is shown experimentally by the observation that we can start with a fixed quantity of gas at any pressure temperature and concentration and find after taking the system through any sequence of changes whatsoever that returning to the original pressure and temperature also restores the original concentration in the experiment or in the mathematical model
