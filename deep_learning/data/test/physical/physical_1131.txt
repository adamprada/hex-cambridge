to fix the equilibrium properties of the system we must know the pressure and temperature of the system and the concentration of each gas because the mixture must obey an equation of state determination of any three of these variables is sufficient to fix the value of the fourth note that we can conclude that three intensive variables are sufficient to determine the equilibrium properties of the system even if we do not have a mathematical model for the equation of state if we experiment with a system in which the liquid and vapor of a pure substance are in
