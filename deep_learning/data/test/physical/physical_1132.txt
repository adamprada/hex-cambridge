is completely consumed in this process two variables change and phase equilibrium cannot be maintained to reach a new equilibrium state in which both liquid and gas are present at a higher temperature we must increase the pressure to the new equilibrium vapor pressure the magnitude of the temperature increase completely determines the required pressure increase two intensive variables change but the changes are not independent if we have pure gas there are two independent intensive variables if we have pure liquid there are two independent intensive variables however if we have liquid and gas in equilibrium with one another
