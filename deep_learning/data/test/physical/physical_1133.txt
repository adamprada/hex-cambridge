requirement that the system be at equilibrium at the triple point fixes the system pressure temperature and concentration evidently maintaining a phase equilibrium in a system imposes a constraint that reduces the number of intensive variables that we can control independently the equilibrium between water and ice is completely unaffected by the state of subdivision of the ice the ice can be present in a single lump or as a large number of very small pieces from experience we know that the equilibrium behavior of the system is the same so long as some ice and some water are both
