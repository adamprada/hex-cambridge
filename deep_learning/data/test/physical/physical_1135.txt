keep all of their degrees of freedom translational rotational vibrational electronic in thermal equilibrium among the collection of such reactant molecules at any instant of time some will have enough internal energy to access a transition state ts on the bornoppenheimer potential energy surface upon which the reaction takes place within tst the rate of progress from reactants to products is then expressed in terms of the concentration of species that exist near the ts multiplied by the rate at which these species move through the ts region of the energy surface the concentration of species at the ts is
