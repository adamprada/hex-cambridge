for a conventional ab molecule except for one modification it does not contain a vibrational contribution for motion along the one internal coordinate corresponding to the reaction path figure typical potential energy surface in two dimensions showing local minima transition states and paths connecting them as we discussed in chapter in the vicinity of the ts the reaction path can be identified as that direction along which the pes has negative curvature along all other directions the energy surface is positively curved for example in figure a reaction path begins at transition structure b and is directed downhill more specifically
