vibrations of the ts species as well as one negative eigenvalue the latter has an eigenvector whose components along the cartesian coordinates describe the direction of the reaction path as it begins its journey from the ts backward to reactants when followed in one direction and onward to products when followed in the opposite direction once one moves a small amount along the direction of negative curvature the reaction path is subsequently followed by taking infinitesimal steps downhill along the gradient vector whose components are note that once one has moved downhill away from the ts by taking the initial
