is also evaluated as in chapter the motion along the reaction path coordinate contributes to the rate expression in terms of the frequency ie how often with which reacting flux crosses the ts region given that the system is in nearthermal equilibrium at temperature to compute the frequency with which trajectories cross the ts and proceed onward to form products one imagines the ts as consisting of a narrow region along the reaction coordinate the width of this region we denote we next ask what the classical weighting factor is for a collision to have momentum along the reaction coordinate
