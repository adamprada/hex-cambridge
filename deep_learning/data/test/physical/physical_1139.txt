still need to integrate this over all values of that correspond to enough energy to access the tss energy relative to that of the reactants which we denote moreover we have to account for the fact that it may be that not all trajectories with kinetic energy equal to or greater pass on to form product molecules some trajectories may pass through the ts but later recross the ts and return to produce reactants moreover it may be that some trajectories with kinetic energy along the reaction coordinate less than can react by tunneling through the barrier the way we
