of the integral treating it as a multiplicative factor the integral over can be evaluated and yields the following the exponential energy dependence is usually then combined with the partition function of the ts species that reflect this species other vibrational coordinates and momenta and the reaction rate is then expressed as this implies that the rate coefficient for this bimolecular reaction is given in terms of molecular partition functions by which is the fundamental result of tst once again we notice that ratios of partition functions per unit volume can be used to express ratios of species concentrations in
