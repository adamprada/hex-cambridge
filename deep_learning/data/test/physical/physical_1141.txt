prepared in highly nonequilibrium conditions moreover it ignores tunneling by requiring all reactions to proceed through the ts geometry for reactions in which a light atom ie an h or d atom is transferred tunneling can be significant so this conventional form of tst can provide substantial errors in such cases however there are straightforward approximations similar to those we discussed in chapter that can be used to make tunneling corrections to this rate expression nevertheless tst remains the most widely used and successful theory of chemical reaction rates and can be extended to include tunneling and other corrections as
