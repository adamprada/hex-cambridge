rates because it assumes all trajectories that cross the ts proceed onward to products unless the transmission coefficient is included to correct for this in the variational transition state theory vtst one does not evaluate the ratio of partition functions appearing in at but one first determines at what geometry s the ts partition function ie or is smallest because this partition function is a product of i the factor as well as ii translational rotational and vibrational partition functions which depend on the value of for which this product is smallest need not be the conventional ts value what
