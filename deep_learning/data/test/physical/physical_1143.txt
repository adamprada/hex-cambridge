a minimum one then evaluates both and the other components of the ts species partition functions at this value finally one then uses the expressions given above but with taken at this is how vtst computes reaction rates in a somewhat different manner than does the conventional tst as with tst the vtst in the form outlined above does not treat tunneling and the fact that not all trajectories crossing proceed to products these corrections still must be incorporated as an addon to this theory ie in the k factor for recrossing and through tunneling corrections to achieve high accuracy
