the negative eigenvalue moves further downhill along the gradient vector whose components are terminates at the geometry of either the reactants or products depending on whether one began moving away from the ts forward or backward along the direction of negative curvature the individual steps along the reaction coordinate can be labeled as they evolve from the ts to the products labeled sp and as they evolve from reactants sr to the ts if these steps are taken in very small infinitesimal lengths they form a continuous path and a continuous coordinate that we label at any point along a
