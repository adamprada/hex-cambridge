be evaluated in terms of the original cartesian counterparts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the massweighted hessian can then be determined upon doing so one finds zero eigenvalues whose eigenvectors describe overall rotation and translation of the molecule positive eigenvalues and eigenvectors along which the gradient has zero or nearly so components and one eigenvalue that may be positive zero or negative along whose eigenvector the gradient has its largest component the one unique direction along gives the direction of evolution of the reaction path in these massweighted coordinates all other directions ie within the space spanned by the other
