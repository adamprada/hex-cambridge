this point if these displacements are expressed as components along the eigenvectors and along the gradient direction one can write the bornoppenheimer potential energy surface locally as e es textbfgcdot textbfvs delta s dfrac omegas delta s sumk n dfrac omegak delta xk within this local quadratic approximation describes a sum of harmonic potentials along each of the modes transverse to the reaction path direction along the reaction path appears with a nonzero gradient and a curvature that may be positive negative or zero the eigenmodes of the local ie in the neighborhood of any point along the reaction path
