rph one must transform the above equation for the kinetic energy by replacing the cartesian massweighted coordinates by the eigenmode displacement coordinates the reaction path displacement coordinate and translation and rotational coordinates the three translational coordinates can be separated and ignored because centerofmass energy is conserved in further consideration the rotational coordinates do not enter into the potential but they do appear in however it is most common to ignore their effects on the dynamics that occurs in the internalcoordinates this amounts to ignoring the effects of overall centrifugal forces on the reaction dynamics we will proceed with this approximation
