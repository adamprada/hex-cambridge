describes harmonicoscillator hamiltonian each of which has a locally defined frequency that varies along the reaction path ie is dependent a hamiltonian for motion along the reaction coordinate with serving as the potential in this limit ie with the factors turned off the reaction dynamics can be simulated in what is termed a vibrationally adiabatic manner by placing each transverse oscillator into a quantum level that characterizes the reactants population of this mode assigning an initial momentum to the reaction coordinate that is characteristic of the collision to be simulated eg could be sampled from a maxwellboltzmann distribution if a
