because varies along s lets return now to the rph theory in which the dynamical couplings among motion along the reaction path and the modes transverse to it are included in the full rph the terms couple modes and while couples the reaction path to mode these couplings express how energy can flow among these various degrees of freedom explicit forms for the and factors are given in terms of the eigenvectors of the massweighted hessian matrix as follows bkk langle dtextbfvkds textbfvkrangle bks langle dtextbfvkds textbfvsrangle where the derivatives of the eigenvectors are usually computed by taking the eigenvectors
