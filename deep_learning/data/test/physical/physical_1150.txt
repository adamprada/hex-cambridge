evolution of a chemical reaction that begins with coordinates and moment characteristic of reactants under specified laboratory conditions and moves through a ts and onward to products once time has evolved long enough for product geometries to be realized one can interrogate the values of to determine how much energy has been deposited into various productmolecule vibrations and of to see what the final kinetic energy of the product fragments is of course one also monitors what fraction of the trajectories whose initial conditions are chosen to represent some experimental situation progress to product geometries vs returning to reactant geometries
