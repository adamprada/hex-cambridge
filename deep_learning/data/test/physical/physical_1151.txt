accurately describe the reactive surface especially near the transition state recall that may force fields do not do so because they do not account for bond breaking and forming with each such coordinate having an initial velocity and an initial value one then uses newtons equations written for a time step of duration to propagate and forward in time according for example to the following firstorder propagation formula or using the verlet algorithm described in chapter here mq is the mass factor connecting the velocity dqdt and the momentum pq conjugate to the coordinate q and is the force along
