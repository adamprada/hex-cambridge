coordinates and momenta in a way that is representative of the experimental conditions that one is attempting to simulate the tools of statistical mechanics discussed in chapter guide us in making these choices and allow us efficient methods eg the monte carlo technique for sampling such initial values when one attempts for example to simulate the reactive collisions of an a atom with a bc molecule to produce ab c it is not appropriate to consider a single classical or quantal collision between a and bc why because in any laboratory setting the a atoms are probably moving toward the
