values of the bc molecules internal vibrational coordinate and momentum as well as its orientation and rotational angular momentum must be selected to represent this when the a and bc molecules collide with a relative motion velocity vector they do not all hit head on some collisions have small impact parameter the closest distance from a to the center of mass of bc if the collision were to occur with no attractive or repulsive forces and some have large values see figure the probability function for these impact parameters is which is simply a statement of the geometrical fact that
