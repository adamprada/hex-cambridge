of data this data includes knowledge of what fraction of the trajectories produced final geometries characteristic of products so the net reaction probability can be calculated in addition the kinetic and potential energy content of the internal vibrational and rotational modes of the product molecules can be interrogated and used to compute histograms giving probabilities for observing products in these states this is how classical dynamics simulations allow us to study chemical reactions andor energy transfer rrkm theory another theory that is particularly suited for studying unimolecular decomposition reactions is named after the four scientists who developed it rice ramsperger
