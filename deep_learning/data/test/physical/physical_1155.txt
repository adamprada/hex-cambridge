molecule the implications of such assumptions are reasonably clear for photochemically activated unimolecular decomposition processes one usually also assumes that the molecule has undergone radiationless relaxation and returned to its ground electronic state but in a quite vibrationally hot situation that is in this case the molecule contains excess vibrational energy equal to the energy of the optical photon used to excite it finally when applied to bimolecular reactions one assumes that collision between the two fragments results in a longlived complex the lifetime of this intermediate must be long enough to allow the energy which is related to the
