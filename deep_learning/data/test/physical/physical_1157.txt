and are the average taken over the three eigenvalues of the moment inertia tensors moments of inertia of the activated molecules and ts species respectively the primary assumption embodied in the above relationship is that the rotational angular momenta of the activated and ts species are the same so their rotational energies can be related as expressed in the equation to changes in geometries as reflected in their moments of inertia because rrkm theory assumes that the vibrational energy is randomly distributed its fundamental rate coefficient equation krm rate dfracgee erm rot neerm roth depends on the total energy the
