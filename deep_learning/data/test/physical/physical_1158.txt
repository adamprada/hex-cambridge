related to that of the activated molecules through erm rot erm rot erm rot left fraciiright to simulate an experiment in which the activated molecules have a thermal distribution of rotational energies the rrkm rate constant is computed for a range of values and then averaged over using the thermal boltzmann population as a weighting factor this can be carried out for example using the mc process for selecting rotational values this then produces a rate constant for any specified total energy e alternatively to simulate experiments in which the activated species are formed in bimolecular collisions at a specified
