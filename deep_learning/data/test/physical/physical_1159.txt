a value and thus an with as the weighting factor he evaluation of the sum of states and the density of states that appear in the rrkm expression is usually carried out using a statecounting algorithm such as that implemented by beyer and swinehart in commun assoc comput machin this algorithm uses knowledge of the harmonic vibrational frequencies of the activated molecules and the frequencies of the ts and determines how many ways a given amount of energy can be distributed among these modes by summing over all such distributions for energy varying from zero to the algorithm determines ge
