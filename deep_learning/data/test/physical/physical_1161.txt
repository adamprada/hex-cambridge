coordinates qj must obey and we write this condition as points lying where are classified as lying in the reactant region of coordinate space while those lying where are in the product region for example if the dividing surface is defined as being a plane perpendicular to the reaction path the function f can be written as here is the reaction coordinate which of course depends on all of the variables and is the value of at the dividing surface if the dividing surface is placed at the transition state on the energy surface vanishes because the transition state is
