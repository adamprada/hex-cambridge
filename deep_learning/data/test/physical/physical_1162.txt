l coordinates are chosen as in the reaction path theory to be the reaction coordinate and l coordinates perpendicular to the reaction path for such a choice one obtains sumj dfracfqj dfracdqjdt fracdsdt dfracpsms where is the momentum along and is the mass factor associated with in the reaction path hamiltonian so in this case the total flux factor reduces to we have seen exactly this construct before in section where the tst expression for the rate coefficient was developed the reaction probability factor is defined in terms of those trajectories that evolve at long time onto the product side
