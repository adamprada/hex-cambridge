by the integral over the initial values of the variables and with the weighting factor of the time correlation function of the flux to evaluate the rate constant in this timedomain framework for a specific chemical reaction one would proceed as follows run an ensemble of trajectories whose initial coordinates and momenta are selected eg using montecarlo methods discussed in chapter from a distribution with as its weighting factor make sure that the initial coordinates lie on the dividing surface because the flux expression contains the factor monitor each trajectory to observe when it again crosses the dividing surface ie
