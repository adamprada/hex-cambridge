initial momentum along to determine at what times the trajectory returns to and to form the product for each such time it is in this manner that one can compute fluxflux correlation functions and thus the rate coefficient notice that trajectories that undergo surface recrossings contribute negative terms to the fluxflux correlation function computed as discussed above that is a trajectory with a positive initial value of can at some later time t cross the dividing surface with a negative value of ie be directed back toward reactants this recrossing will contribute a negative value via the product to the
