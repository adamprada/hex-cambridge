to propagate a classical trajectory is relatively straightforward in addition to the semiclassical tools introduced in chapter there is another powerful tool that allows one to retain much of the computational ease and convenient interpretation of the classical trajectory approach while also incorporating quantum effects that are appropriate under certain circumstances in this wave packet propagation approach one begins with a quantum mechanical wave function that is characterized by two parameters specifying the average value of the position and of the momentum along each coordinate one then propagates not the quantum wave function but the values of these two parameters
