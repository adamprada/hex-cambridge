a gaussian spatial dependence centered at the values and having gaussian width factors related to this dependence tends to make the wave functions amplitude largest when is close to secondly it has a form that looks like the travelling wave that we encountered in chapter in which the coordinate moves with momentum so these wave packet functions have built into them characteristics that allow them to describe motion via the of an amplitude that is centered at with a width given by the parameter in this approach to chemical dynamics we assume the parameters and will undergo classical time evolution
