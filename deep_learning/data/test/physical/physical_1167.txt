packet functions that we need to point out it turns out that functions of the form can be shown to have uncertainties in and in whose product is as small as possible the proof that the wave packet form of the wave function has the smallest uncertainty product is given in the text book quantum mechanics rd ed l i schiff mcgrawhill new york the heisenberg uncertainty relation which is discussed in many texts dealing with quantum mechanics says that this product of coordinate and momentum dispersions must be greater than or equal to in a sense the gaussian wave
