to represent the range of that coordinate in the experiment that is to be simulated for example assume one were to represent the dynamics of a wave function that is prepared by photon absorption of a vibrational state of the hcl molecule from the ground s state to an excitedstate energy surface such a situation is described qualitatively in figure in this case one could choose to be the half width of the harmonic or morse oscillator wave function of hcl and take because this is the average value of the momentum for and the equilibrium bond length for such
