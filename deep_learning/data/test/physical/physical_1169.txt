causes the packet to move as shown for several equally spaced time steps in figure for the two different photons cases at such subsequent times the quantum wave function is then assumed within this model to be given by that is it is taken to be of the same form as the initial wave function but to have simply moved its center from to with a momentum that has changed from to figure propagation of wave packet prepared by absorption of two different photons it should be noticed that the time evolution of the wave packet shown in figure displays
