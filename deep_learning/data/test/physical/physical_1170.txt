time evolves this decay in will occur more rapidly for the highenergy photon case because moves to the right more quickly because the classical momentum grows more rapidly these dynamics will induce exponential decays in ie will vary as at short times in fact the decay of discussed above produces when is fourier transformed the primary characteristic of the correlation function for the higherenergy photon case where dissociation ultimately occurs in such photodissociation spectra one observes a lorentzian line shape whose width is characterized by the decay rate which in turn relates to the total energy of the packet and
