are characteristic of bound motion in contrast to the directly dissociative motion discussed earlier this recurrence will cause to again achieve a large amplitude but will subsequently again undergo decay as the packet once again departs clearly the correlation function will display a series of recurrences followed by exponential decays the frequency of the recurrences is determined by the frequency with which the packet traverses from its inner to outer turning points and back again which is proportional to this of course is the vibrational period of the hcl bond so in such boundmotion cases the spectrum ie the fourier
