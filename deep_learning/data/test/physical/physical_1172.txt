which one coordinates vibrational frequency is ca cm and the others is cm these two modes then require ca ps and ps respectively to undergo one complete oscillation at the wave packet which is a product of two packets one for each mode produces a large ct after ps the first modes coordinate has returned to its initial location but the second mode is only of the way along in its periodic motion moreover after ps the second modes coordinate has returned to near where it began but now the first mode has moved away so at both ps and
