arise in using the wave packet function to describe the time evolution of a molecule or any system that should be treated using quantum mechanics one of the most important limitations of the wave packet approach to be aware of relates to it inability to properly treat wave reflections it is well know that when a wave strikes a hard wall it is reflected by the wall however when for example a water wave moves suddenly from a region of deep water to a much more shallow region one observes both a reflected and a transmitted wave in the discussion
