evolution they are not able to describe dynamical processes that require multiplefragmentation events it is primarily for this reason that wave packet approaches to simulating dynamics are usually restricted to treating shorttime dynamics where such fragmentation of the wave packet is less likely to occur prompt molecular photodissociation processes such as we discussed above is a good example of such a shorttime phenomenon there have been many refinements of the wave packet approach described above some of which are designed to allow for splitting of the wave function i refer the reader to the work of one of the pioneers
