can be the bo electronic wave function belonging to the electronic state in which case we say we are using an adiabatic basis of electronic states the are amplitudes that will relate to the probability that the system is on the energy surface next we assume that the coordinates of the nuclei undergo classical motion in a manner to be specified in further detail below that allows us to know their locations and velocities or momenta at any time this assumption implies that the time dependence of the above wave function is carried in the time dependence of the coordinates
