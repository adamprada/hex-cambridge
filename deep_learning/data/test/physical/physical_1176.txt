next step is to express using the chain rule in terms of derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates and the time rate of change of these coordinates so now the equations for the read as follows the are called nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements for each pair of states and they are a vector in the space of the nuclear coordinates and it is their magnitudes that play a central role in determining the efficiency of surface hoppings below we will make use of the following symmetry property of these quantities which derive from the orthogonality of the these matrix
