if one chooses electronic functions that have vanishing values only the terms induce transitions among surfaces the latter case is said to involve using diabatic wave functions while the former involves adiabatic wave functions for the remainder of this discussion i will assume we are making use of adiabatic ie bo wave functions but i will carry through the derivation in a manner that will allow either adiabatic or diabatic functions to be used because one is eventually interested in the populations for being in various electronic states it is common to recast the above equations for the amplitudes into
