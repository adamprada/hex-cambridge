intersect this helps focus attention on those geometries near which a surface hop is most likely to occur to utilize the most basic form of surface hopping theory one proceeds as follows one begins with initial values of the nuclear coordinates and their velocities that properly characterize the kind of collision or reaction one wishes to simulate of course one has to utilize an ensemble of trajectories with initial conditions chosen to properly describe such an experimental situation in addition one specifies which electronic surface say the surface the system is initially on for each such set of initial conditions
