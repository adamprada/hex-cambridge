state into state they are used as follows a random number is chosen if a hop to surface is allowed to occur otherwise no hop occurs and the system remains to continue its time evolution on surface k if a hop occurs the coordinates and momenta are allowed to now propagate on the energy surface where the forces will of course be different but with one change the component of the velocity vector along the nonadiabatic coupling vector is modified to allow for the fact that the systems electronic energy has suddenly changed from to which must be compensated for
