equations involving continue to be propagated with no changes other than the fact the nuclei may or may not be evolving on a different surface the entire process is repeated until the trajectory reaches termination eg a reaction or quenching is observed or some specified time limit is reached at which time one can probe the properties of the products as reflected in the coordinates and velocities of the nuclei carrying out surface hopping trajectories for an ensemble of trajectories with initial conditions representative of an experiment generates an ensemble of final values ie at the end of each trajectory
