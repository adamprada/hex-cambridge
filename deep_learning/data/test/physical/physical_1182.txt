rates can be viewed as relating to transitions between two surfaces that cross i one surface being that of the initial state plus a photon of energy and ii the second being that of the final state with no photon in this point of view the photon lifts the lowerenergy state upward in energy until it crosses the upper state and then the dipole operator effects the transition making analogy with the photonabsorption case we consider expressing the rates of transitions between an initial state consisting of an electronic state multiplied by a state describing the initial vibrational including interfragment
