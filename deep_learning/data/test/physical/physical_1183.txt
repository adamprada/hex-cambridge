would involve either the electronic hamiltonian couplings if one uses a diabatic basis or the nonadiabatic coupling elements if one used a bo adiabatic basis in either case these elements are functions of the nuclear coordinates and thus do not commute with the differential operators appearing in as a result the operator combination must be handled carefully eg as one does in the coupledcluster expansion treated in chapter by expanding the exponential operators and keeping track of the fact that not all terms commute the lowestorder term in the expansion of this combination of operators is which yields the approximation
