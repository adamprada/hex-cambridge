above rate expression we see a dfunction that limits the integration to only those geometries for which these are the geometries that lie on the intersection seam any geometry can be expressed in terms of the geometry of the point on the seam closest to plus a displacement of magnitude along the unit vector normal to the seam at point if we now expand the energy difference in a taylor series about the point lying on the seam we obtain the gradient of the potential difference has zero components within the subspace of the seam its only nonvanishing component lies
