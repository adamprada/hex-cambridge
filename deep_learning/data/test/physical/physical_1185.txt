by i sampling eg using monte carlo over as much of the seam as is energetically accessible using the initialstate spatial probability density as a weighting factor and ii forming the sampling average of the rate quantity computed for each accepted geometry there is another way to utilize the above rate expression if we think of a swarm of trajectories ie an ensemble representative of the experiment of interest and ask what is the rate at which trajectories pass through a narrow region of thickness at a point on the seam we could write where gives the probability density for
