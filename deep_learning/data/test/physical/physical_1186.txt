will occur and integrate over the entire seam space we can express the rate at which the trajectories will undergo jumps if we divide this rate by the number of trajectories to produce the average rate per trajectory and compare this expression to the rate we derived earlier we see that they would be equivalent if the probability of a surface jump were given by the above expression for the probability of jumping from to is known as the landauzener lz formula the way it is used in most applications is as follows an ensemble of classical trajectories with initial
