region of a crossing seam are taken to be diabatic states because then the coupling matrix elements can be taken from the splitting between the two adiabatic states that undergo an avoided crossing near rather than by evaluating nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements between adiabatic bo states in summary the lz expression for the probability of a surface jump should be viewed as an approximate version of the algorithm provided by the fewestswitches surface hopping approach discussed earlier before closing this section it is useful to point out how this formula applies to two distinct cases if as suggested in figure
