whose stretching generates the curve crossing igure b qualitative depiction of predissociation that can occur from an excited blue surface onto a dissociative green surface alternatively one may be interested in determining the probability that the fragment species atoms in figure b collide on the green curve and undergo a transition to the upper blue curve as a result of this collision for example prompt fluorescence from this upper blue curve might be the experimental signature one wishes to simulate in this case the outcome ie generation of the molecule in the upper blue curves electronic state can occur in
