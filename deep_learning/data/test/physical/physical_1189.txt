reaches the crossing after which prompt fluorescence occurs the overall probability for this path is so the total yield of fluorescence would be related to the quantity the point of these two examples is that the lz formula gives an estimate of the jump probability for a given crossing event one still needs to think about how various crossing events relate to the particular experiment at hand contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and professor of chemistry u utah telluride schools on theoretical chemistry integrated by tomoyuki hayashi uc davis theoretical treatment of electronic structure last updated save
