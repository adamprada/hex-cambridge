hessian matrix of this function that provides the harmonic vibrational frequencies of such isomers in the present chapter i want to provide you with an introduction to the tools that we use to solve the electronic schrödinger equation to generate and the electronic wave function in essence this treatment will focus on orbitals of atoms and molecules and how we obtain and interpret them for an atom one can approximate the orbitals by using the solutions of the hydrogenic schrödinger equation discussed in part of this text although such functions are not proper solutions to the actual electron schrödinger equation
