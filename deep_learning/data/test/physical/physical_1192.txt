the relative energies of the and orbitals are not adequately described in a model that treats electron repulsion effects in terms of a simple screening factor so now it is time to examine how we can move beyond the screening model and take the electron repulsion effects which cause the interelectronic couplings that render the schr√∂dinger equation insoluble into account in a more reliable manner atomic units the electronic hamiltonian that appears throughout this text is commonly expressed in the literature and in other texts in socalled atomic units aus in that form it is written as follows atomic units
