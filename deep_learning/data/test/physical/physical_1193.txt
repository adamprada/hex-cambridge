factor of which has units of energy since a has units of length can then be removed from the coulomb and kinetic energies after which the kinetic energy terms appear as and the potential energies appear as and then choosing changes the kinetic energy terms into as a result the entire electronic hamiltonian takes the form given above in which no me or factors appear the value of the socalled bohr radius turns out to be Ã¥ and the socalled hartree energy unit which factors out of he is ev or kcalmol contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist
