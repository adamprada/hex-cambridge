this is a necessary condition if any concentration is changing with time the reaction is not at equilibrium however our deduction uses another assumption that we have not yet emphasized we assume that the forward and reverse rates of each elementary step are equal when the overall reaction is at equilibrium this is a special case of the principle of microscopic reversibility definition principle of microscopic reversibility any molecular process and its reverse occur with equal rates at equilibrium the principle of microscopic reversibility applies to any molecular process it is inferred from the fact that such processes can be
