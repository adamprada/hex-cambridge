processes that constitute a mechanism and on their relative rates in the previous section we see that microscopic reversibility provides a sufficient basis for deducing the relationship relating reactant and product concentrations at equilibriumthe equilibrium constant expressionfrom our rate equations for elementary reactions we now want to see that the principle of microscopic reversibility is indeed necessary that is setting for all species involved in the reaction is not in itself sufficient to assure that the system is at equilibrium figure cyclic equilibrium we consider the triangular network of elementary reactions shown in figure this network gives rise to the
