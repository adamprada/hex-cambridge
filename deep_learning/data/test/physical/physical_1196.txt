represent the criteria for the system of reactions to be at equilibrium purely as a name for easy reference let us call these equations the cyclic equilibrium set when we consider the reactions one at a time we deduce the following equilibrium relationships for easy reference let us call these equations the oneatatime set now it cannot be true that both sets of relationships specify a sufficient condition for the system to be at equilibrium to see this let us first suppose that the principle of microscopic reversibility is a sufficient condition for equilibrium then the oneatatime set of equations
