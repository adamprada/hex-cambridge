for equilibrium then the cyclic set of equations must be sufficient to uniquely specify the position of equilibrium let us consider a particular set of rate constants and this set of rate constants satisfies the cyclic set of equations and requires that each of the equilibriumconcentration ratios be equal to in this case the oneatatime set of equations implied by microscopic reversibility cannot be satisfied we have and therefore that is if we assume that setting for all species is a sufficient condition for equilibrium we must conclude that the principle of microscopic reversibility is false using the contrapositive if
