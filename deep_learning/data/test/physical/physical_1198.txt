both the forward and reverse directions consequently if a sequence of elementary steps is a mechanism for a forward reaction the same sequence of stepstraversed backwardsmust be a mechanism for the reverse reaction the principle does not exclude the possibility that a given reaction can occur simultaneously by two different mechanisms however it does mean that a given reaction cannot have one mechanism in the forward direction and a second different mechanism in the reverse direction in describing reaction mechanisms we assume that the energy of the reacting molecules depends on their progress along the path that they follow during
