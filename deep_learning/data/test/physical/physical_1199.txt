probabilitydensity function for gas velocities in one dimension last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers in section we find a differential equation in the function unlike the velocity which takes values from zero to infinity the component takes values from minus infinity to plus infinity the probability density at an infinite velocity in either direction is necessarily zero therefore we cannot evaluate the integral of from to an arbitrary velocity however we know from maxwells assumption that the probability density for must be independent of whether
