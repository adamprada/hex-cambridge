last expression specifies the probability density as a function of the relative velocity coordinates next we make a further transformation of variables we convert the velocity of the center of mass and the relative velocity from cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates referred to the axis system the motion of the center of mass is most readily visualized in the original frame the relative motion is most readily visualized in the particleone centered frame in the motion of particle is specified by and the motion of the center of mass is specified by and since it is the relative motion that
