center of mass lie in the intervals to to to while the components of the relative velocity lie in the intervals to to to becomes we are interested in the probability increment for the relative velocityrelative velocityprobability density function irrespective of the velocity of the center of mass to sum the contributions for all possible motions of the center of mass we integrate this expression over the possible ranges of and we have this is the same as the probability increment for a singleparticle velocityalbeit with replacing replacing replacing and replacing as in the singleparticle case we can obtain the
