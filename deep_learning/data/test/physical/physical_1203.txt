same conclusion by considering the relative motion of two particles that represents the average case as illustrated in figure this occurs when the two particles have the same speed but are moving at degree angles to one another in this situation the length of the resultant vectorthe relative speed is just the rate of collisions between unlike gas molecules last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers we define the collision frequencycollision frequency as the number of collision per unit time between a single molecule of type
