inequality leads to an important constraint on the work that can be done on a system during a spontaneous process in which the temperature of the surroundings is constant as we discuss in section the initial state of the spontaneous process cannot be a true equilibrium state in our present considerations we assume that the initial values of all the state functions of the spontaneously changing system are the same as those of a true equilibrium system likewise we assume that the final state of the spontaneously changing system is either a true equilibrium state or a state whose thermodynamic
