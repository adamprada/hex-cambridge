at equilibrium a system that is not isolated can undergo any change that results in an increase in the entropy of the universe and conversely such changes are also said to be spontaneous if a system that is not isolated undergoes a change but the entropy of the universe remains constant the change is not spontaneous the entropy changes for the system and the surroundings are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign the change is said to be reversible although the first statement applies to isolated systems and the second applies to systems that are not isolated we usually
