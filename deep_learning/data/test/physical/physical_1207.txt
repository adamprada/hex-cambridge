functions can change thus and since we have for a spontaneous change in a system that is not isolated can be greater or less than zero however and must satisfy in a system that is not isolated reversible change may be possible a system that undergoes a reversible change is ator is arbitrarily close toone of its equilibrium states during every part of the process for a reversible change it is always true that so that our criteria for change are admirably terse but to appreciate them we need to understand precisely what is meant by entropy to use the
