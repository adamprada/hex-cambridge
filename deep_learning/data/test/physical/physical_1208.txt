evidently the entropy of the universe is at a maximum when the system is at equilibrium typically we are interested in what happens when the interaction between the system and surroundings serves to impose conditions on the final state of a system a common example of such conditions is that the surroundings maintain the system at a constant pressure while providing a constanttemperature heat reservoir with which the system can exchange heat in such cases the system is not isolated it turns out that we can use the entropy criterion to develop supplemental criteria based on other thermodynamic functions these
