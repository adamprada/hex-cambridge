at the same pressure temperature having volumes and after being allowed to mix isothermally the partial pressures of the two gases will drop by a factor of although the total pressure will still be the original value and the volumes occupied by the two gases will double enthalpy of mixing assuming ideal behavior so that interactions between individual gas molecules are unimportant it is fairly easy to calculate delta h for each gas as it is simply an isothermal expansion the total enthalpy of mixing is then given by and since the enthalpy change for an isothermal expansion of an
