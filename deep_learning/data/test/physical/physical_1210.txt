of the two gases fortunately entropy changes for isothermal expansions are easy to calculate for ideal gases if we use the initial volumes va and vb for the initial volumes of gases a and b the total volume after mixing is and the total entropy change is noting that the term where is the mole fraction of after mixing and that can be expresses as the product of and the total number of moles the expression can be rewritten delta smix ntot r left chia ln chia chib ln chib right it should be noted that because the mole fraction
