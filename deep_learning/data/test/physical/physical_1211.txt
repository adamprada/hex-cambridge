ideal gases and is summarized in the graph below again because then implying that mixing is always a spontaneous process for an ideal solution this is true for gases but for many combinations of liquids or solids the strong intermolecular forces may make mixing unfavorable for example in the case of vegetable oil and water also these interactions may make the volume nonadditive as well as in the case of ethanol and water mixing is always a spontaneous process for an ideal solution contributors and attributions patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay thermodynamic
