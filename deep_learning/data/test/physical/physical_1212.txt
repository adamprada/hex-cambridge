different words by saying that the state of a system is completely specified when the values of all of its state variables are specified if we initially have a system in some equilibrium state and change one or more of the variables that characterize it the system will eventually reach a new equilibrium state in which some state variables will have values different from those that characterized the original state if we want to return the system to its original state we must arrange matters so that the value of every state variable is the same as it was originally
