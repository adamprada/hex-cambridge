a system passes from one state to another other important thermodynamic variables are defined as functions of pressure volume temperature energy and entropy these include enthalpy the gibbs free energy the helmholtz free energy chemical activity and the chemical potential our goals in developing the subject of chemical thermodynamics are to define each of these state functions learn how to measure each of them and provide a theory that relates the change that occurs in any one of them to the changes that occur in the others when a chemical system changes from one state to another any interaction through
