variable would be of limited utility thermodynamic variables can be sorted into two classes in another way consider the pressure temperature and volume of an equilibrium system we can imagine inserting a barrier that divides this original system into two subsystemswithout changing anything else each of the subsystems then has the temperature and pressure of the original system however the volume of each subsystem is different from the volume of the original system we say that temperature and pressure are intensive variables by which we mean that the temperature or pressure of an equilibrium system is independent of the size
