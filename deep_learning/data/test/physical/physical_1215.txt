density by dividing by the systems volume we will discover that it is useful to define certain partial molar quantities which have units like energy per mole partial molar quantities are intensive variables we will find a partial molar quantity that is particularly important in describing chemical equilibrium it is called the chemical potential and since it is a partial molar quantity the chemical potentialchemical potential is an intensive thermodynamic variable we think of a system as a specific collection of matter containing specified phases our goal is to develop mathematical models equations that relate a systems state functions to
