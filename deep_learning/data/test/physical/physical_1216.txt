of any system that contains specified substances and phases by specifying the values of the systems intensive variables in general not all of these intensive variables will be independent the number of intensive variables that are independent is called the number of degrees of freedom available to the system this is also the number of intensive variables that can change independently while a given system remains at equilibrium to completely define a particular system we must specify the size and composition of each phase to do so we must specify the values of some number of extensive variables these extensive
