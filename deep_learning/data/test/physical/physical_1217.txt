in j willard gibbs developed an equation called gibbs phase rule from which we can calculate the number of degrees of freedom available to any particular system we introduce gibbs phase rule in section the perspective and analysis that underlie gibbs phase rule have a significance that transcends use of the rule to find the number of degrees of freedom available to a system in essence the conditions assumed in deriving gibbs phase rule define what we mean by equilibrium in chemical systems from experience we are usually confident that we know when a system is at equilibrium and when
