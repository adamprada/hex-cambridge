accessible to the system at equilibrium and the possible paths along which the system can undergo reversible change the thermodynamic theory that we develop predicts quantitatively how a systems equilibrium position changes in response to a change that we impose on one or more of its state functions the principle of le chatelier makes qualitative predictions about such changes we introduce the principle of le chatelier and its applications later in this chapter in chapter we revisit this principle to understand it as a restatement in qualitative terms of the thermodynamic criteria for equilibrium the role of the ideal gas
