experimental and a theoretical perspective in chapter we review the experimental observations that we can make on gases and the idealizations that we introduce to extrapolate the behavior of ideal gases from the observations we make on real gases we also develop boyles law from a very simple model for the interactions between pointmass gas molecules and the walls of their container in chapter we develop a detailed model for the behavior of an ideal gas the physical model is the one we use in chapter but the mathematical treatment is much more sophisticated for this treatment we need to
