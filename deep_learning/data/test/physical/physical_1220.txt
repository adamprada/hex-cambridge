treat electronic motion classically and found that features observed clearly in experimental measurements simply were not consistent with such a treatment attempts were made to supplement the classical equations with conditions that could be used to rationalize such observations for example early workers required that the angular momentum be allowed to assume only integer multiples of which is often abbreviated as which can be shown to be equivalent to the bohr postulate however until scientists realized that a new set of laws those of quantum mechanics applied to light microscopic particles a wide gulf existed between laboratory observations of moleculelevel
