relevant model problems by learning the solutions of the schr√∂dinger equation for a few model systems the student can better appreciate the treatment of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics as well as their relation to experimental measurement for which the wave functions of the known model problems offer important interpretations operators each physically measurable quantity has a corresponding operator the eigenvalues of the operator tell the only values of the corresponding physical property that can be observed in an experimental probe of that property some operators have a continuum of eigenvalues but others have only discrete quantized eigenvalues any
