the cartesian momenta by can then be made and the resultant expression can be transformed back to the curvilinear coordinates if desired example for example the classical kinetic energy of particles with masses moving in a potential field containing both quadratic and linear coordinatedependence can be written as the quantum mechanical operator associated with this is such an operator would occur when for example one describes the sum of the kinetic energies of a collection of particles the first term in eq plus the sum of hookes law parabolic potentials the second term in eq and the interactions of the
