classical form of for which the quantum operator is where is the charge on the particle notice that in this case classical and quantum forms are identical because contains no momentum operators remember the mapping from to is straightforward only in terms of cartesian coordinates to map a classical function given in terms of curvilinear coordinates even if they are orthogonal into its quantum operator is not at all straightforward the mapping can always be done in terms of cartesian coordinates after which a transformation of the resulting coordinates and differential operators to a curvilinear system can be performed the
