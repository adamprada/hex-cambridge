example will help clarify these points the differential operator acts on what functions of to generate the same function back again but multiplied by a constant the answer is functions of the form since so we say that is an eigenfunction of and is the corresponding eigenvalue as i will discuss in more detail shortly the eigenvalues of the operator tell us the only values of the physical property corresponding to the operator that can be observed in a laboratory measurement some operators that we encounter possess eigenvalues that are discrete or quantized for such properties laboratory measurement will result
