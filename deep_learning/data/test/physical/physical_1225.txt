about the corresponding momentum operator lets take the left hand side of the above identity for and rewrite it using integration by parts as follows if the functions and are assumed to vanish at the righthand side of this equation can be rewritten as so ihbar dfracq is indeed a hermitian operator moreover using the fact that and are hermitian one can show that any operator formed using the rules described above is also hermitian one thing you need to be aware of concerning the eigenfunctions of any hermitian operator is that each pair of eigenfunctions and belonging to different
