property in mind because you will soon see that it is a characteristic of all eigenfunctions of any hermitian operator it is common to write the integrals displaying the normalization and orthogonality conditions in the following socalled dirac notation and where the and symbols represent and respectively and putting the two together in the construct implies the integration over the variables that y depends upon the hermitian character of an operator means that this operator forms a hermitian matrix when placed between pairs of functions and the coordinates are integrated over for example the matrix representation of an operator when
