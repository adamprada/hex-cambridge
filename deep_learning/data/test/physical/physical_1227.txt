in the case of degenerate eigenvalues can be chosen to be orthogonal lets see how these conditions follow from the hermiticity property if the operator has two eigenfunctions and having eigenvalues and respectively then multiplying this equation on the left by and integrating over the coordinates denoted that acts on gives the hermitian nature of allows us to also write which because gives if is not equal to the only way the leftmost and rightmost terms in this equality can be equal is if which means the two eigenfunctions are orthogonal if the two eigenfunctions and have equal eigenvalues the
