wave function depends on many coordinates for it depends on the and or and coordinates of the ten electrons and the and or and coordinates of the oxygen nucleus and of the two protons a total of thirtynine coordinates appear in if one is interested in what the probability distribution is for finding the corresponding momenta at time the wave function has to first be written as a combination of the eigenfunctions of the momentum operators expressing in this manner is possible because the momentum operator is hermitian and it can be shown that the eigenfunctions of any hermitian operator
