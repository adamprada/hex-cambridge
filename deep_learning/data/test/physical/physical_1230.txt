a function of time is replaced by the concept of the probability density for finding coordinate qj at a particular value at a particular time or the probability density for finding momentum at time the hamiltonian eigenstates are especially important in chemistry because many of the tools that chemists use to study molecules probe the energy states of the molecule for example most spectroscopic methods are designed to determine which energy state electronic vibrational rotational nuclear spin etc a molecule is in however there are other experimental measurements that measure other properties eg the component of angular momentum or the
