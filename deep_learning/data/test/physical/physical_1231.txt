and a particular eigenvalue has been observed the systems wave function becomes the eigenfunction that corresponds to that eigenvalue that is the act of making the measurement causes the systems wave function to become the eigenfunction of the property that was measured this is what is meant when one hears that the act of making a measurement can change the state of the system in quantum mechanics what happens if some other property g whose quantum mechanical operator is is measured in a case where we have already determined we know from what was said earlier that some eigenvalue mk
