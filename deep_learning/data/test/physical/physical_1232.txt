if they obey this property let us see how this property leads to the conclusion about y remaining unchanged if the two operators commute in particular we apply the g operator to the above eigenvalue equation from which we concluded that next we use the commutation to rewrite the lefthand side of this equation and use the fact that is a scalar number to thus obtain so now we see that itself is an eigenfunction of f having eigenvalue so unless there are more than one eigenfunction of f corresponding to the eigenvalue ie unless this eigenvalue is degenerate must
