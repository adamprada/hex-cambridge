to laboratory measurements in summary when the operators corresponding to two physical properties commute once one measures one of the properties and thus causes the system to be an eigenfunction of that operator subsequent measurement of the second operator will if the eigenvalue of the first operator is not degenerate produce a unique eigenvalue of the second operator and will not change the system wave function if either of the two properties is subsequently measured even over and over again the wave function will remain unchanged and the value observed for the property being measured will remain the same as
