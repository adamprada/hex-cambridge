let us consider the following orbital angular momentum operators for particles or and it turns out that the operator can be shown to commute with any one of or but or do not commute with one another we will discuss these operators in considerably more detail in chapter section for now please accept these statements let us assume a measurement of is carried out and one obtains the value thus far all one knows is that the system can be described by a wave function that is some combination of etc angular momentum functions having different values but all having
