specific value the probability of observing any particular value will be given by once this measurement is realized the wave function will contain only terms having that specific value and for example if is found we know the wave function has and so we know it is a fsymmetry function with but we dont know any more that is we dont know if it is an etc ffunction what now happens if we make a measurement of when the system is in the state recall this is a value of the component of angular momentum because and commute the measurement
