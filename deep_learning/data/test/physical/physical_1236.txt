how atoms ions and molecules behave when subjected to statespecific measurements so i urge you to get used to the fact that quantum mechanics has rules and behaviors that may be new to you but need to be mastered by you the schrödinger equation this equation is an eigenvalue equation for the energy or hamiltonian operator its eigenvalues provide the only allowed energy levels of the system the timedependent equation if the hamiltonian operator contains the time variable explicitly one must solve the timedependent schrödinger equation before moving deeper into understanding what quantum mechanics means it is useful to learn
