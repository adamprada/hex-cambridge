this hermitian operator is called the hamiltonian and is formed as stated above by first writing down the classical mechanical expression for the total energy kinetic plus potential in cartesian coordinates and momenta and then replacing all classical momenta by their quantum mechanical operators for the example used above the classical mechanical energy of all thirteen particles is where the indices and are used to label the ten electrons whose thirty cartesian coordinates and thirty cartesian momenta are and and and label the three nuclei whose charges are denoted and whose nine cartesian coordinates and nine cartesian momenta are and
