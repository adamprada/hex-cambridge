this step is an example of the use of the separations of variables method to solve a differential equation substituting this ansatz into the timedependent schr√∂dinger equation gives psiqj ihbar fracpartial fpartial t ft textbfhpsiqj tag dividing by then gives since is only a function of time and is only a function of the spatial coordinates and because the left hand and right hand sides must be equal for all values of t and of both the left and right hand sides must equal a constant if this constant is called e the two equations that are embodied in this
