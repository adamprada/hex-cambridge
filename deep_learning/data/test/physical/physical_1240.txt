operator recall earlier that we showed the component of angular momentum for a single particle is to equal when the schr√∂dinger equation can be separated to generate a timeindependent equation describing the spatial coordinate dependence of the wave function the eigenvalue must be returned to the equation determining to find the time dependent part of the wave function by solving once is known one obtains and the full wave function can be written as for the above example the time dependence is expressed by in such cases the spatial probability density does not depend upon time because the product reduces
