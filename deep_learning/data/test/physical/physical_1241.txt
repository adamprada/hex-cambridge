it is possible to prepare in the laboratory even when the hamiltonian contains no explicit time dependence wave functions that are time dependent and that have timedependent spatial probability densities for example one can prepare a state of the hydrogen atom that is a superposition of the and wave functions where the two eigenstates obey and when does not contain explicitly it is possible to then express in terms of as follows this function which is a superposition of and functions does indeed obey the full timedependent schr√∂dinger equation the probability of observing the system in the state if a
