has resulted in a body of theory and a body of experimental results that are mutually compatible when we define and measure energy correctly we do indeed find that energy is a state function and that it is conserved the theory of relativity introduced a significant expansion of the energy concept for chemical processes we can view mass and energy conservation as independent postulates for processes in which fundamental particles undergo changes and for systems moving at velocities near that of light we cannot relativity asserts that the energy of a particle is given by einsteins equation in this equation
