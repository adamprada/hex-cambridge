with the mass of a stationary particle for which the situation with respect to the second law is similar from experience with devices that convert heat into work the idea evolved that such devices must have particular properties consideration of these properties led to the discovery of a new state function which we call entropy and to which we customarily assign the symbol we introduce the laws of thermodynamics in we repeat our statement of the second law here the second law of thermodynamics in a reversible process in which a closed system accepts an increment of heat from its
