model from which we can estimate the entropy of a nonequilibrium state or an equilibrium system that is a good model for the initial state of the spontaneous process we can usually find an equilibrium system that is a good model for the initial state of a spontaneous process typically some alteration of an equilibrium system makes the spontaneous change possible the changeenabled state is the initial state for a spontaneous process but its thermodynamic state functions are essentially identical to those of the prealteration equilibrium state for example suppose that a solution contains the reactants and products for some
