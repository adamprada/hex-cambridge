as the catalyst is introduced the system can no longer be considered to be in an equilibrium state the spontaneous reaction proceeds until it reaches equilibrium we can find the entropy change for the spontaneous process by finding the entropy change for a reversible process that takes the initial precatalyst quasiequilibrium state to the final postcatalyst equilibrium state our statement of the second law establishes the properties of entropy by postulate while this approach is rigorously logical it does not help us understand the ideas involved like the first law the second law can be stated several ways to develop
