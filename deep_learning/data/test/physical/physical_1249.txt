assuming that proposition is false so that proposition is true we let be the entropybased statement of the second law the sketch in figure describes the interaction of this perpetual motion machine with its surroundings from our entropybased statement of the second law we can assert some important facts about the entropy changes that accompany operation of the machine since entropy is a state function for one cycle of the machine if the machine works that is is true then the entropybased statement requires that since it follows that we can make this more explicit by writing the machinebased statement
