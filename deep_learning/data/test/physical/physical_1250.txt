at we can effect identically the same change in the surroundings using some other process to reversibly extract this amount of heat the entropy change in the surroundings in this reversible process will be and this will be the same as the entropy change for the surroundings in one cycle of the machine we consider this conclusion further in it follows that and since while we have we can write this conclusion more explicitly figure a perpetual motion machine ppm that violates the second law by assuming a perpetual motion machine of the second kind is possiblethat is by assuming
