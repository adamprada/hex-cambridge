asserts the definition and basic properties of entropy that we need in order to make predictions about natural processes the ultimate justification for these assertions is that the predictions they make agree with experimental observations we have devoted considerable attention to arguments that develop the definition and properties of entropy from the machinebased statement of the second law these arguments parallel those that were made historically as these concepts were developed understanding these arguments greatly enhances our appreciation for the relationship between the properties of the entropy function and the changes that can occur in various physical systems while these
