in applying these rules one must examine and and determine by how many if any spinorbitals and differ in so doing one may have to reorder the spinorbitals in one of the determinants to achieve maximal coincidence with those in the other determinant it is essential to keep track of the number of permutations that one makes in achieving maximal coincidence the results of the slatercondon rules given below are then multiplied by to obtain the matrix elements between the original and the final result does not depend on whether one chooses to permute or to determine the hamiltonian is
