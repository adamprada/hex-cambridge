earlier in section any matrix element involving one and twoelectron operators needs to be expressed in terms of integrals involving the spinorbitals in the two determinants and the one and twoelectron operators to simplify the above expression which contains terms in its two summations one proceeds as follows a use is made of the identity to move the permutation operator to just before the langle p phiphicdotsphikkcdotsphinncdots phinn fg q phiphicdotsphikkcdotsphinncdotsphinnrangle langle phiphicdotsphikkcdotsphinncdots phinn pfg q phiphicdotsphikkcdotsphinncdotsphinnrangle b because and contain sums over all electrons in a symmetric fashion any permutation acting on leaves these sums unchanged so commutes with
