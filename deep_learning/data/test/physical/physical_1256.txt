even for if there are three spinorbital differences neither the nor operator gives rise to any nonvanishing results b if we now consider any other permutation the situation does not improve because any permutation cannot alter the fact that three spinorbital mismatches do not generate any nonvanishing results if there are only two spinorbital mismatches say in locations and the integrals we need to evaluate are of the form and c again beginning with we can conclude that all of the integrals involving the operator ie and vanish because the two spinorbital mismatch is too much even for or to
