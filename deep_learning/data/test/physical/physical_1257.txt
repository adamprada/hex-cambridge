the operator produces no nonvanishing contributions because these permutations generate orthogonality integrals for the operator and the only nonvanishing contributions are where the sum over runs over all of the spinorbitals that are common to both of the two determinants f among all other permutations the only one that produces a nonvanishing result are those that permute the spinorbital in the kth location with another spinorbital and they produce the minus sign arises from the factor associated with this pair wise permutation operator finally if there is no mismatch ie the two determinants are identical then g the identity permutation
