and differ by two spinorbitals and note that the contribution vanishes in this case if and differ by three or more spin orbitals then or the identity operator the matrix elements if and differ by one or more spinorbitals ie the slater determinants are orthonormal if their spinorbitals are in these expressions is used to denote the oneelectron integral and or in short hand notation represents the twoelectron integral the notation introduced above gives the twoelectron integrals for the operator in the socalled dirac notation in which the and indices label the spinorbitals that refer to the coordinates and the
