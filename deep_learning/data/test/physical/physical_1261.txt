and mass are examples of extensive variables the value of intensive properties is that they can be conveniently tabulated for various substances whereas extensive properties would be specific to individual systems oftentimes it is the case that the ratio of two extensive variables results in an intensive variable since the amount of substance cancels out an example of this is density which is the ratio of mass and volume another example is molar volume which is the ratio of volume and number of moles of substance for a given substance the molar volume is inversely proportional to the density of
