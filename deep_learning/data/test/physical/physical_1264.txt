the system the heat reservoir can exchange heat but not work with the system in this sketch the heat reservoir is at a constant temperature it might comprise for example a large quantity of ice and water in phase equilibrium the workgenerating device cannot exchange heat but it can exchange work with the system a partially extended spring represents the potential energy available in the surroundings the system can do work on the device and increase the potential energy of the spring alternatively the surroundings can transfer energy to the system at the expense of the potential energy of the
