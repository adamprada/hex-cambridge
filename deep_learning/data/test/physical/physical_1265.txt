the system in figure we indicate the temperatures of system and surroundings by and respectively we adopt this general rule when a thermodynamic quantity appears with a superscripted caret the quantity is that of the surroundings if there is no superscripted caret the quantity is that of the system thus and are the temperature the energy and the entropy of the surroundings respectively whereas and are the corresponding quantities for the system we develop thermodynamics by reasoning about closed chemical systems that consist of one or more homogeneous phases a phase can be a solid a liquid or a gas
