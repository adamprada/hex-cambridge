university east bay calculating a third law entropycontributors and attributions one important consequence of botlzmanns proposal is that a perfectly ordered crystal ie one that has only one energetic arrangement in its lowest energy state will have an entropy of this makes entropy qualitatively different than other thermodynamic functions for example in the case of enthalpy it is impossible have a zero to the scale without setting an arbitrary reference which is that the enthalpy of formation of elements in their standard states is zero but entropy has a natural zero it is the state at which a system has
