to measure heat capacities very near zero k fortunately many substances follow the debye extrapolation in that at very low temperatures their heat capacities are proportional to t using this assumption we have a temperature dependence model that allows us to extrapolate absolute zero based on the heat capacity measured at as low a temperature as can be found example sio is found to have a molar heat capacity of j mol k at k yamashita et al calculate the molar entropy of sio at k solution using the debye model the heat capacity is given by the value of
