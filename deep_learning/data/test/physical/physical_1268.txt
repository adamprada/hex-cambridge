of familiar observations from which we infer that every equilibrium state of any system is intersected by one and only one adiabat and by one and only one isotherm when only pressurevolume work is possible each pressurevolume point specifies a unique equilibrium state of the system since temperature is a state function the temperature of this state has one and only one value when another form of work is possible every point specifies a unique state for which the temperature has one and only one value from experience we know that we can produce a new state of the system
