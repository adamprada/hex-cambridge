we know that we can effect such a change with any reversible system the result is a new equilibrium state when we make the increment of work arbitrarily small the new equilibrium state is arbitrarily close to the original state successive exchanges of arbitrarily small work increments produce successive equilibrium states that are arbitrarily close to one another this succession of arbitrarily close equilibrium states is an adiabat if the same state of a system could be reached by two reversible adiabats involving the same form of work the effect of doing a given amount of this work on an
