the machinebased statement of the second law two such adiabats would necessarily intersect a common isotherm a path along one adiabat the isotherm and the second adiabat would be a cycle that restored the system to its original state this path would enclose a finite area traversed in the appropriate direction the cycle would produce work in the surroundings by the first law the system would then accept heat as it traverses the isotherm the system would exchange heat with surroundings at a single temperature and produce positive work in the surroundings thus violating the machinebased statement if an adiabatic
