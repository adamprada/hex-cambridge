equivalent to the assumption that temperature is a continuous singlevalued function of the state of the system that there is one and only one adiabat for every state is equivalent to the assumption that or generally is a continuous singlevalued function of the state of the system with these ideas in mind let us now observe that any reversible cycle can be described by a closed path in a space whose coordinates are and entropy in figure we sketch this space with on the abscissa then an isotherm is a horizontal line and line of constant entropy an isentrope is
