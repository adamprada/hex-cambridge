the conclusion that for a reversible carnot cycle producing any form of work the fact that a cyclic process corresponds to a closed path in this space is equivalent to the fact that entropy is a state function figure a reversible cycle described using coordinates and to appreciate this aspect of the path of a cyclic process in space let us describe the path of the same process in a space whose coordinates are and with on the abscissa isotherms are again horizontal lines and adiabats are vertical lines in this space a reversible carnot cycle does not begin and
