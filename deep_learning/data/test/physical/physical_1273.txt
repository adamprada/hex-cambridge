in a threedimensional space is the height of the surface above the plane at the point in the plane if we consider points and in the plane the vertical separation between the corresponding points on the surface and is we can add to without changing its value then if we consider a small change such that and we have letting we have we call the total differential of the function where is the amount by which changes when changes by an arbitrarily small increment and changes by an arbitrarily small increment we use the notation and to represent the partial
