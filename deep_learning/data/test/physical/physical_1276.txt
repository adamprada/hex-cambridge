a variance of the approximation to the normal distribution becomes better as becomes larger it turns out that the number of trials that is needed to get a good estimate of the variance is substantially larger than the number required to get a good estimate of the mean the variational method last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack simonsprofessor emeritus and henry eyring scientist chemistry at university of utah contributors and attributions let us now turn to the other method that is used to solve schr√∂dinger equations approximately the variational method in this approach one must again
