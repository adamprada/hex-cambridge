eigenstates ie true and true of the true hamiltonian these states obey because these true states form a complete set it can be shown that the eigenfunctions of all the hamiltonian operators we ever encounter have this property our socalled trial wavefunction can in principle be expanded in terms of these before proceeding further allow me to overcome one likely misconception what i am going through now is only a derivation of the working formula of the variational method the final formula will not require us to ever know the exact or the exact but we are allowed to use
