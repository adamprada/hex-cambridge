way to minus infinity there are systems for which this is not the case we saw one earlier when studying the stark effect but we will now assume that we are not dealing with such systems this allows us to introduce the inequality which says that all of the energies are higher than or equal to the energy of the lowest state which we denote introducing this inequality into the above expression gives this means that the variational energy computed as will lie above the true groundstate energy no matter what trial function we use the significance of the above
