form to represent a twoelectron ion of nuclear charge and suppose that you are lucky enough that i have already evaluated the variational energy expression equation refenergy which ill call for you and found now lets find the optimum value of the variational parameter for an arbitrary nuclear charge by setting after finding the optimal value of well then find the optimal energy by plugging this into the above expression note that represents the shielding factor of one s electron to the other reducing the optimal effective nuclear charge by this amount those familiar with slaters rules will not be
