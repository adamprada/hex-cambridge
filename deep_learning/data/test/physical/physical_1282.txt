attributions one of the most active research areas in statistical mechanics involves the evaluation of socalled equilibrium time correlation functions such as we encountered in chapter the correlation function is defined in terms of two physical operators and a time dependence that is carried by a hamiltonian via and an equilibrium average over a boltzmann population the quantum mechanical expression for is while the classical mechanical expression here we allow the factor that occurs in the partition function shown in section to be canceled out in the numerator and denominator for simplicity is where and are the values of all
