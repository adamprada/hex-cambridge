transport coefficients eg diffusion coefficients viscosity can be expressed in terms of timecorrelation functions it is beyond the scope of this text to go much further in this direction so i will limit my discussion to the optical spectroscopy case at hand which requires that we now discuss how the timeevolution aspect of this problem is dealt with the text statistical mechanics d a mcquarrie harper and row new york has a nice treatment of such other correlation functions so the reader is directed to that text for further details the computation of correlation functions involves propagating either wave functions
