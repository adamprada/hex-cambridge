so with many eg m selections of the initial and variables of the molecules being made one would allow the newton dynamics of each set of initial conditions to proceed during each such trajectory one would monitor the initial value of the property and the time progress of the property one would then compute the mc average to obtain the correlation function where the index labels the accepted configurations and momenta of the mc sampling in the quantum case the time propagation is especially challenging and is somewhat beyond the scope of this text however i want to give you
