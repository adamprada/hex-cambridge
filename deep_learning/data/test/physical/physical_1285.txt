timepropagation in the quantum case and it is these new devices that i now attempt to describe in a manner much like we saw in section s discussion of time propagation of wave functions to illustrate consider the time propagation issue contained in the quantum definition of shown above one is faced with propagating from up to time using and then acting with the operator acting with the operator on and then propagating from up to time using then requires that these two timepropagated functions be multiplied together and integrated over the coordinates that depends on the operator that also
