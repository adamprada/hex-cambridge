begins by dividing the time interval into discrete steps this can be the real time interval or the complex interval the number will eventually be taken to be large so each time step has a small magnitude this fact allows us to use approximations to the exponential operator appearing in the propagator that are valid only for short time steps for each of these short time steps one then approximates the propagator in the most commonly used socalled split symmetric form here and are the potential and kinetic energy operators that appear in it is possible to show that the
