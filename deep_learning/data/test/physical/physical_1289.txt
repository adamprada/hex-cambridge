is called the action in classical mechanics recall that in chapter we used quantization of the action in the particleinabox problem hence the ndimensional integral in terms of which is expressed can be written as f qp t leftfracmpi ihbar delta trightp sumtext all paths expbigfracihbar int dt l big fq t here the notation all paths is realized in the earlier version of this equation by dividing the time axis from to into equal divisions and denoting the coordinates of the system at the jth time step by by then allowing each to assume all possible values ie integrating
