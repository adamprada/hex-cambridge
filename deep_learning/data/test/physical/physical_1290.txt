evolutions is really the exponentials of these action components can have both real and imaginary parts the real parts which arise from the cause the exponential terms to be damped ie to undergo exponential decay but the imaginary parts give rise in to oscillations the sum of many many actually an infinite number of oscillatory terms is extremely difficult to evaluate because of the tendency of contributions from one path to cancel those of another path the practical evaluation of such sums remains a very active research subject the most commonly employed approximation to this sum involves finding the paths
