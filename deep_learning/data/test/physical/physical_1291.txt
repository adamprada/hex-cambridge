that connect at and at at and one evaluates the action for each such path one then applies the formula phiqp t leftfracmpi ihbar delta trightp sumtext all paths expbigfracihbar int dt l big fq t but includes in the sum only the contribution from the classical paths in this way one obtains an approximate quantum propagated wave function via a procedure that requires knowledge of only classical propagation paths clearly the quantum propagation of wave functions even within the semiclassical approximation discussed above is a rather complicated affair however keep in mind the alternative that one would face in
