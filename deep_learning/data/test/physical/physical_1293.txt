a minimum we solve this problem proceeding much as one would do if one had to minimize a function of a variable we differentiate with respect to the variable and set the derivative to zero however in our case we have a function of a function not a function of a variable so how do we carry out the derivative we assume that the function that minimizes is known and we express any function that differs a little bit from the correct as where is a scalar quantity used to suggest that and differ by only a small amount and
