stable with respect to variations in can be expressed as which is equivalent to requiring that the terms linear in in the above expansion for vanish next we use integration by parts to rewrite the first term involving as a term involving instead because the function vanishes at and the first term vanishes so this identity can be used to rewrite the condition that the terms in that are linear in vanish as because this result is supposed to be valid for any function that vanishes at and tf the factor multiplying in the above integral must itself vanish this
