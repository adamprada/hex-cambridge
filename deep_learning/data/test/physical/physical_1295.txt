induced transitionsreferencescontributors and attributions when dealing with the effects of external perturbations eg applied fields collisions with other species one needs to have a way to estimate the probabilities and rates of transitions among states of the system of interest induced by these perturbations timedependent perturbation theory tdpt offers a framework within which such estimates can be achieved derivation in deriving the working equations of tdpt one begins with the timedependent schr√∂dinger equation in which is the hamiltonian for the system whose transitions are to be probed and is the perturbation caused by the external field or the collision the
