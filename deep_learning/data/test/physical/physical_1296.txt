derivation treats the zerothorder states and as eigenfunctions of however in most practical applications of tdpt and are not known exactly and in fact are usually approximated by using variational or perturbative methods eg to treat differences between hf meanfield and true coulombic interactions among electrons so the derivation of tdpt that we are pursuing assumes the and are exact eigenfunctions when the final tdpt working equations are thus obtained one usually substitutes perturbative or variational approximations to and into these equations substituting the orderbyorder expansion into the schr√∂dinger equation gives for the left and righthand sides ihbar fracpartial psipartial
