than focusing on any of these particular forms of spectroscopic transitions to proceed further one needs to say something about how the perturbation depends on time in the most common application of tdpt the perturbation is assumed to consist of a term that depends on spatial variables denoted multiplied by a timedependent factor of sinusoidal character an example of such a perturbation is provided by the electric dipole potential vttextbfecdot esumn zn textbfrn e sumi textbfri cosomega t characterizing photons of frequency interacting with the nuclei and electrons of a molecule textbfecdot esumn zn textbfrn e sumi textbfri is the
