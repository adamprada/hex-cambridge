we will focus much of our attention to this class of perturbations in this chapter to proceed deriving the working equations of tdpt the above expression for is inserted into the differential equation for the expansion coefficients and the equation is integrated from an initial time to a final time these times describe when the external perturbation is first turned on and when it is turned off respectively for example a laser whose photon intensity profile is described by might be pulsed on from to and one wants to know what fraction of the molecules initially in have undergone transitions
