fact that the photon source used to induce the transitions being studied most likely is not perfectly monochromatic if it is characterized as suggested earlier by a distribution of frequencies that is broader than the width of the large central peak in figure nb this will be true if the time duration is long enough then when we average over to obtain a result that directly relates to this kind of experiment we obtain intinftyinfty fomegacftdomega fraclangle psifvrpsifrranglehbar intinftyinfty fomegafracsinomegaomegaftomegaomegafdomega fracpilangle psifvrpsifrranglethbarfomegaflangle cft rangle label we are allowed to write the integral over as ranging from to because the function
