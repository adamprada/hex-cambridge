the light source because we carried out this derivation within firstorder perturbation theory we should trust this result only under conditions where the effects of the perturbation are small in the context of the example considered here this means only for short times that is we should view as expressing the shorttime estimate of the probability of a transition from to and obtained as as expressing the initial rate of such transitions within the firstorder tdpt approximation it should be noted that the rate expression given above will not be valid if the time duration t of the perturbation does
