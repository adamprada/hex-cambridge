this is a firstorder theory the rates of transitions from one quantum state to another induced by a perturbation whose spatial dependence is characterized by and whose time dependence is sinusoidal the same kind of coupling matrix elements as we experienced in timeindependent pt govern the selection rules and intensities for these transitions so there is no need to repeat how symmetry can be used to analyze these integrals before closing this treatment of tdpt it is useful to address a few issues that were circumvented in the derivation presented above application coupling to a continuum in some cases one
