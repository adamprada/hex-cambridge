not vary significantly within the narrow range between and one arrives at a rate expression of which is much like we obtained earlier but now contains the density of states in some experiments one may not have only a single state that can absorb light of a given frequency w in such a situation attenuation of the light source at this frequency can occur through absorptions from many initial states into all possible final states whose energy differs from that of the initial state by in this case the correct expression for the total rate of absorption of photons of
