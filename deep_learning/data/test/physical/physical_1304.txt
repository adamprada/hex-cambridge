data were obtained by allowing a stream of molecules to flow through a laser beam of width with the laser frequency tuned to from the flow velocity of the stream and the laser beam width one can determine the duration over which the molecules were exposed to the light source after the molecules exited the laser beam they were probed to determine whether they were in an excited state this experiment was repeated for various values of the frequency the population of excited states was then plotted as a function of to obtain the data plotted in figure this experiment
