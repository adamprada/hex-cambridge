collision with an ion of charge moving along the axis with constant velocity as an approximation we assume that the ion moves in a straight line characterized by an impact parameter and a velocity this would be appropriate if the ion were moving so fast that it would not be deflected by interactions with the atom that the perturbation caused by the ion on the electrons of the atom at the origin can be represented by where is the position of the ith electron in the atom and is the position of the ion the time dependence of the perturbation
