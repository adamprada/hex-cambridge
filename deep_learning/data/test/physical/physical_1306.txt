above expression for the perturbation to obtain this is the equation that must be solved to evaluate by integrating from to representing the full collision with the ion starting far to the left on the axis and proceeding far to the right there are two limiting cases in which the solution is straightforward first if the time duration of the collision ie the time over which the ion is close to the atom is long compared to where then the integrand will oscillate repeatedly during the time as a result of which the integral will be vanishingly small so in
