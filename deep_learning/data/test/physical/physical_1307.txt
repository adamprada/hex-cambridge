course this result can not be trusted if the speed is too low because then the condition will not hold this example shows how one must rederive the equations of tdpt when dealing with perturbations whose timedependence is not sinusoidal references for the reader who wishes a more complete and diverse treatment of tdpt as applied to chemistry i suggest the text radiation and noise in quantum electronics w h louisell r e krieger pub huntington n y as well as my text quantum mechanics in chemistry contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and professor of chemistry u
