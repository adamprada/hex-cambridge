is to change either or or both and if there is a mathematical function that relates the internal energy to these two variables it should easy to see how it changes when either or both are changed this can be written as a total differential even without knowing the actually mathematical function relating the variables to the property we can imagine how to calculate changes in the property from this expression in words this implies that we can think of a change in occurring due to an isothermal change followed by an isochoric change and all we need to know
