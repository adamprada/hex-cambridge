tools that can be used to derive a number of very useful expressions example expanding thermodynamic function derive an expression for in terms of measurable quantities solution begin by using the total differential of dh left dfracpartial hpartial p rightt dp left dfracpartial hpartial t rightp dt divide by and constrain to constant to generate the partial of interest on the left the last term on the right will vanish since for constant after converting to partial derivatives leftdfracpartial hpartial v rightt left dfracpartial hpartial p rightt leftdfracpartial ppartial v rightt labeleq this result is simply a demonstration of the
