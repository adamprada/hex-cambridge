and work directly it is easiest to see what is involved by considering a specific example figure shows a cyclic path aaba superimposed on a nottoscale presentation of the phase diagram for water let us look at the sublimation of ice at the melting point of pure water the sublimation of ice is the conversion of pure ice to pure water vapor the melting point of pure water is the temperature at which pure ice is at equilibrium with pure liquid water at a pressure of one atmosphere it is represented by points a and a on the diagram we
