on the diagram this sublimation pressure is represented as and the sublimation process is represented as the transition from d to d is less than the triplepoint pressure of or however the difference is less than or in equation form the successive states traversed in this cycle are a ice at c and atm a water at c and atm b water at c and atm b water vapor at c and atm c water vapor at c and d water vapor at c and dice at c and a ice at c and atm we select these steps because
