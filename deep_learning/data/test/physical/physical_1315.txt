approximately true real gas molecules must interact with one another at short distances they repel one another at somewhat longer distances they attract one another the ideal gas equation can also be derived from the basic assumptions that we make in by an application of the theory of statistical thermodynamics by making different assumptions about molecular properties we can apply statistical thermodynamics to derive van der waals equation the required assumptions are that the molecules occupy a finite volume and that they attract one another with a force that varies as the inverse of a power of the distance between
