characteristic volume we can understand this in turn to be a consequence of the nature of the intermolecular forces evidently these forces become stronger as the distance between a pair of molecules decreases since a liquid or a solid occupies a definite volume the repulsive force must increase more rapidly than the attractive force when the intermolecular distance is small often it is useful to talk about the molar volume of a condensed phase by molar volume we mean the volume of one mole of a pure substance the molar volume of a condensed phase is determined by the intermolecular
