the pressure and volume appearing in van der waals equation are the pressure and volume of the real gas we can relate the terms in van der waals equation to the ideal gas equation it is useful to think of the terms and as the pressure and volume of a hypothetical ideal gas that is then we have we derive the ideal gas equation from a model in which the molecules are noninteracting point masses so the volume of an ideal gas is the volume occupied by a gas whose individual molecules have zero volume if the individual molecules of
