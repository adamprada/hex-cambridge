real gas with it says that the pressure of the real gas is less than the pressure of the hypothetical ideal gas by an amount that is proportional to the proportionality constant is since is the molar density moles per unit volume of the gas molecules it is a measure of concentration the number of collisions between molecules of the same kind is proportional to the square of their concentration we consider this point in more detail in chapters and so is a measure of the frequency with which the real gas molecules come into close contact with one another
