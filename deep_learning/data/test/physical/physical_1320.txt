attractive intermolecular forces tend to cause the gas molecules to clump up after all it is these attractive forcesattractive force that cause the molecules to aggregate to a liquid at low temperatures above the boiling point the ability of gas molecules to go their separate ways limits the effects of this tendency however even in the gas the attractive forces must act in a way that tends to reduce the volume occupied by the molecules since the volume occupied by the gas is dictated by the size of the containernot by the properties of the gas itselfthis clumpingup tendency finds
