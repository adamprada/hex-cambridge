them increases when they are very far apart the attractive interaction is very small we say that the energy of interaction is zero when the molecules are infinitely far apart if we initially have two widely separated stationary mutually attracting molecules they will spontaneously move toward one another gaining kinetic energy as they go their potential energy decreases as they approach one another reaching its smallest value when the molecules come into contact thus van der waals equation implies the potential energy versus distance diagram sketched in figure various approaches to electron correlation last updated save as pdf page id
