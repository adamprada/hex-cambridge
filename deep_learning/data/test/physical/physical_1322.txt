to determine these parameters include a the ci method in this approach the lcaomo coefficients are determined first usually via a singleconfiguration hf scf calculation the ci coefficients are subsequently determined by making the expectation value variationally stationary with chosen to be of the form as with all such linear variational problems this generates a matrix eigenvalue equation to be solved for the optimum coefficients and for the optimal energy the ci wave function is most commonly constructed from spin and spatial symmetry adapted combinations of determinants called configuration state functions csfs that include the socalled reference csf that is
