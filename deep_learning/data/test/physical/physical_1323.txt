included in the ci calculation can be large ci wave functions including to csfs are routine and functions with one to several billion csfs are within the realm of practicality the need for such large csf expansions can be appreciated by considering i that each electron pair requires at least two csfs to form the polarized orbital pairs discussed earlier in this chapter ii there are of the order of electron pairs for a molecule containing electrons hence iii the number of terms in the ci wave function scales as for a molecule containing ten electrons there could be terms
