of the number of basis functions and thus is one of the more troublesome steps in most configuration interaction and most other correlated calculations to transform the twoelectron integrals from this ao basis to the mo basis one proceeds as follows first one utilizes the original aobased integrals to form a partially transformed set of integrals this step requires of the order of operations next one takes the list and carries out another socalled oneindex transformation this list is then subjected to another oneindex transformation to generate after which is subjected to the fourth oneindex transformation to form the final
