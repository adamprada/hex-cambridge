of the same form as arises in the ci method and equations that look very much like the hf equations but in which the he matrix element is sumetagamma gammaetagamma langlechinur chietar fracerr chimur chigammarrangle langlechinur chietar fracerr chigammar chimu rrangle here replaces the sum that appears in the hf equations with depending on both the lcaomo coefficients of the spinorbitals and on the expansion coefficients these equations are solved through a selfconsistent process in which initial coefficients are used to form the matrix and solve for the coefficients after which the can be determined and the hflike equations solved
