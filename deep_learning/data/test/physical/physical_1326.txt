perturbation is the difference between the true coulomb interactions among the electrons and the meanfield approximation to those interactions where and are the coulomb and exchange operators defined earlier in this chapter and the sum over runs over the spinorbitals that are occupied in the hartreefock wave function that forms the zerothorder approximation to in the mppt method once the reference csf is chosen and the scf orbitals belonging to this csf are determined the wave function and energy are determined in an orderbyorder manner as is the case in the rspt discussed in chapter in fact mppt is just
