the sum of the orbital energies for all spinorbitals occupied the excited csfs are the zerothorder wave functions other than the reference csf only doubly excited csfs contribute to the firstorder wave function the fact that the contributions from singly excited configurations vanish in is known at the brillouin theorem the brillouin theorem can be proven by considering hamiltonian matrix elements coupling the reference csf to singlyexcited csfs fim the rules for evaluating all such matrix elements are called slatercondon rules and are given later in this chapter if you dont know them this would be a good time to
