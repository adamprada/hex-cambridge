given through second order as in rspt by and again only contains contributions from the doubly excited csfs both and are expressed in terms of twoelectron integrals that are sometimes denoted coupling the virtual spinorbitals and to the spinorbitals from which electrons were excited and as well as the orbital energy differences accompanying such excitations clearly major contributions to the correlation energy are made by double excitations into virtual orbitals with large integrals and small orbital energy gaps in higher order corrections contributions from csfs that are singly triply etc excited relative to the hf reference function appear and additional
