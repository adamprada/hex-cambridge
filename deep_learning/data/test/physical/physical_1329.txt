excitations relative to the dominant scf determinant it was observed that quadruple excitations had the next largest amplitudes after the double excitations and very importantly it was observed that the amplitudes of the quadruply excited csfs could be very closely approximated as products of the amplitudes of the doubly excited csfs and this observation prompted workers to suggest that a more compact and efficient expansion of the correlated wave function might be realized by writing as where is the scf determinant and the operator appearing in the exponential is taken to be a sum of operators that create single double
