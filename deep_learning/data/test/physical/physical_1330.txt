excitations in double excitations in and in triple excitations in and and quadruple excitations in a variety of terms including and as well as even higher level excitations by the design of this wave function the quandruple excitations will have amplitudes given as products of the amplitudes of the double excitations just as were found by earlier ci workers to be most important hence in cc theory we say that quadruple excitations include unlinked products of double excitations arising from the product the quadruple excitations arising from would involve linked terms and would have amplitudes that are not products of
