exactly after the fourth power term shown here so once the various operators and their amplitudes that comprise are known is computed using the above expression that involves various powers of the operators the equations used to find the amplitudes eg those of the operator where the are the amplitudes and are the excitation operators that promote two electrons from and into and of the various excitation level are obtained by multiplying the above schr√∂dinger equation on the left by an excited determinant of that level and integrating for example the equation for the doubleexcitations is the zero arises from
