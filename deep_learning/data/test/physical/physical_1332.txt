result of the exponential expansion form of the wave function and the resulting coupled quartic equations that need to be solved to determine the amplitudes however it is this way of writing that allows us to automatically build in the fact that products of double excitations are the dominant contributors to quadruple excitations and is the dominant component of sixfold excitations not in fact the cc method is today one of the most accurate tools we have for calculating molecular electronic energies and wave functions d the density functional method these approaches provide alternatives to the conventional tools of quantum
