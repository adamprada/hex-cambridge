state for which the calculation is being performed is specified by forming a corresponding density that in turn is often expressed as a sum of squares of occupied orbitals multiplied by orbitial occupation numbers before going further in describing how dft calculations are carried out let us examine the origins underlying this theory the socalled hohenbergkohn theorem states that the groundstate electron density of the atom or molecule or ion of interest uniquely determines the potential in the molecules electronic hamiltonian ie the positions and charges of the systems nuclei and because h determines all of the energies and wave
