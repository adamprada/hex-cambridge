c and d gives a clear contradiction unless the electronic state of interest is degenerate hence there cannot be two distinct potentials and that give the same nondegenerate groundstate so the groundstate density uniquely determines and and thus h furthermore because the eigenfunctions of determine all properties of the ground state then in principle determines all such properties this means that even the kinetic energy and the electronelectron interaction energy of the groundstate are determined by it is easy to see that gives the average value of the electronnuclear plus any additional oneelectron additive potential interaction in terms of the
