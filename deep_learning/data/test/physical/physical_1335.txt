function must be as any of the electrons positions approach the nucleus of charge residing at position because the groundstate electron density can be expressed in terms of the groundstate wave function as it can be shown that the groundstate density also displays cusps at the nuclear centers as where me is the electron mass and e is the unit of charge so imagine that you knew the true groundstate density at all points in space you could integrate the density over all space to determine how many electrons the system has then you could explore over all space to
