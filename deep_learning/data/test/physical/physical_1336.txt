groundstate ie that they can in principle be determined once is given but it does not tell us what these functional relations are to see how it might make sense that a property such as the kinetic energy whose operator involves derivatives can be related to the electron density consider a simple system of noninteracting electrons moving in a threedimensional cubic box potential the energy states of such electrons are known to be where is the length of the box along the three axes and and are the quantum numbers describing the state we can view as defining the squared
