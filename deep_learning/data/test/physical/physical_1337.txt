is the derivative of if we calculate the total energy for these noninteracting electrons that doubly occupy all states having energies up to the socalled fermi energy ie the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo we obtain the groundstate energy the total number of electrons can be expressed as which can be solved for in terms of to then express in terms of instead of in terms of this gives the total energy which is also the kinetic energy in this case because the potential energy is zero within the box and because the electrons are assumed to
