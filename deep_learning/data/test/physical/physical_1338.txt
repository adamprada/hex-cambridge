all to compute the total kinetic energy where the last equality simply defines the constant ignoring the correlation and exchange contributions to the total energy this is combined with the electronnuclear and coulombic electronelectron potential energies to give the thomasfermi total energy this expression is an example of how is given as a local density functional approximation lda the term local means that the energy is given as a functional ie a function of which depends only on at points in space but not on at more than one point in space or on spatial derivatives of unfortunately the thomasfermi
