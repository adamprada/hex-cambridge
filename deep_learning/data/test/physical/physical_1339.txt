gas is applied on a local level one obtains the commonly used dirac local density approximation to the exchange energy with adding this exchange energy to the thomasfermi total energy gives the socalled thomasfermidirac tfd energy functional because electron densities vary rather strongly spatially near the nuclei corrections to the above approximations to and are needed one of the more commonly used socalled gradientcorrected approximations is that invented by becke and referred to as the becke exchange functional where and is a parameter chosen so that the above exchange energy can best reproduce the known exchange energies of specific electronic
