compute the density by simply adding up the orbital densities multiplied by orbital occupancies here or is the occupation number of the orbital in the state being studied and that the kinetic energy should be calculated as the same investigations of the idealized uniform electron gas that identified the dirac exchange functional found that the correlation energy per electron could also be written exactly as a function of the electron density of the system for this model system but only in two limiting cases the highdensity limit large and the lowdensity limit there still exists no exact expression for the
