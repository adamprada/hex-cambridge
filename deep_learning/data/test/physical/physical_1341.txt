there are many alternative approximations to the exchangecorrelation energy functional currently many workers are doing their best to cook up functionals for the correlation and exchange energies but no one has yet invented functionals that are so reliable that most workers agree to use them to summarize in implementing any dft one usually proceeds as follows an atomic orbital basis is chosen in terms of which the ks orbitals are to be expanded most commonly this is a gaussian basis or a planewave basis some initial guess is made for the lcaoks expansion coefficients of the occupied ks orbitals the
