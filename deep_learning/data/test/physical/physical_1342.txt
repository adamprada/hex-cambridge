which in turn is used to solve a new set of ks equations this process is continued until convergence is reached ie until the used to determine the current iterations are the same that arise as solutions on the next iteration once the converged is determined the energy can be computed using the earlier expression e energy difference methods in addition to the methods discussed above for treating the energies and wave functions as solutions to the electronic schr√∂dinger equation there exists a family of tools that allow one to compute energy differences directly rather than by finding the energies
