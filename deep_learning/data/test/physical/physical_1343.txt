s his group advanced and applied this tool to their studies of molecular eas and electronmolecule interactions because of space limitations we will not be able to elaborate much in great detail on these methods however it is important to stress that these socalled eom or greens function or propagator methods utilize essentially the same input information eg atomic orbital basis sets and perform many of the same computational steps eg evaluation of one and two electron integrals formation of a set of meanfield molecular orbitals transformation of integrals to the mo basis etc as do the other techniques discussed
