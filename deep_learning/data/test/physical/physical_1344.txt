ips or eas respectively one writes equations which and are expected to obey for example in the early development of these methods the schrödinger equation itself was assumed to be obeyed so and are the two equations one combines with the equations that and obey to obtain an equation that must obey in the above example one a uses in the schrödinger equation for b allows to act from the left on the schrödinger equation for and c subtracts the resulting two equations to achieve or in commutator form one can for example express in terms of a superposition of
