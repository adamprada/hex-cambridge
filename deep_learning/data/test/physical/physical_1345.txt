equations of the eom or greens function or propagator methods in recent years these methods have been greatly expanded and have reached a degree of reliability where they now offer some of the most accurate tools for studying excited and ionized states in particular the use of time dependent variational principles have allowed a much more rigorous development of equations for energy differences and nonlinear response properties in addition the extension of the eom theory to include coupledcluster reference functions now allows one to compute excitation and ionization energies using some of the most accurate ab initio tools vibrations of
