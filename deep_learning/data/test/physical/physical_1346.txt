state labeled by the rotational quantum number has its own vibrational schr√∂dinger equation and thus its own set of vibrational energy levels and wave functions it is common to examine the vibrational problem and then to use the vibrational levels of this state as approximations to the vibrational levels of states with nonzero values treating the vibrationrotation coupling via perturbation theory let us thus focus on the situation by substituting into this equation one obtains an equation for in which the differential operators appear to be less complicated this equation is exactly the same as the equation seen earlier in
