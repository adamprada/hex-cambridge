the two atoms bound together by the potential are dissociated into two separate atoms in solving the radial differential equation for this potential the larger behavior is first examined for larger the equation reads dfracdfdx dfrac k x dfracmuhbar phi dfrackmuhbar x f where is the bond displacement away from equilibrium defining and as a new scaled radial coordinate and realizing that dfracddx beta dfracddx allows the larger schr√∂dinger equation to be written as which has the solution the general solution to the radial equation is then expressed as this larger solution multiplied by a power series in the variable
