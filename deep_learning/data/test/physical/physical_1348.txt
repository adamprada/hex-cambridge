harmonic approximation to the potential the vibrational energy levels are evenly spaced in experimental data such evenly spaced energy level patterns are seldom seen most commonly one finds spacings that decrease as the quantum number increases in such cases one says that the progression of vibrational levels displays anharmonicity because the hermite functions are odd or even functions of depending on whether n is odd or even the wave functions ynx are odd or even this splitting of the solutions into two distinct classes is an example of the effect of symmetry in this case the symmetry is caused by
