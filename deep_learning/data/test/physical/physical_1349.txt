reflection plane in the above example commutes with the hamiltonian that is the symmetry operator obeys textbfs textbfh textbfh textbfs so leaves unchanged as it acts on this allows us to pass through in the above equation any operator that leaves the hamiltonian ie the energy unchanged is called a symmetry operator if you have never learned about how point group symmetry can be used to help simplify the solution of the schr√∂dinger equation this would be a good time to interrupt your reading and go to chapter and read the material there the harmonic oscillator energies and wave functions
