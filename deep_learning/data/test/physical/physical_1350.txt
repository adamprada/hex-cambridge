do not increase without bound as the major shortcomings of the harmonic oscillator picture can be overcome the socalled morse potential see figure is often used in this regard in this form the potential is zero at the equilibrium bond length and is equal to as sometimes the potential is written as vr de exparre de so it vanishes as and is equal to at the latter form is reflected in figure figure morse potential energy as a function of bond length in the morse potential function is the bond dissociation energy is the equilibrium bond length and is a
