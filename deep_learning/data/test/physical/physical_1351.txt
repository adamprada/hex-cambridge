is no outer turning point and thus the no spatial confinement its degree of anharmonicity is governed by the ratio of the harmonic energy to the dissociation energy the energy spacing between vibrational levels and are given by en en hbar sqrtdfrackmu left dfrac nhbar sqrtkmude right these spacings decrease until reaches the value at which after which the series of bound morse levels ceases to exist ie the morse potential has only a finite number of bound states and the morse energy level expression shown above should no longer be used it is also useful to note that if
