have seen earlier in the particleinboxes model problems namely as the energy of the vibrational state increases the number of nodes in the vibrational wave function also increases the state having vibrational quantum number has nodes i hope that by now the student is getting used to seeing the number of nodes increase as the quantum number and hence the energy grows as the quantum number grows not only does the wave function have more nodes but its probability distribution becomes more and more like the classical spatial probability as expected in particular for large the quantum and classical probabilities
