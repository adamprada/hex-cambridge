of temperature the values of and must be determined for each real gas at every temperature note also that etc however it is true that values for these parameters are tabulated in various compilations of physical data in these tabulations and are called the second virial coefficient and third virial coefficient respectively volume dependence of helmholtz energy last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry at california state university east bay contributors if one needs to know how the helmholtz function changes with changing volume at constant temperature the following expression can be
