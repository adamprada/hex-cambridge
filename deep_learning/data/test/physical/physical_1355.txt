dv left dfracpartial apartial t rightv dt labeltotal and by simple comparison of equations refeq and reftotal it is clear that left dfracpartial apartial v rightt p left dfracpartial apartial t rightv s and so one can evaluate equation refeq as if the pressure is independent of the temperature it can be pulled out of the integral otherwise the temperature dependence of the pressure must be included fortunately this is easy if the substance is an ideal gas or if some other equation of state can be used such as the van der waals equation example ideal gas expansion calculate
