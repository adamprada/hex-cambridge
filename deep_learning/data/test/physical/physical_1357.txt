of the more fundamental issues chemistry addresses is molecular structure which means how the molecules atoms are linked together by bonds and what the interatomic distances and angles are another component of structure analysis relates to what the electrons are doing in the molecule that is how the molecules orbitals are occupied and in which electronic state the molecule exists for example in the arginine molecule shown in figure a carboxylic acid group its oxygen atoms are shown in red is linked to an adjacent carbon atom yellow which itself is bonded to an amino group whose nitrogen atom is
