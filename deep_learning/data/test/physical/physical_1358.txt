interactions among the several functional groups in arginine that also contribute to its ultimate structure in particular the hydrogen bond linking the aamino groups nitrogen atom to the groups hydrogen atom causes this molecule to fold into a less extended structure than it otherwise might what does theory have to do with issues of molecular structure and why is knowledge of structure so important it is important because the structure of a molecule has a very important role in determining the kinds of reactions that molecule will undergo what kind of radiation it will absorb and emit and to what
