molecules framework various reactant species eg electrophilic or nucleophilic or radical will be most strongly attracted clearly molecular structure is a crucial aspect of the chemists toolbox how does theory relate to molecular structure as we discussed in the part of this text the bornoppenheimer approximation leads us to use quantum mechanics to predict the energy of a molecule for any positions of its nuclei given the number of electrons ne in the molecule or ion this means for example that the energy of the arginine molecule in its lowest electronic state ie with the electrons occupying the lowest energy
