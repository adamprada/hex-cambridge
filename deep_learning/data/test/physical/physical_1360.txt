and how they differ time propagation of quantum wave functions the h√ºckel or tightbinding model of chemical bonding among atomic orbitals harmonic vibrations molecular rotations electron tunneling atomic orbitals angular and radial characteristics and point group symmetry and how it is used to label orbitals and vibrations you need to know this material if you wish to understand most of what this text offers so i urge you to read part if your education to date has not yet adequately been exposed to it let us now return to the discussion of how theory deals with molecular structure we assume
