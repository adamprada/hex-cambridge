is used to describe these structures not because they are lower in energy than all other possible arrangements of the atoms but because the curvatures as given in terms of eigenvalues of the hessian matrix are positive at this particular geometry the procedures by which minima on the energy landscape are found may involve simply testing whether the energy decreases or increases as each geometrical coordinate is varied by a small amount alternatively if the gradients are known at a particular geometry one can perform searches directed downhill along the negative of the gradient itself by taking a small step
