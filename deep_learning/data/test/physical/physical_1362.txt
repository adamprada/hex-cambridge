state are different than those obtained for the ground state because the orbital occupancy and thus the nature of the bonding is different again using arginine as an example its ground electronic state also has the structure shown in figure as a stable isomer notice that this isomer and that shown earlier have the atoms linked together in identical manners but in the second structure the aamino group is involved in two hydrogen bonds while it is involved in only one in the former in principle the relative energies of these two geometrical isomers can be determined by solving the
