of this excited state of arginine will be different than that of the ground state because the two states have different orbitals available to react with attacking reagents in summary by solving the electronic schrödinger equation at a variety of geometries and searching for geometries where the gradient vanishes and the hessian matrix has all positive eigenvalues one can find stable structures of molecules and ions the schrödinger equation is a necessary aspect of this process because the movement of the electrons is governed by this equation rather than by newtonian classical equations the information gained after carrying out such
