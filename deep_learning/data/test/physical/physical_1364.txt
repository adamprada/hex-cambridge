mode ie they describe the normal mode motions details about how these harmonic vibrational frequencies and normal modes are obtained were discussed earlier in chapter molecular change reactions and interactions changes in bonding chemistry also deals with transformations of matter including changes that occur when molecules react are excited electronically vibrationally or rotationally or undergo geometrical rearrangements again theory forms the cornerstone that allows experimental probes of chemical change to be connected to the molecular level and that allows simulations of such changes molecular excitation may or may not involve altering the electronic structure of the molecule vibrational and rotational
