green diatomic to break the bond between the two green atoms and form a new bond between the pink and green atoms both such reactions are termed bimolecular because the basic step in which the reaction takes place requires a collision between to independent species ie the atom and the diatomic a simple example of a unimolecular chemical reaction is offered by the arginine molecule considered above in the first structure shown for arginine the carboxylic acid group retains its bonding however in the zwitterion structure of this same molecule shown in figure the group has been deprotonated to produce
