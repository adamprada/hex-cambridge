of arganine is determined by the valence preferences of its constituent atoms as well as by hydrogen bonds formed among various functional groups the carboxylate group and one amino group and one group figure the arginine molecule in a zwitterion stable structure energy conservation in any chemical reaction as in all physical processes other than nuclear event in which mass and energy can be interconveted total energy must be conserved reactions in which the summation of the strengths of all the chemical bonds in the reactants exceeds the sum of the bond strengths in the products are termed endothermic for
