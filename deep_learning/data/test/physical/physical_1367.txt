analogously for exothermic reactions the excess energy produced as the reaction proceeds is usually deposited into the kinetic energy of the product molecules and into that of surrounding molecules for reactions that are very endothermic it may be virtually impossible for thermal excitation to provide sufficient energy to effect reaction in such cases it may be possible to use a light source ie photons whose energy can excite the reactant molecules to induce reaction when the light source causes electronic excitation of the reactants eg one might excite one electron in the bound diatomic molecule discussed above from a bonding
