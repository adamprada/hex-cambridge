through this symmetry plane it is not appropriate to label the orbitals with respect to their symmetry under the plane containing the four c atoms because although this plane is indeed a symmetry operation for the reactants and products it does not remain a valid symmetry throughout the reaction path that is in applying the woodwardhoffmann rules we symmetry label the orbitals using only those symmetry elements that are preserved throughout the reaction path being examined figure the active valence orbitals of butadiene and of cyclobutene the four orbitals of butadiene are of the following symmetries under the preserved symmetry
