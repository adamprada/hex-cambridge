which the electrons are arranged as in the ground state of the reactants evolves as the reaction occurs we notice that the lowest two orbitals of the reactants which are those occupied by the four electrons of the reactant do not connect to the lowest two orbitals of the products which are the orbitals occupied by the two and two electrons of the products this causes the groundstate configuration of the reactants to evolve into an excited configuration of the products this in turn produces an activation barrier for the thermal disrotatory rearrangement in which the four active electrons occupy
