rearrange by the occupancy of two electrons from to for the groundstate wave function of the reactant to smoothly evolve into that of the product of course if the reactants could be generated in an excited state having orbital occupancy then products could also be produced directly in their ground electronic state however it is difficult if not impossible to generate such doublyexcited electronic states so it is rare that one encounters reactions being induced via such states it should be stressed that although these symmetry considerations may allow one to anticipate barriers on reaction potential energy surfaces they have
