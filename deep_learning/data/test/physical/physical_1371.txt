to cause the reaction to occur at an accelerated rate with the electrons occupying the lowestenergy orbitals the ring closure reaction can still occur but it has to surmount a barrier to do so it can employ thermal collision al energy to surmount this barrier so its rate might be slow if an electron is excited there is no symmetry barrier to surmount so the rate can be greater reactions that take place on excited states also have a chance to produce products in excited electronic states and such excitedstate products may emit light such reactions are called chemiluminescent because
