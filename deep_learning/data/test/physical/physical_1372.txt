species will react once they do encounter one another the former aspects relate primarily to the concentrations of the reacting species and the speeds with which they are moving the latter have more to do with whether the encountering species collide in a favorable orientation eg do the enzyme and substrate dock properly or does the ion collide with the end of or with the end in the sn reaction that yields and with sufficient energy to surmount any barrier that must be passed to effect breaking bonds in reactants to form new bonds in products the rates of reactions
