proceeds in the ringclosure reaction cited earlier the catalysts orbitals would interact ie overlap with the butadienes orbitals in a manner that lowers their energies and thus reduces the energy barrier that must be overcome for reaction to proceed in addition to being capable of determining the geometries bond lengths and angles energies vibrational frequencies of species such as the isomers of arginine discussed above theory also addresses questions of how and how fast transitions among these isomers occur the issue of how chemical reactions occur focuses on the mechanism of the reaction meaning how the nuclei move and how
