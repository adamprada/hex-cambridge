connecting reactants through a transition state to produces is often represented as shown in figure figure energy vs reaction progress plot showing the transition state or activated complex and the activation energy in this figure the potential energy ie the electronic energy without the nucleis kinetic energy included is plotted along a coordinate connecting reactants to products the geometries and energies of the reactants products and of the activated complex can be determined using the potential energy surface searching methods discussed briefly above and detailed earlier in chapter chapter provides more information about the theory of reaction rates and how
