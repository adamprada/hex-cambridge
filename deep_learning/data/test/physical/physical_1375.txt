for example in supersonic molecular beam experiments the kinetic energy distribution of the colliding molecules is more likely to be of the type shown in figure figure molecular speed distributions in thermal and supersonic beam cases in this figure the probability is plotted as a function of the relative speed with which reactant molecules collide it is common in making such collision speed plots to include the volume element factor in the plot that is the normalized probability distribution for molecules having reduced mass m to collide with relative velocity components is because only the total collisional kinetic energy is
