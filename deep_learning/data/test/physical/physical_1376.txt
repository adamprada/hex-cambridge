a molecule apart for example when a complex consisting of a cation bound to a uracil molecule is accelerated by an external electric field to a kinetic energy and subsequently allowed to impact into a gaseous sample of xe atoms the highenergy collision allows kinetic energy to be converted into internal energy this collisional energy transfer may deposit into the nauracil complex enough energy to fragment the uracil attractive binding energy thus producing and neutral uracil fragments if the signal for production of is monitored as the collision energy is increased one generates a cid reaction rate profile such as
