complex mxe v where is the relative speed of the complex and the xe atom and and are the respective masses of the colliding partners the most essential lesson to learn from such a graph is that no dissociation occurs if is below some critical threshold value and the cid reaction narm uracil rightarrow na rm uracil occurs with higher and higher rate as the collision energy increases beyond the threshold for the example shown above the threshold energy is ca ev these cid thresholds can provide us with estimates of reaction endothermicities and are especially useful when these energies
