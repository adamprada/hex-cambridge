sample of cm of water at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in this macroscopic sample there are approximately x water molecules if one imagines having an instrument that could monitor the instantaneous speed of a selected molecule one would expect the instrumental signal to display a very jerky irregular behavior if the signal were monitored on time scales of the order of the time between molecular collisions on this time scale the water molecule being monitored may be moving slowly at one instant but upon collision with a neighbor may soon be moving very rapidly in contrast if one monitors
