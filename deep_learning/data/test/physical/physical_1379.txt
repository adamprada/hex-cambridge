single anion in a solution with water as the solvent as a function of time the vertical axis label says eq because this figure was taken from a literature article the ion initially has excess vibrational energy in this simulation which was carried out in part to model the energy flow from this hot solute ion to the surrounding solvent molecules one clearly sees the rapid jerks in energy that this ion experiences as it undergoes collisions with neighboring water molecules these jerks occur approximately every ps and some of them correspond to collisions that take energy from the ion
