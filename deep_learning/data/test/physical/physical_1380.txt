large enough to contain many water molecules for large r one finds that the average square of the speed of all the water molecules residing inside the sphere ie is independent of time even when considered at a sequence of times separated by fractions of ps and is related to the temperature through this example shows that at equilibrium the longtime average of a property of any single molecule is the same as the instantaneous average of this same property over a large number of molecules for the single molecule one achieves the average value of the property by averaging
