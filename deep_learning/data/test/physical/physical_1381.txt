last a short time ie the time between collisions in contrast for a collection of many molecules the fluctuations in the energy for the whole collection are small at all times because fluctuations take place by exchange of energy with the molecules that are not inside the sphere and thus relate to the surface area to volume ratio of the sphere so if one has a large number of molecules that one has reason to believe are at thermal equilibrium one can avoid trying to follow the instantaneous shorttime detailed dynamics of any one molecule or of all the molecules
