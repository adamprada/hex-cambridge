tools provide a direct way to compute equilibrium averages and small fluctuations about such averages for systems containing large numbers of molecules in chapter i provide a brief introduction to the basics of this subdiscipline of theoretical chemistry where you will learn more about this exciting field sometimes we speak of the equilibrium behavior or the dynamical behavior of a collection of molecules let me elaborate a little on what these phrases mean equilibrium properties of molecular collections include the radial and angular distribution functions among various atomic centers for example the oo and radial distribution functions in liquid water
