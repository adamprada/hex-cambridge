changing at the same time if the change in a thermodynamic variable such as is needed contributions from both changes are required to be taken into account weve already seen how to express this in terms of a total differential fortunately like the other thermodynamic functions and is kind enough to be a state variable this means that we can consider the changes independently and then simply add the results another way to think of this is that the system may follow either of two pathways to get from the initial conditions to the final conditions pathway i an isothermal
