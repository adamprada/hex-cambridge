temperature and volume one can write the total differential of entropy as and thus the first term is the contribution due to an isochoric temperature change the second term is the contribution due to an isothermal expansion from the maxwell relation on so equation refsecond becomes and the total entropy change is deriving an expression for a partial derivative type iii thermodynamics involves many variables but for a single component sample of matter only two state variables are needed to describe the system and fix all of the thermodynamic properties of the system as such it is conceivable that two
