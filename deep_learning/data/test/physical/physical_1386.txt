differential for can be written and it too must be zero for a process in which is held constant from this expression it can be seen that substituting this into the equation refeq yields which simplifies to left dfracpartial zpartial x righty dx left dfracpartial zpartial w rightx left dfracpartial wpartial x righty dx left dfracpartial zpartial x rightw dx so for implies that left dfracpartial zpartial x righty left dfracpartial zpartial w rightx left dfracpartial wpartial x righty left dfracpartial zpartial x rightw or left dfracpartial zpartial x righty left dfracpartial zpartial x rightw left dfracpartial zpartial w rightx
