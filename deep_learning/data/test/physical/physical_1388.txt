exact the best possible estimate of the expected value of is the expected value of is the expected value of the variance of averages of random variables drawn from the original distribution that is the expected value of is what we would get if we repeatedly drew values from the original distribution computed the average of each set of values and then found the variance of this new distribution of average values by the central limit theorem this variance is thus the expected value of is exactly since is constant the expected value of is which is equal to zero
