ions all of whose sizes range from ca å for atoms and small molecules to a few hundred å for polymers and biological molecules such as dna and proteins sometimes these building blocks combine to form nanoscopic materials eg quantum dots graphene sheets whose dimensions span up to thousands of å making them amenable to detection using specialized microscopic tools however description of the motions and properties of the particles comprising such small systems has been found to not be amenable to treatment using classical mechanics their structures energies and other properties have only been successfully described within the framework
