particles behaved in a way that simply is not consistent with the newton equations let me now illustrate some of the experimental data that gave rise to these paradoxes and show you how the scientists of those early times then used these data to suggest new equations that these particles might obey i want to stress that the schrödinger equation was not derived but postulated by these scientists in fact to date to the best of my knowledge no one has been able to derive the schrödinger equation from the pioneering work of bragg on diffraction of xrays from planes
