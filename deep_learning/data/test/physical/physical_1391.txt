will undergo constructive interference this condition is met when the extra path length covered by the second photon ie the length from points to to is an integer multiple of the wavelength of the photons figure scattering of two beams at angle from two planes in a crystal spaced by d the importance of these xray scattering experiments to electrons and nuclei appears in the experiments of davisson and germer in who scattered electrons of reasonably fixed kinetic energy from metallic crystals these workers found that plots of the number of scattered electrons as a function of scattering angle displayed
