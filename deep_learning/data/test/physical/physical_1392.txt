these amazing findings were among the earliest to suggest that electrons which had always been viewed as particles might have some properties usually ascribed to waves that is as de broglie has suggested in an electron seems to have a wavelength inversely related to its momentum and to display wavetype diffraction i should mention that analogous diffraction was also observed when other small light particles eg protons neutrons nuclei and small atomic ions were scattered from crystal planes in all such cases bragglike diffraction is observed and the bragg equation is found to govern the scattering angles if one assigns
