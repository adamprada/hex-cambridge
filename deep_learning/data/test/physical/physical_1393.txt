behaviors presented significant challenges another problem that arose in early studies of atoms and molecules resulted from the study of the photons emitted from atoms and ions that had been heated or otherwise excited eg by electric discharge it was found that each kind of atom ie h or c or o emitted photons whose frequencies were of very characteristic values an example of such emission spectra is shown in figure for hydrogen atoms figure emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen with some lines repeated below to illustrate the series to which they belong in the top panel we see all
