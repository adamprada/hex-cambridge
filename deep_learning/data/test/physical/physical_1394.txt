the outward centrifugal force characterized by radius and speed on the electron perfectly counterbalanced the inward attractive coulomb force exerted by the nucleus of charge this equation in turn allows one to relate the kinetic energy to the coulombic energy and thus to express the total energy of an orbit in terms of the radius of the orbit the energy characterizing an orbit or radius relative to the reference of energy at becomes more and more negative ie lower and lower as becomes smaller this relationship between outward and inward forces allows one to conclude that the electron should move
