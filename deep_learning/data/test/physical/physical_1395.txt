to orbit the breakthrough that allowed scientists such as niels bohr to apply the circularorbit model to the observed spectral data involved first introducing the idea that the electron has a wavelength and that this wavelength l is related to its momentum by the de broglie equation lambda hp the key step in the bohr model was to also specify that the radius of the circular orbit be such that the circumference of the circle be equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength only in this way will the electrons wave experience constructive interference as the electron orbits the
