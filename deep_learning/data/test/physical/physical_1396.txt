analysis and using as well as the forcebalance equation one can then solve for the radii that stable bohr orbits obey and in turn for the velocities of electrons in these orbits these two results then allow one to express the sum of the kinetic and coulomb potential energies as just as in the bragg diffraction result which specified at what angles special high intensities occurred in the scattering there are many stable bohr orbits each labeled by a value of the integer those with small have small radii scaling as high velocities scaling as n and more negative total
