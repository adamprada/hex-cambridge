that a photon of energy hnu r leftdfracni dfracnfright tag is emitted when the atom or ion undergoes a transition from an orbit having quantum number to a lowerenergy orbit having here the symbol is used to denote the following collection of factors and is called the rydberg unit of energy and is equal to ev the bohr formula for energy levels did not agree as well with the observed pattern of emission spectra for species containing more than a single electron however it does give a reasonable fit for example to the na atom spectra if one examines only
