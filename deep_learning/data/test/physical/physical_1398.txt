formula one finds decent agreement between the dependence of the energy spacings of the singly excited valence states of these atoms the fact that is larger for na than for li and largest for cs reflects that fact that the s orbital of na penetrates the s s and p shells while the s orbital of li penetrates only the s shell and the s orbital of cs penetrates and shells it turns out this rydberg formula can also be applied to certain electronic states of molecules in particular for closedshell cations such as protonated alcohols and protonated amines even
