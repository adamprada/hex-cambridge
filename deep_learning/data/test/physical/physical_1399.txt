of the quantum defect parameter d the energy spacings among these states can be fit reasonably well to the rydberg formula equation in figure a several rydberg orbitals of are shown figure a the and rydberg orbitals of with their outermost contours containing of their electron density the smaller orbitals are supposed to depict cc cn or co orbitals to give perspective of the rydberg orbitals sizes these rydberg orbitals can be quite large their sizes scale as clearly have the s p or d angular shapes and possess the expected number of radial nodes however for molecular rydberg orbitals
