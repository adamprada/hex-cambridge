the neglect of electronelectron coulomb repulsions in its derivation which are qualitatively corrected for by using the quantum defect parameter for rydberg atoms and molecules nevertheless the success of the bohr model made it clear that discrete emission spectra could only be explained by introducing the concept that not all orbits were allowed only special orbits that obeyed a constructiveinterference condition were really accessible to the electrons motions this idea that not all energies were allowed but only certain quantized energies could occur was essential to achieving even a qualitative sense of agreement with the experimental fact that emission spectra
