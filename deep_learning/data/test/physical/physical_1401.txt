be imposed to achieve some degree of agreement with experimental observation however we still are left wondering what equations can be applied to properly describe such motions and why the extra conditions are needed it turns out that a new kind of equation based on combining wave and particle properties needed to be developed to address such issues these are the socalled schrödinger equations to which we now turn our attention as i said earlier no one has yet shown that the schrödinger equation follows deductively from some more fundamental theory that is scientists did not derive this equation they
