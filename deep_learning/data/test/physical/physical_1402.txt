string held fixed at two ends undergo oscillatory motion in space and time with characteristic frequencies and wavelengths for example the motion of the violin string just mentioned can be described as having an amplitude at a position along its length at time given by where is its oscillation frequency the amplitudes spatial dependence also has a sinusoidal dependence given by where is the cresttocrest length of the wave two examples of such waves in one dimension are shown in figure figure fundamental and first overtone notes of a violin string of length in these cases the string is fixed
