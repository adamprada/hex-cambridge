of the wave we find that the waves frequency and wavelength are related by the socalled dispersion equation or this relationship implies for example that an instrument string made of a very stiff material large will produce a higher frequency tone for a given wavelength ie a given value of than will a string made of a softer material smaller for waves moving on the surface of for example a rectangular twodimensional surface of lengths and one finds hence the waves are quantized in two dimensions because their wavelengths must be constrained to cause to vanish at and as well
