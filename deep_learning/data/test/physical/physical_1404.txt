return to the issue of waves that describe electrons moving the pioneers of quantum mechanics examined functional forms similar to those shown above for example forms such as were considered because they correspond to periodic waves that evolve in and under no external or dependent forces noticing that and using the de broglie hypothesis in the above equation one finds if is supposed to relate to the motion of a particle of momentum p under no external forces since the waveform corresponds to this case can be related to the energy of the particle by so the equation for can
