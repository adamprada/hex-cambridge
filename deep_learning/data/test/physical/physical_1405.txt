features of quantum mechanics the above discussion about waves and quantized wavelengths as well as the observations about the wave equation and differential operators are not meant to provide or even suggest a derivation of the schr√∂dinger equation again the scientists who invented quantum mechanics did not derive its working equations instead the equations and rules of quantum mechanics have been postulated and designed to be consistent with laboratory observations my students often find this to be disconcerting because they are hoping and searching for an underlying fundamental basis from which the basic laws of quantum mechanics follow logically i
