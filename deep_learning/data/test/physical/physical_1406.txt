used to predict things that could then be tested in the laboratory thus far this theory has proven to be reliable but of course we are always searching for a new and improved theory that describes how small light particles move if it helps you to be more accepting of quantum theory i should point out that the quantum description of particles reduces to the classical newton description under certain circumstances in particular when treating heavy particles eg macroscopic masses and even heavier atoms it is often possible to use newton dynamics soon we will discuss in more detail how
