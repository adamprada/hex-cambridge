a molecule with energy in excess of the minimum activation energy undergoes reaction with some fixed probability represented by the rate constant a complete answer to the question of why unimolecular processes are characteristically firstorder in the high pressure limit requires that we rationalize this assumption another way of phrasing this question is to ask why the activated molecule does not react immediately why isnt the total energy of a molecule is distributed among numerous degrees of freedom the molecule has translational kinetic energy rotational kinetic energy and vibrational energy when it acquires excess energy through a collision with another
