equilibrium and is the constant of proportionality the negative sign is necessary to insure that the force acting on the object is one that will tend to restore it to an equilibrium position irrespective of whether is positive or negative as the object that follows hookes law moves from its equilibrium position the kinetic energy of its motion is converted into potential energy until there is no more kinetic energy left at this point the change in displacement will change direction returning the object to the equilibrium position by converting potential energy back into kinetic energy figure an example of
