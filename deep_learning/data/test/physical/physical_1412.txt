other definitions the constant of integration can be arbitrarily made to be zero for example by choosing it to offset any other forces acting on the object such as the force due to gravity the kinetic energy is then given by the total energy minus the potential energy since the total energy must be constant due to the conservation of energy in the system work work is defined as the amount of energy expended to move a mass against a resisting force for a mass being moved along a surface the amount of energy expended must be sufficient to overcome
