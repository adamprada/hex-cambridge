is this expression can then be integrated including any dependence might have on as needed for a given system another important way that work can be defined includes that for the expansion of a gas sample against an external pressure in this case the displacement is defined by a change in volume for the sample this is a very convenient expression and will be used quite often when discussing the work expended in the expansion of a gas the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy generally is accomplished through work which is done someplace in the universe as such
