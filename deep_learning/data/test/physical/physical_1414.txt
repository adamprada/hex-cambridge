making a simple substitution from the ideal gas law allows for the expression in terms of volume and temperature if the temperature is constant so that it can be placed before the integral the expression becomes w nrt intvv dfracdvv nrt ln left dfracvv right labelworkig where and are the initial and final volumes of the expansion respectively example consider mol of an ideal gas expanding isothermally at k from an initial volume of l to a final volume of l what is the final pressure of the gas calculate the work of the expansion if it occurs against a
