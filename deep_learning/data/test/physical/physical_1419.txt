a specific heat which is defined per unit mass rather than per mol the specific heat of water for example has a value of j g k at constant pressure a pathway distinction that will be discussed later example heat required to raise temperature example how much energy is needed to raise the temperature of g of water from c to c solution what is a partial derivative a partial derivative like a total derivative is a slope it gives a magnitude as to how quickly a function changes value when one of the dependent variables changes mathematically a partial
