change in pressure can be expressed or by substituting equations refmax and refmax macroscopic changes can be expressed by integrating the individual pieces of equation refeq over appropriate intervals this can be thought of as two consecutive changes the first is an isothermal constant temperature expansion from to at and the second is an isochoric constant volume temperature change from to at for example suppose one needs to calculate the change in pressure for an ideal gas expanding from lmol at k to lmol at k the set up might look as follows or delta p int lmol lmol left
