this results demonstrates an important property of pressure in that pressure is a state variable and so the calculation of changes in pressure do not depend on the pathway work work can take several forms such as expansion against a resisting pressure extending length against a resisting tension like stretching a rubber band stretching a surface against a surface tension like stretching a balloon as it inflates or pushing electrons through a circuit against a resistance the key to defining the work that flows in a process is to start with an infinitesimal amount of work defined by what is
