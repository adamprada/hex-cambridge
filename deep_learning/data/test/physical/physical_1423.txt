process at constant temperature similarly a simple expression can be derived for starting from the total differential of using an expression for where and is split into two terms one describing the work of expansion and the other describing any other type of work electrical stretching etc can be expressed as dg canceltds cancelpdv dwe cancelpdv vdp canceltds sdt cancelling the and terms leaves so at constant temperature and pressure this implies that gives the maximum amount of non pv work that can be extracted from a process this concept of and giving the maximum work under the specified conditions
