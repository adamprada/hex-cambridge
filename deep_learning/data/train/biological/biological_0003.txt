beginning with the study of small molecules makes sense since most lipids are amphiphiles their structural diversity can be simplified by considering them as simple structures with spatially distinct polar and nonpolar ends single chain and double chain amphiphiles aggregate in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner to form micelle and bilayer structures respectively with the nonpolar parts sequestered from water and associated with themselves and the polar parts solventaccessible this simple model introduces students to the notion that structure mediates properties to the important concept of intermolecular forces and to the thermodynamics of the hydrophobic effect all critical elements ultimately required
