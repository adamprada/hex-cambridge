large multimolecular aggregates than to start with the physiochemical properties of twenty different amino acid which vary in size and hydrophobicity and proceed to the complexities of intramolecular protein folding reactions topic protein structure the understandings derived from the study of lipids can then be applied to the more complex subject of intramolecular protein folding reactions and protein stability a more expanded and modern view of the hydrophobic effect and associated heat capacity change is presented along with the denaturing effect of chain conformational entropy the role of the hydrophobic effect and hbonds in protein stability are extrapolated from the
