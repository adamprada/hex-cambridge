topic binding function now necessarily follows since all biological events are initiated by binding a purely physical process the logic of chemistry suggests it should be studied next indeed in most textbooks introductory chapters on protein function focus on the binding of dioxygen a simple ligand to myoglobin and hemoglobin macromoleculedrug interactions as well as cellcell adhesion can be discussed as additional relevant examples the control of gene expression a topic of preeminent importance to modern biologists can be discussed from the logic of chemistry as an essential outcome of the binding of transcription factors and appropriate enzymes to each
