state binding and leads to the same equations hyperbolic dependence of flux with outer solute concentration effect of competitive inhibitors as when michaelismenten enzyme kinetics mechanisms are modeled topic binding and kinetics the study of enzyme kinetics follows as a logical extension of the expression of molecular function involving the addition of a more complex step namely a chemical transformation through the study of enzyme kinetics students learn how to obtain a low resolution understanding of the structureactivity of enzymes and of their chemical mechanisms topic binding and chemical transformations next the detailed mechanism of specific enzymes whose structures are
