reactions several questions are introduced to provoke discussion and challenge students knowledge of oxidation reactions students propose reasons to explain the fact that oxidation reactions of organic molecules using dioxygen are thermodynamically but not kinetically favored as well as to explain the need for different types of biological oxidizing agents for energy transduction signal transduction at the cell membrane serves as an excellent capstone area of study since it incorporates ideas from each sequence references knowles j nature contributors and attributions prof henry jakubowski college of st benedictst johns university contributed by sorangel rodriguezvelazquezprofessorial lecturer chemistry at american university contributors
