master plan that determines the sequence of all cellular proteins which then catalyze almost all other activities in the cell including catalysis motility architectural structure etc in contrast to dna rna and protein polymers the length and sequence of a polysaccharide polymer is not driven by a template but rather by the enzymes that catalyzes the polymerization importexport many of the chemical constituents of the cell arise not from direct synthesis but from import of both small and large molecules the imported molecules must pass through the cell membrane and in some cases through additional membranes if they need to
