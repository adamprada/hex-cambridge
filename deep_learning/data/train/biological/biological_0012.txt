typically down a concentration gradient computer simulations of the facilitated diffusion of lactose across the membrane is shown in the following link animation of lactose diffusion through the lacy receptor the link above and immediately below are from the theoretical and computational biophysics group at the beckman institute university of illinois at urbanachampaign these molecular dynamic simulations were made with vmdnamdbiocorejmvother software support developed by the group with nih support ion channels these membrane proteins allow the flow of ions across membranes some are permanently open nongated while others are gated open or closed depending on the presence of ligands
