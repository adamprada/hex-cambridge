the diffusion of water through aquaporin animation of water diffusion through the aquaporin channel endocytosis very large particles for example ldl or low density lipoproteins or viruses can enter a cell through a process called endocytosis initially the ldl or virus binds to a receptor on the surface of the cell this triggers a series of events which leads to the invagination of the cell membrane at that point this eventually pinches off to form an endosomal vesicle which is surrounded by a protein called clathrin early endosomes can pick up new proteins and other constituents as well as shed
