surviving the process to reenter the golgi synthesizedegrade cells have to both synthesize and degrade small molecules as well as larger polymeric protein carbohydrates and nucleic acids the anabolic synthetic and catabolic degradative pathways are often compartmentalized in time and space within a cell for example fatty acid synthesis is carried out in the cytoplasm but fatty acid oxidation is carried out in the mitochondria proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm or completed in the endoplasmic reticulum for membrane and exported proteins while they are degraded in the lysosome or more importantly in a large multimolecular structure in the cell
