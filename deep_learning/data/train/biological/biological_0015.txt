thermodynamically unfavored synthesis of atp compared to the extracellular fluid the concentration of potassium ion is higher inside the cell while concentrations of sodium chloride and calcium ions are higher on the outside of the cell see table below these concentration gradients are maintained by ion transporters and channels and require energy expenditure ultimately in the form of atp hydrolysis changes in these concentrations are integral to the signaling system used by the cell to sense and respond to changes in its external and internal environments water is found in bulk form as well as bound to macromolecules like proteins
