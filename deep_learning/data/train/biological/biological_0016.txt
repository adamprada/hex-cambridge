the photo above taken from wikipedia microfilaments of actin monomers which are stained with a redorange fluorophore and microtubules which offer more structural support made of tubulin monomers stained green along with the bluestained nucleus are shown in the image organelles are supported and organized by the cytoskeleton primarily microtubules even the cell membrane is supported underneath the inner leaflet by actin stained orange and spectrin microfilaments motor proteins like myosin that moves along actin microfilaments and dynein and kinesin that move along tubulin microtubules carry cargo vesicles organelles in a directional fashion the cell is not a disorganized collection
