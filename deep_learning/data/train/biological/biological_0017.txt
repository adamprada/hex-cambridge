solutions of solute molecules in a solvent you have probably heard that the body is comprised of water but the water concentration is obviously dependent on the cellular environment solute molecules like protein and carbohydrates are densely packed cells are so crowded that the space between larger molecules like protein is less than the size of protein studies have shown that the stability of a protein is increased in such condition which would help keep the protein in the folded native state another consequence of high concentrations is that it would promote the binding or self aggregation of like molecules
