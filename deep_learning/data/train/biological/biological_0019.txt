enough concentration the solubility of the nonpolar liquid is exceeded and a phase transition occur as evidenced by the appearance of two separate liquid phases the same process occurs when triglycerides coalesce into lipid droplets with proteins associated on their outside another example occurs within a cell membrane when lipids with saturated alkyl chains self associate with membrane cholesterol which contains a rigid planar ring system to form a lipid raft characterized by greater packing efficiency rigidity and thickness that other parts of the membrane these lipid rafts often recruit protein involved in signaling processes within the cell membranes this
