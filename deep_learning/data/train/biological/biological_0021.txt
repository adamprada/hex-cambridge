learning objectives identify the types of catalysis used in enzymecatalyzed reactions given a detailed mechanism interpret kinetic experiments experiments varying substrate inhibitors ph ion strength and amino acid side chains through chemical modification or sitespecific mutagenesis to better understand the catalytic mechanisms utilized in enzymecatalyzed reactions identify potential rate limiting steps in enzyme catalyzed reaction mechanisms and simplify kinetic equations based on them generally describe the diversity the critical active site residues and the biological activities of proteases describe the structurefunction of the proteasome we can apply what we learned about catalysis by small molecules to enzymecatalyzed reactions to understand
