protein concentration approx mgml in solution and onlythe dimer was the active form of the proteinase based on the crystal structures and biochemical studies of several coronavirus clpros one hypothesis was proposed that the nterminalresidues might play an important role in both dimerization and enzymatic activity of sars clpro however other studies showned that the n terminus was not necessaryfor the dimer formation of sars clpro ie the nterminal deleted sars clpro may possibly form a dimer with a new statedifferent from the fulllength proteinase biochemical and biophysicalstudies of the dimerization and proteolytic activities of thefulllength s and nterminal residues
