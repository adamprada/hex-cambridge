mm sodium phosphate ph mm nacl the enzymatic activity of the two proteins was studied using a novel fluorescent substrate reactant edansvnstlqsglrkdabcylm which is totally hydrolyzed by papainlike protases this is a short peptide with an amino terminus dansyl fluorophore and a c terminus dabcyl group which does not fluoresce but can be excited by the excited state dansyl fluorophore which can transfer energy to the dabcyl group in a nonradiative process but only if it is very close in space to the dansyl group a graph of enzyme activity is shown below figure representative fluorescence profiles of hydrolysis of
