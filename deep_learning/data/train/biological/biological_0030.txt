of why the fluorescence increases on s cleavage of the substrate b what conclusions can you draw concerning the different activity of s and sn towards the substrate one way to determine if a protein can dimerize is to introduce covalent bonds between adjacent proteins subunits in potential dimer or multimer one such crosslinking reagent is glutaraldehye which is shown below a draw a mechanism to show how it could react with lys residues on two adjacent proteins to crosslink them sdspage gels were run for both s and sn and are shown below fig sdspage acrylamide profiles of glutaraldehyde
