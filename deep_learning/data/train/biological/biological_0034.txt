the enthalpy curve to the base line value after the first injection ie at the end of the spike in the enthalpy for the first ul protein injection b why does the enthalpy change becomes smaller and smaller as shown in fig b as more concentrated protein is added to the calorimetry cells c calculate δg and δs for the dimerization equilibrium for s d what conclusions can you draw concerning the ability for the two proteins to form dimers molecular dynamics simulations were made from the pdb file for s in which the unit cell contained a dimer and
