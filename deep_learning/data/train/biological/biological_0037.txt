st genetically encoded amino acid identified in selected proteins in all three kingdoms of life in bacteria sec is encoded by the uga stop codon in combination with a specific hairpin structure on the mrna the sec insertion sequence sectrnasec is delivered to the ribosome by a specialized translation factor selb a kda gtpbinding protein that consists of four domains and recognizes both sectrnasec and the sec insertion sequence selb shares significant sequence similarity with other translation factors that deliver aminoacyltrna to the ribosome such as eftu and eifeifb domains i ii and iii of selb have the same secondary
