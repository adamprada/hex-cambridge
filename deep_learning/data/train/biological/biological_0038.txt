much more weakly than gdp values of kd for gtp and gdp are and nm respectively furthermore the arrangement of domains iiii in eftu changes dramatically upon gtp hydrolysis which is used to control aminoacyltrna binding and delivery to the ribosome in contrast crystal structures suggested that domains iiii in selb from the archaeon methanococcus maripaludis adopt similar gtplike conformations in the presence of the gtp analog gdpnp or gdp or in the absence of guanine nucleotides this finding is difficult to reconcile with the orders of magnitude differences in the binding affinity of sectrnasec to selbï½gtp and selbï½gdp which
