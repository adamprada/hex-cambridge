sensitive method to draw the link between the thermodynamic data and structural rearrangement of the molecules the investigators utilized itc to estimate the magnitude of conformational changes in selb upon binding of different guanine nucleotides backgrounreview questions a looking at the calorimetry cells above what components would most likely be placed in the reference cell sample cells and syringe b itc is very sensitive and can detect minute enthalpy changes when a titrant is injected into the reference cell list possible physical and chemical processes which might lead to enthalpy changes on on injection of a titrant into the control
