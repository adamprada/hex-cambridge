as a function of mo l and kd is shown above kd values are typically determined from binding experiment when mo the total amount of m is much less than free l from the equation of ml above draw a graph of ml vs l on the axes below e simplify the equation for ml as a function of l for each of the following conditions l kd l kd l kd the equilibrium constant keq kd is related to the standard free energy change dg using the following equation f what is the dg at equilibrium using this information
