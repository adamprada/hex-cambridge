and l with a stoichiometry of b is the binding exothermic or endothermic what is the sign of dh b which one proceeds with a lower dissociation constant kd c assuming that the binding is favored which one has a more negative dg assume equal concentrations of selb in the sample cell which one is more favored under standard condition d the change in gibbs free energy is also related to the change in enthalpy and entropy as shown in the equation below can you deduce from simple inspection of the curves above if ds is or explain the itc
