for the interaction of selb and gxp the thermodynamic parameters of selb binding to guanine nucleotides at different temperatures are shown below g do they confirm your answers to b and d above to determine the effect of change in protonation state on binding of selb and gxp the effect of different buffer solutions on the binding enthalpy of selbgtp was studied figure a below shows binding enthalpy of gtp to selb in phosphate buffer hepes buffer and tris buffer as a function of temperature a any change in enthalpy accompanying proton release or uptake on binding of a macromolecule
