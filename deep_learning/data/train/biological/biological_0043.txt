units for the slope of the line what is the actual slope what does this tell you what does the y intercept tell you why use is the y intercept in this study figure c above shows the enthalpy change for binding of selb and gtp corrected for buffer solution protonation changes standard deviations of measurements are given by error bars in some cases not visible because they are smaller than symbol size note that the dh is a linear function of temperature the slope of the line has units of kcalmoloc which is heat capacity the change in heat
