hence the dissolution of benzene in water might require an input of heat energy to drive it so the process would be endothermic yet around k it is a bit favored enthalpically to for benzene to dissolve in water what dramatically disfavors it is entropy this is manifestation of the hydrophobic effect which helps drive protein folding so that hydrophobic side chains are buried a key signature of the hydrophobic effect is that the transfer of nonpolar groups to water is associated with a positive dcp note that taking benzene from benzene is water is characterized by a linearly increasing
