following equation has been used to show the contribution to δcp from dissolution of solids compounds in water δcp dcapdasaap dcpdasap where dasaap and dasap are the apolar and polar solvent accessible surface areas changes respectively model compounds give values of dcap and dcp per mol of sa angstroms squared table below shows heat capacity changes and accessible surface area for selb binding to guanine nucleotides δcp heat capacity change obtained as δhdt δasaap and δasap changes in apolar and polar solventaccessible surface areas assuming that all the changes were conferred by either apolar aaap or polar aap residues respectively
