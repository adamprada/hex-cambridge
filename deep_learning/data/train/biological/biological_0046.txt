from graphs a and b and table above compare the similarities and differences between the free and bound states of selb with the different ligands to further study the differences in selb conformations upon binding of gtp gdp and nonhydrolyzable analogs selb and its complexes were separated by sizeexclusion chromatography which separates on hydrodynamic volume with larger molecules of the same shape eluting first figure below shows the separation of apo form and nucleotidebound forms of selb by sizeexclusion chromatography elution profiles of selbï½gtp selbï½gtpγs selbï½gdp ï½ï½ï½ï½ selbï½gdpnp ï½ï½ï½ and selb ï½ï½ï½ï½ï½ï½ were monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence λexcitation nm
