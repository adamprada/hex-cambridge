electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the carboxyl group of another amino acid the carboxyl group of the amino acid must first be activated to provide a better leaving group than oh we will discuss this activation by atp latter in the course the resulting link between the amino acids is an amide link which biochemists call a peptide bond in this reaction water is released in a reverse reaction the peptide bond can hence be cleaved by water hydrolysis complex carbohydrates polysaccharides monosaccharides are the monomeric units which polymerize to form a polysaccharide monosaccharides are simple sugars polyhydroxyaldehydes or ketones which
