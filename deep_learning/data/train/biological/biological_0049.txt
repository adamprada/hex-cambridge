sugars through hemiacetal links hemiacetalacetal chemistry examples of complex carbohydrates nucleic acids the monomeric units of nucleic acids consist of a ring cyclized sugar ribose for rna and deoxyribose for dna which has been attached at c to an organic base pyrimidine or purine through an acetallike link ie instead of a nucleophilic alcohol reacting with the ribose hemiacetal a nucleophilic n on the base reacts the link between the monomers requires the activation of the o on c through a triphosphate group the actual link between the monomers is a phosphodiester link which likewise can be hydrolyzed see the
