and running why was this column run at this ph the vlpl fraction was subjected to monosaccharide compositional analysis by gcms a ul aliquots that was desalted and dissolved in water was mixed with ul of acetonitrile with formic acid and subjected to gcms it contained man gal and glcnac in the ration of is this consistent with the proposed glycan structure it is necessary to know the linkage of the monosaccharide in the vlpl linkage analysis was done by converting glycans to partially methylated alditol acetates and analyzing them by gcms the general chemistry involved in the formation of
