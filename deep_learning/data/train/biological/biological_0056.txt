to their masstocharge ratio in methylation analysis peaks are identified by a combination of their retention time relative time of elution from the lc column and their electron impact eims fragmentation pattern the ei fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted monosaccharides of the same class eg aldohexoses are the same thus definitive identification requires in addition to the analysis of the ms pattern the comparison of retention times with those of known standards ie all triomethylhexoses produce the same eims spectrum but peracetylated triomethylgalactitol elutes later than peracetylated triomethylglucitol this type of analysis indicates which residues are terminal ie they are
