to it dsdna is a highly charged molecule and can be view to a first approximation as a long polyelectrolyte with a large negative charge this very large molecule must somehow be packed into a small nucleus these packing problem is solved by coiling dna and packing it with proteins which usually have a net positive charge the chromosomes are usually dispersed within the nucleus and are not visible with an ordinary microscope when the cell is ready to divide the dna in the chromosomes replicates and the chromosomes condense in a fashion that they are not visible using an
