of double chain amphiphiles in lipid bilayers differentiating between motion of entire molecules and motion within a molecule describe experiments that could be used to study lateral and flipflop diffusion in vitro and in vivo explain the use of exogenous labels fluorescent radioactive electron spin resonance that allow laboratory determination of lipid location and movement explain similarities and differences in measurement and explanations of phase transitions in water and in lipid vesicle explain the biological effects and necessities of membrane dynamics c dynamics of membranesmolecules are not static but rather are dynamic this also applies to molecular aggregates in the
