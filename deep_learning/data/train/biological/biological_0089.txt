attributions learning objectives differentiate among competitive uncompetitive and mixed inhibition of enzymes by reversible noncovalent inhibitors by writing coupled chemical equilibria equations and drawing cartoons showing molecular interactions among e s and i using lechateliers principle and coupled chemical equilibria equations draw double reciprocal lineweaverburk plots and semilog plots for enzyme catalyzed reactions in the presence of different fixed concentrations of inhibitors and activators of enzyme define kis and kii for competitive uncompetitive and mixed inhibition from coupled chemical equilibria and double reciprocal plots differentiate between apparent and actual dissociations constants constants of an inhibitor and enzyme from double reciprocal
