and the cas endonuclease the signature gene of the type ii system the system can be further simplified by fusing the mature crrna and tracrrna into a single guide rna sgrna in addition to its role in target cleavage tracrrna also mediates crrna maturation by forming rna hybrids with primary crrna transcripts leading to coprocessing of both rnas by endogenous rnase iii cas contains two nuclease domains that together generate a doublestrand ds break in target dna the hnh nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand and the ruvclike nuclease domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand a short signature sequence named the
