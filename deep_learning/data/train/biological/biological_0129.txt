variable region is often included in the definition of the pam sequence but for simplicity we refer to this variable region as the linker and the conserved sequence as the pam to date cas from streptococcus pyogenes cas from streptococcus thermophilus dgcc and cas from neisseria meningitidis have been employed as tools for genome editing or regulation for these cas orthologs the pams are gg ggng and gatt and the linkers are and bp respectively the simplicity of sgrna design and sequencespecific targeting means the rnaguided cas machinery has great potential for programmable genome engineering cas can be employed to
