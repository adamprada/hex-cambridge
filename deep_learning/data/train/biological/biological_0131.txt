the target dna crrna tracrrna protospacer pam and linker draw in a connecting piece of rna if you wish to create a single guide rna containing both the crrna and tracrna what is the specific pam sequence in this figure to confirm that the identified pam was functional investigators needed a selection system they used a transformation assay in which e coli cells containing an exogenous type ii crisprcas system were resistant to plasmid transformation whereas cells lacking the system are competent for transformation explain how this system could be used to determine if specific pam are functional a figure
