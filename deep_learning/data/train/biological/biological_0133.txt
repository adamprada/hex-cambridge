the gel results c in figure c they studied cleavage in the presence of different sgrna sequences explain the results d for figure d the used different active site mutants of cas the da mutant was in the ruvclike domain while the ha mutant was in the hnh domain explain the results what effect does the double mutant have on the activity e in figure e the authors studied which domain was involved in the cleavage of each strand complementary to the guide dna or the noncomplementary strand of the target dna the dsdna was radiolabeled at the end of
