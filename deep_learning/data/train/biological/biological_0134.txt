lengths was studied in ac and ef the positions of negatively supercoiled nsc linear l and nicked or open circle oc plasmid are indicated the linear control is a digestion of the plasmid target with the restriction enzyme agei h in the mutational analysis they substituted asparatic acid for alanine draw the structures of the side chains of d and a why did they choose a to substitute for d what role might d have in catalysis in the wildtype protein to evaluate whether other divalent cations besides mg can activate dna cleavage by cas the authors performed plasmid cleavage
