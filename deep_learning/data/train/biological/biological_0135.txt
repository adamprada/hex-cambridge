control is a digestion of the plasmid target with the restriction enzyme agei to determine the effect of pam sequence and linker length on binding of lmg cas to dna targets the authors determined the binding affinity kd of the cassgrna complex to endlabeled dsdna targets using native gel electrophoresis a why did they not include sds in the gel b binding experiments were conducted with the nucleasedeficient mutant of cas daha in the presence of mg fixed concentrations of the dsdna targets were incubated with increasing concentrations of the cassgrna complex why did they use the double mutant of
