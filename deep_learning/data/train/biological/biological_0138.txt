happen to the nucleosome complex the dna must unwind from the histone core of then nucleosome to allow binding of transcription factors and ultimately rna polymerase to the regulatory regions of the dna promoter etc otherwise dnadependent rna polymerization will not occur b the phenotype of a cell depends on the dna sequence of the cell and the subset of genes that are expressed by that cell the emerging field of epigenetics describes how factors other than the dna sequence control cell phenotype and heritability of traits key features in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription are chromatin remodeling packing and
