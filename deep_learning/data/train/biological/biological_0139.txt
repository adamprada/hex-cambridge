present in the plumbago and diospyros plant genera and have a variety of biological activities one such derivative plumbagin is a potent inhibitor of a particular lysine acetyltransferase kat p lysine acetyltransferases ba pcbp some of the inhibitors are toxic to cells as they react with free rsh groups in cells and generate reactive oxygen species ros an ideal drug would be nontoxic and an effective inhibitoractivator of a specific enzyme investigators synthesized a derivative ptk of plumbagin which inhibit p and with much lower toxicity that plumbagin how does it work fig a to study the toxicity of plumbagin
