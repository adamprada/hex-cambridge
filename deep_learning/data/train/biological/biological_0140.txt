a nitrocellluose membrane was placed on top and the proteins in the gel were electrophoresed into the membrane a technique called western blotting individual protein band were visualized by adding antibodies that recognized phosphorylated haxg or histone h without modification followed by reagents that produce a dark band interpret the results why did the investigators do blots for unmodified h fig c what affect did plumbagin have on histone acetylation immuoblots were performed after plumbagin treatment in the presence or absence of nac in the indicated cell lines as above using antibodies that recognized acetylated lys on h hk or
