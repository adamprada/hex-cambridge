product which retains conjugation if possible draw a mechanism showing how nac might react with the structure below and show the final products fig a a variety of naphthoquinone derivatives were tested to see their effect on p activity in the presence and absence of nac one lawsone whose structure is given below showed no inhibitory effects as shown below give a likely chemical explanation for this observation fig c if they reacted with free thiols then the naphthoquinone derivatives should have an effect on the concentration of free thiols in an in vitro assays results of one such assay
