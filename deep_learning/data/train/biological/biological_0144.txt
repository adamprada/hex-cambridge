that apply to double reciprocal plots v vs s when substrate is kept constant the slope changes when i and s bind to the same form of the enzyme for example e binds both s and i or i binds to a form of e on the horizontal line which is connected to the form that s binds and i binds first for example i binds to e and then s binds the y intercept changes when i and s bind to different forms of the enzyme unless i binds first and the binding of i and s are in
