state the dependent variable can also be normalized to show fractional denaturation fd an idealized example of an experimental denaturation curve is shown in the figure below figure denaturation curve for proteins a more realistic denaturation curve might show a linear change in the values of the dependent variable fluorescence intensity for example for values of temperature or denaturant concentration well below that at which the protein starts to unfold or above that at which it is unfolded in these cases the mathematical analysis presented below is a bit more complicated for each curve the value of y either a
