measured by substituting and into the expression for the equilibrium constant for the reaction we get or and remember that dgoand hence keq depends only on the intrinsic stability of the native vs denatured state for a given set of conditions they vary as a function of temperature and solvent conditions at low temperature and low ureaguanidine hcl concentration the native state is favored and for the transition dgo ie denaturation is not favored at high temperature and ureaguanidine hcl concentration the denatured state is favored and dgo at some value of temperature or ureaguanidine concentration both the native and
