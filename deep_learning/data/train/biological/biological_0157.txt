in the d state that it would be extremely difficult to determine the concentration of the protein in the d state hence it would be difficult to determine the keq or dgo for the reaction however in the range where the protein denatures either with urea or increasing temperature it is possible to measure fdfnand hence d go at each urea or temperature denaturation with chemical perturbants such as urea calculation of dgo for in the absence of urea a plot of dgo vs urea is linear and given by the following equation which should be evident from the beginning
