protein in experimental cases in which the denaturant is a substance such as urea or guanidine hcl the dgd for the protein in the absence of denaturant ie in water can be determined by extrapolating the straight line to urea admittedly this is a long extrapolation but with high quality data and a high correlation coefficient for the linear regression analysis of the bestfit line reasonable values can be obtained denaturation with heat calculation of dho and dso for at room temperature keq values can be calculated from thermal denaturation curves in the same way as described above using urea
