with respect to t ie the slope of equation plotted as lnkd vs t is indeed dhr equation is the van t hoff equation and the calculated value of the enthalpy change is termed the van t hoff enthalpy dhvhoff equation calculates the derivative of lnkeq with respect to t instead of t this method assumes that the denaturation is cooperative no intermediates and that dh is independent of temperature over the narrow range of temperature in which the protein cooperatively unfolds this equation will be useful later when we compare the enthalpies calculated using the van t hoff equation
