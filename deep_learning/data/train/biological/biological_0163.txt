steric hindrance with bulky heady groups and ionion repulsions of course there are also entropic considerations let us now consider these factors as we explore what might happen to a preformed micelle as we try to put more single chain amphiphiles sca into it clearly as we increase the number of cs in the sca the micelles would have a larger radius for a given sca of fixed number of cs once a spherical micelle is formed it can no longer retain its spherical shape if more scas are added imagine increasing the diameter of a spherical micelle x a
