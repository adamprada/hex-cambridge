the sphere is distorted to a cylinder the head groups would come closer together and hence they will experience more steric interference if a cylinder can be formed however it could continue to grow as long as needed with no further compression required imagine now that you further compressed the cylinder into a planar bilayer structure the head groups would be even closer and experience even more repulsion this bilayer will not form since growth can occur in the cylindrical phase without the added repulsion now consider a double chain amphiphile dca in the case of a sca the number
