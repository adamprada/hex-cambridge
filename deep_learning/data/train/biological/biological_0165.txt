extra closeness of head groups in the bilayer can be tolerated even more since the dmo for transfer of a dca into a micelle is more negative than that of a sca the ashg for closed vesicles differs only slightly from that of a truly planar bilayer since the vesicles are so large compared to a micelle once again we have discovered that structure mediates function we can account for the fact that sca and dca form micelles and bilayers respectively by understanding the structure of the monomers figure surface area per head group vs no of c in amphiphile
