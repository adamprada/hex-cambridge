surface somehow the cells senses that a ligand is bound to the outside enzymes usually in the membrane or at the intracellular surface of the lipid bilayer are activated many of these enzymes cleave lipids in the membrane the cleaved fragments of the lipid molecules serve as intracellular signals or secondary messengers which can bind to intracellular enzymes to activate intracellular processes the following diagram shows some of the lipid mediators which are generated by the process and signal the cell to respond figure lipids more than grease mediators in signal transduction recently fatty acid amides have been shown to
