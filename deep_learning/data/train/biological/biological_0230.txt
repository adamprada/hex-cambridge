for the charged carbanion and carbocation intermediates there is a developing charge in the transition state the thermodynamics of the reactions is determined by the change in free energy between the intermediates and the reactants while the kinetics of the reaction is determined by the difference in free energy between the transition states and the reactants a catalyst lowers the energy of the transition state without affecting the energies of the reactants or intermediates assuming that these are free and not bound to the catalyst a comparison of the thermodynamic reactivity of molecules of similar structures can be made by
