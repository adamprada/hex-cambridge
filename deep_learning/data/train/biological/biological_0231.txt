can be determined through a comparison of their structures is shown below for acetic acid and ethanol an example of how an intermediate can be stabilized through resonance is shown below for the keto enol tautomerization reaction which is favored in the direction of the keto form a a weaker acid than the enol an example of how the inductive effect electron release and withdrawal stabilizedestabilize carbocations and cations is shown below electron withdrawing by the fs in the negatively charged conjugate base of trifluoracetic acid helps explains its lower pka compared to acetic acid stabilization of the tertiary carbocation
