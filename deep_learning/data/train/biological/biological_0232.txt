involves determining the oxidation number of the carbon atoms in the reactant and product if the oxidation number becomes more positive the c is oxidized the general rules for determining oxidation numbers of the atoms in a molecule are o is generally h is usually in molecules consisting of one type of atom like o ie a polyatomic element the atoms have an oxidation number of the sum of the oxidation numbers of the atoms in a molecule equals the net charge on the molecule or ion in general the oxidation number can be calculated as follows assign all nonbonded
