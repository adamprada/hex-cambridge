oxidation number reaction of carbonyls aldehydes and ketones when water reacts with an aldehyde in a nucleophilic addition reaction a diol or a geminal diol results this reacts can be catalyzed by base which acts as the nucleophile its a stronger nucleophile than water and adds to the carbonyl c oh is regenerated when the alkoxide produced abstracts a proton from water regenerating oh when an alcohol adds to an aldehyde or ketone a hemiacetal or hemiketal respectively is formed in the presence of an acid catalyst the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen making the carbonyl more electrophilic after the
