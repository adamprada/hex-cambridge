to keep aldehydes and ketones from undesired reactions in basic solution acetal formation is favored by excess anhydrous alcohol in acetic condition while acetal breakdown is accelerated by high concentrations of water and the presence of an acid catalyst why are ethers and hence acetalsketals resistant to bases they are resistant to nucleophilic attack such as by base since the expelled group alkoxide is unstable epoxides in contrast will react with oh nucleophiles since the epoxide ring is strained and of high energy ethers can react with acids however which protonate the ether o to form an oxonium ion nucleophilic
