resonance the figure below shows that the order of increased reactivity of reactants is amide ester anhydride acid chloride the nonbonded electron pair on n of the amide being less electronegative than o can delocalize and form a resonant structure with a double bond with the carbonyl c more readily than the o in the ester an electron pair on the bridging o in the anhydride since its ability to from a double bond in a resonance structure is split between the two carbonyls c is less effective in stabiliziing either side than in the this is called competing resonances
