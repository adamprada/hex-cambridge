ro rhn note the pka of roh rnh more on the thermodynamics of carbonyl reactivity what really determines the stability of products compared to reactants is the strength of bonds made and broken during the reaction in nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and ketones the strength of the bond to the nucleophile must be greater than the strength of the pi bond broken in the carbonyl a ccl bond strength is kcalmol compared to a pi co bond strength of kcalmol hence a cl is not likely to add to a carbonyl c consider the hydration of formaldehyde carbonyl with hs
