the pi carbonyl bond if the reactant is stabilized by resonance in ways that reduces the electrophicity of the carbonyl c the reaction is slowed nucleophiilicity really is a measure of the affinity of an atom or ion on an electrophilic c which is similar to basicity which is a measure of the affinity of an atom or ion for a proton halides are not good nucleophiles for reactions with acid derivatives since the halide like cl is a better leaving group than the actual leaving group making cc bonds metabolism can be divided into catabolic breaking down and anabolic
