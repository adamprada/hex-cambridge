a molecule in which it is stable so instead of using them the carbonyl c is used as the electrophilic carbon instability of carbocations is reflected in their propensity to rearrangement taking into account the resonance form of the co carbonyl bond in with a positive on c and a negative on o the net charge on the carbonyl is about a stabalized carbanion often stabilized as a enolate resonant form is used as the negatively charged carbon one method of making a cc bond is an aldol condensation in which a carbanion formed the deprotonation of a ch alpha
