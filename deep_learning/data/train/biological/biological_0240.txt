of a brine which saves having to construct a mine holes are drilled approximately cm in in diameter until the salt deposits are reached a pipe is then driven into the salt beds and another pipe is driven inside the larger pipe further into the deposits pressurized water is forced through the outer pipe into the salt beds and then pumped back out through the smaller pipe to the refineries through separation of the impurities eventually all water in the brine will evaporate leaving crystallized salt which then can be dried sifted and graded in different sizes ocean sea and
