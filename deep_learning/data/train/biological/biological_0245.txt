the concentration gradient of solute across the membrane dadx and also on the difference of solute concentration across the membrane Î´a for passive diffusion differentiate between passive diffusion facilitated diffusion mediated by a receptor transporter and active transport write chemical equations which show the physical steps in the process of passive and facilitated diffusion derive a mathematical equation and graphs which shows the dependencies of flux j as a function of aout and ar for facilitated diffusion assuming rapid equilibrium binding of differentiate between carrier proteins permeases or transport proteins on one hand and channels on the other this chapter
