identify from their structures thiamine nicotinamide and pyridoxal cofactors draw mechanisms to show how thiamine pyrophosphate facilitates decarboxylation of αketoacids as a cofactor in enzymecatalyzed reactions draw mechanisms to show how nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide facilitates oxidation oxidative decarboxylaitn and oxidative deamination reactions as a cofactor in enzymecatalyzed reactions draw mechanisms to show how pyridoxal phosphate facilitates cleavage of all bonds to the αcarbon in amino acids as a cofactor in enzymecatalyzed reactions to make and break bonds electrons have to be moved in drawing reaction mechanisms we showed how electrons moved from sources to sinks in many enzymecatalyzed reactions vitamin
