below showing the flow of electrons from a source to a sink the source might often be a pair of electrons on an anion which was formed by prior removal of a proton from the atom by a general base a sink could be a carbonyl o which receives a pair of electrons from one of the double co bonds of the carbonyl as a bond is made to the carbonyl one of the double bonds must break with the electrons going temporarily if the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution reaction to the carbonyl o an excellent sink since it
