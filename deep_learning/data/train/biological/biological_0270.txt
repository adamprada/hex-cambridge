as vitamin d binds to a membrane receptor initiating a signal transduction activation of the cell one signal in the pathway would be alteration in the sm raft leading to changes in membrane protein arrangement and activity the study below was designed to address how sm hydrolysis alters lipid organization in bilayers luvs were made with a lipid ratio of smpecholesterol molar ratio and in the presence of a water soluble protein neuraminidase mw note that these are artificial liposomes not biological membranes as such the sm would be expected to be equally distributed between the two leaflets devise a
