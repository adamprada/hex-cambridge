the other in the presence of added antibody the curves differ little using the data presented in graphs draw a cartoon and explain the sequence of events in the cleavage of gm by neuraminidase luvs identical to those made above but with the added fluorophore nbdpe were prepared the structure of nbdpe is shown below after the luvs were made the liposomes were treated with the membraneimpermeant sodium dithionite which reduces nbd fluorescence excess dithionitewas removed immediately by gel filtration note any remaining flourescence is from inner leaflet nbdpe luvs were then treated withsphingomyelinase enzyme activity was the same as
