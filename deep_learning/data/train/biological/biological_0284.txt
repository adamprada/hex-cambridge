to simulate possible conformational changes in the protein the first charge state was defined to be neutral simulating ph next they changed the protonation state of amino acids to reflect expected charges under acidic ph condition which might promote a change to the molten globule state in a last trial they left the majority of the protein under neutral ph condition but changed just the charge state of the cterminal helix to acidic ph conditions figure modeling and molecular dynamics of n sr a ribbon diagram of the model of n sr the salt bridges between asp d and arg
