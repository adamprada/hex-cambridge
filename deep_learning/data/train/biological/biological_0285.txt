right is covalently bonded to two nitrogen atoms n and n under neutral conditions arg forms two hydrogen bonds to arg oδnω and oδnω but under acidified chelix conditions the ω loop and chelix movement and bonding are disrupted which amino acids would be protonated on the shift from neutral to acidic ph conditions explain why the authors ran a simulation with just the cterminal helix in the acidic protonation state compare the energies of the neutral and acidified strucutures b and the rigidity of the two structures in d which one is more compact flexible higher in energy which
