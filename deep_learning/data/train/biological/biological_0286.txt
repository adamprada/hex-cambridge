dynamics a c superposition of conformations from md snapshots every ps over the ns simulations at neutral left panel acidic middle panel and acidified chelix right panel conditions the protein is dynamic particularly in the distal ends and the loop regions but the overall structure is well maintained at neutral and acidic phs at low ph conformation transitions are particularly prominent at the ω region b interatomic distances in ï½ between arg and asp as a function of time during molecular dynamics simulations the carboxyl carbon cγ of arg in the ω loop is bonded to two oxygen atoms termed
