would the molecular dynamics simulation in the top panel of c change the mutants described above where made using sitespecific mutagenesis and sdspolyacrylamide gels run why did the mutants da and ss migrated further on the gel than the wild type wt unmutated proteins when the mutant proteins were treated first with diothiothreitol dtt before electrophoreis they comigrated with the wt proteins when the mutant proteins were treated with diamide oxidizes sulfhydryls to disulfides their migration was not affected the structures of dtt and diamide are shown below explain the gel results figure characterization of the disulfide mutants a model
