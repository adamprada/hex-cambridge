the dna sequence shows that the wt n protein has cys and the two mutants da and ss mutated as above to contain two cys each have the amount of free cys in each protein was determined using ellmans reagent draw a reaction to show how a free cys represented as rsh below reacts with ellmans reagent what instrument would you use to measure the reaction and quantitate the levels of cys reaction mechanism computer modeling of the wt n sr shows no disulfides and two accessible cys compare the number of cys residues determine by ellmans for each protein
