trnaacyl synthetase this charged trna binds through a complementary anticodon region to the triplet codon in the trna the ribosometrna complex ratchets down the mrna allowing a new charged trna complex to bind at an adjacent site the two adjacent amino acids form a peptide bond in a process driven by atp cleavage this process repeats until a stop codon appears in the mrna sequence the genetic code shows the relationship between the triplet mrna codon and the amino acid which corresponds to it in the growing peptide chain figure codonanticodon interactions between mrna and trna figure central dogma differences
