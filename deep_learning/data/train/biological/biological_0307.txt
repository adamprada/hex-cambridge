number of different transcripts many of which overlapped splicing often occur between nonadjacent introns transcripts were found from both strands and were from regions containing introns and exons other studies found up to of transcripts continued through the end of gene into other genes of the entire mouse genome which is comprised of only exons is transcribed new functions for introns recent studies have shown that not all of the dna interspersed between coding sections of eukaryotic dna introns are devoid of information content some of the intron dna information ultimately gets transcribed and ultimately translated into protein structure introns
