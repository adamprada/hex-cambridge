the genome only once in about billion base pairs these group introns are prime candidates for genetic engineering to produce mutant enzymes which could cut only one specific site in the human genome allowing insertion of novel therapeutic dna sequences into a specific location this would alleviate the problem faced in recent dna therapy regimes in which a therapeutic dna is inserted into a virus which inserts randomly into the host dna potentially leading to mutagenesis of host dna these endonucleases are often called homing endonucleases group intron also form endonucleases with dna sequence recognition sites of base pairs both
