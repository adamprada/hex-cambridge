which results posttranslational modification of proteins through select proteolyis is common a subset of some mature proteins result from selective removal of an internal piece of the nascent protein an intein from the n terminal nextinand c terminal cextein of the protein and subsequent religation of the nextein and cextein through peptide bond formation intein sequence can even be engineered to connect two different discrete proteins which is stable at low temperatures but n which the intein is spliced out at higher temperatures the splicing of the n and cextins occur before the intein is removed this process occurs during
