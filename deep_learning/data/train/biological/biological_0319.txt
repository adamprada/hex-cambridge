smaller fragments which are more readily manipulable similar techniques are used to sequence proteins which require overlapping polypeptide fragments to be made after the fragments have been made they must be separated from each other in order to study them dna fragments can be separated on the basis of some structural feature that differentiates the fragments from each other polarity can not be used since all dna fragments have negatively charged phosphates in the sugar phosphate backbone of the molecule although each fragment would have a unique sequence it would be hard to separate all the different fragments by for
