the shorter the fragment the faster you move using this technique and its many modifications oligonucleotides differing by just one nucleotides can be separated from each other in electrophoresis of dna fragments a fluorescent uncharged dye ethidium bromide is added to the buffer solution this dye literally intercalates inbetween the base pairs of dna which imparts a fluorescent yellowgreen color to the dna when uv light is shown on the agarose gel a reading dna we will discuss one method of reading the sequence of dna this method developed by sanger won him a second nobel prize to sequence a
