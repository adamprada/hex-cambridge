another a needs to be added hence a whole series of discreet fragments of dna chains will be made all terminated when ddatp was added the same scenario occurs for the other tubes which contain dctp and ddctp dttp and ddttp and dgtp and ddgtp respectively all the fragments made in each tube will be placed in separate lanes for electrophoresis where the fragments will separate by size didexoynucleotides figure didexoynucleotides problem you will pretend to sequence a single stranded piece of dna as shown below the new nucleotides are added by the enzyme dna polymerase to the primer gact
