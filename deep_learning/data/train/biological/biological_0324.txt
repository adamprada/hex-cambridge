dye if a different dye is used for each reaction mixture all the reaction mixtures can be run in one lane of a gel actually only one reaction mix containing all the ddxtps together need be performed the gel can then be scanned by a laser which detects fluorescence from the dyes each at a different wavelength figure dna sequencing using different fluorescent primers for each ddxtp reaction one recent advance in sequencing allows for realtime determination of a sequence the four deoxynucleotides are each labeled with a different fluorphore on the phosphate not the base as above a tethered
