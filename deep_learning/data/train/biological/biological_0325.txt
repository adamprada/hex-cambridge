time scale this allows for prolonged detection of fluorescence which give a high signal to noise ratio newer technology in which sequence is done by moving dna through pores in membranes could bring sequencing down to genome or less animation of sanger sequencing nanopore sequencing b writing dna oligonucleotide can be synthesized on a solid bead by adding one nucleotide at a time the sequence and length of the oligonucleotide can be controlled c copying dna several methods exists for copying a sequence of dna millions of times most methods make use of plasmids which are found in bacteria and
