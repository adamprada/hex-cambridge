of cleaving one strand as in proteins the restriction endonuclease must cleave both strands of dsdna it can cut the strands cleanly to leave blunt ends or in a staggered fashion to leave small tails of ssdna multiple such sites exist at random in the genome the gene of interest must be flanked on either side by such a sequence the same enzyme is used to cleave the plasmid or virus dna figure cleaving dna with the restriction enzyme ecor the foreign fragment of dna can then be added to the plasmid or viral dna as shown to make a
