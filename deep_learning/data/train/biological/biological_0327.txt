bacteria and cleaved with the same restriction enzyme to remove the desired fragment after which it can be purified in addition the bacteria can be induced to express the protein from the foreign gene in lab we will transform bacteria with a plasmid containing the gene for human adipoctye acid phosphatase beta haapb and induce expression of the gene a similar method can be used to copy dna in which the foreign fragment is recombined with the dna of bacteriophage a virus which infects bacteria like e coli the recombinant dna can be packaged into actual viruses as shown below
