not splice out the intron rna so mature mrna can not be made if one could clone into the bacteria dna without the introns this problem would not exist one such possible method exists in which you start with the actual mrna for a protein of interest in this technique a dsdna copy is made from a ssmrna molecule such dsdna is called cdna for complementary or copy dna this can then be cloned into a plasmid or bacteriophage vector and amplified as described above copying dna from a mrna construction of a cdna library insert in the mid s
