stoichimetric excess of the primers to anneal to the ssdna the heat stable taq polymerase from thermophilus aquaticus polymerizes dna from the primers the temperature is raised again allowing dsdna strand separation on cooling the primers anneal again to the original and newly synthesized dna from the last cycle and synthesis of dna occurs again this cycle is repeated as shown in the diagram this chain reaction is called the polymerase chain reaction pcr the target dna synthesized is amplified a million times in cycles or a billion times in cycles which can be done in a few hours figure
