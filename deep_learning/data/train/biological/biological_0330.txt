delete one or more amino acids this technique called sitespecific mutagenesis is used extensively by protein chemist to determine the importance of a given amino acid in the folding structure and activity of a protein the techniques is described in the diagram below figure site specific mutagenesis e searching dna where on a chromosome is the gene that codes for a given protein one way to find the gene is to synthesize a small oligonucleotide probe which is complementary to part of the actual dna sequence of the gene determined from previous experiments attach a fluorescent molecule to the dna
