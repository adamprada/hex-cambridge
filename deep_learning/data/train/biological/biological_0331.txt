sequence of the protein as in the example shown below from the genetic code table you could predict the possible sequence of all possible rna molecule which are complementary to the dna in the gene since some of the amino acids have more than one codon there are many possible sequences of dna which could code for the protein fragment the link below shows all possible corresponding mrna sequences that could code for a short amino acid sequence the mer sequence of minimal degeneracy in the nucleotide sequence should be used as possible genomic probe f comparing dna the dna
