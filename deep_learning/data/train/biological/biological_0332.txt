these are in genes but most are probably in between dna and many have been shown to be clustered in areas of highly repetitive dna at the ends of chromosomes called the telomeres and in the middle called the centromeres now remember that their are restriction enzyme sites interspersed randomly along the dna as well if some of the differences in the dna among individuals occurs within the sequences where the dna is cleaved by restriction enzymes then in some individuals a particular enzyme wont cleave at the usual site but at a more distal site hence the size of
