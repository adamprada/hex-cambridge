fragment could be reacted with a set of small radioactive dna probes which are complementary to certain highly polymorphic sections of dna like teleomeric dna and then visualized only a few sets of discrete bands would be observed in the agarose gel these discrete bands would be different from the dna bands seen in another individuals gene treated the same way this technique is called southern blotting and works as shown below dna fragments are electrophoresed in an agarose gel the ds dna fragments are unwound by heating and then a piece of nitrocellulose filter paper is placed on top
