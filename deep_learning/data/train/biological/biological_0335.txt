protein stability draw a thermodynamics cycle for the transfer of a hydrogen bonded dimer of nma from water to a nonpolar environment from the dg for steps in the cycle and extending this model to protein predict if buried h bond formation drives protein folding explain if studies of low temperature protein denaturation high temperature protein and dgo transfer of nonpolar side chains from water to more nonpolar solvents support the hydrophobic effect in protein stability summarize the relationship between the empirical hofmeister series and preferential binding of reagents into the hydration sphere of protein to explain the effects of
