describe chain conformational entropy relate it to conformational changes in acyl side chains in single and double chain amphiphiles with temperatures and describe it role in protein stability state which of several given explanations for the observed destabilizing effects of asn to ala mutations in protein account for those observation summarize graphically the magnitude and direction of the major contributors inter and intramolecular forces and effects to protein stability it is clear that proteins are not all that stable and many contributions of varying magnitudes must sum to give the proteins marginal stability under physiological conditionshydrophobic interaction defined in the
