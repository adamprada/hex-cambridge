molecular structurephysical and chemical propertiesreferencesoutside linksproblems water is a triatomic species with one oxygen atom for every two hydrogen atoms per molecule through a combination of polarized bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms and a bent molecular geometry that gives the molecule an overall dipole moment water posesses several unique chemical and physical properties that are unlike any other species of its size molecular structure the classic model for the water molecule ho is a central oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms on either side unlike other triatomic species that have a linear shape the bonds on a
