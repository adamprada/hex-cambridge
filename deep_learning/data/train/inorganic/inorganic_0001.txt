bonds measure approximately pm in length this bent geometry due to the presence of lone pair electrons makes water different from typical linear triatomic species both on an atomic and a macroscopic level physical and chemical properties through its combination of bent geometry and polarized bonds ho has unique physical properties that are uncharacteristic of most other small molecules as a result of oxygen being more eletronegative than hydrogen the oxygenhydrogen bonds have an unequal sharing of electrons with a majority of the negative charge going to the oxygen atom and leaving the positive chage to the hydrogens with the
