of arrhenius for aqueous solutions it is more useful because the theory was extended to nonaqueous acids and bases exercise write the molecular formulae of nitric acid perchloric acid sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid as oxo acids together with the formal oxidation number of the central atom answer nitric acid hono perchloric acid hoclo sulfuric acid hoso and phosphoric acid hopo acid strength a protonic acid gives h to water and generates the oxonium ion ho the strength of an acid in a dilute aqueous solution is estimated from the equilibrium constant ka for the dissociation equilibrium but it is
