stronger than ho gives h to water forming ho in an aqueous solution for example both hbr and hi dissociate completely to become ho and their acidities are similar this kind of phenomenon is called the leveling effect and all acidities become equal to that of ho in measuring the relative acidity of strong acids it is necessary to use a solvent whose h affinity is smaller than that of water such as acetic acid or ethanol binary halo acids hx except for hf are very strong acids although the ho concentration itself is also high in an aqueous solution
