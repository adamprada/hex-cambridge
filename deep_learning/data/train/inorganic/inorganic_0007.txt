perchloric acid hoclo sulfuric acid hoso nitric acid hono phosphoric acid hopo although phosphoric acid can be written as hopo phosphorous acid is not hop but hohpo and has an acid strength comparable to phosphoric acid hammett acidity function hydrogen ion concentration and ph are meaningful only in dilute aqueous solutions of acids the acidity in nonaqueous and concentrated solutions is measured using the hammett acidity function this function makes it possible to measure the acidities of various acids in a nonaqueous solvent or of an acid in various nonaqueous solvents the hammett acidity function in the equilibrium is defined
