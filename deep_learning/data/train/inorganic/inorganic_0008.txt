an acceptor and a lewis base b a donor of an electron pair an acid a and a base b bind together to form an adduct ab for example a lewis acid bf and a lewis base oet diethylether form an adduct fboet the stability increases by the completion of an octet around boron when such an adduct forms the stability of an adduct is expressed by the equilibrium constant of the reaction therefore the lewis acidities of a series of acids are measured by comparing kf against a common base b since a proton is also an electron acceptor
