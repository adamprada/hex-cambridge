substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water this definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation selfionization of water into hydronium and hydroxide oh ions kw is defined as hoh and the value of kw varies with temperature as shown in the table below where at c kw is approximately ie pkw water temperature kw pkw c c c c c in pure water the majority of molecules are ho but the molecules are constantly dissociating and reassociating and at any time a small number of the molecules about in are hydronium and an equal number are
