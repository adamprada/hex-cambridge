to qualify as an arrhenius base upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise a decrease in the aqueous hydronium concentration or an increase in the aqueous hydroxide concentration the definition is expressed in terms of an equilibrium expression acid base conjugate base conjugate acid with an acid ha the equation can be written symbolically as the equilibrium sign is used because the reaction can occur in both forward and backward directions the acid ha can lose a hydron to become its conjugate base a the base b can accept a hydron to become its
