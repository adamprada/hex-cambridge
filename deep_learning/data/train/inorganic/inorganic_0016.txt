describe the first reaction chcooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of ho when dissolved in water and it acts as a br√∏nsted acid by donating a hydron to water in the second example chcooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a hydron to ammonia nh but it cannot be described using the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium ions lewis acids and bases a third concept was proposed in by gilbert n lewis which includes reactions with acidbase characteristics that do not involve a hydron transfer
