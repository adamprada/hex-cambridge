brønsted theory because there is no hydron transfer the second reaction can be described using either theory a hydron is transferred from an unspecified brønsted acid to ammonia a brønsted base alternatively ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion other definitions luxflood acidbase definition this acidbase theory was a revival of the oxygen theory of acids and bases proposed by german chemist hermann lux in and further improved by håkon flood circa it is still used in modern geochemistry and for the electrochemistry of molten salts
