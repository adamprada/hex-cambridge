leads to where n is the number of atoms at zero time and the time during which the radioactivity becomes half of n is the half life exercise how does a nuclide change with Î± disintegration and disintegration answer because an atomic nucleus of helium atom he is emitted by disintegration of a nuclide its atomic number z becomes z and its mass number a changes to a in disintegration an electron is emitted and z becomes a nuclide z isolation of thulium thulium is a rare earth element with the least abundance except promethium and there were remarkable difficulties
