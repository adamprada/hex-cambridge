water and wateralcohol in those days identification of an element by spectroscopy was already possible and recrystallizations were repeated times over several months proving that it was not possible to obtain purer metal chemists are requested to repeat monotonous operations even now but it is not likely that patience of this sort still exists this may hinder the progress of our understanding of the chemistry of rare earth elements although actinoids are similar to lanthanoids in that their electrons fill the f orbitals in order their chemical properties are not uniform and each element has characteristic properties promotion of f
