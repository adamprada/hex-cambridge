or the electride salt na e of course we already know the answer to this question elemental sodium is clearly a metal it is shiny conducts electricity and has a bcc crystal structure and has never been observed in either of the salt forms but how far away are these forms energetically we can calculate the energetics by assuming that the na ion is about the same size as br and that the e anion is about the same size as cl then the lattice energies in the cycles become the same as those of nabr and nacl the rather
