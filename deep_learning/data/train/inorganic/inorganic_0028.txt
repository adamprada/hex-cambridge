alloys are mixtures of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element an alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements a homogeneous mixture or a mixture of metallic phases a heterogeneous mixture of two or more solutions topic hierarchy electronegativityslaters rulesallredrochow electronegativityreferencesproblemscontributors and attributions allredrochow electronegativity is a measure that determines the values of the electrostatic force exerted by the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons the value of the effective nuclear charges is estimated from slaters rules the higher charge the more likely it will attract electrons although slaters rule are partly empirical so
