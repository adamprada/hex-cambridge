is the nuclear charge is the effective nuclear charge and is the shielding constant through this equation this tells us that electron may get reduced nuclear charge due to high shielding allred and rochow used because it is accurate due to the involvement of shielding that prevents electron to reach its true nuclear charge when an atom with filled sshell attracts electrons those electrons will go to the unfilled porbital since the electrons have the same negative charge they will not only repel each other but also repel the electrons from the filled sshell this creates a shielding effect where
