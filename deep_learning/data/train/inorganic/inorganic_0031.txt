electrons in ca since ca has atomic number of z then we find the electron configuration for ca which is sspsps now we got that we can use slaters rules so ca has a of allredrochow electronegativity allred and rochow were two chemists who came up with the allredrochow electronegativity values by taking the electrostatic force exerted by effective nuclear charge zeff on the valence electron to do so they came up with an equation at the time the values for the covalent radius were inaccurate allred and rochow added certain perimeters so that it would more closely correspond to
