and hydroxides oxides and hydroxides an early classification of substances arose from the differences observed in their solubility in acidic and basic solutions this led to the classification of oxides and hydroxides as being either acidic or basic acidic oxides or hydroxides either reacted with water to produce an acidic solution or were soluble in aqueous base basic oxides and hydroxides either reacted with water to produce a basic solution or readily dissolved in aqueous acids the diagram below shows there is strong correlation between the acidic or basic character of oxides exoy and the position of the element e
