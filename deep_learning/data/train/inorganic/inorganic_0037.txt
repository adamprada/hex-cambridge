to develop as an analytical technique progress in atomic absorption languished for almost a century modern atomic absorption spectroscopy has its beginnings in as a result of the independent work of a c walsh and c t j alkemade commercial instruments were in place by the early s and the importance of atomic absorption as an analytical technique was soon evident instrumentation atomic absorption spectrophotometers use the same singlebeam or doublebeam optics described earlier for molecular absorption spectrophotometers see figure and figure there is however an important additional need in atomic absorption spectroscopywe must covert the analyte into free atoms
