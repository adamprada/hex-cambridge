using a mixture of concentrated acids such as hno hcl and hf this destroys the sediments matrix and brings everything into solution on the other hand if our interest is biologically available metals we might extract the sample under milder conditions such as a dilute solution of hcl or chcooh at room temperature atomization the process of converting an analyte to a free gaseous atom is called atomization converting an aqueous analyte into a free atom requires that we strip away the solvent volatilize the analytes and if necessary dissociate the analyte into free atoms desolvating an aqueous solution of
