move horizontally and vertically horizontal adjustments ensure that the flame is aligned with the instruments optical path vertical adjustments adjust the height within the flame from which absorbance is monitored this is important because two competing processes affect the concentration of free atoms in the flame the more time the analyte spends in the flame the greater the atomization efficiency thus the production of free atoms increases with height on the other hand a longer residence time allows more opportunity for the free atoms to combine with oxygen to form a molecular oxide for an easily oxidized metal such as
