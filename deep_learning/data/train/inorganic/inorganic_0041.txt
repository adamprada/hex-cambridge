mixed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio however a fuelrich mixture may be necessary for easily oxidized analytes table fuels and oxidants used for flame combustion fuel oxidant temperature range oc natural gas air hydrogen air acetylene air acetylene nitrous oxide acetylene oxygen figure shows a crosssection through the flame looking down the source radiations optical path the primary combustion zone is usually rich in gas combustion products that emit radiation limiting is usefulness for atomic absorption the interzonal region generally is rich in free atoms and provides the best location for measuring atomic absorption the hottest part of the flame
