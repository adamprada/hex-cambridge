allows us to introduce a discrete sample of fixed volume and is useful when we have a limited amount of sample or when the samples matrix is incompatible with the flame atomizer for example continuously aspirating a sample that has a high concentration of dissolved solidssea water for example comes to mindmay buildup a solid deposit on the burner head that obstructs the flame and that lowers the absorbance flame microsampling is accomplished using a micropipet to place Î¼l of sample in a teflon funnel connected to the nebulizer or by dipping the nebulizer tubing into the sample for a
