flame by the combustion gases consequently as much as of the sample never reaches the flame a second reason for poor atomization efficiency is that the large volume of combustion gases significantly dilutes the sample together these contributions to the efficiency of atomization reduce sensitivity because the analytes concentration in the flame may be a factor of less than that in solution this is the reason for the waste line shown at the bottom of the spray chamber in figure electrothermal atomizers a significant improvement in sensitivity is achieved by using the resistive heating of a graphite tube in place
