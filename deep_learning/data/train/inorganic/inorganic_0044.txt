samples of between Î¼l are injected into the graphite tube through a small hole at the top of the tube atomization is achieved in three stages in the first stage the sample is dried to a solid residue using a current that raises the temperature of the graphite tube to about oc in the second stage which is called ashing the temperature is increased to between oc at these temperatures any organic material in the sample is converted to co and ho and volatile inorganic materials are vaporized these gases are removed by the inert gas flow in the final
