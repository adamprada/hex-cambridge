the resulting improvement in detection limitsis offset by a significant decrease in precision atomization efficiency is strongly influenced by the samples contact with the graphite tube which is difficult to control reproducibly miscellaneous atomization methods a few elements may be atomized by a chemical reaction that produces a volatile product elements such as as se sb bi ge sn te and pb for example form volatile hydrides when reacted with nabh in acid an inert gas carries the volatile hydrides to either a flame or to a heated quartz observation tube situated in the optical path mercury is determined by
