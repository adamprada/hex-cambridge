several considerations including choosing a method of atomization selecting the wavelength and slit width preparing the sample for analysis minimizing spectral and chemical interferences and selecting a method of standardization each of these topics is considered in this section developing a quantitative method flame or electrothermal atomization the most important factor in choosing a method of atomization is the analytes concentration because of its greater sensitivity it takes less analyte to achieve a given absorbance when using electrothermal atomization table which compares the amount of analyte needed to achieve an absorbance of when using flame atomization and electrothermal atomization is
