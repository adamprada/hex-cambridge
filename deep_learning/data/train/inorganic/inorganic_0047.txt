source for atomic absorption is a hollow cathode lamp consisting of a cathode and anode enclosed within a glass tube filled with a low pressure of ne or ar figure applying a potential across the electrodes ionizes the filler gas the positively charged gas ions collide with the negatively charged cathode sputtering atoms from the cathodes surface some of the sputtered atoms are in the excited state and emit radiation characteristic of the metals from which the cathode was manufactured by fashioning the cathode from the metallic analyte a hollow cathode lamp provides emission lines that correspond to the analytes
