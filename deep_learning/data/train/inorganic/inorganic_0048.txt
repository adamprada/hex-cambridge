glass shield to isolate it from the anode the lamp is filled with ne gas also shown is the process leading to atomic emission see the text for an explanation each element in a hollow cathode lamp provides several atomic emission lines that we can use for atomic absorption usually the wavelength that provides the best sensitivity is the one we choose to use although a less sensitive wavelength may be more appropriate for a larger concentration of analyte for the cr hollow cathode lamp in table for example the best sensitivity is obtained using a wavelength of nm another
