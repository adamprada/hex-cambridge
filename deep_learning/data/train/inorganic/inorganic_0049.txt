emission spectrum from a hollow cathode lamp includes besides emission lines for the analyte additional emission lines for impurities present in the metallic cathode and from the filler gas these additional lines are a source of stray radiation that leads to an instrumental deviation from beers law the monochromators slit width is set as wide as possible improving the throughput of radiation while at the same time being narrow enough to eliminate the stray radiation preparing the sample flame and electrothermal atomization require that the sample be in solution solid samples are brought into solution by dissolving in an appropriate
