pb ni and zn for example can be concentrated by extracting with a solution of ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate in methyl isobutyl ketonesee chapter to review different methods for preparing samples for analysis minimizing spectral interference a spectral interference occurs when an analytes absorption line overlaps with an interferents absorption line or band because they are so narrow the overlap of two atomic absorption lines is seldom a problem on the other hand a molecules broad absorption band or the scattering of source radiation is a potentially serious spectral interference an important consideration when using a flame as an atomization source
