samples background and may present a significant problem particularly at wavelengths below nm where the scattering of radiation becomes more important if we know the composition of the samples matrix then we can prepare our samples using an identical matrix in this case the background absorption is the same for both the samples and standards alternatively if the background is due to a known matrix component then we can add that component in excess to all samples and standards so that the contribution of the naturally occurring interferent is insignificant finally many interferences due to the samples matrix can be
