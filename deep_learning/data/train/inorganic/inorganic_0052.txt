a continuum source such as a d lamp because a d lamp is a continuum source absorbance of its radiation by the analytes narrow absorption line is negligible only the background therefore absorbs radiation from the d lamp both the analyte and the background on the other hand absorb the hollow cathodes radiation subtracting the absorbance for the d lamp from that for the hollow cathode lamp gives a corrected absorbance that compensates for the background interference although this method of background correction may be quite effective it does assume that the background absorbance is constant over the range of
