nonvolatile compounds is the effect of po or al on the flame atomic absorption analysis of ca in one study for example adding ppm al to a solution of ppm ca decreased the calcium ions absorbance from to while adding ppm po to a similar solution of ca decreased the absorbance from to these interferences were attributed to the formation of nonvolatile particles of capo and an alcao oxide when using flame atomization we can minimize the formation of nonvolatile compounds by increasing the flames temperature either by changing the fueltooxidant ratio or by switching to a different combination of
