previous paragraph increased the absorbance to ionization interferences occur when thermal energy from the flame or the electrothermal atomizer is sufficient to ionize the analyte where m is the analyte because the absorption spectra for m and m are different the position of the equilibrium in reaction affects absorbance at wavelengths where m absorbs to limit ionization we add a high concentration of an ionization suppressor which is simply a species that ionizes more easily than the analyte if the concentration of the ionization suppressor is sufficient then the increased concentration of electrons in the flame pushes reaction to the
