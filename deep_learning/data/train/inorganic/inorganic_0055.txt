the calibration curve from a set of standards most instruments include several different algorithms for computing the calibration curve the instrument in my lab for example includes five algorithms three of the algorithms fit absorbance data using linear quadratic or cubic polynomial functions of the analytes concentration it also includes two algorithms that fit the concentrations of the standards to quadratic functions of the absorbance when possible a quantitative analysis is best conducted using external standards unfortunately matrix interferences are a frequent problem particularly when using electrothermal atomization for this reason the method of standard additions is often used one
