of nm and zinc is analyzed at nm with a slit width of nm background correction using a d lamp is necessary for zinc results are reported as mg of cu or zn per gram of ffdt questions describe the appropriate matrix for the external standards and for the blank the matrix for the standards and the blank should match the matrix of the samples thus an appropriate matrix is m hno any interferences from other components of the sample matrix are minimized by background correction why is a background correction necessary for the analysis of zn but not for
