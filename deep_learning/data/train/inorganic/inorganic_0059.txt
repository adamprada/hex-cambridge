of major minor and ultratrace for describing analytes accuracy if spectral and chemical interferences are minimized an accuracy of is routinely attainable when the calibration curve is nonlinear accuracy may be improved by using a pair of standards whose absorbances closely bracket the samples absorbance and assuming that the change in absorbance is linear over this limited concentration range determinate errors for electrothermal atomization are often greater than that obtained with flame atomization due to more serious matrix interferences precision for absorbance values greater than the relative standard deviation for atomic absorption is for flame atomization and for electrothermal atomization
