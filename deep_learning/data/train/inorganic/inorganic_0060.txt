of the burner to give the greatest absorbance with electrothermal atomization sensitivity is influenced by the drying and ashing stages that precede atomization the temperature and time used for each stage must be optimized for each type of sample see chapter for several strategies for optimizing experiments sensitivity is also influenced by the samples matrix we have already noted for example that sensitivity can be decreased by chemical interferences an increase in sensitivity may be realized by adding a low molecular weight alcohol ester or ketone to the solution or by using an organic solvent selectivity due to the narrow
