another way to think about this is to consider the hybridization of the s and p electrons in mg hybridization requires promotion from the sp ground state of an mg atom to a sp excited state the promotion energy kjmol is more than offset by the bonding energy kjmol the energy released when gaseous atoms in the excited state condense to form the metallic solid the heat of vaporization or the cohesive energy of a metal is the difference between the bonding energy and the promotion energy experimentally we can measure the vaporization energy kjmol and the promotion energy and
