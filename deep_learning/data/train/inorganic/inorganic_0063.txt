to make bonds and the sublimation energy of the metal is kjmol periodic trends in delectron bonding while electrons in s and p orbitals tend to form strong bonds delectron bonds can be strong or weak there are two important periodic trends that are related to orbital size and orbital overlap as we move across the periodic table sc ti v cr fe the d orbitals contract because of increasing nuclear charge moving down the periodic table v nb ta the d orbitals expand because of the increase in principal quantum number these trends explain the distinct behavior of the
