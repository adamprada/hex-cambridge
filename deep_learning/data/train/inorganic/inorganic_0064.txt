the s and p orbitals are more effective in bonding than the d in the third transition series the situation is reversed the increased nuclear charge is felt most strongly by the s which takes on the character of an inert electron pair the d orbitals are well shielded by the complete n shell so they have good orbital overlap with neighboring atoms in the d and d series a plot of cohesive energy vs number of valence electrons below left has a volcano shape that is peaked at the elements mo and w sd and sd respectively the number
