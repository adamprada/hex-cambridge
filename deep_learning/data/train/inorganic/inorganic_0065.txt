per atom and the energy cost of promoting electrons from the d to the p orbitals is reflected in the net bonding energy because of their strong bonding energy elements in the middle of the d and d series have very high melting points we do not see magnetism in the d or d metals or their alloys because orbital overlap is strong and the bonding energy exceeds the electron pairing energy the heat of vaporization the cohesive energy of metals in the d and d series measured at the melting point of the metal the d elements sc through
