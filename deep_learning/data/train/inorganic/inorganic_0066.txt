are progressively contracting as more protons are added to the nucleus for elements beyond v the orbital overlap is so poor that the d electrons are no longer effective in bonding and the valence electrons begin to unpair at this point the elements become magnetic depending on the way the spins order metals and alloys in this part of the periodic table can be ferromagnetic spins on neighboring atoms aligned parallel as in the case of fe or ni or antiferromagnetic spins on neighboring atoms antiparallel as in the case of mn we have seen the tradeoff between orbital overlap
