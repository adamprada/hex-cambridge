in magnetic behavior interestingly many alloys of the f elements the lanthanides are also magnetic because the f orbitals like the d orbitals are poorly shielded from the nuclear charge and are ineffective in bonding strong permanent magnets often contain alloys of nd sm or y usually with magnetic d elements such as fe and co because the f orbitals are contracted and not very effective in bonding other physical properties of the lanthanides can also be affected for example it has been proposed that oxides of the f elements have weak surface interactions with polar molecules such as water
