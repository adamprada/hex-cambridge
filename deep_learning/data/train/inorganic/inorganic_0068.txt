progressive filling of the dband explains the steady decrease in bonding energy going from os to au pt and au are both soft metals with relatively low heats of vaporization however these metals especially ir pt and au can combine with early transition metals to form stable alloys with very negative heats of formation and high melting points for example zrc and pt react to form a number of stable alloys zrpt zrpt zrpt zrpt plus carbon this reactivity is unusual because we normally think of pt as a noble ie unreactive metal and because zrc is a very stable
