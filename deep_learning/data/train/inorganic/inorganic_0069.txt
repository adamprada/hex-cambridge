from electron transfer from zr to pt not the other way around and the polarity of the resulting metalmetal bonds regardless of the source of their stability some earlylate transition metal alloys are of particular interest for use in catalysis for example the alloy scpt is a good catalyst for oxygen reduction in fuel cells even though sc is an active metal that is easily oxidized it is stabilized in the aqueous acid environment of the fuel cell by its strong interaction with pt filling of the d and sp bands in the d series we see magnetic behavior for
