are not yet so contracted that they cannot contribute to bonding thus the valence electrons in sc ti and v are all spinpaired except for a small number near the fermi level that give rise to a weak pauli paramagnetism moving across the d series to the magnetic elements fe co ni the dorbitals are now so contracted that their electrons unpair and we see cooperative ordering of spins ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism referring to the band diagram at the right the d band is only partially filled and the fermi level cuts through it for cu zn and ga the
