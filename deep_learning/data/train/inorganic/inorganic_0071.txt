to ge materials are classified as diamagnetic if they contain no unpaired electrons diamagnetic substances are very weakly repelled from an inhomogeneous magnetic field as we learned in chapter molecules or ions that have unpaired spins are paramagnetic and are attracted to a magnet ie they move towards the high field region of an inhomogeneous field this attractive force results from the alignment of spins with the field but in the case of paramagnetism each molecule acts independently in metals alloys oxides and other solid state compounds the unpaired spins interact strongly with each other and can order spontaneously resulting
