undergoing redox so so ho ho step a balance oxygen already balanced step b balance hydrogen so so ho h ho step c balance charge by adding electrons so so e ho h e ho step combine the half reactions so that there are equal numbers of electrons on the left and right sides already equal overall balanced reaction so ho h so ho note that again we did not need to know the formal oxidation states of s or o in the reactants and products in order to balance the reaction in this case assigning the oxidation states would
