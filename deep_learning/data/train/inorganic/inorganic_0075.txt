increasing number of electrons as their amount increases eventually as more orbitals are added the space in between them decreases to hardly anything and as a result a band is formed where the orbitals have been filled different metals will produce different combinations of filled and half filled bands sodiums bands are shown with the rectangles filled bands are colored in blue as you can see bands may overlap each other the bands are shown askew to be able to tell the difference between different bands the lowest unoccupied band is called the conduction band and the highest occupied band
