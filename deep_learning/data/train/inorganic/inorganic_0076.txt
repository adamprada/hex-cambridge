or gap between the valence band and the conduction band the less likely electrons are to be found in the conduction band this is because they cannot be excited enough to make the jump up to the conduction band element ekjmol of energy gap of electronscm in conduction band insulator or conductor c diamond big band gap insulator si smaller band gap but not a full conductor semiconductor ge smaller band gap but still not a full conductor semiconductor conductors insulators and semiconductors a conductors metals are conductors there is no band gap between their valence and conduction bands since
