is a semiconductor in its pure state for every electron that jumps into the conduction band the missing electron will generate a hole that can move freely in the valence band the number of holes will equal the number of electrons that have jumped ii extrinsic semiconductors in extrinsic semiconductors the band gap is controlled by purposefully adding small impurities to the material this process is called doping doping or adding impurities to the lattice can change the electrical conductivity of the lattice and therefore vary the efficiency of the semiconductor in extrinsic semiconductors the number of holes will not
