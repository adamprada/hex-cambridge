rectangles filled bands are colored in blue as you can see bands may overlap each other the bands are shown askew to be able to tell the difference between different bands the lowest unoccupied band is called the conduction band and the highest occupied band is called the valence band bands will follow a trend as you go across a period in na the s band is full in mg the s band is full in al the s band is full and the p ban is full and so on the probability of finding an electron in the conduction
