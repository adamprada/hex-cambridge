band gap insulator si smaller band gap but not a full conductor semiconductor ge smaller band gap but still not a full conductor semiconductor conductors insulators and semiconductors a conductors metals are conductors there is no band gap between their valence and conduction bands since they overlap there is a continuous availability of electrons in these closely spaced orbitals b insulators in insulators the band gap between the valence band the the conduction band is so large that electrons cannot make the energy jump from the valence band to the conduction band c semiconductors semiconductors have a small energy gap
