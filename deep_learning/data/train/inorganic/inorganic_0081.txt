by purposefully adding small impurities to the material this process is called doping doping or adding impurities to the lattice can change the electrical conductivity of the lattice and therefore vary the efficiency of the semiconductor in extrinsic semiconductors the number of holes will not equal the number of electrons jumped there are two different kinds of extrinsic semiconductors ptype positive charge doped and ntype negative charge doped problems how do you distinguish between a valence band and a conduction band is the energy gap between an insulator smaller or larger than the energy gap between a semiconductor what two
