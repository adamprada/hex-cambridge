the pi bond they will find that the formal charges on all of the atoms are the boron shares its valence electrons with the fluorine creating a total of electrons shared with the fluorine making its formal charge each fluorine shares one of its valence electrons creating a total of shared electrons with boron and has more electrons to themselves making their formal charges also figure figure if one of the fluorines were to form a pi bond with the boron then the fluorine which is the most electronegative element will have an oxidized state and a formal charge of
