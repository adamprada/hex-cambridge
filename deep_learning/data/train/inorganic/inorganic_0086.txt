lgos that can be made out of these symmetry labelsone lgo is from a and two lgos are from e due to doubly degenerate in order to determine the shape of each lgo we would use the wavefunctions three hydrogens in bh are assigned with ψ ψ ψ now lets look at how each ψ is affected by the symmetry operations of the dh and their results are completed in the following table dh e c c c c c σh s s σv σv σv ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ ψ a
