would also nodal plane and its wavefunction would be ψe ψψ the shape of the lgo is mo diagram as we can see in this diagram the energy level of lgos are higher than the s orbital and below the p orbital dued to the electronegativy of both boron and hydrogen hydrogen has higher electronegativity than boron therefore hydrogen would have lower energy level in the mo diagram in addition b has electrons in the valence electrons and hydrogens have total electrons therefore the total number of electrons filled in orbitals are with all of the informations above about symmetry
