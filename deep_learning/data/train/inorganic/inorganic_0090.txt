many years is described below iron porphyrins hemoglobin and myoglobin and the copper compound hemocyanin are involved in the transportation of oxygen gas in air to cells in living organisms the basis of this function is reversible bonding and dissociation of dioxygen to iron or copper ions in order to perform these functions metals must be in oxidation states and coordination environments suitable for the reversible coordination of dioxygen the iron porphyrin compound hemoglobin is found in red bloods of human beings and other animals hemoglobin has the structure of heme iron with four iron porphyrin units combined with a
