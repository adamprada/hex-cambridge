iron ion decreases and it just fits into the hole of the porphyrin molecule this molecularlevel movement has attracted interest as an allosteric effect because it affects the whole protein through the histidine coordinate bond and governs the specific bond of a dioxygen molecule oxidation of the feii ion of a hem molecule is prevented by a macromolecular protein and if the hem iron is taken out of the prote in feii ion is oxidized to feiii and two porphyrin rings are bridged by a peroxide o which finally changes to a bridging ostructure when the hem is in this
