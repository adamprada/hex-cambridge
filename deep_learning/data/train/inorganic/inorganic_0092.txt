plants including mankind were depended on biological nitrogen fixation as a source of nitrogen for protein and other compounds containing nitrogen before the invention of the harberbosch process an enzyme named nitrogenase catalyzes this reaction nitrogenase contains ironsulfur and ironmolybdenum sulfur proteins and reduces dinitrogen by coordination and cooperative proton and electron transfers while using mgatp as an energy source because of the importance of this reaction attempts to clarify the structure of nitrogenase and to develop artificial catalysts for nitrogen fixation have continued for many years recently the structure of an active center in nitrogenase called ironmolybdenum cofactor was
