a manganese cluster complex plays the central role a chloroplast contains photosystem i psi and photosystem ii psii which use light energy to reduce carbon dioxide and to oxidize water chlorophyll is a fundamental component of psi chlorophyll is a porphyrin complex of magnesium and is responsible for the green colors of leaves it plays an important role in receiving light energy and transferring it to redox reaction systems chlorophyll is excited from the singlet ground state to the singlet excited state by light the energy of the excited state is transferred to an acceptor within ps and the resultant
