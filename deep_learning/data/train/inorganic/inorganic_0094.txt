to mn ii in this reaction at least two manganese species are involved probably a cluster complex which contains two mnii and two mniv species mediates the electron transfer via four step reactions however the details of this reaction are as yet unclear because it is very difficult to isolate this cluster and to analyze its structure the electron transfer stage is being studied at present by using various manganese complexes as model systems photosynthesis is a very interesting research theme in bioinorganic chemistry as it involves a few metal ions a porphyrin sulfide and oxide clusters that constitute a
