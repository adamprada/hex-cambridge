electron pair description of chemical bonds which was the basis of the octet rule for pblock compounds breaks down for metals this is illustrated well by na metal the structure of which is shown at the left na has too few valence electrons to make electron pair bonds between each pair of atoms we could think of the na unit cell as having eight nobond resonance structures in which only one nana bond per cell contains a pair of electrons sodium metal crystallizes in the bodycentered cubic structure in which each atom has eight nearest neighbors since the electronic configuration
