with n possible nodes in chapter we showed that the energy versus internuclear distance graph for a two hydrogen atom system has a low energy level and a high energy level corresponding to the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals respectively these two energy levels were well separated from each other and the two electrons in h energetically prefer the lower energy level if more atoms are introduced to the system there will be a number of additional levels between the lowest and highest energy levels mo picture for a linear chain of six na atoms three of the six mos
