the tightbinding approximation the number of atoms is so large that the energies can be thought of as a continuum rather than a series of distinct levels a metal will only partially fill this band as there are fewer valence electrons than there are energy states to fill in the case of na metal this results in a halffilled s band nearly free electron model in metals the valence electrons are delocalized over many atoms the total energy of each electron is given by the sum of its kinetic and potential energy e ke pe e pm v where p
