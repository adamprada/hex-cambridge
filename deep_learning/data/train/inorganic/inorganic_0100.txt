in these orbitals is very long at the top of the band the highest orbital is fully antibonding and the wavelength is times the distance between atoms a since there is one node per atom remember that the wavelength of an electron λ is inversely proportional to its momentum p according to the de broglie relation λ hp for a nearly free electron the kinetic energy can be expressed in terms of its wavelength using ke pm and the de broglie relation we can think of the wavelength of an electron in a molecular orbital as twice the distance between
