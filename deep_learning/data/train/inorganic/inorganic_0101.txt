k is that it is directly proportional to the number of nodes n in a molecular orbital within the band for a d crystal of sodium atoms that contains n unit cells each separated by a distance a a molecular orbital with n nodes has a wavelength λ nan and the wavenumber k πnna we can see from this definition that k at the bottom of the band where λ is infinite and k πa at the top of the band where the mo contains n nodes and λ a energies of orbitals in a metallic crystal electrons with long
