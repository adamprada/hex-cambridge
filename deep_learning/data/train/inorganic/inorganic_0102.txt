charged atomic cores in particular the electrons prefer to have the maxima in their wavefunctions line up with the atomic cores which is the most electrostatically favorable situation the electronatom attraction lowers the energy and causes the e vs k curve to deviate from the parabolic behavior of a free electron as shown in the figure below density of states dos the density of states is defined as the number of orbitals per unit of energy within a band because of the parabolic relation between e and k the density of states for a d metallic crystal is highest near
