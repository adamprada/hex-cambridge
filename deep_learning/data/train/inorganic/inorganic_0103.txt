a twelve boxcars but many ways to make a seven a winner electrons in metals follow a parabolic dispersion curve where the energy increases with the square of the wavenumber k near the top of the band the dispersion curve deviates from the parabolic dotted line because there is one mo for each value of k the number of orbitals per unit energy the density of states dos is highest at the bottom and top of the band for a d chain of atoms the density of states is constant with energy for a d crystal and has a maximum
