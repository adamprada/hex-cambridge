chirality are metallic and have characteristic sharp absorption bands in the infrared prof millie dresselhaus below did foundational research on the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes and other lowdimensional conductors metals semiconductors and insulators the degree to which bands fill determines whether a crystalline solid is a metal semiconductor or insulator if the highest occupied molecular orbitals lie within a band ie if the fermi level ef cuts through a band of orbitals then the electrons are free to change their speed and direction in an electric field and the solid is metallic however if the solid contains just enough
