to a metal or an insulator in this case we have changed the diagram to show explicitly the energies of electrons moving left and right these energies are the same in the absence of an electric field once we apply a field eg by putting a voltage across a metal wire the electrons moving in the direction of the field have lower energy than those moving in the opposite direction in the case of the metal the populations of electrons moving with and against the electric field are different and there is a net flow of current note that this
