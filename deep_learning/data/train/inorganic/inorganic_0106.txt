even in the case of a semiconductor or insulator however there can be no net movement of electrons unless the band is partially filled no headers a electrical conductivity and resistivityelectrical resistivity and conductivity is an important property for materials different materials have different conductivity and resistivity electrical conductivity is based on electrical transport properties these can be measured with multiple techniques by using a variety of instruments if electricity easily flows through a material that material has high conductivity some materials that have high conductivity include copper and aluminumb band theory of metals and insulatorsband theory was developed with
