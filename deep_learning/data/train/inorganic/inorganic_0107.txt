the metal is surrounded by a trigonal prism of sulfur atoms nbs tas mose mote and wse also have the trigonal prismatic molybdenite structure which is shown below alongside a platy crystal of mos the coordination of the metal ions by a trigonal prism of chalcogenide ions is sterically unfavorable relative to octahedral coordination there are close contacts between the chalcogenide ions which are eclipsed in the stacking sequence abababababab where indicates the van der waals gap between layers what stabilizes this structure the molybdenite structure occurs most commonly in mx compounds with a d or d electron count the
