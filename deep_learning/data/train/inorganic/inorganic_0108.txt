energy bands in tis and mos mos is a semiconductor with a ev gap between its filled and empty bands because it has an unfilled tg band tis is relatively easy to reduce by intercalation with li for this reason litis was one of the first intercalation compounds studied by stanley whittingham who developed the concept of the nonaqueous lithium ion battery in the early s because it has a filled dz band mos is harder to reduce but it can be intercalated by reaction with the powerful reducing agent nbutyllithium to make lixmos x atoms in the van der
