discovered by the group of reshef tenne in shortly after the discovery of carbon nanotubes since then nanotubes have been synthesized from many other materials including vanadium and manganese oxides the pyrite fes crystal structure the structure is related to nacl with fe and s ions occupying the cation and anion sites although early tis and late pts transition metal disulfides have layered structures a number of ms compounds in the middle of the transition series such as mns fes and rus have threedimensionally bonded structures for example fes has the pyrite structure which is related to the nacl structure
