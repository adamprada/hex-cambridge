consequently we have to study the syntheses structures bondings reactions and physical properties of elements molecular compounds and solidstate compounds of elements in recent years the structures of crystalline compounds have been determined comparatively easily by use of single crystal xray structural analysis and by through the use of automatic diffractometers this progress has resulted in rapid development of new areas of inorganic chemistry that were previously inaccessible research on higher dimensional compounds such as multinuclear complexes cluster compounds and solidstate inorganic compounds in which many metal atoms and ligands are bonded in a complex manner is becoming much easier
