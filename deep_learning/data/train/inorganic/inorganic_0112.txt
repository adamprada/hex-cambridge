structure types is increasing very rapidly and they represent a major field of study in today inorganic chemistry see chapter solidstate compounds although solidstate inorganic compounds are huge molecules it is preferable to define them as being composed of an infinite sequence of dimensional chain dimensional layer or dimensional arrays of elements and as having no definite molecular weight the component elements of an inorganic solid bond together by means of ionic covalent or metallic bonds to form a solid structure an ionic bond is one between electronically positive alkali metals etc and negative elements halogen etc and a covalent
