and different structural dimensions for example in the case of binary consisting of two kinds of elements metal iodides gold iodide aui has a chainlike structure copper iodide cui a zinc blende type structure sodium iodide nai has a sodium chloride structure and cesium iodide csi has a cesium chloride structure refer to section e and the metal atoms are bonded to or iodine atoms respectively the minimum repeat unit of a solid structure is called a unit lattice and is the most fundamental information in the structural chemistry of crystals xray and neutron diffraction are the most powerful experimental
