ratios of elements are nonintegers and these nonstoichiometric compounds characteristically display conductivity magnetism catalytic nature color and other unique solidstate properties therefore even if an inorganic compound exhibits nonintegral stoichiometry unlike an organic compound the compound may be a thermodynamically stable orthodox compound this kind of compound is called a nonstoichiometric compound or berthollide compound whereas a stoichiometric compound is referred to as a daltonide compound the law of constant composition has enjoyed so much success that there is a tendency to neglect nonstoichiometric compounds we should point out that groups of compounds in which there are slight and continuous
