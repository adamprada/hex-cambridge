in a chemical bond on the pauling scale the electronegativity difference between two atoms a and b was defined in terms of the dissociation energies ed of the aa bb and ab bonds where the energies are expressed in electron volts figure a water molecule a commonly used example of polarity the two charges are present with a negative charge in the middle red and a positive charge at the ends blue this definition while directly relevant to the strength of chemical bonds requires thermochemical input data from many compounds some of which were not available at the time mulliken
