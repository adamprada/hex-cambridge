interesting exceptions to this behavior most notably two islands of high electronegatvity at the bottom of the transition series peaking at tungsten χ and gold χ the first of these can be explained by the very high metalmetal bond energy of elements such as mo and w which can use all six of their valence electrons in bonding as we will discuss in chapter the second however occurs with more weakly bonded noble metals such as pt and au and is responsible for their low position in the activity series as well as their extraordinary properties as catalysts table of
