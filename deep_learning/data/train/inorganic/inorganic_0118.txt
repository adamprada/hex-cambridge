on ch compounds there is also a correlation between the strength of a chemical bond and the bond length longer bonds being weaker because of weaker orbital overlap pauling introduced an empirical formula relating bond length to bond strength for a given pair of atoms for example two carbon atoms where dn represents the bond length in å and n is the bond order d in this case would be the length of a cc single bond which we can obtain from the average bond length in alkanes å using this formula we can predict that the bond lengths in
