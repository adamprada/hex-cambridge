which is å longer than twice the covalent radius of the f atom å the ff bond is also quite weak bond dissociation energy kjmol relative to the clcl bond kjmol by putting the extra bond length into the pauling formula we calculate that the bond order in the f molecule is only ie substantially weaker than a ff single bond the physical reason for this is that the ff bond is stretched by repulsion of the lone pairs on the f atoms this crowding is caused by the fact that the he s core orbital as well as the
