pauling overestimated the size of the f atomaccurate quantum chemical calculations place the f singlebond covalent radius at about Ã¥ the important roles of electronegativity differences and lone pair repulsion are evident when comparing trends in bond strengths the table below shows the average singlebond enthalpies of pblock elements with h and f h makes stronger bonds with nd row elements c n o f than with third row elements si p s cl because the p valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and thus make stronger bonds than electrons in p orbitals the bonds to h also follow
