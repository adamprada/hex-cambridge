sih ph sh hcl cf nf of ff sif pf sf clf the anomalously weak bond in f is responsible for the high electronegativity of fluorine as well as the legendary reactivity of elemental fluorine gas which reacts explosively with hydrogen and powdered metals because of the instability of elemental fluorine and the polar nature of its bonds with more electropositive elements fluorine compounds tend to be very stable for example the noble gases xe and kr react with fluorine to make covalent compounds whereas other halogens do not react fluorocarbon compounds contain strong cf bonds and have high thermal
