called born forces introduction lattice energy is the energy released when gaseous cations and anions bond to form a solid ionic compound with the bornlande equation one can calculate the lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound born and lande theorized around the turn of the century that lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound could be found by calculating terms of electrostatic potential and a repulsive potential with is the avagadros constant times and is the madelung constant the first potential is the force of attraction it is a negative value because it pulls the two atoms closer together
