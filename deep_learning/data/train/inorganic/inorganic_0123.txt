the power of a born exponent some number between and implications of born forces attractive forces are affected by the charge of the ions and their radii ions with large charges like mg or o have greater attractive potential than those with smaller charges like na or f smaller ions like li or cl also have greater electrostatic potential than larger ions like i or cs the madelung constant is dependent on the crystal structure type this value is found in tables online or in a text but in general can be thought of as large with larger cationcation distances
