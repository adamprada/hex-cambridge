these crystal geometries what are the oxidation states of barium and oxygen in the crystalline lattice bao calculate the lattice energy of sodium chloride using the bornlande equation find all needed information from tables compare this calculated value to experimentally found value of kjmol solutions lif alo rutile ba and o the calculated value is kjmol silver halides now that we have an equation for the lattice energy of an ionic crystal we can ask the question of how accurate it is remember we made several approximations in arriving at this formula we assumed that the lattice was completely ionic
