bond dissocation energy of clg ea electron affinity of clg ellattice energy of nacl r gas constant t absolute temperature from hess law here we have to subtract rt to convert our cycle of energies to a cycle of enthalpies because we are compressing two moles of gas in making nacls and pδv δnrt where δn experimentally δhf for nacl is kjmol because all the other numbers in the cycle are known accurately the error in our calculation is only about kj about of el the result is promising because we neglected the van der waals term buthow did we
