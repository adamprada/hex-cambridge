explicitly included the errors in this case are only about of el compound calculated lattice energy kjmol experimental el from bornhaber cycle mgf rutile structure caf fluorite structure baf fluorite structure silver halides it is interesting to repeat this exercise for the silver halides which have either the nacl structure agf agcl agbr or zincblende structure agi silver halide calculated cycle difference kjmol agf agcl agbr agi looking at the table we see that the error is small for agf and becomes progressively larger for the heavier silver halides however we are still obtaining answers within about error even for
