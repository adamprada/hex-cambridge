agbr and agi makes these salts sparingly soluble in water again we can interpret the fortuitous agreement between the calculated and experimentally obtained energies in terms of compensating errors our lattice energy calculation overestimates the ionic contribution in the case of the heavier silver halides but underestimates the covalent contribution of these compounds only agf is soluble in water and should be thought of as an ionic compound the others are progressively more insoluble in water ksp is and for agcl agbr and agi reflecting increasing covalency as δχ decreases the moral of the story is that simple lattice energy
