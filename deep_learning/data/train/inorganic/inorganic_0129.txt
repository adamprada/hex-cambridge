cell in the nacl structure which is discussed in chapter we place one nacl formula unit on each lattice point in the facecentered cubic fcc lattice that is one atom na or cl would be placed on the lattice point and the other one would be placed halfway between similarly in the cubic diamond structure we place one c unit around each lattice point in the fcc lattice the fourteen bravais lattices fall into seven crystal systems that are defined by their rotational symmetry in the lowest symmetry system triclinic there is no rotational symmetry this results in a unit
