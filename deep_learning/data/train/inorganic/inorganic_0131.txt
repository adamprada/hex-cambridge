in total combinations but it can be shown that several of these are in fact equivalent to each other for example the monoclinic i lattice can be described by a monoclinic c lattice by different choice of crystal axes similarly all a or bcentred lattices can be described either by a c or pcentering this reduces the number of combinations to conventional bravais lattices shown in the table below when the fourteen bravais lattices are combined with the crystallographic point groups we obtain the space groups these space groups describe all the combinations of symmetry operations that can exist in
