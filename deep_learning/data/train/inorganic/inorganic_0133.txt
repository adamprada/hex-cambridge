explain why some substances that do not contain hydroxide ions for example f and no can make basic solutions in water the brønstedlowry definition of acids and bases addresses this problem in this theory an acid is a substance that can release a proton like in the arrhenius theory and a base is a substance that can accept a proton a basic salt such as naf generates oh ions in water by taking protons from water itself to make hf when a brønsted acid dissociates it increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution h conversely brønsted bases dissociate
