and bases acids and bases that dissociate completely are said to be strong here the righthanded arrow implies that the reaction goes to completion that is a m solution of hclo in water actually contains m haq and m cloaq and very little undissociated hclo conversely weak acids such as acetic acid chcooh and weak bases such as ammonia nh dissociate only slightly in water typically a few percent depending on their concentration and the values of ka and kb and exist mostly as the undissociated molecules antacid tablets typically contain calcium salts of the bicarbonate ion hco a weak
