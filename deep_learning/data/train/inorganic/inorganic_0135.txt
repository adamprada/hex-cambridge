can solve this problem rigorously by invoking both charge balance h nh oh and mass balance m nh nh and using hoh but because the algebra becomes complicated with that method leading to a cubic equation that is hard to solve well invoke two simplifying assumptions which is a reasonable assumption for a basic solution and also reasonable if the percent ionization is small now we can write the percent ionization is this example illustrates that it is technically incorrect to label a bottle of aqueous ammonia as ammonium hydroxide since only about of one percent of the weak base
