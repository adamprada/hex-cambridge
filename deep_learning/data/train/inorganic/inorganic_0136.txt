weak acids produce weak conjugate bases this is illustrated below for acetic acid and its conjugate base the acetate anion acetic acid is a weak acid ka x and acetate is a weak base the strength of a conjugate acidbase varies inversely with the strength or weakness of its parent acid or base any acid or base is technically a conjugate acid or conjugate base also these terms are simply used to identify species in solution ie acetic acid is the conjugate acid of the acetate anion a base while acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid an acid
