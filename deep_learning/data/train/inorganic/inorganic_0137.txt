the central atom hocl is stronger than hoi acids that can donate more than one proton are called polyprotic acids for example sulfuric acid hso is a strong acid that has a conjugate base that actually happens to be a weak acid itself this means that every mole of hso in aqueous solution donates more than mole of protons carbonic acid hco and phosphoric acid hpo are weak polyprotic acids typically the sequential pkas of polyprotic acid are separated by about ph units because it becomes progressively more difficult to remove protons as the ion becomes more negatively charged for
