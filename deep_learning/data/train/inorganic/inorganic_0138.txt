hydroxides of elements that lie on the border between the metallic and nonmetallic elements in the periodic table for example aluminum hydroxide aloh is insoluble at neutral ph but can accept protons in acid to make alho or accept an oh ion in base to form aloh ions consequently aluminum oxide is soluble in acid and in base but not neutral water other examples of amphoteric oxides are beo zno gao sbo and pbo increasing the oxidation state of a metal increases the acidity of its oxide by withdrawing electron density from the oxygen atoms thus sbo is acidic but
