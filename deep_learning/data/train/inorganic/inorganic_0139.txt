to ho in the context of our discussion of conjugate bases above we would say that both cl and br are spectator ions in water neither one is a strong enough base to accept a proton from ho in order to differentiate the acidities of strong acids such as hclo and hcl or the basicities of strong bases such as cho and nh we must typically work in nonaqueous solvents as explained below nonaqueous solutions the br√∏nsted theory encompasses any type of solvent that can donate and accept h ions not just aqueous solutions the strength of an acid or
