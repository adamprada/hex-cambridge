weak base superacids are useful in reactions such as the isomerization of alkanes industrially anhydrous acidexchanged zeolites which are superacid catalysts are used on a massive scale to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil to gasoline superbases such as lithium diethylamide linet alkyllithium compounds rli and grignard reagents rmgx useful in a broad range of organic reactions linet deprotonates ch bonds to generate reactive carbanions rli and rmgx are powerful nucleophiles the use of superbases in nonaqueous media allows us to rank the acidities and measure the pkas of different classes of molecules this ranking is particularly important
