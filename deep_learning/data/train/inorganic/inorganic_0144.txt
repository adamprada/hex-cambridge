in the synthesis of oxide crystals such as the perovskite superconductor kxbaxbio eutectic mixtures of naoh and koh are relatively low melting c and can be used as solvents for crystallizing a variety of basic oxides lewis acids and bases the lewis classification of acids and bases is broader than the brønstedlowry definition and encompasses many more substances whereas the brønstedlowry and the arrhenius classifications are based on transfer of protons lewis acidity and basicity are based on the sharing of an electron pair lewis acids can accept an electron pair while lewis bases can donate an electron pair this
