lewis acid that can react with cl a lewis base to make the lewis salt alcl note that in water cl is a spectator ion a weaker base than the solvent in br√∏nsted acidbase reactions additional examples of lewis acid base reactions in each try to identify the acid the base and the salt based on the concept that the base is the molecule or ion that donates an electron pair in cases where you are not sure it may help to draw the vsepr structures of the molecules in other lewis acid base reactions both acid and base are
