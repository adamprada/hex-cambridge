kand na are not the smaller the atomic radius of the metal ion the more acidic it is going down the periodic table the lewis acidity of metal ions decreases eg al ga in because the ionic radius increases for transition metal ions more electronegative metals tend to make stronger lewis acids the electronegativity has maxima at w and au in the d series so metal ions near in that part of the periodic table are good lewis acids molecules with five coordinate geometries eg pcl asf sbf are typically strong lewis acids because when accepting another pair of electrons
