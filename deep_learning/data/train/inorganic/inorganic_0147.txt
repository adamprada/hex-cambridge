of using lewis acidbase chemstry to drive reactions is the chemical synthesis of fluorine gas which was devised by karl o christe in christe at the time was organizing a symposium to commemorate the th anniversary of the isolation of elemental fluorine by henri moissan which moissan did in by electrolyzing a solution of anhydrous hf years later there was still no direct nonelectrochemical synthesis of f christes reaction scheme followed two steps the first was the known synthesis of kmnf from kmno the second step involved reacting kmnf with the powerful lewis acid sbf to make metastable mnf which
