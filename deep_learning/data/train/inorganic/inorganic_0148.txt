all its valence electrons to form mn in the permanganate ion mno here the oxidation state is stabilized electrostatically by coordination to four o ions and by the overall charge on the mno anion because of its charge o is a stronger base and a better ion for stabilizing high oxidation states than f this is a general trend among transition metals the highest oxidation state is usually reached in the oxide not in the fluoride despite the fact that f is a more electronegative element than o for example cr is stable in the cro and cro anions but
