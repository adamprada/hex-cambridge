with the h s orbitals we now construct the sp hybrid orbitals of the nitrogen atom and orient them so that one is up and the other three form the triangular base of the tetrahedron the latter three by analogy to the h ion transform as one totally symmetric orbital a and an esymmetry pair the hybrid orbital at the top of the tetrahedron also has a symmetry the three hydrogen s orbitals also make one a and one doubly degenerate e combination we make bonding and antibonding combinations with the nitrogen orbitals of the same symmetry the remaining a
