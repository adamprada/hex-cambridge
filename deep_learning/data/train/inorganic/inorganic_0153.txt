inorganic chemistry our understanding of surface reactions in solid catalysts is also deepening a homogeneous catalysis the chemistry of catalysts that are soluble in solvents has developed remarkably since the epochmaking discovery of the wilkinson catalyst rhclpph this complex is a purplish red compound which forms by heating rhcl ho and pph under reflux in ethanol when dissolved in an organic solvent this complex is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons by h at ambient temperatures and pressures to form saturated hydrocarbons and hydroformylation reactions of olefins with h and co to form aldehydes in the past the
