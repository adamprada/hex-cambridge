metal of a complex and they dissociate from the metal as products oxidative addition oxidative addition is one among a few key elementary reactions of metal complexes this is a reaction of such compounds as alkali metal halides rx acids hx or dihydrogen h to the metal in a complex which then dissociate into r and x h and x or h and h which are bonded to the metal as two fragment anions if other ligands on the start complex are not removed the coordination number increases by two as alkyl halogen and hydride ligands are more electronegative than
