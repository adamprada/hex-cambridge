the central metal should increase by similar change occur when two hydride ligands are formed as the result of the addition of dihydrogen the reverse reaction is called reductive elimination both oxidative and reductive reactions are very important as elementary steps in the mechanism of homogeneous catalysis involving hydrocarbons and dihydrogen exercise how does the oxidation number of rhodium change with reductive elimination of dihydrogen from rhclhpph sol answer it changes to rhi from rhiii insertion reaction in the reaction of an alkyl or hydride ligand to shift to a carbonyl or olefin ligand coexisting on the central metal the
