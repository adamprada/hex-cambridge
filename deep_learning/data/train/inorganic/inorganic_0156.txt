catalyst the catalytic cycle in hydrogenation of ethylene is illustrated in figure figure catalytic cycle of ethylene hydrogenation by the wilkinson catalyst l is a ligand and sol is a solvent molecule if the triphenylphosphine ligand pch in the wilkinson catalyst is replaced by an optical active phosphine asymmetric hydrogenation is realized asymmetrical catalysis equivalent to enzyme reactions have been developed by skillful design of asymetrical ligands in particular the asymmetric induction of binaphtyldiphosphine binap has attracted attention b solid state catalysis a solid catalyst is also called a heterogeneous catalyst and promotes the reaction of reactants in gaseous or
