on activation of reactants by surface acids or bases and by coordination to the metal surface it is possible to observe these interactions using various spectroscopies infrared spectroscopy exafs extended xray absorption fine structure electronic spectra electron microscopy or stm scanning tunnelling microscopy since mechanisms of homogeneous catalysis have been clarified considerably solid surface reactions can also be analyzed by introducing concepts such as surface complexes or surface organometallic compounds however unlike homogeneous catalysis in which only one or a few metal centers participate many active sites are involved in solid state catalysis since surface homogeneity and reproducibility are difficult
