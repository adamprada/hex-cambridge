in recognition of this a nobel prize was awarded to f haber for this invention a huge volume of research on the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of ammonia synthesis has been performed up until the present because the reaction of dinitrogen and dihydrogen on iron catalysts is a good model of solid state catalysis no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to develop the next generation of openaccess texts to improve postsecondary education at all levels of higher learning the libretexts approach
