and rings of four h atoms or πorbitals h or butadiene mo diagram for h or butadiene a few notes about this mo diagram in the linear form of the molecule the combination of aos makes a ladder of evenly spaced energy levels that alternate g u g u each successive orbital has one more node this is a general rule for linear chains of σ or π orbitals with even numbers of atoms in the cyclic form of the molecule there is one nondegenerate orbital at the bottom one at the top and a ladder of doubly degenerate orbitals
