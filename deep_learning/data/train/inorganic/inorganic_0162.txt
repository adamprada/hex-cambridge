thus cyclobutadiene should be antiaromatic and have two single and two double bonds that are not delocalized by resonance cyclobutadiene is actually a very unstable molecule because it polymerizes to relieve ring strain sterically hindered derivatives of the molecule do have the puckered rectangular structure predicted by mo theory benzene Ï€orbitals how do we get from a atom to atom chain by analogy to the process we used to go from a atom chain to a atom chain we now go from to we start with the orbitals of the atom chain which form a ladder of g and u
