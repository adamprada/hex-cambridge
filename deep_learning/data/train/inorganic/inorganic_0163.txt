interesting question of whether the aromatic n rule might apply to sorbital systems ie if three molecules of h could get together to form an aromatic hmolecule in fact recent studies of hydrogen under ultrahigh pressures in a diamond anvil cell show that such structures do form a solid hydrogen phase exists that contains sheets of distorted sixmembered rings analogous to the fully connected d network of sixmembered rings found in graphite or graphene it should now be evident from our construction of mo diagrams for four and sixorbital molecules that we can keep adding atomic orbitals to make chains
