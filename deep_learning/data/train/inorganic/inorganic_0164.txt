of metals and semiconductors from this model using the infinite chain of atoms as a model for the crystal a simple substancesb polyatomic chalcogen cations and anionsc metal sulfideschevrel phase compounds a simple substances sulfur selenium and tellurium are called chalcogens simple substances and compounds of oxygen and of the elements of this group in the later periods have considerably different properties as a result of having much smaller electronegativities than oxygen they show decreased ionicity and increased bond covalency resulting in a smaller degree of hydrogen bonding because they have available d orbitals chalcogens have increased flexibility of valence
