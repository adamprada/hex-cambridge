the bonds of sulfur compounds is low and hydrogen bonding is not important elemental sulfur has many allotropes such as s s s s s s s s s s s and s reflecting the catenation ability of sulfur atoms elemental sulfur is usually a yellow solid with a melting point of c called orthorhombic sulfur sulfur phasetransition of this polymorph produces monoclinic sulfur sulfur at c it was established in that these are crownlike cyclic molecules figure being molecular they dissolve well in organic solvents such as cs not only membered rings but also s rings are known and
