transitionmetal salt mos a complex cpws etc of polysulfide anions sx x in which the sulfur atoms are bonded mutually have been synthesized and their structures determined as is evident from the fact that elemental sulfur itself forms s molecules sulfur unlike oxygen tends to catenate therefore formation of polysulfide ions in which many sulfur atoms are bonded is feasible and a series of polysulfanes hsx x has actually been synthesized c metal sulfides stratified disulfides ms are important in transition metal sulfides they show two types of structures one has a metal in a triangular prismatic coordination environment and
