case interestingly however we observe that the equilibrium constant is times larger for the second reaction than it is for the first the big difference between these two reactions is that the second one involves condensation of fewer particles to make the complex this means that the entropy changes for the two reactions are different the first reaction has a δs value close to zero because there are the same number of molecules on both sides of the equation the second one has a positive δs because four molecules come together but seven molecules are produced the difference between them
