means for a given metal ion kf is times larger for edta than it would be for the relevant monodentate ligands at the same concentration edtatightly binds essentially any or ion in the periodic table and is a very useful ligand for both analytical applications and separations ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid acid edta a hexadentate ligand the macrocyclic effect follows the same principle as the chelate effect but the effect is further enhanced by the cyclic conformation of the ligand macrocyclic ligands are not only multidentate but because they are covalently constrained to their cyclic form they allow less conformational freedom the ligand
