deposition cvd of metal thin films bipyridine and related bidentate ligands such as phenanthroline below center left form propellershaped complexes with metals such as ru the rubpy complex below left is photoluminescent and can also undergo photoredox reactions making it an interesting compound for both photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis the chiral propellor shapes of metal polypyridyl complexes such as rubpy coincidentally match the size and helicity of the major groove of dna this has led to a number of interesting studies of electron transfer reactions along the dna backbone initiated by photoexcitation of the metal complex prof jacqueline barton caltech
