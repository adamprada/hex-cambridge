crystals precipitated patiently and carefully using tweezers pasteur was able to separate the two types of crystals pasteur noticed that the types rotated the plane polarized by the same amount but in different directions these two compounds are called enantiomers what are enantiomers two compounds are enantiomers if they are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other as was mentioned enantiomers are characterized by their ability to rotate planepolarized light they also have the same physical properties eg melting point etc relative to each other as a result they are also referred to as being optically active when it comes to
