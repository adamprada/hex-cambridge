axis however since by definition an improper rotation axis is a rotation about an certain axis followed by reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis and an inversion center is simply the absence of an improper axis requires in most cases that absence of both a plane of symmetry and an inversion center as a result it suffices in most cases to check for improper rotation axes to determine whether a molecule is chiral or not as a result of the previous discussion there are a few classes of point groups that lack an improper axis those classes are
