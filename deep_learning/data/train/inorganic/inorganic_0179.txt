and the oxygen molecule o answer nn oo eight electrons are required to fill an s and three p orbitals and when the total number of electrons used for the bonds and lone pairs is eight a stable molecular structure results this is called the octet rule and is useful when qualitatively discussing the molecular structures of main group compounds of course this rule is not applied to a hydrogen molecule h but is applicable to covalent molecules such as simple twoatomic molecules o or co and even to complicated organic compounds for the elements after the rd period the
