the total electrical charge in a compound should be zero the electrical charges of cations and anions are equal there is a partial contribution from covalent bonds even in an ionic compound and the ions are not necessarily bonded only by the electrostatic interaction paulings electroneutrality principle states that the net electrical charge of each component of a compound is essentially neutral as will be mentioned later the structures of many solid compounds are described as an alternate array of cations and anions and are classified into several representative crystal types metal atoms are bound together by means of the
