bonds as has already been described a weak bonding interaction called the van der waals interaction has been recognized in neutral atomic or molecular compounds the potential of this interaction is inversely proportional to the th power of the distance between atoms the adjacent but nonbonded distance between atoms is estimated by the sum of the van der waals radius assigned to each atom the weak interaction xhy that a hydrogen atom forms with the atoms x y nitrogen oxygen fluoride etc with larger electronegativity than that of hydrogen is called the hydrogen bond hydrogen bonding plays an important role
