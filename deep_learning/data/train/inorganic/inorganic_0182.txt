there is one octahedral hole and two tetrahedral holes per packing atom question would anions or cations be better as packing atoms we might expect that anions which are often larger than cations would be better suited to the positions of packing atoms while this is often true there are many examples of structures in which cations are the packing atoms and others in which the distinction is arbitrary the nacl structure is a good example of the latter one octahedral and one tetrahedral site in a facecentered cubic unit cell each cell contains four packing atoms gray four octahedral
