which are related to each other by a translation of half the unit cell along any of the three cartesian axes we could have equivalently placed the cl ions at the fcc lattice points and the na ions in the octahedral holes by simply translating the origin of the unit cell by thus the distinction between packing and interstitial atoms in this case is arbitrary crystal structure of nacl both the na and cl ions are octahedrally coordinated nacl is interesting in that it is a threedimensional checkerboard and thus there are no nacl molecules that exist in the structure
