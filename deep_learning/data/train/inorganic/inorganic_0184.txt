determine the structures of a number of other compounds including diamond zincblende calcium fluoride and other alkali halides these experiments gave chemists their first real look at the atomic structure of solids and laid the groundwork for xray diffraction experiments that later elucidated the structures of dna proteins and many other compounds for their work on xray diffraction the braggs received the nobel prize in physics in the lattice dimensions and positions of atoms in crystals such as nacl are inferred from diffraction patterns since each type of atom in the nacl structure forms a facecentered cubic lattice there are
