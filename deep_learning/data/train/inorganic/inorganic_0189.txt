happens if sodium chloride is added to this saturated solution sodium chloride shares an ion with leadii chloride the chloride ion is common to both of them this is the origin of the term common ion effect look at the original equilibrium expression again what happens to that equilibrium if extra chloride ions are added according to le ch√¢telier the position of equilibrium will shift to counter the change in this case by removing the chloride ions by making extra solid leadii chloride of course the concentration of leadii ions in the solution is so small that only a tiny
