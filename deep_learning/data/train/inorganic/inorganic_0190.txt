to be the concentration of the leadii ions the calculations are different from before this time the concentration of the chloride ions is governed by the concentration of the sodium chloride solution the number of ions coming from the leadii chloride is going to be tiny compared with the m coming from the sodium chloride solution in calculations like this it can be assumed that the concentration of the common ion is entirely due to the other solution this simplifies the calculation so we assume the rest of the mathematics looks like this beginequation beginsplit ksp pbcl s times times
