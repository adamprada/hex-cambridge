would without the added common ion the common ion effect suppresses the ionization of a weak acid by adding more of an ion that is a product of this equilibrium example the common ion effect of ho on the ionization of acetic acid the common ion effect suppresses the ionization of a weak base by adding more of an ion that is a product of this equilibrium example consider the common ion effect of oh on the ionization of ammonia adding the common ion of hydroxide shifts the reaction towards the left to decrease the stress in accordance with le
