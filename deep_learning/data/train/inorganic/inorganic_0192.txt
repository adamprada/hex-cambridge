of the excess product adding a common ion to a dissociation reaction causes the equilibrium to shift left toward the reactants causing precipitation example consider the reaction what happens to the solubility of pbcls when m nacl is added solution identify the common ion cl notice qsp ksp the addition of nacl has caused the reaction to shift out of equilibrium because there are more dissociated ions typically solving for the molarities requires the assumption that the solubility of pbcl is equivalent to the concentration of pb produced because they are in a ratio because ksp for the reaction is
