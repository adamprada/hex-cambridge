the molarity of pb is lower when nacl is added the equilibrium constant remains the same because of the increased concentration of the chloride ion to simplify the reaction it can be assumed that cl is approximately m since the formation of the chloride ion from the dissociation of lead chloride is so small the reaction quotient for pbcl is greater than the equilibrium constant because of the added cl this therefore shift the reaction left towards equilibrium causing precipitation and lowering the current solubility of the reaction overall the solubility of the reaction decreases with the added sodium chloride
