compared to the size of the atoms or the unit cell the diagram at the left shows a generic plot of electron energy vs density of states for a metal such as na cu or ag in these cases there are n orbitals for n electrons and each orbital can accommodate two electrons therefore the fermi level which corresponds to the energy of the highest occupied mo at zero temperature is somewhere in the middle of the band of orbitals the energy level spacing between orbitals is very small compared to the thermal energy kt so we can think of
