levels because of quantization electrons in metals have a fermidirac distribution of energies in this distribution most of the electrons are spinpaired although the individual electrons in these pairs can be quite far apart since the orbitals extend over the entire crystal a relatively small number of electrons at the top of the fermi sea are unpaired by thermal excitation this is the origin of the pauli paramagnetism of metals how fast are electrons traveling in a typical metal because of the bell shape of the e vs dos curve most of the electrons have e ef at the midpoint
