ms for na and ag respectively so our approximations are pretty good how fast are electrons moving in metals really really fast meters per second this is about the speed of light and about times the speed of sound in air x ms however the drift velocity of electrons in metals the speed at which electrons move in applied electric field is quite slow on the order of ms or cms you can easily outrun an electron drifting in a metal even if you have been drinking all night and have been personally reduced to a very slow crawl in
