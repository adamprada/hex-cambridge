electron is scattered its acceleration starts all over again the time between scattering events is τ and the distance the electrons travel between scattering events is the mean free path λ note that this is not the same λ as the de broglie wavelength they just unfortunately have the same symbol we can write the force on the electron as in this equation a is the acceleration in the electric field me is the mass and vdrift is the drift velocity of the electron experimentally the mean free path is typically obtained by measuring the scattering time for an electron
