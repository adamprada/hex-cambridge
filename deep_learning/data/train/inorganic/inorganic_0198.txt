traveling in metals at the fermi velocity vf which is very very fast ms but the flux of electrons is the same in all directions that is they are going nowhere fast in an electric field a very small but directional drift velocity is superimposed on this fast random motion of valence electrons for ordinary metals the mean free path of a valence electron Î» is quite long relative to the interatomic spacing represented in this analogy as the length of a football we can calculate the drift velocity of electrons as the acceleration in the electric field times the
