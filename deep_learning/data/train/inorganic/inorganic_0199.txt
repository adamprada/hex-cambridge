density of valence electrons cm and e is the charge of the electron coul combining these equations with our equation for vdrift we obtain thus v ir where r is the combination of the two terms in parentheses the first of these is the resistivity and the second is a geometrical factor the conductivity σ of a metal which is the inverse of is proportional to μ which in turn is proportional to τ and λ we can use this equation to work out the conductivity of a specific metal cu for which n x cm and τ x s
