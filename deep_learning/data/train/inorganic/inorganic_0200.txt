becomes more complicated and the equation can then only be solved numerically when there are many mutually repulsive electrons in a molecule so as a first approximation we will assume that the s p d f etc orbitals of the atoms that make up the molecule are good solutions to the schr√∂dinger equation we can then allow these wavefunctions to interfere constructively and destructively as we bring the atoms together to make bonds in this way we use the atomic orbitals ao as our basis for constructing mos lcaomo linear combination of atomic orbitals in physics this is called this
