end up with two molecular orbitals when atomic orbitals add in phase we get constructive interference and a lower energy orbital when they add out of phase we get a node and the resulting orbital has higher energy the lower energy mos are bonding and higher energy mos are antibonding figure sigma bonding and antibonding combinations of an s and p orbital molecular orbitals are also called wavefunctions ψ because they are solutions to the schrödinger equation for the molecule the atomic orbitals also called basis functions are labeled as φs for example φs and φpz or simply as φand
