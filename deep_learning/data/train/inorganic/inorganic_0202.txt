not contribute to bonding and empty orbitals at higher energy likewise do not contribute those orbitals are however important in photochemistry and spectroscopy which involve electronic transitions from occupied to empty orbitals the fluorescent dyes that stain the cells shown in fig absorb light by promoting electrons in the homo to empty mos and give off light when the electrons drop back down to their original energy levels figure different components of endothelial cells are stained by blue green and red fluorescent dyes for each dye the color of emitted light corresponds to the energy given off when an electron
