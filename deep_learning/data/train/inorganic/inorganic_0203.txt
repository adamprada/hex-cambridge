s orbital and a chlorine p orbital combine to make a polar hcl bond nodes the wavefunctions φ and ψ are amplitudes that are related to the probability of finding the electron at some point in space they have lobes with or signs which we indicate by shading or color wherever the wavefunction changes sign we have a node as you can see in fig nodes in mos result from destructive interference of and wavefunctions generally the more nodes the higher the energy of the orbital in the example above we have drawn a simplified picture of the cl pz
