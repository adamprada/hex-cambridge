aos to make mos so for the simple case of combining φ and φ to make ψand ψ overlap integral the spatial overlap between two atomic orbitals φ and φ is described by the overlap integral s where the integration is over all space figure the wavefunctions of atomic orbitals decrease exponentially with distance orbital overlap is nonzero when two atoms are close together as illustrated for s orbitals in the upper figure the lower figure shows orbitals that are too far away to interact in this case both s and β are close to zero energies of bonding and
