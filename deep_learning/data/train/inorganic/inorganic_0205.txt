energy rises continuously as the atoms are brought together figure energy as a function of distance for the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the h molecule at the equilibrium bond distance the energies of the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals ψ ψ are lower and higher respectively than the energies of the atomic basis orbitals φ and φ this is shown in fig for the mos of the h molecule figure molecular orbital energy diagram for the h molecule the energy of an electron in one of the atomic orbitals is α the coulomb integral where h is the hamiltonian
