be used to obtain approximate solutions for π molecular orbitals in organic molecules we simplify the math by taking s and setting h for any porbitals that are not adjacent to each other the extended hückel method developed by roald hoffmann and other semiempirical methods can be used to rapidly obtain relative orbital energies approximate wavefunctions and degeneracies of molecular orbitals for a wide variety of molecules and extended solids more sophisticated ab initio methods are now readily available in software packages and can be used to compute accurate orbital energies for molecules and solids we can get the coefficients
