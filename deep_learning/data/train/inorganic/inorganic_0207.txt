diagram the bond order can be calculated as ½ of bonding electrons of antibonding electrons for h the bond order is and for hethe bond order is zero heteronuclear case eg hcl polar bonds here we introduce an electronegativity difference between the two atoms making the chemical bond the energy of an electron in the h s orbital is higher it is easier to ionize than the electron in the chlorine pz orbital this results in a larger energy difference between the resulting molecular orbitals ψ and ψ as shown in fig the bigger the electronegativity difference between atomic orbitals
