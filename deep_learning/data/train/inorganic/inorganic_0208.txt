case there is not much mixing between the aos because their energies are far apart fig the two bonding electrons are localized on the f atom so we can write the molecule as naf note that if we were to excite an electron from ψ to ψ using light the resulting electronic configuration would be ψψ and we would have naf this is called a charge transfer transition figure molecular orbital energy diagram illustrating ionic bonding in the naf molecule summary of molecular orbital theory so far add and subtract ao wavefunctions to make mos two aos two mos more
