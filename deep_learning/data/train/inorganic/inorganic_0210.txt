electron occupancy of the metals dorbitals to understand and rationalize these properties it is important to know how to count the delectrons because transition metals are generally less electronegative than the atoms on the ligands c n o cl p that form the metalligand bond our convention is to assign both electrons in the bond to the ligand for example in the ferricyanide complex fecn if the cyanide ligand keeps both of its electrons it is formulated as cn by difference iron must be fe because the charges must add up to the overall charge on the complex the next
