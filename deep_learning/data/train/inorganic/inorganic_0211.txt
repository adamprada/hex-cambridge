valence shell minus two leaving it with delectrons d in the neutral complex rhohho rh is in the oxidation state and is in group so the electron count is d zincii in group would have delectrons in znnh a full shell and manganese vii has zero delectrons in mno nickel carbonyl nico contains the neutral co ligand and ni in the zero oxidation state since ni is in group we count the electrons on ni as d a frequent source of confusion about electron counting is the fate of the selectrons on the metal for example our electron counting rules
