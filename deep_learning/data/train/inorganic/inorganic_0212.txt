is useful and works reliably for all kinds of complexes the assignment of all the shared electrons in the complex to the ligands does not always represent the true bonding picture this picture would be most accurate in the case of ligands that are much more electronegative than the metal but in fact there all all kinds of ligands including those such as h alkyl cyclopentadienide and others where the metal and ligand have comparable electronegativity in those cases especially with late transition metals that are relatively electropositive we should regard the metalligand bond as covalent the cbc method also
