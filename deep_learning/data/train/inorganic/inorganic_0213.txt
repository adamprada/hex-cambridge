examples of this type of ligand include co pr nh ho carbenes crr and alkenes xtype ligands are those that donate one electron to the metal and accept one electron from the metal when using the neutral ligand method of electron counting or donate two electrons to the metal when using the donor pair method of electron counting regardless of whether it is considered neutral or anionic these ligands yield normal covalent bonds a few examples of this type of ligand are h ch halogens and no bent ztype ligands are those that accept two electrons from the metal center
