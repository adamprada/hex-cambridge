this neutral ligand as lx with the two l functionalities corresponding to the two olefinic fragments while the x functionality corresponds to the ch radical carbon in the ring the addition of one electron makes the cp anion which has six pi electrons and is thus planar and aromatic in the ferrocene complex cpfe using the standard donor pair counting method we can regard the two cp ligands as each possessing six pi electrons and by difference fe is in the oxidation state the fe ion is d thus the iron atom in the complex regardless of the counting method
