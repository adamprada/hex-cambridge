tg orbitals singly the spins align parallel according to hunds rule which states that the lowest energy state has the highest spin angular momentum for each of these complexes we can calculate a crystal field stabilization energy cfse which is the energy difference between the complex in its ground state and in a hypothetical state in which all five dorbitals are at the energy barycenter for ti there is one electron stabilized by δo so similarly cfse δo and δo for v and cr respectively for cr complexes which have four delectrons the situation is more complicated now we can
