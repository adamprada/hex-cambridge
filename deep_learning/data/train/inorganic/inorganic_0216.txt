on both the metals and the ligands it determines the spin state of the complex rules of thumb d complexes are high spin with weak field ligands and low spin with strong field ligands high valent d complexes eg co complexes tend to be low spin large δo d and d complexes are always low spin large δo note that high and low spin states occur only for d metal complexes with between and delectrons complexes with to delectrons can accommodate all electrons in individual orbitals in the tg set complexes with or delectrons will always have completely filled tg
