of transition metal complexes compounds with unpaired electrons have an inherent magnetic moment that arises from the electron spin such compounds interact strongly with applied magnetic fields their magnetic susceptibility provides a simple way to measure the number of unpaired electrons in a transition metal complex if a transition metal complex has no unpaired electrons it is diamagnetic and is weakly repelled from the high field region of an inhomogeneous magnetic field complexes with unpaired electrons are typically paramagnetic the spins in paramagnets align independently in an applied magnetic field but do not align spontaneously in the absence of a
