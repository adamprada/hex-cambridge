stability of the complex follows the order mg mn fe co ni cu zn this trend represents increasing lewis acidity as the ions become smaller going left to right in the periodic table as well as the trend in cfse this same trend is reflected in the hydration enthalpy of gasphase m ions as illustrated in the graph at the right note that ca mn and zn which are d dhigh spin and d aquo ions respectively all have zero cfse and fall on the same line ions that deviate the most from the line such as ni octahedral d
