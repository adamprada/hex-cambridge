in optical transitions by the spin selection rule so the excited state will always have the same spin multiplicity as the ground state the spectra of even the simplest transition metal complexes are rather complicated because of the many possible ways in which the delectrons can fill the tg and eg orbitals for example if we consider a d complex such as vaq we know that the two electrons can reside in any of the five dorbitals and can either be spinup or spindown there are actually different such arrangements called microstates that do not violate the pauli exclusion principle
