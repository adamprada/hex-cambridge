is excited to an empty eg orbital interestingly we find not one but two transitions in the visible the reason that we see two transitions is that the electron can come from any one of the tg orbitals and end up in either of the eg orbitals let us assume for the sake of argument that the electron is initially in the dxy orbital it can be excited to either the dz or the dxy orbital higher energy lower energy the first transition is at higher energy shorter wavelength because in the excited state the configuration is dyzdxzdz all three
