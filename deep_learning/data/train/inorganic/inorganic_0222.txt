the simplest models for explaining the structures and properties of transition metal complexes the theory is based on the electrostatics of the metalligand interaction and so its results are only approximate in cases where the metalligand bond is substantially covalent but because the model makes effective use of molecular symmetry it can be surprisingly accurate in describing the magnetism colors structure and relative stability of metal complexes consider a positvely charged metal ion such as fe in the field of six negatively charged ligands such as cn there are two energetic terms we need to consider the first is the
