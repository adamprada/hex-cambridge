ligand sphere around the metal and then moving the six ligands to the vertices of an octahedron initially all five dorbitals are degenerate ie they have the same energy by symmetry in the first step the antibonding interaction drives up the energy of the orbitals but they remain degenerate in the second step the dorbitals split into two symmetry classes a lower energy triplydegenerate set the tg orbitals and a higher energy doubly degenerate set the eg orbitals a fe ion has five delectrons one in each of the five dorbitals in a spherical ligand field the energy of electrons
