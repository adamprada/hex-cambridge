are destabilized by Î´o in an octahedral complex dorbitals and their orientation with relation to ligands in an octahedral complex what causes the dorbitals to split into two sets recall that the dorbitals have a specific orientation with respect to the cartesian axes the lobes of the dxy dxz and dyz orbitals the tg orbitals lie in the xy xz and yzplanes respectively these three dorbitals have nodes along the x y and zdirections the orbitals that contain the ligand lone pairs are oriented along these axes and therefore have zero overlap with the metal tg orbitals it is easy
