in the mo picture below the frontier orbitals are derived from the metal dorbitals the lower tg set which contains one electron is nonbonding by symmetry and the eg orbitals are antibonding the metal s orbital which has ag symmetry makes a low energy bonding combination that is ligandcentered and an antibonding combination that is metalcentered and above the eg levels this is the reason that our delectron counting rules do not need to consider the metal s orbital the important takehome message is that crystal field theory and mo theory give very similar results for the frontier orbitals of
