rapid cooling molten metals have low viscosity and the identical essentially spherical atoms can pack into a crystal very easily glassy metals can be made however by rapidly cooling alloys particularly if the constituent atoms have different sizes the different atoms cannot pack in a simple unit cell sometimes making crystallization slow enough to form a glass bodycentered cubic hcp left and fcc right closepacking of spheres crystal structures most metals and alloys crystallize in one of three very common structures bodycentered cubic bcc hexagonal close packed hcp or cubic close packed ccp also called face centered cubic fcc in
