from layers above and below the stacking sequence is abcabc in the ccp lattice and abab in hcp in both cases it can be shown that the spheres fill of the volume of the lattice this is the highest volume fraction that can be filled with a lattice of equal spheres atoms in metallic crystals have a tendency to pack in dense arrangments that fill space efficiently the simple square packing above upon which the simple cubic structure is based is inefficient and thus rare among metallic crystal structures body or facecentered structures fill space more efficiently and more common
