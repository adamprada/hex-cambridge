to neighboring atoms in graphite each carbon has three nearest neighbors and so there are two single bonds and one double bond in diamond there are four nearest neighbors situated at the vertices of a tetrahedron and so there is a single bond to each one the two elements right under carbon silicon and germanium in the periodic table also have the diamond structure recall that these elements cannot make double bonds to themselves easily so there is no graphite allotrope for si or ge while diamond is a good insulator both silicon and germanium are semiconductors ie metalloids mechanically
