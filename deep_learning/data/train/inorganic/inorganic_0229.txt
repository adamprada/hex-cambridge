si diamond semiconductor ge diamond semiconductor sn diamond distorted bcc semiconductor metal pb ccp metal the elements c si and ge obey the octet rule and we can easily identify the electron pair bonds in their structures sn and pb on the other hand adopt structures with high coordination numbers they do not have enough valence electrons to make electron pair bonds to each neighbor this is a common feature of metals what happens in this case is that the valence electrons become smeared out or delocalized over all the atoms in the crystal it is best to think of
