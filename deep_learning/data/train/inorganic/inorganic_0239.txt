left because of sp mixing a good animation of the molecular orbitals in the co molecule can be found on the university of liverpool structure and bonding website why dont we get sporbital mixing for o and f the reason has to do with the energies of the orbitals which are not drawn to scale in the simple picture above as we move across the second row of the periodic table from li to f we are progressively adding protons to the nucleus the s orbital which has finite amplitude at the nucleus feels the increased nuclear charge more than
