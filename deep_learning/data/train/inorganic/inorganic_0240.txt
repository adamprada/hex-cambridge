at the left side of the nd period li be b the s and p energies are only a few ev apart the energy difference becomes very large more than electron volts for o and f since single bond energies are typically about ev this energy difference would be very large on the scale of our mo diagrams for all the elements in the nd row of the periodic table the s core orbitals are very low in energy compared to the sp valence orbitals so we dont need to consider them in drawing our mo diagrams no headers topic
