of an accidental leak in his vacuum line noticed the compounds reaction with o to generate a solid with formula ptfo the formula suggested pt in the oxidation state which was clearly unreasonable because ptf was known to be a more powerful oxidizer than either molecular fluorine f or molecular oxygen o bartlett noticed that the xray powder diffraction pattern of the compound was similar to that of csasf a salt with the cscl structure in which octahedral asf ions occupy the chloride ion sites this led bartlett to propose a formulation of optf for his new compound magnetic susceptibility
