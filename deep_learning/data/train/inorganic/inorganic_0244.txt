acid and reacts further with excess ptf the ultimate product of the reaction is formulated xefptf a salt which contains xe in the oxidation state and pt in the oxidation state this was an important discovery because it shattered the dogmatic notion which derived from the octet rule that elements in group viii could not form bonds with other elements the name of this group was changed from the inert gases to the noble gases subsequently many compounds of xe and a few of kr and even ar which is much harder to oxidize were synthesized and characterized no headers
