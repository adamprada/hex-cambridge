a material that material has high conductivity some materials that have high conductivity include copper and aluminum electrical conductivity is the measure of how easily electricity flows through a material conductivity vs resistivity conductivity and resistivity are inversely proportional to each other when conductivity is low resistivity is high when resistivity is low conductivity is high the equation is as follows where resistivity is represented by and is measured in ohmmeters conductivity is represented by and is measured in siemens since conductivity is the measure of how easily electricity flows electrical resistivity measures how much a material resists the flow
