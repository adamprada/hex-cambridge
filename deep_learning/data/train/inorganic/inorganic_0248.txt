equation as you already read œÅ is the symbol for resistivity is the electric field and has units of volts per meter vm j is the current density and has units of amps per meter squared am the electric field is calculated by dividing the voltage by the length l that voltage is applied the current density is calculated by the equation below i is the current and is divided by the cross sectional area a over which the current flows resistivity vs resistance resistivity and resistance are two different things resistivity does not depend on size or shape resistance
