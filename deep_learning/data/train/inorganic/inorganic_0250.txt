nernst equationexample in electrochemical cells or in redox reactions that happen in solution the thermodynamic driving force can be measured as the cell potential chemical reactions are spontaneous in the direction of Î´g which is also the direction in which the cell potential defined as ecathode eanode is positive a cell operating in the spontaneous direction for example a battery that is discharging is called a galvanic cell a cell that is being driven in the nonspontaneous direction is called an electrolytic cell for example let us consider the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to make water thermodynamically this reaction
