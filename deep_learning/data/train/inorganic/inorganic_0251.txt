that is we put in electrical energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules in this case the half reactions and their standard potentials reverse og bubbles form at the anode and hg is formed at the cathode now the anode is the positive electrode and the cathode is negative electrons are extracted from the substance at the anode water and pumped into the solution at the cathode to make hydrogen an animation of the cathode half reaction is shown below in both galvanic and electrolytic cells oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode halfcell
