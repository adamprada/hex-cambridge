according to their standard reduction potentials or more simply their standard potentials as shown in the table below note that when we construct an electrochemical cell and calculate the voltage we simply take the difference between the half cell potentials and do not worry about the number of electrons in the reaction for example for the displacement reaction in which silver ions are reduced by copper metal the reaction is the two halfcell reactions are and the standard potential the reason we dont need to multiply the ag potential by is that eo is a measure of the free energy
