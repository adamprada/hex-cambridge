at atmosphere pressure more generally at any concentration or pressure where or at k where q is the concentration ratio of products over reactants raised to the powers of their coefficients in the reaction this equation in either form is called the nernst equation the second term in the equation when multiplied by nf is rtlnq this is the free energy difference between δg and δg we can think of this as an entropic term that takes into account the positive entropy change of dilution or the negative entropy change of concentrating a reactant or product relative to its standard
