fuel cell hybrid bus the bus runs on electrical energy obtained directly from the ho reaction individual fuel cells are connected in series to make a power train that charges a battery pack and drives an electric motor although the standard potential of the reaction is v because of kinetic overpotentials each fuel cell in the power train operates at a voltage of about v despite this energy loss the fuel cell system is still about twice as efficient as a combustion engine performing the same reaction to solve this problem we need to find the difference between the h
