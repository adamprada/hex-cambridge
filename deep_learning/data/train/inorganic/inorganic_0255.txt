mvph according to the nernst equation this is the consequence of the fact that the number of electrons equals the number of protons in each of the half cell reactions another way to rationalize this result is to remember that the overall reaction h o ho does not involve h as a reactant or product so Î´g and e should be independent of ph we can plot the shift in the hh and oho halfcell potentials with ph on a potentialph diagram also called a pourbaix diagram as shown below the phdependent potentials of the h and o couples are
