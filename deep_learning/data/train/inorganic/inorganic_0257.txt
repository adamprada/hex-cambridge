sce value is v and the agagcl value is v a redox reaction takes place only when redox partners exist and a reactant can be either an oxidant or reductant depending on its reaction partner the relative redox capability can be expressed numerically by introducing the reduction potentials e of imaginary halfreactions table the free energy change of a reaction is related to e where n is the number of transferred electrons and f the faraday constant c mol table standard reduction potentials at c couple e v fg e f aq hoaq h aq e hol ceaq e ceaq
