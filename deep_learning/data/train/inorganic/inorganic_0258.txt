the redox reaction takes place the equation for the actual reaction is complete when the latter equation is subtracted from the former the free energy change of the whole redox reaction is the difference between for the respective halfreactions because halfreactions are not real and they are used in pairs the free energy change of h is set to zero for convenience since the experimental value of is kj equals kj potential corresponding to of a halfreaction is called the standard reduction potential therefore the standard potentials of various halfreactions are determined using similar procedures to that mentioned above table
