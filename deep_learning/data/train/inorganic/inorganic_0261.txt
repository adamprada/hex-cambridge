nuclear chargeb ionization energyc electron affinityd electronegativitye molecular orbitalsconditions of the formation of bonding molecular orbitalsgreat theory and evaluation the bonding and structure of a compound are determined by electronic properties such as the power of constituent atoms to attract or repel electrons the molecular orbitals occupied by valence electrons etc geometrical arrangements of atoms are also influenced by the electronic interactions between nonbonding electrons here some fundamental concepts are described a effective nuclear charge since the positive nuclear charge is generally offset by the negative charge of the internal electrons in the electron shell inside the valence electrons the
