energy which removes the outermost electron is the smallest and the nd and rd ionization energies which further ionize cations increase rapidly the ionization enthalpy which is the standard enthalpy change of the ionization process and is used in thermodynamic calculations is the ionization energy multiplied by rt r is the universal gas constant j k mol and t is temperature kj ev at room temperature the difference between these two parameters is small the st ionization energy varies periodically with atomic number across the periodic table with the lower left cesium cs being the smallest and the upper right
