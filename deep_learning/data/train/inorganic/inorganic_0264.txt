actively seeking new numerical values of electronegativity the pauling scale introduced first in is still the most frequently used and subsequent new numerical values have been justified if they are close to those of pauling l pauling defined electronegativity as the quantitative ionic character of bonds originally the following equation was proposed as a formula to define the ionic character of the bond between atoms a and b where d is the bond energy of a covalent bond however it turned out that is not necessarily positive and pauling modified the definition and redefined it as the ionic character of
