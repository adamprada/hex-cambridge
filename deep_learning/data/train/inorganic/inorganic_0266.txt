to ionize and easy to attract electrons have large values although the electronegativity is defined for the atoms in a valence state in a molecule and has the dimensions of energy it is treated as a dimensionless number table figure mulliken electronegativity although the definition of mulliken is intelligible since it is directly related to atomic orbitals generally the values of pauling or allredrochow are used as these values are not much different the pauling electronegativity is appropriate when choosing only one electronegativity values change not only by definition but are also considerably affected by the bonding state of atoms
