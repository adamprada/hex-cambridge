since the probability of finding electrons in a molecular orbital is proportional to the square of a wave function the electron map looks like a wave function a wave function has domains of positive and negative amplitude called lobes the overlapping positive lobes or negative lobes of the wave functions of atoms in a molecule amplify each other to form a bond but the positive and negative lobes cancel each other forming no bond the extent of this interference effect corresponds to the magnitude of the overlap integral in quantum chemistry in the formation of a molecule atomic orbitals overlap
