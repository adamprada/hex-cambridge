the energy levels of atomic orbitals are close the simplest case where a molecular orbital is constructed from atomic orbitals a and b is explained here a bonding molecular orbital is formed between a and b if the above mentioned conditions and are satisfied but if the sign of one of the atomic orbitals is reversed condition is not satisfied and an antibonding molecular orbital in which the signs of the overlapping lobes are different figure results the energy level of a bonding orbital is lower and the level of an antibonding orbital is higher than those of the constituent
