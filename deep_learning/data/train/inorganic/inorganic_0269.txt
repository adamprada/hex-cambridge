degenerate orbital e and triply degenerate orbital t the symbol g gerade is attached as a suffix to the centrosymmetric orbital and u ungerade to the orbital which changes sign under inversion around an inversion center the number before the symmetry symbol is used in order of energy to distinguish orbitals of the same degeneracy additionally they are named sigma or pi orbitals according to the orbital character a sigma orbital has rotation symmetry around the bond axis and a pi orbital has a nodal plane therefore sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of ss pp sd pd and
