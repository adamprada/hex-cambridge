the lumo are empty in a hydrogen molecule h the overlap of the s orbital of each hydrogen atom forms a bonding orbital if the lobes have equal sign and an antibonding orbital if they have opposite signs and two electrons occupy the bonding orbital figure figure the molecular orbitals of h the arrows indicate the electron spins in the twoatom molecules of the nd period from lithium li to fluorine f if the z axis is set as a bond axis and are formed by the overlap of s orbital of each atom and and from pz orbitals and
