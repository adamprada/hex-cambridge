and hence an oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons figure molecular orbitals of n figure molecular orbitals of o the molecular orbitals of two different atoms are formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals with different energy levels the energy level of the orbital of the atom with larger electronegativity generally is lower and the molecular orbitals are more characteristic of the atomic orbital with the nearer energy level therefore the bonding orbitals have the character of the atom with the larger electronegativity and the antibonding orbitals that of the atom with the smaller electronegativity for example five molecular orbitals
