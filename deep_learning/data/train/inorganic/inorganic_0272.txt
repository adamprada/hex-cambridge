resulting in both sigma and pi bonds and a triple bond is formed between the atoms although molecular orbitals in this case are qualitatively the same as those of the isolectronic nitrogen molecule n and electrons occupy the orbital up to the energy level of each orbital differs from that of the nitrogen molecule the bonding orbital has the s character of oxygen because of its larger electronegativity and the bonding orbital also has the p character of oxygen the antibonding and orbitals have the p character of carbon figure figure molecular orbitals of co the bond order between atoms
