the orbital lt can be any integer between and including and each orbital has planar nodes some examples of orbitals with different is an s orbital with no planar nodes gives a p orbital which has one planar node ml magnetic quantum number tells you about the angular momentum projected on to the z axis it tells you of the orientation of the orbital it can be any integer between and has different but degenerate possible values or ms spin projection quantum number tells you about the spin of the electron an electron is a fermion a type of quantum
