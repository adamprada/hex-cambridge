planar complexestetrahedral complexesjahnteller effect it is necessary to learn a few concepts to understand the structure spectrum magnetism and reactivity of complexes which depend on d electron configurations in particular the theory of electronic structure is important ligand field theory ligand field theory is one of the most useful theories to account for the electronic structure of complexes it originated in the application of the crystal field theory of ionic crystals to metal complex systems six coordinate octahedral complexes the five d orbitals of transition metal cations are degenerate and have equal energy figure change of electronic energy upon complex
