called the ligand field negative charge in the case of anionic ligands or a negative end lone pair in the case of neutral ligands exert a repulsive force on the metal d orbitals which is anisotropic depending on the direction of the orbitals the position of the metal cation is taken as the origin and cartesian coordinates are constructed figure then dxy and dz orbitals are aligned along the directions of the axes and the dxy dyz and dxz orbitals are directed between the axes if ligands are placed on the axes the repulsive interaction is larger for the eg
