of the eg orbitals is dq and that of the tg orbitals dq figure ligand field splitting in tetrahedral and octahedral complexes transition metal ions have to d electrons and when the split d orbitals are filled from a lower energy level the electron configuration tgxegy corresponding to each ion is obtained with the zero energy level chosen as the average energy level the energy of the electron configuration relative to zero energy becomes this value is called the ligand field stabilization energy the electron configuration with smaller value taking the minus sign into consideration is more stable lfse is
