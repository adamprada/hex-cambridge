tg or tg two possibilities arise when the fourth electron occupies either of the tg or eg orbitals the lower energy orbital tg is favorable but occupation of the same orbital gives rise to pairing energy p the total energy becomes if the fourth electron occupies the energetically unfavorable eg orbital the total energy becomes the choice of the electron configuration depends on which of the above values is larger therefore if p tg is favoured and this is called the strong field case or the low spin electron configuration if p tgeg is favoured and this is called the
