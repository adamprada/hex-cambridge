complexes it is easier to understand the electronic energy levels of the d orbitals in square planar complexes by starting from those for hexacoordinate octahedral complexes placing the six ligands along the cartesian axes the two ligands on the z axis are gradually removed from the central metal and finally only four ligands are left on the xy plane the interaction of the two z coordinate ligands with the dz dxz and dyz orbitals becomes smaller and the energy levels of these ligands lower on the other hand the remaining four ligands approach the metal and the dxy and dxy
