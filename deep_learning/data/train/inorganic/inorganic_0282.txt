all examples of coordination complexes figure when a metal is placed on the origin of the cartesian axes as in the octahedral complexes e orbitals dxy dz are distant from ligands and t orbitals dxy dyz dxz are nearer ligands consequently the electronic repulsion is larger for the t orbitals which are destabilized relative to the e orbitals the ligand field exerted by four ligands splits the fivefold degenerate orbitals of the central metal into twofold degenerate e and threefold degenerate t sets figure the t set has energy of and the e set with a ligand field splitting of
