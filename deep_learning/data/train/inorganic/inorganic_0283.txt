when orbitals of a highly symmetrical nonlinear polyatomic molecule are degenerate the degeneracy is resolved by distorting the molecular framework to attain lower symmetry and thus lower energy this is the jahnteller effect and a typical example is seen in the tetragonal distortion of an octahedral coordination structure of hexacoordinate cu complexes figure jahnteller splitting in a cu ion figure the relation between the metal and ligand orbitals during formation of bonds they have a d configurations and the eg orbitals in the octahedral structure are occupied by three electrons if the eg orbitals split and two electrons occupy the
