an atomic orbital is expressed by the combination of n and l for example n is and l is for a d orbital there are l m values namely l l l l consequently there are one s orbital three p orbitals five d orbitals and seven f orbitals the three aforementioned quantum numbers are used to express the distribution of the electrons in hydrogentype atom and another quantum number ms which describes the direction of an electron spin is necessary to completely describe an electronic state therefore an electronic state is defined by four quantum numbers n l m
