of electrons that are allowed to occupy an orbital must be limited to one or two and for the latter case their spins must be antiparallel different direction hunds rule when there are equalenergy orbitals electrons occupy separate orbitals nd their spins are parallel same direction the order of orbital energy of a neutral atom is and the electron configuration is determined as electrons occupy orbitals in this order according to the pauli principle and hunds rule an s orbital with one m can accommodate electrons a p orbital with three m electrons and a d orbital with five m
