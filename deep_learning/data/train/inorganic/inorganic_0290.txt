crystal structures of ionic compounds lets start by looking at the forces that hold ionic lattices together there are mainly two kinds of force that determine the energy of an ionic bond the nacl crystal structure is the archetype for calculating lattice energies and computing enthalpies of formation from bornhaber cycles electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion coulombs law two ions with charges z and z separated by a distance r experience a force f where e c π ε c²j m this force is attractive for ions of opposite charge the electrostatic potential energy eelec is then given by
