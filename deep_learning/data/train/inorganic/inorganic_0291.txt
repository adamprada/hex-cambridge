approximation b is a constant and ρ is a number with units of length which is usually empirically determined from compressibility data a typical value of ρ is å the energy of the ionic bond between two atoms is then calculated as the combination of net electrostatic and the closedshell repulsion energies as shown in the figure at the right note that for the moment we are ignoring the attractive van der waals energy between ions which we will explain below for a pair of ions the equilibrium distance between ions is determined by the minimum in the total energy
