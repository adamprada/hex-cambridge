the right we can see that the nearest neighbor interactions with ions labeled are attractive the next nearest neighbor interactions and are repulsive and so on in the nacl structure counting from the ion in the center of the unit cell there are nearest neighbors on the faces of the cube next nearest neighbors on the edges of the cube in the next shell at the vertices of the cube and so on their distances from ion increase progressively ro ro ro and so on where ro is the nearest neighbor distance we can now write the electrostatic energy at
