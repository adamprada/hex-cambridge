same madelung constant because they both have the nacl structure the madelung constant is calculated by summing up electrostatic interactions with ion labeled in the expanding spheres method each number designates the order in which it is summed for example ions labeled represent the six nearest neighbors attractive interaction ions labeled are the next nearest neighbors repulsive interaction and so on note that if the sum is carried out over shells it converges very slowly but there are mathematical methods for summing it which give a rapidly converging series the table below lists madelung constants for some common structures the
