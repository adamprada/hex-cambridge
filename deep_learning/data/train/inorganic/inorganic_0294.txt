the wurtzite structure is favored by more polar compounds structure madelung constant a reduced madelung constant an nacl halite cscl zns zincblende zns wurtzite caf fluorite tio rutile alo corundum total lattice energy of a crystal having in hand a formula for the electrostatic energy we can now add in the closedshell repulsion term to obtain an equation that gives us the total lattice energy at the equilibrium bond distance the forces on all the ions are zero and we can use this fact to eliminate the constant b expressed this way el is a negative number because z and
