a spinonly moment s of the spin moments of neigboring atoms can align in parallel antiparallel or random fashion in bcc fe the tendency is to align parallel because of the positive sign of the exchange interaction this results in ferromagnetic ordering in which all the spins within a magnetic domain typically hundreds of unit cells in width have the same orientation as shown in the figure at the right conversely a negative exchange interaction between neighboring atoms in bcc cr results in antiferromagnetic ordering a third arrangement ferrimagnetic ordering results from an antiparallel alignment of spins on neighboring atoms
