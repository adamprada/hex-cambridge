these kinds of magnetic ordering primarily among the d and f elements and their alloys and compounds for example fe co ni ndfeb smco and yco are all ferromagnets cr and mno are antiferromagnets and feo and cofeo are ferrimagnets diamagnetic compounds have a weak negative susceptibility χ definitions h applied magnetic field units henry h b induced magnetic field in a material units tesla t m magnetization which represents the magnetic moments within a material in the presence of an external field h magnetic susceptibility χ mh usually χ is given in molar units in the cgs system χm
