on µeff the effective magnetic moment of the molecule or ion which in turn depends on its number of unpaired electrons curie law behavior of a paramagnet a plot of χ vs absolute temperature is a straight line with a slope of c and an intercept of zero here µb is the bohr magneton a physical constant defined as µb ehπme x erggauss in cgs units in cgs units we can combine physical constants combining these equations we obtain these equations relate the molar susceptibility a bulk quantity that can be measured with a magnetometer to µeff a quantity that
