compare it to the calculation of Âµeff since n we calculate the plot at the right shows the number of unpaired electrons per atom calculated from measured curie constants for the magnetic elements and alloys in the d series the plot peaks at a value of spins per atom slightly lower than we calculated for an isolated iron atom this reflects that fact that there is some pairing of delectrons ie that they do contribute somewhat to bonding in this part of the periodic table susceptibility of ferro ferri and antiferromagnets below a certain critical temperature the spins of a
