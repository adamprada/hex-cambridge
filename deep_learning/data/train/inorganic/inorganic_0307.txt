electrons peaks between fe and co as the dband is filled and the exchange interaction is stronger for co than for fe in contrast to ferromagnetic metals and alloys paramagnetic salts of transition metal ions typically have critical temperatures below k because the magnetic ions are not directly bonded to each other and thus their spins are very weakly coupled in the solid state for example in gadolinium sulfate the paramagnetic gd ions are isolated from each other by so ions magnetic susceptibility vs temperature kelvin for ferrimagnetic ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials above the critical temperature tc ferromagnetic compounds become
