for ferromagnets ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets antiferromagnetic solids are also paramagnetic above a critical temperature which is called the néel temperature tn for antiferromagnets χ reaches a maximum at tn and is smaller at higher temperature where the paramagnetic spins are further disordered by thermal energy and at lower temperature where the spins pair up typically antiferromagnets retain some positive susceptibility even at very low temperature because of canting of their paired spins however the maximum value of χ is much lower for an antiferromagnet than it is for a ferro or ferrimagnet the curieweiss law is also modified for an
