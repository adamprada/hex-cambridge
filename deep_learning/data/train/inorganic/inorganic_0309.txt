the opposite way in order to minimize the total energy of the system this is illustrated in the figure at the left for a ndfeb magnet the sample consists of Âµm wide crystal grains that can be easily distinguished by the sharp boundaries in the image within each grain are a series of lighter and darker stripes imaged by using the optical kerr effect that are ferromagnetic domains with opposite orientations averaged over the whole sample these domains have random orientation so the net magnetization is zero microcrystalline grains within a piece of ndfeb the alloy used in neodymium magnets
