relatively low energy process the movement of domain walls in a grain of silicon steel is driven in this movie by increasing the external magnetic field in the downward direction and is imaged using a kerr microscope white areas are domains with their magnetization directed up dark areas which eventually comprise the entire grain are domains with their magnetization directed down the process of magnetization moves the solid away from its lowest energy state random domain orientation so magnetization involves input of energy when the external magnetic field is removed the domain walls relax somewhat but the solid especially in
