ferro or ferrimagnetic material in a magnetic field results in hysteresis in the magnetization of the material as shown in the figure at the left at the beginning the magnetization is zero but it begins to rise rapidly as the magnetic field is applied at high field the magnetic domains are aligned and the magnetization is said to be saturated when the field is removed a certain remanent magnetization indicated as the point br on the graph is retained ie the material is magnetized applying a field in the opposite direction begins to orient the magnetic domains in the other
