this work is turned into heat magnetization of a ferro or ferrimagnet vs applied magnetic field h starting at the origin the upward curve is the initial magnetization curve the downward curve after saturation along with the lower return curve form the main loop the intercepts hc and br are the coercivity and remanent magnetization no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to develop the next generation of openaccess texts to improve postsecondary education at all levels of higher learning the libretexts approach
