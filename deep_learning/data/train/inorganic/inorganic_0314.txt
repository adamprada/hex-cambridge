where an atom or ion occupies a normally vacant site other than its own as a result the atom or ion leaves its own lattice site vacant the frenkel defect in a molecule the frenkel defect explains a defect in the molecule where an atom or ion normally the cation leaves its own lattice site vacant and instead occupies a normally vacant site figure the cation leaves its own lattice site open and places itself between the area of all the other cations and anions this defect is only possible if the cations are smaller in size when compared to
