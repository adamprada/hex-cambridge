and moisture it releases molecular h when heated above c this reactivity is remarkable considering the strength of the hh bond kjmol absorption and release of hydrogen from flp the discovery that some flps can split h triggered the rapid growth of research into flps because of their unquenched reactivity such systems are reactive toward substrates that can undergo heterolysis for example many flps split the hydrogen molecule this reactivity suggested that flps can be useful for hydrogenation reactions a sizable range of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic reactions have now been developed using flps mixtures of sterically hindered lewis acids
