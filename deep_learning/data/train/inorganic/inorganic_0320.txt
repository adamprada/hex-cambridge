bonded by electrostatic interactions the bond distance is the sum of ionic radii assigned to the cation and anion the standard ionic radius of one species is fixed first and is then subtracted from the distance between ions to decide the radius of the partner ion as the standard the radius of o ion in a number of oxides is set to pm pm m r d shannon cationic radii in oxides are the difference between the bond distance and pm after cation radii in oxides are decided other anion radii can be calculated by subtraction of the cation radii
