c slater we must also be mindful that the cationanion distances of the same ion pair become larger as the coordination number of opposite ions increases therefore in any discussion of the structural features of ionic compounds from a viewpoint of ionic radii a set of the ionic radii calculated using the same standard radius for the compounds with the same coordination number should be used exercise which ionic radius is larger cs or f answer cs pm f pm the anion radius is not always larger the metal and covalent radii also called the atomic radii become smaller in
