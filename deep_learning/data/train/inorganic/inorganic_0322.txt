the elements following lanthanides are very similar to those of the d elements lattice enthalpy although the stability of a crystal at constant temperature and pressure depends on the gibbs free energy change of the crystals formation from its constituent ions the stability of a crystal is determined mostly by the enthalpy change alone since the lattice formation is very exothermic and the entropy term is negligibly small refer to section lattice enthalpy is defined as the standard enthalpy change of the reaction in which an ionic crystal decomposes into gaseous ions s is solid g is gas and l
