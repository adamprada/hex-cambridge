ions in an ionic crystal consisting of ions a and b should be the sum of the individual coulomb potential energies vab since the locations of the ions in the crystal lattice are decided by the structure type the total coulomb potential between all ions is calculated by setting the distance between the ions to d a is the madelung constant that is characteristic of each crystal type table na is avogadros constant and za and zb are the electric charges of the cation and anion the electrostatic interaction between contiguous ions is the strongest and the madelung constant generally
