is the main origin of this force it is an attractive interaction between electric dipoles which is inversely proportional to the th power of the distance d between ions the van der waals force is very small the value of the constant c is a function of each compound since it is at most of the coulombic force it may be safely neglected in the calculation of lattice enthalpy d structure of metal crystals if we imagine metal atoms as being hard balls when densely packed in two dimensions each ball will be in contact with six other balls a
