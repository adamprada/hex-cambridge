each ball is surrounded by balls that is it is coordinated the coordination polyhedron of hcp is anticubooctahedron figure hexagonally closepacked hcp of balls figure cubic closepacked ccp of balls and that of ccp is cubooctahedron when the lattice is sliced in different planes the unit lattice of ccp appears to be a facecentered cubic lattice fcc containing a ball at each cubical apex and on the center of each face figure the unit lattice of hcp is a rhombohedral prism in which two balls are located in the positions shown in figure there are several different modes of piling
