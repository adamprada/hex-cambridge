than the first eight balls however because of the smaller ratio of space occupation bcc appears relatively rarely and pure metals tend to adopt hcp or ccp in both hcp and ccp the cavities among the balls are either the oh holes enclosed octahedrally by six balls or the td holes enclosed tetrahedrally by four balls figure oh and td are the symmetry symbols used in group theory in ionic solids if the anions are in hcp or ccp arrangements cations enter into either of these cavities figure octahedral and tetrahedral holes ionic crystal in ionic crystals such as metal
