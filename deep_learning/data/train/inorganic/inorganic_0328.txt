number of ions in a unit lattice is calculated by summing up the ions shown in figure since there is one ion inside the lattice the ions on the faces of the lattice are shared by on the edges by and on the corners by lattices a net of cl ions belonging to the unit lattice of nacl is obtained by multiplying the numbers of ions inside the lattice by on the faces by on the edges by and on the corners by the number of na ions in the unit lattice is also and the ratio of cl and
