formula cscl figure cesium chloride structure zinc blende structure zinc blende has the composition zns and its unit lattice is shown in figure s anions are arranged in ccp and zn cations occupy half of the tetrahedral holes td holes in this arrangement each cation is coordinated by four anions and each anion by four cations hence this is a structure there are both four zn and s ions belonging to this unit lattice and the atomic ratio coincides with the formula of zns figure zinc blende structure fluorite structure the composition of fluorite is caf since the number of
