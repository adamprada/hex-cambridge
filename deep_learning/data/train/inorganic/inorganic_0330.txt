generally the total coulombic potential energy ec of the univalent ionic compound mx is expressed by the following formula na is the avogadro constant a the madelung constant and r the distance between ions according to this formula a structure with a larger a r ratio is more stable the madelung constant of an mx compound increases with increasing coordination number on the other hand it is advantageous to lower the coordination number and to reduce r in the case of small m rendering contact between m and x more difficult in an ionic crystal the ratio of rm and
