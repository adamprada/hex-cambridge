of each polyhedron to an apex is fracsqrt rx therefore the ratios of the cationic and anionic radii rm rx are fracsqrt rx rxrx sqrt for cscl fracsqrt rx rxrx sqrt for nacl and fracfracsqrt rx rxrx fracsqrt for zns structures figure it has been explained that the coordination number decreases when these radius ratios are smaller than the given values since cations and anions do not come into contact with each other causing instability on the other hand the coordination number increases for larger cations increasing the radius ratio however the relation between a coordination number and a radius
