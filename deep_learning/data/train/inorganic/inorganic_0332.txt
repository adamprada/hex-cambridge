of its structure in the case of complicated inorganic compounds drawing bond lines between atoms as in most organic compounds causes confusion the anions in many metal oxides sulfides or halides form tetrahedra or octahedra around the central metal cations although there is no bond between anions the structures are greatly simplified if they are illustrated by the anion polyhedra sharing apexes edges or faces in such illustrations cationic metal atoms are usually omitted as has been mentioned ionic solid structures can be thought of as a close packed arrays of anions figures and illustrate these three representations for molecular
