to the differing orbitals and hybridization the ground state electron configuration sheds light on many different atomic properties fundamentally understanding electron configuration leads to an understanding of the periodic table introduction in niels bohr proposed that electrons could orbit an atom at a certain distance without collapsing into the atom and that each orbit distance had its own energy level he proposed that each orbitals angular momentum m was equal to a multiple n of planks constant h divided by π this gives the equation m nħ where ħ hπ and n this model proposed the bohr atom which shows
