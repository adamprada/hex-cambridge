a positive integer and it represents the energy of the orbital the angular momentum quantum number l is from to n the l values of and correspond to the s p d and f orbitals respectively the magnetic quantum number ml ranges from l to l this quantum number dictates the orbital orientation such as px py or pz the quantum spin number ms is either or and it dictates the electron spin aufbau principle the aufbau principle states that electrons must fill lowest energy shells first following the model electrons fill the s orbital with two electrons then the
