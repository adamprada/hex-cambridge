sd because there is extra stability gained from the halffilled d orbital hunds rule hunds rule states that when filled sublevels other than s orbital electrons must not be spin paired in the orbitals until each orbital contains one electron and no orbital can have two electrons with the same spin ms pauli exclusion principle pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same quantum numbers an orbital can only hold or electrons they must have opposite spins if there are electrons in the orbittal periodic trend valence electron shells in the periodic table follow a trend
