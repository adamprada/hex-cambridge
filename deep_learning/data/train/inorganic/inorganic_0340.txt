is very low and mono cations of alkali metals form easily qualitative analysis of alkali metals is possible by means of flame reactions using characteristic luminescence lines especially the orange dline of sodium is used in the sodium lamp alkali metals are oxidized by water evolving hydrogen gas due to their low reduction potentials except lithium the heavier alkali metals react violently with water and sufficient caution should be exercised in their handling exercise describe the reactivity of alkali metals in water answer the reactivity of lithium is the lowest sodium reacts violently and potassium rubidium and cesium react explosively
