easily handled alkali metals dissolve readily in liquid ammonia and dilute solutions are blue but concentrated ones show a bronze color the metal is recovered when ammonia is evaporated from metal solutions alkali metal solutions show the same color irrespective of the kind of alkali metals as the color is due to the solvated electrons namely the dissolution is accompanied by the separation of the alkali metal atoms into metal cations and electrons solvated by ammonia according to the following equation the liquid ammonia solution of an alkali metal is conductive and paramagnetic the highly reducing solution is used for
