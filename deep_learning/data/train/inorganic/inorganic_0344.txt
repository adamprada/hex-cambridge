molecules it is also the most reactive nonmetallic element since water is oxidized by f at much lower electrode potential v fluorine gas cannot be manufactured by the electrolysis of aqueous solutions of fluorine compounds therefore it was a long time before elemental fluorine was isolated and f f h moisson finally succeeded in isolating it by the electrolysis of kf in liquid hf fluorine is still manufactured by this reaction chlorine which is especially important in inorganic industrial chemistry is manufactured together with sodium hydroxide the basic reaction for the production of chlorine is electrolysis of an aqueous solution
