br with chlorine gas in saline water iodine is similarly produced by passing chlorine gas through saline water containing i ions since natural gas is found in japan together with underground saline water containing i japan is one of the main countries producing iodine anomalies of fluorine molecular fluorine compounds have very low boiling points this is due to the difficulty of polarization as a result of the electrons being strongly drawn to the nuclei of fluorine atoms since the electronegativity of fluorine is highest and electrons shift to f resulting in the high acidity of atoms bonded to f
