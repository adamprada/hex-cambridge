usual halogen molecules mixed halogen and polyhalogen molecules such as brcl ibr icl clf brfif etc also exist polyhalogen anions and cations such as i i i and i are also known b oxygen compounds although many binary oxides of halogens consisting only of halogen and oxygen are known most are unstable oxygen difluoride of is the most stable such compound this is a very powerful fluorinating agent and can generate plutonium hexafluoride puf from plutonium metal while oxygen chloride clo is used for bleaching pulp and water treatment it is generated in situ from clo since it is unstable
