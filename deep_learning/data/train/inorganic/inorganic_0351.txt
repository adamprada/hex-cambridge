it should be noted that the anhydrous transition metal halides are usually solid compounds and hydrates are coordination compounds with water ligands as the dimensionality of structures is one of the most interesting facets of structural or synthetic chemistry typical halides are described in order of their dimensionality table typical chlorides and fluorides of transition metals oxidation number sccl ycl lacl zrcl hfcl cucl agcl aucl ticl vcl crcl mocl wcl mncl fecl rucl cocl nicl pdcl pdcl cucl scf ycl laf ticl zrcl vcl crcl mocl wcl recl fecl rucl oscl cof rhcl ircl aucl ticl zrcl hfcl vcl
