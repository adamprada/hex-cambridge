in water answer it is because water reacts with halides breaking the halogen bridges in the solid structures and coordinates to the resultant molecular complexes solid state hydrogen and fluorineability to use the sphere model of crystalline structure for h and f solidsreferencesoutside linksproblemscontributors hydrogen and fluorine as well as chlorine bromine and iodine exist as diatomic molecules both diatomic hydrogen and diatomic florine exist as gasses at room temperature and exhibit extremely low melting and boiling points if the temperature of the system is lowered below the respective melting points of hydrogen or fluorine molecular motion is reduced and
