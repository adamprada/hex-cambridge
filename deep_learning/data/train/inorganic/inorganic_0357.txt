to use the sphere model of crystalline structure for h and f solids when solid both dihydrogen and difluorine are small enough to allow for rotation within the solid structure the radius of fluorine is about equivalent to that of hydrogen this rotation occurs about a central axis midway between the two distal atoms of the molecule creating two equal radii from the middle of the hh or ff bond to the outer boundary of each h or f atom this rotation occurs in the x y and z directions of the central axis as well as all manner of
