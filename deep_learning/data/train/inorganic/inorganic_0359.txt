have a low charge to radius ratio with low oxidation states they are normally larger ions that are polarizable for example i and s are soft bases and low charge density transition metals such as ag are considered soft acids soft acids often include transition metals in the second and third row of the periodic table that have a or charge as well as late transition metals especially those in the d and d series with filled or almost completely filled d orbitals acids and bases are not strictly hard or soft with many ions and compounds being classified as
