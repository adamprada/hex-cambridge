the rows below hardsoft trends for acids hardsoft trends for bases like binds with like hard acids interact more strongly with hard bases than they do with soft bases and soft acids interact more strongly with soft bases than hard bases thus the most stable complexes are those with hardhard and softsoft interactions this tendency is illustrated in the table below which shows the trend in formation constants for hard and soft acids hard acids bind halides in the order f cl br i whereas soft acids follow the opposite trend log k fluoride chloride bromide iodide acid classification fe
