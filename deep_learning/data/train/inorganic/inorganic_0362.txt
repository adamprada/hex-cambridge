the magnetic domains this property is characterized by hc the coercivity hard magnets have a high coercivity hc and thus retain their magnetization in the absence of an applied field whereas soft magnets have low values the figure at the right compares hysteresis loops for hard and soft magnets recall that the energy dissipated in magnetizing and demagnetizing the material is proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop we can see that soft magnets while they can achieve a high value of bsat dissipate relatively little energy in the loop this makes soft magnets preferable for use in transformer
