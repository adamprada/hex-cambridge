when the magnetic domains are pinned a stronger coercive magnetic field needs to be applied to cause them to realign when iron is annealed the crystal grains grow and the magnetic domains become more free to align with applied magnetic fields this decreases the coercive field and the material becomes a soft magnet hysteresis loops comparing a hard magnet ironsilicon steel to a soft magnet permalloy on the same scale hc for permallloy is oe about times lower than that of the hard magnet the remanent magnetizations of the two materials are comparable hard magnets such as cro Î³feo and
