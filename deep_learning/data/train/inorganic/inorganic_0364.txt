marked hard and soft acids and bases pearsons hsab hard and soft acids and bases pearsons hsab this theory proposes that soft acids react faster and form stronger bonds with soft bases whereas hard acids react faster and form stronger bonds with hard bases all other factors being equal the classification in the original work was largely based on equilibrium constants for the reaction of two lewis bases competing for a lewis acid hard acids and hard bases tend to have the following characteristics small atomicionic radius high oxidation state low polarizability high electronegativity bases examples of hard acids are
