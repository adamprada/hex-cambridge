each other is mainly covalent in nature hsab acids and bases this provides a qualitative approach to looking at the reactions of metal ions with various ligands since from the diagram above it is expected that whereas aliii and tiiii would prefer to react with ospecies over sspecies the reverse would be predicted for hgii carbon dioxidecontributors and attributions in a modern ab initio electronic structure calculation on a closed shell molecule the electronic hamiltonian is used with a single determinant wavefunction this wavefunction is constructed from molecular orbitals that are written as linear combinations of contracted gaussian basis functions
