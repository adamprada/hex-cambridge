to add the internuclear repulsion to the electronic energy calculated by this procedure the total energy of the molecule can be calculated for different geometries ie bond lengths and angles to find the minimum energy configuration also the total energies of possible transition states can be calculated to find the lowest energy pathway to products in chemical reactions exercise for a molecule with three nuclei show that the sums in equation correctly include all the pairwise potential energy terms without including any twice as we improve the basis set used in calculations by adding more and better functions we expect
