all the essential features of this function restricted vs unrestricted hartreefock you may encounter the terms restricted and unrestricted hartreefock the above discussion pertains to a restricted hf calculation in a restricted hf calculation electrons with spin are restricted or constrained to occupy the same spatial orbitals as electrons with spin this constraint is removed in an unrestricted calculation for example the spin orbital for electron could be and the spin orbital for electron in a molecule could be where both the spatial molecular orbital and the spin function differ for the two electrons such spin orbitals are called unrestricted
