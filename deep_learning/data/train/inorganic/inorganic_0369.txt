the solution of this problem gives the following equations for the molecular orbitals only the largest terms have been retained here these functions are listed and discussed in order of increasing energy the says this is the first orbital the says it is symmetric with respect to reflection in the plane of the molecule the large coefficient means this is essentially the s atomic orbital of oxygen the oxygen s orbital should have a lower energy than that of carbon because the positive charge on the oxygen nucleus is greater this orbital is essentially the s atomic orbital of carbon
