directly without the Ã  priori introduction of hybridization in other words hybridization just falls out of the calculation the hybridization in this bonding lcao increases the amplitude of the function in the region of space between the two atoms and decreases it in the region of space outside of the bonding region of the atoms this molecular orbital also can be thought of as being a hybrid formed from atomic orbitals the hybridization of oxygen atomic orbitals because of the negative coefficient with so decreases the electron density between the nuclei and enhances electron density on the side of oxygen
