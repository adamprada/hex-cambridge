called antibonding electrons this orbital is the antibonding partner to the orbital these two orbitals are degenerate and correspond to bonding orbitals made up from the px and py atomic orbitals from each atom these orbitals are degenerate because the x and y directions are equivalent in this molecule tells us that these orbitals are antisymmetric with respect to reflection in a plane containing the nuclei this orbital is the sp hybrid of the carbon atomic orbitals the negative coefficient for pc puts the largest amplitude on the side of carbon away from oxygen there is no node between the
