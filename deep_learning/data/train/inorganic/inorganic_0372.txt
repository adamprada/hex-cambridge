donation when we might naively expect o to be more electronrich and capable of donating electrons to iron exercise summarize how quantum mechanics is used to describe bonding and the electronic structure of molecules exercise construct an energy level diagram for co that shows both the atomic orbitals and the molecular orbitals show which atomic orbitals contribute to each molecular orbital by drawing lines to connect the mos to the aos label the molecular orbitals in a way that reveals their symmetry use this energy level diagram to explain why it is the carbon end of the molecule that binds
