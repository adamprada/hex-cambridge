be found in exhaust of vehicles and burning nitrogencontainig plastics introduction the valence bond theory can be explained by overlapping of atomic orbitals which electrons are localized in the reigion to form chemical bonds however when you utilize this approach to explain chemical structure of the molecule you must aware that there are various atomic orbitals for bonding which will significantly influence the structure of the molecule definition of valence bond theory the valence bond thoery simply explains the bond formation just like lewis dot structure but instead it explains the bonding in terms of covalent bond by quantum mechanics
