also because known atomic geometry can not be able to have effective overlap atomic orbitals combine with each other and reconfigure themselves into a different configuration this process is called hybrdization this formation of new hybrid orbital is possible by combining several types of orbitals spd and etc describe hcn molecular bond by using valence bond theory in hcn molecule the c atom includes sphybridized orbital since it will combine with only two other atoms to form hcn one of the sphybrid orbitals of carbon atom overlaps with the s orbital of h atom while the other sphybrid orabital mixes
