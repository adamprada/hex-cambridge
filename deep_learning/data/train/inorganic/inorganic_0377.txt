geometries and each individual complex will have unique properties based on its substituents and their arrangement spatially though there is no set number of ligands ions or bound atoms required for a species to be considered highly coordinated versus general coordination when the coordination number exceeds seven it is generally considered a high coordination number high coordination numbers are of particular interest in solution phase and inorganic chemistry introduction the coordination number of a specified atom in a chemical species is the number of other atoms directly linked to that specified atom coordination itself is the formation of a covalent
