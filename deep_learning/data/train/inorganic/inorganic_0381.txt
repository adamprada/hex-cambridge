center electron πbonding our mo treatment of ozone is entirely analogous to the electron h anion we map that solution onto this one as follows the nonbonding πorbital has a node at the central o atom this means that the nonbonding electron pair in the πsystem is shared by the two terminal o atoms ie that the formal charge is shared by those atoms this is consistent with the octet resonance structure of ozone this trick of mapping the solution for a set of sorbitals onto a πbonding problem is a simple example of a broader principle called the isolobal
