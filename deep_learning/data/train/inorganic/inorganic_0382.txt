atom has valence orbitals s px py pz making a total of frontier orbitals and the i anion has electrons we can simplify the problem by recalling two periodic trends the sp orbital splitting is large relative to the bond energy after the second row of the periodic table thus the s orbital is low in energy and too contracted to make bonds with its neighbors Ï€overlap of p orbitals is very weak so the px and py orbitals will also be nonbonding this leaves only the three pz orbitals to make bondingnonbondingantibonding combinations again the problem is entirely analogous
