of four hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms experimentally we know that the hch and hcc angles in ethylene are approximately this angle suggests that the carbon atoms are sp hybridized which means that a singly occupied sp orbital on one carbon overlaps with a singly occupied s orbital on each h and a singly occupied sp lobe on the other c thus each carbon forms a set of three bonds two ch sp s and one cc sp sp part a of figure figure a the Ïƒbonded framework is formed by the overlap of two sets of singly occupied
