can be separated into two independent frameworks the bonding framework and the the bonding framework the wavefunctions used to describe the bonding orbitals in each framework results from different combinations of atomic orbitals the method limits itself to addressing conjugated hydrocarbons and specifically only electron molecular orbitals are included because these determine the general properties of these molecules the sigma electrons are ignored this is referred to as sigmapi separability and is justified by the orthogonality of and orbitals in planar molecules for this reason the hückel method is limited to planar systems hückel approximation assumes that the electrons in
