in ethylene involves the hybridization of the and atomic orbitals on each carbon atom leaving the orbitals untouched figure figure hybridizing of the carbon atomic orbitals to give hybrid orbitals for bonding to hydrogen atoms in ethylene cc bync Ã¼mit kaya the use of hybrid orbitals in the molecular orbital approach describe here is merely a convenience and not invoking valence bond theory directly an identical description can be extracted using exclusively atomic orbitals on carbon but the interpretation of the resulting wavefunctions is less intuitive for example the ith molecular orbital can be described via hybrid orbitals or via
