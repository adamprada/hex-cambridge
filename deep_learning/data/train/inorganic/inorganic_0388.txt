bonding framework figure molecular orbitals demonstrating the sigmapi separability of the bonding framework blue and the bonding frameworks red of ethylene cc bync ümit kaya hückel treatment is concerned only with describing the molecular orbitals and energies of the bonding framework since hückel theory is a special consideration of molecular orbital theory the molecular orbitals can be described as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals at carbon with their corresponding coefficients this equation is substituted in the schrödinger equation with the hamiltonian and the energy corresponding to the molecular orbital to give if equation is multiplied by and integrated
