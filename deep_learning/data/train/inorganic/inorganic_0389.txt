a nontrivial solution if and only if the secular determinant is zero or in shorthand notation everything in equation is a known number except since the secular determinant for ethylene is a matrix finding requires solving a quadratic equation after expanding the determinant there will be two values of which satisfy this equation and they are the molecular orbital energies for ethylene one will be the bonding energy and the other the antibonding energy for the orbitals formed by the combination of the two carbon orbitals equation however if more than two atomic orbitals were used eg in a bigger
