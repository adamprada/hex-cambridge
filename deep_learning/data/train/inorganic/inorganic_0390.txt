overlap integral between the two atomic orbitals is matrix representation of the hamiltonian the coulomb integrals and resonance integrals are often described within the matrix representation of the hamiltonian specifically within the basis or within the hückel assumptions the hückel assumptions reduces equation in two homogeneous equations if equation is divided by and then a new variable is defined then equation simplifies to the trivial solution gives both wavefunction coefficients equal to zero and the other nontrivial solution is determined by solving the secular determinant which when expanded is so knowing that from equation the energy levels can be found
