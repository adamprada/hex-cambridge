based off of equation where is the normalization constant for this molecular orbital this is the antibonding molecular orbital the normalization constants for both molecular orbitals can obtained via the standard normalization approach ie to obtain these molecular orbitals form the bonding framework and since each carbon contributes one electron to this framework only the lowest molecular orbital is occupied figure in the ground state the corresponding electron configuration is then figure schemetic representation of the molecular orbitals framework for ethylene notice that the antibonding molecular orbital has one more node than the bonding molecular orbital as expected since it
