very important for understanding experiment although the assumptions in hückel theory are drastic they enabled the early calculations of molecular orbitals to be performed with mechanical calculators or by hand hückel theory can be extended to address other types of atoms in conjugated molecules eg nitrogen and oxygen moreover it can be extended to also treat orbitals and this extended hückel theory is still used today despite the utility of hückel theory it is highly qualitative and we should remember the limitations of hückel theory hückel theory is very approximate hückel theory cannot calculate energies accurately electronelectron repulsion is not
