needless to say most hydrogen exists as water on the earth since its polarity may change freely between hydride h atom h and proton h hydrogen also forms various compounds with many elements including oxygen and carbon therefore hydrogen is highly important in chemistry of the three kinds of isotopes of hydrogen deuterium d was discovered by h c urey and others in and subsequently tritium t was prepared from deuterium in about of hydrogen is present as deuterium and this can be enriched by electrolysis of water tritium is a radioactive isotope emitting particles with a halflife of years
