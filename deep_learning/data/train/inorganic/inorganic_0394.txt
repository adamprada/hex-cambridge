substitution shows a marked effect on the rate of reaction of a hydrogencontaining compound since the nuclear spin of hydrogen is and given its abundance it is the most important nuclide for nmr spectroscopy nmr is widely used not only for identification of organic compounds but also for medical diagnostic purposes using mri magnetic resonance imaging of water in living bodies human organs can now be observed with this noninvasive method table properties of isotopic hydrogen and water properties h d t ho do to melting point boiling point density g cm c temp of maximum density c hydrogen k
