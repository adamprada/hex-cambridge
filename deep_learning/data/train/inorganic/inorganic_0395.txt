gas chromatography and rotational lines in the electronic band spectrum of h can distinguish two hydrogen isomers b hydride binary hydrides can be classified according to the position of the element in the periodic table and by the bond characters the hydrides of alkali and alkaline earth metals among sblock elements are ionic compounds structurally analogous to halides and are called saline hydrides the group pblock elements form covalent molecular hydrides no hydride of rare gas elements has been reported some of the dblock and fblock transition metals form metal hydrides exhibiting metallic properties transition metals which do not give
