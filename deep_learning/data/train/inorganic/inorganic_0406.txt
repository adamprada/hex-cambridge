important industrially for example some transition metal carbides and nitrides figure b different atomic mechanisms of alloy formation showing pure metal substitutional and interstitial structures image used with permission from wikipedia with the interstitial mechanism one atom is usually much smaller than the other so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix called the interstices this is referred to as an interstitial alloy steel is an example of an interstitial alloy because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices
