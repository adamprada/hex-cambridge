ho the anion x which is a spectator in water can become a weak base in chcooh it follows that acidic solvents magnify the br√∏nsted basicities of substances that cannot accept protons in water conversely basic solvents magnify the acidity of substances that cannot donate a proton to the acidity and basicity of nonaqueous solvents is difficult to quantify precisely but one good relative measure is the hammett acidity function which is defined analogously to ph according to the hendersonhasselbach equation for nonaqueous solvents or for acidic or basic compounds in dissolved in solvents that do not themselves dissociate ho
