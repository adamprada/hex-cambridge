used hardsphere model the hardsphere model are impenetrable spheres that do not overlap in space the hardsphere model has been tested by wellknown scientists lande pauling and goldsmidt the ion radii measured under crystal state of ionic compound which cations and anions are stacking in pattern as shown below figure schematic of the hardsphere model the hardsphere model can be applied to metallic and ionic compounds such as nacl which is shown below figure d hard sphere model of sodium chloride taken with permission from httpenwikipediaorgwikifilesoedionicpng in general scientists uses formula of internuclear distance to test out the radii of
