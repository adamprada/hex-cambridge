the radii of anion r atom find internuclear distance d between anion and cation use internuclear distance formula to find the r a cs b la c ca radius ratio rules atoms in crystals are held together by electrostatic forces van der waals interactions and covalent bonding it follows that arrangements of atoms that can maximize the strength of these attractive interactions should be most favorable and lead to the most commonly observed crystal structures radius ratio rules early crystallographers had trouble solving the structures of inorganic solids using xray diffraction because some of the mathematical tools for analyzing the
