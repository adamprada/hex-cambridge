considerations that the quality of the fit depended on the radius ratio of the anion and the cation atomic and ionic radii note that cations are always smaller than the neutral atom pink of the same element whereas anions are larger going from left to right across any row of the periodic table neutral atoms and cations contract in size because of increasing nuclear charge click for larger image the basic idea of radius ratio rules is illustrated at the right we consider that the anion is the packing atom in the crystal and the smaller cation fills interstitial sites
