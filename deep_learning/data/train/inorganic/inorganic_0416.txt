in the plane are shown is above the plane and is below the stability limit is at rcra coordination number geometry œÅ rcationranion linear triangular tetrahedral square planar octahedral cubic cuboctahedral there are unfortunately several challenges with using this idea to predict crystal structures we dont know the radii of individual ions atoms in crystals are not really ions there is a varying degree of covalency depending electronegativity differences bond distances and therefore ionic radii depend on bond strength and coordination number remember paulings rule dn d log n ionic radii depend on oxidation state higher charge smaller cation size
