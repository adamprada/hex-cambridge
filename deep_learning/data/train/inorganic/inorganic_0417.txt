the radii of the s and se ions are and Ã¥ respectively once the sizes of these anions are fixed we can obtain a selfconsistent set of cation and anion radii from the lattice constants of many mx compounds how well does this model work lets consider the structures of tetravalent metal oxides mo using pauling radii and the predictions of the radius ratio model oxide mo radius ratio predicted coord no observed coord no structure co linear molecule sio various tetrahedral structures geo silicalike structures rutile tio rutile zro baddleyite fluorite tho fluorite note that cations have different radii
