csi which have the cscl structure in this case the radius ratio model fails rather badly the li salts libr and lii are predicted to have tetrahedral structures and kf is predicted to have an structure like cscl we can try adjusting the radii eg making the cations larger and anions smaller but the best we can do with the alkali halides is predict about half of their structures correctly since the alkali halides are clearly ionic compounds this failure suggests that there is something very wrong with the radius ratio model and its success with mo compounds was coincidental
