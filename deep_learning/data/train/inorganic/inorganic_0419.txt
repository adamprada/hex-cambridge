be minimized anion polyhedra can share vertices as in the perovskite structure without any energetic penalty shared polyhedral edges and especially shared faces cause cationcation repulsion and should be avoided for example in rutile the most stable polymorph of tio the tio octahedra share vertices and two opposite edges forming ribbons in the structure in anatase tio each octahedron shares four edges so the anatase polymorph is less thermodynamically stable highly charged cations in anion polyhedra tend not to share edges or even vertices especially when the coordination number is low for example in orthosilicates such as olivine msio there
