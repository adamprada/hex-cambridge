electron affinity usually decreases down a group and increases across a period although these trends often hold truth there are some exceptions to these patterns introduction ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from its molecular orbital the nth ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the nth electron the ionization energy can predict the atoms reactivity atoms with lower ionization energies easily lose their valence electrons and become cations which will react with anions to from ionic bonds ionization energy the ionization energy is usually determined experimentally it is the energy needed to remove a
