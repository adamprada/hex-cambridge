positively charged ion the general pattern of the ionization energy as they are in regard to the period table is that the ie increases across a period and decreases down a group because it requires more energy to remove an electron from a stable atom the noble gases are usually associated with the highest ie because their valence shells are already filled and stablized they will require much more energy to disrupt that stability the first electron that is expelled is the most loosely held to the atom on the other hand the group elements are usually associated with the
