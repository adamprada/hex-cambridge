because be has the filled shell s which is more stable than the electronic configuration of b s p hence be will require more ie than b similarly the ie decreases when going from elements in group to group electron affinities electron affinity often abbreviated as ea is the energy released when an electron is added to a valence shell of the atom fg e fg ea kjmol when an electron is added to an atom energy is given off this process is exothermic atoms like the noble gases will not gain an electron because they are already in their
