hot piece directly into cold water cools it to room temperature but doesnt allow time for the fcc bcc phase transition to occur therefore such pieces are still relatively malleable and can be shaped the ironiron carbide fefec phase diagram below c pure iron exists as the alpha phase ferrite which has the bcc structure between and c pure iron exists as the gamma phase austenite which has the fcc structure carbon is more soluble in the fcc phase which occupies area Î³ on the phase diagram than it is in the bcc phase the percent carbon determines the type
