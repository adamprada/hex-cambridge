grains of an extra phase fec cementite a very hard material which are layered or dotted throughout the matrix of bcc iron grains the effect of all these little grains of fec is to stop the motion of dislocations making for a harder but with higher carbon content increasingly brittle material this is why knives and swords are quenched from the fcc phase cold worked into the appropriate shapes and then heated up again and tempered before they are sharpened when they are made cast iron objects frying pans radiators etc have a higher carbon content and are therefore very
