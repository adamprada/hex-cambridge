stable the jahnteller theorem essentially states that any nonlinear molecule with a spatially degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the molecule jahnteller distortion of a d octahedral transition metal complex the tetragonal distortion lengthens the bonds along the zaxis as the bonds in the xy plane become shorter this change lowers the overall energy because the two electrons in the dz orbital go down in energy as the one electron in the dxy orbital goes up we can understand this effect in the context of
