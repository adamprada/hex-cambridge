such geometric distortions that lower the electronic energy are said to be electronically driven similar electronically driven distortions occur in onedimensional chain compounds where they are called peierls distortions and in twodimensionally bonded sheets where they are called charge density waves the jahnteller effect is most often encountered in octahedral complexes especially sixcoordinate copperii complexes the d electronic configuration of this ion gives three electrons in the two degenerate eg orbitals leading to a doubly degenerate electronic ground state such complexes distort along one of the molecular fourfold axes always labelled the z axis which has the effect of removing
