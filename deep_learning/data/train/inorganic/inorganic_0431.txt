to have an inversion center this is preserved after the distortion the jahnteller effect is responsible for the tetragonal distortion of the hexaaquacopperii complex ion cuoh which might otherwise possess octahedral geometry the two axial cuo distances are å whereas the four equatorial cuo distances are å in octahedral complexes the jahnteller effect is most pronounced when an odd number of electrons occupy the eg orbitals this situation arises in complexes with the configurations d lowspin d or highspin d complexes all of which have doubly degenerate ground states in such compounds the eg orbitals involved in the degeneracy point
