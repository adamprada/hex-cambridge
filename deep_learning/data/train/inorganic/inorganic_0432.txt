is less stabilisation to be gained because the ligands are not pointing directly at the orbitals the expected effects for octahedral coordination are given in the following table jahnteller effect number of d electrons highlow spin hs ls hs ls hs ls hs ls strength of jt effect w w s w w w w s s w weak jahnteller effect tg orbitals unevenly occupied s strong jahnteller effect expected eg orbitals unevenly occupied blank no jahnteller effect expected the jahnteller effect is manifested in the uvvis absorbance spectra of some compounds where it often causes splitting of bands it
