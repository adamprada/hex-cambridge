be calculated with reasonable accuracy if the structure is known but how can we calculate el for a new or hypothetical compound of unknown structure recall that the reduced madelung constant is about the same for different crystal structures russian chemist a f kapustinskii recognized this fact and devised a formula that allows one to calculate el for any compound if we know the univalent radii of the constituent ions the madelung constant a is proportional to the number of ions n in formula unit so dividing by the n gives similar values as shown in the table below an
