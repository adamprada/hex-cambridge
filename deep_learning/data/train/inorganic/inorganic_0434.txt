the structure of the compound therefore it can be used in combination with bornhaber cycles to predict the stability of unknown compounds as we show below this is a broadly useful tool in guiding syntheses and predicting the reactivity of inorganic solids no headers the fifteen elements shown in table from lanthanum la f to lutetium lu f are lanthanoids ln may be used as a general symbol for the lanthanoid elements although lanthanoids scandium sc and yttrium y are sometimes called rare earth elements they are relatively abundant in the earths crust with the exception of promethium pm which
