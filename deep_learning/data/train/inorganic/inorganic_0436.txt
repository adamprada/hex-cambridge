an increase of atomic number complexes of lanthanoid metals are to coordinate and especially many and coordinate compounds are known organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands of the types or are also known all of which are very reactive to oxygen or water latimer diagrams thermodynamically stable and unstable oxidation statesfrost diagrams in addition to pourbaix diagrams there are two other kinds of redox stability diagrams known as latimer and frost diagrams each of these diagrams contains similar information but one representation may be more useful in a given situation than the others latimer and frost diagrams help predict stability relative
