oxidation states of successive substances in a latimer diagram can differ by one or more electrons oxidation states for the element undergoing redox are typically determined by difference we assign the oxygen atoms an oxidation state of and the hydrogen atoms an oxidation state of example mn in acid the latimer diagram for mn illustrates its standard reduction potentials in m acid in oxidation states from to the latimer diagram compresses into shorthand notation all the standard potentials for redox reactions of the element mn for example the entry that connects mn and mn gives the potential for the halfcell
