to the right example cemno mno mno the mno species is unstable spontaneous disproportionation which mn species are unstable with respect to disproportionation mno mn so stable species are mno mno mno mn and mn but mno is also unstable why e v moral all possible disproportionation reactions must be considered in order to determine stability this is often more convenient with a frost diagram note thermodynamically unstable ions can be quite stable kinetically for example most ncontaining molecules no no nh are unstable relative to the elements o n h but they are still quite stable kinetically frost diagrams
