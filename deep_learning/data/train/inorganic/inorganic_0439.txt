mn and mno on the frost diagram has a slope of the standard potential of mno reduction to mn this is the number that is written above the arrow in the latimer diagram for mn multielectron potentials can be calculated easily by connecting the dots in a frost diagram a frost diagram contains the same information as in a latimer diagram but graphically shows stability and oxidizing power the lowest species on the diagram are the most stable mn mno the highest species on diagram are the strongest oxidizers mno no headers lattice energies can also help predict compound solubilities
