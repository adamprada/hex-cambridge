energy eh the lattice energy depends on the sum of the anion and cation radii r r whereas the hydration energy has separate anion and cation terms generally the solvation of small ions typically cations dominates the hydration energy because of the r dependence for salts that contain large anions el doesnt change much as r changes that is because the anion dominates the r r term in the denominator of the formula for el on the other hand eh changes substantially with r especially for small cations as a result sulfate salts of small divalent cations such as mgso
