cations such as cs and ba which make soluble fluoride salts for small anions el is more sensitive to r whereas eh does not depend on r as strongly for fluorides and hydroxides lif is slightly soluble whereas csf is very soluble and mgoh is insoluble whereas baoh is very soluble putting both trends together we see that low solubility is most often encountered when the anion and cation match well in their sizes especially when one or both are multiply charged spacefilling models showing the van der waals surfaces of ba and so the similarity in size of the
