that lattice energy is the reverse process meaning it is the energy released when gaseous ions bind to form an ionic solid as implied in the definition this process will always be exothermic and thus the value for lattice energy will be negative its values are usually expressed with the units kjmol lattice energy is used to explain the stability of ionic solids some might expect such an ordered structure to be less stable because the entropy of the system would be low however the crystalline structure allows each ion to interact with multiple oppositely charge ions which causes a
