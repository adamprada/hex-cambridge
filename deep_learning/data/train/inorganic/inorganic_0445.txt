an electron from a neutral atom or an ion this process always requires an input of energy and thus will always have a positive value in general ionization energy increases across the periodic table from left to right and decreases from top to bottom there are some excepts usually due to the stability of halffilled and completely filled orbitals electron affinity is the energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or an ion usually energy released would have a negative value but due to the definition of electron affinity it is written as a positive value
