cause a change of phase from solid to gas bypassing the liquid phase this is an input of energy and thus has a positive value it may also be referred to as the energy of atomization the heat of formation is the change in energy when forming a compound from its elements this may be positive or negative depending on the atoms involved and how they interact hesss law states that the overall change in energy of a process can be determined by breaking the process down into steps then adding the changes in energy of each step the bornhaber
