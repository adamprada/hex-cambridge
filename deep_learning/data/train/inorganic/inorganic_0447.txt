this is the energy of the ionic solid and will be used at the end of the process to determine the lattice energy step the bornhaber cycle requires that the elements involved in the reaction are in their gaseous forms add the changes in enthalpy to turn one of the elements into its gaseous state and then do the same for the other element step metals exist in nature as single atoms and thus no dissociation energy needs to be added for this element however many nonmetals will exist as polyatomic species for example cl exists as cl in its
