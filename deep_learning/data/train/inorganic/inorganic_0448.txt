by the definition of electron affinity so be careful when doing this calculation step now the metal and nonmetal will be combined to form the ionic solid this will cause a release of energy which is called the lattice energy the value for the lattice energy is the difference between the value from step and the value from step the diagram below is another representation of the bornhaber cycle equation the bornhaber cycle can be reduced to a single equation heat of formation heat of atomization dissociation energy sum of ionization energies sum of electron affinities lattice energy note in
