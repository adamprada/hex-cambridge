in alternate layers of the fcc lattice and the cdi structure is the relative of this structure in the hcp lattice in the cdcl structure the stacking sequence of anion layers is abcabc in the cdi structure the anion stacking sequence is abab and all the cations are eclipsed along the stacking axis comparison of the cdcl left and cdi right crystal structures these are examples of structures because the cations are coordinated by an octahedron of six anions and the anions are coordinated by three cations to make a trigonal pyramid like nh another way to describe these structures
