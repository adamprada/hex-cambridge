x and lic in these compounds lithium is ionized to li and the sheets are negatively charged oxidizing agents such as br fecl and asf also react with graphite in the resulting intercalation compounds the sheets are positively charged and the intercalated species are anionic intercalation reactions are especially important for electrochemical energy storage in secondary batteries such as lithium ion batteries nickelmetal hydride batteries and nickelcadmium batteries the reversible nature of the intercalation reaction allows the electrodes to be charged and discharged up to several thousand times without losing their mechanical integrity in lithium ion batteries the negative electrode
