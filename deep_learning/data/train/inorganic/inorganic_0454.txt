and the negative electrode is in the lic form discharge involves the motion of li ions through the electrolyte forming lixcoo and graphite at the two electrodes blue plaque erected by the royal society of chemistry commemorating the development of cathode materials for the lithiumion battery crystal structure of licoo the lithium ion battery is a rocking chair battery so named because charging and discharging involve moving li ions from one side to the other coo is one example of a positive electrode material that has been used in lithium ion batteries it has a high energy density but batteries
