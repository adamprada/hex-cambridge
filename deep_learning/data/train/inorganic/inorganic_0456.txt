that shared electrons between atoms are shown as lines lone pairs of electrons themselves are usually represented by dots around the atoms these diagrams are helpful because they allow us to predict the shape of the molecule and see the positions of each atom relative to the others introduction in gilbert lewis newton introduced a way to show the bonding of atoms in a molecule though diagrams creating lewis structures is rather simple and only requires a small series of steps and little bit of math basic steps for simple structures lewis structure are very simple to construct and only
