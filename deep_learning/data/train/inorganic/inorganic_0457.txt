fluorine atoms contain valence electrons each the total amount of electrons we have to work with is electrons in some cases there may be a charge on the molecule you are working on if this charge is negative then you add the value of that charge to the amount of electrons you totaled up whereas if the charge is positive then you subtract that value from the amount that you totaled up in this case we do not have a charge on our molecule so we will stick to using electrons the next step requires some drawing draw out your
