be known as the lone pairs because they are not bonded to another atom you will represent these electrons by using dots around the atom each dot represents one electrons because each fluorine requires another electrons each to fill their octets this means that we have used up all of our remaining electrons boron does not fill its octet because it is one of the few exceptions to the rule it is perfectly fine only forming bonds the final structure can be seen in a diagram below because there are three bonded atoms to a central atom with no lone
