formal charge unless a charge is preferred you want the overall charge of the molecule to be formal charge of valence electrons of unpaired electrons of paired electrons so the formal charges are fcboron fcfluorine fctotal fcboron fcfluorine if a formal charge is preferred then the final answer should be in brackets with the charge outside of the bracket lewis structures of charged molecules in the case of triiodide i you notice that there is a negative charge that means that instead of the valence electrons for each i you add one more electron to make it you will then
