co molecule if you go about the steps that were given to you above you will notice that the octets of the oxygen atoms have been filled but the carbon still needs more electrons what you need to do it move one pair of electrons from each oxygen atom and turn it into a double bond on each side of the carbon the final structure for co can be seen below problems complete the following problems to to evaluate your understanding of this module draw the lewis structure for the following molecules no ch sf find the formal charge on
