kinetics as in organic chemistry the mechanisms of transition metal reactions are typically inferred from experiments that examine the concentration dependence of the incoming and outgoing ligands on the reaction rate the detection of intermediates and the stereochemistry of the reactants and products thermodynamic vs kinetics when we think about the reactions of transition metal complexes it is important to recall the distinction between their thermodynamics and kinetics take for example the formation of the square planar tetracyanonickelate complex thermodynamically nicn is very stable meaning that the equilibrium above lies very far to the right kinetically however the complex is
