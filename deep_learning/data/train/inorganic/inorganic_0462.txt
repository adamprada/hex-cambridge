if their reaction halflife was one minute or less and inert if they took longer to react the dynamic range of ligand substitution rates is enormous spanning at least orders of magnitude on the timescale of most laboratory experiments the taube definition of lability is a useful one for classifying reactions into those that have low and high activation energies as we will see the crystal field stabilization energy cfse plays a key role in determining the activation energy and therefore the rate of ligand substitution henry taube stanford university received the nobel prize for his work on the electron
