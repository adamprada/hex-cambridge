about orders of magnitude for different metal ions and oxidation states mn log k sec cr v cr cu while at first it may seem strange that the same ion in two different oxidation states cr vs cr would be inert or labile respectively we can begin to rationalize the difference by drawing dorbital splitting diagrams for the complexes what we find is that octahedral complexes that have high cfse cr v tend to be inert conversely ions with electrons in high energy eg orbitals cr cu tend to be labile in the case of cr and v the energy
