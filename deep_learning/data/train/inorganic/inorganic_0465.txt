to form an mln intermediate and the incoming ligand y reacts with the mln fragment this mechanism is illustrated below for ligand substitution on an octahedral ml complex the intermediate state in this example involves a trigonal bipyramidal ml fragment as well as free l and y ligands if the rate determining step is the dissociation of l from the complex then the concentration of y does not affect the rate of reaction leading to the firstorder rate law illustration of the dissociative ligand substitution mechanism for an ml complex the reaction energy profile is shown at the right in
