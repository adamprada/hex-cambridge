formation of the transition state involves dissociation of a ligand the entropy of activation is always positive in the dissociative mechanism in the associative mechanism the incoming ligand y attacks the mln complex transiently forming an mlny intermediate and the intermediate then loses a ligand l forming the mlny product complexes that undergo associative substitution are typically either coordinatively unsaturated or contain a ligand that can change its bonding to the metal eg a change in the hapticity or bending of a nitric oxide ligand no in homogeneous catalysis the associative pathway is desirable because the binding event and hence
