both the equatorial and axial sites ligand dissociation must occur from an equatorial site according to the principle of microscopic reversibility dissociation of y results in no reaction but dissociation of l results in net substitution yielding the d complex mly the first step is typically rate determining thus the entropy of activation is negative which indicates an increase in order in the transition state associative reactions follow second order kinetics the rate of the appearance of product depends on the concentration of both ml and y the trans effect which is connected with the associative mechanism controls the stereochemistry
