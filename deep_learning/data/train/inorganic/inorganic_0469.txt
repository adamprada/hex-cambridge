mechanism described above which goes through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate ligands with a high kinetic trans effect are in general those with high π acidity as in the case of phosphines or lowligand lonepairdπ repulsions as in the case of hydride which prefer the more πbasic equatorial sites in the intermediate the second equatorial position is occupied by the incoming ligand the third and final equatorial site is occupied by the departing trans ligand so the net result is that the kinetically favored product is the one in which the ligand trans to the one with the largest trans effect
