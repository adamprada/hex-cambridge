more important in reaching the transition state then the mechanism is id an example of the ia mechanism is the interchange of bulk and coordinated water in vho in contrast the slightly more compact ion niho ion exchanges water via the id mechanism effects of ion pairing highly charged cationic complexes tend to form ion pairs with anionic ligands and these ion pairs often undergo reactions via the ia pathway the electrostatically held nucleophilic incoming ligand can exchange positions with a ligand in the first coordination sphere resulting in net substitution an illustrative process is the anation reaction with an
