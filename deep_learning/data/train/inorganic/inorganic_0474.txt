ions the sum of ionic radii the coulomb energy of the other ions in this d lattice on this sodium atom can be decomposed by proximity or shells nearest neighbors first shell this reference sodium ion has two negative chloride ions as its neighbors on either side at so the coulombic energy of these interactions is underbrace dfrace pi epsilono rotextleft chloride ion underbrace dfrace pi epsilono rotextright chloride ion dfrace pi epsilono ro labeleq next nearest neighbors second shell similarly the repulsive energy due to the next two positive sodium ions at a distance of is underbrace dfrace pi
