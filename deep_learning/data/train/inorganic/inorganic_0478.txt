and the b icosahedral structural units join together by center electron ce bonds and center electron ce bonds electron deficient bonds between boron atoms figure boron is very hard and shows semiconductivity figure the structure of the elemental boron with b icosahedra the chemistry of boranes boron hydrides started from the research of a stock reported during the period although boron is adjacent to carbon in the periodic table its hydrides have completely different properties from those of hydrocarbons the structures of boron hydrides in particular were unexpected and could be explained only by a new concept in chemical bonding
