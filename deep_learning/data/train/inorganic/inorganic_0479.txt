with inorganic acids and determined their compositions however additional research was necessary to determine their structures at present the original synthetic method of stock using mgb as a starting compound is used only for the preparation of bh since reagents such as lithium tetrahydroborate libh and sodium tetrahydroborate nabh are now readily available and diborane bh is prepared according to the following equation higher boranes are synthesized by the pyrolysis of diborane a new theory of chemical bonding was introduced to account for the bonding structure of diborane bh although an almost correct hydrogenbridged structure for diborane was proposed in
