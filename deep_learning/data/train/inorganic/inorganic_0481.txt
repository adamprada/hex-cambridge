of valence electrons used for skeletal bonds and the structures of boranes and proposed an empirical rule called the wade rule according to this rule when the number of boron atoms is n the skeletal valence electrons are n for a closo type n for a nido type and n for an arachno type borane the relationship between the skeletal structure of a cluster compound and the number of valence electrons is also an important problem in the cluster compounds of transition metals and the wade rule has played a significant role in furthering our understanding of the structures of
