of the lubricating properties of graphite various molecules such as alkali metals halogens metal halides and organic compounds intercalate between the layers and form intercalation compounds graphite has semimetallic electrical conductivity about cm parallel to layers and about times more resistant in the perpendicular direction figure structure of graphite diamond its structure is called the diamondtype structure figure a unit cell of diamond contains eight carbon atoms and each carbon atom is coordinate in a regular tetrahedron diamond is the hardest substance known with a mohs hardness diamond has very high heat conductivity although it is an electrical insulator although
