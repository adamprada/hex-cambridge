isotopes of silicon si si and si because of its nuclear spin of i si is used for nmr studies of organic silicon compounds or silicates solidstate nmr silicates and organosilicon compounds show a wide range of structures in silicon chemistry section c describes the properties of silicates organosilicon chemistry is the most active research area in the inorganic chemistry of main group elements other than carbon silicon chemistry has progressed remarkably since the development of an industrial process to produce organosilicon compounds by the direct reaction of silicon with methyl chloride chcl in the presence of a copper catalyst
