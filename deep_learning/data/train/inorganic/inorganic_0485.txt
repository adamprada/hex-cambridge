kinetic stabilization exercise why are the properties of co and sio different answer their properties are very different because co is a chainlike threeatom molecule and sio is a solid compound with the three dimensional bridges between silicon and oxygen atoms d nitrogen nitrogen is a colorless and odorless gas that occupies of the atmosphere volume ratio it is produced in large quantities together with oxygen bp c by liquefying air bp c and fractionating nitrogen bp c nitrogen is an inert gas at room temperatures but converted into nitrogen compounds by biological nitrogen fixation and industrial ammonia synthesis the
