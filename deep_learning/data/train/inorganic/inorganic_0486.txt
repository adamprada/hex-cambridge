amorphous and its structure is unclear the principal component is assumed to be a chain formed by the polymerization of p molecules as the result of the opening of one of the pp bonds it is neither pyrophoric nor poisonous and used in large quantities for the manufacturing of matches etc black phosphorus is the most stable allotrope and is obtained from white phosphorus under high pressure about gpa it is a solid with a metallic luster and a lamellar structure although it is a semiconductor under normal pressures it shows metallic conductivity under high pressures gpa phosphorus compounds as
