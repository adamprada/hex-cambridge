compounds is as follows ar is an aryl and r is an alkyl on the other hand c a tolman has proposed that the angle at the vertex of a cone that surrounds the substituents of a phosphorus ligand at the van der waals contact distance can be a useful parameter to assess the steric bulkiness of phosphines and phosphites this parameter called the cone angle is widely used figure when the cone angle is large the coordination number decreases by steric hindrance and the dissociation equilibrium constant and dissociation rate of a phosphorus ligand become large table the numerical
