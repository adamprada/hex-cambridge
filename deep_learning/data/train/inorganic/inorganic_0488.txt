bcc structure there are no closepacked planes and much greater corrugation between atoms at different levels this makes it much harder for one row to slide past another this effect explains the hardness of alloys like brass cuzn which has the bcc structure which are made by combining two soft metals cu and zn which are respectively fcc and hcp as pure metals are both soft and ductile bronzes originally made as alloys of copper and arsenic but later as alloys of copper and tin are harder than either of the constituent metals for the same reason the history of
