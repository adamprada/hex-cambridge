that the spatial orientation of the molecule is arbitrary since the molecule looks the same at any viewing angle for a diatomic its orientation can be specified by giving two angles the angle it makes with the zaxis and the angle of its projection onto the plane with the xaxis the choice of these angles is arbitrary this leaves only number left which is the distance between a and b called the molecules bond length this is an internal degree of freedom and is the only important number we need to give in order to convey the geometry of the
