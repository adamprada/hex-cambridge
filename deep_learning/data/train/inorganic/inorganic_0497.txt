a few examples of how to do this will be illustrated below example the diatomic how do we determine a set of coordinates for given only its bond length since its absolute location in space and its orientation are arbitrary any set of coordinates that reproduces the correct bond length will suffice thus since a diatomic is linear we may place it along one of the axes of our coordinate system with one of the atoms at the origin figure now we see that the coordinates of atom will simply be and the coordinates of atom since lies on the
