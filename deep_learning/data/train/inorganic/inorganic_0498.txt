later with a bond angle of and an bond length of approximately to determine a set of coordinates for we note that the molecule is planar so we may choose it to lie in the plane we will place the oxygen at the origin with the hydrogens as shown below figure the coordinates of the oxygen can be written down immediately for each of the hydrogens note that the yaxis bisects the angle giving two right triangles an bond forms the hypotenuse of one of these triangles so that the and coordinates will be determined from the sine and cosine
