increased valence shell size hence increased electronelectron repulsion an important result from experiment which has been corroborated by theory is that bond lengths tend not to vary much from molecule to molecule thus a bond will have roughly the same value in methane as it will in aspirin bond dissociation energies were discussed in the last lecture in the context of ionic bonds there we used the symbol measured in this measures the energy required to break a mole of a particular kind of bond a similar periodic trend exists for bond dissociation energies consider the hydrogen halides thus as
