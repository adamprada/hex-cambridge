chemical bonds in nature are neither truly covalent nor truly ionic only homonuclear bonds are truly covalent and nearly perfect ionic bonds can form between group i and group vii elements for example kf generally however bonds are partially covalent and partially ionic meaning that there is partial transfer of electrons between atoms and partial sharing of electrons in order to quantify how much ionic character and how much covalent character a bond possesses electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bond can be used we have already seen one method for estimating atomic electronegativities the mulliken method in linus
