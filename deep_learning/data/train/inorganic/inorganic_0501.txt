and respectively since and are purely covalent bonds these two dissociation energies can be used to estimate the pure covalent contribution to the bond pauling proposed the geometric mean of and this being more sensitive to large differences between these energies than the arithmetic average if is the true bond dissociation energy then the difference is a measure of the ionic contribution let us define this difference to be then pauling defined the electronegativity difference between atoms and to be where is measured in and the constant has units so that the electronegativity difference is dimensionless thus with some extra
