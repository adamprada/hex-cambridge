the potassium will be approximately and the charge on the fluorine will be approximately for a polar covalent bond such as in which only partial charge transfer occurs a more accurate representation would be where expressed in units of is known as a partial charge it suggests that a fraction of an electron is transferred although the reality is that there is simply a little more electron density on the more electronegative atom and a little less on the electropositive atom how much charge is actually transferred can be quantified by studying the electric dipole moment of the bond which
