a very large unit and awkward to work with for molecules a more convenient unit is the debye defined to be is actually the dipole moment of two charges and separated by a distance of thus for a diatomic with partial charges and the dipole moment in is given by and the percent ionic character is defined in terms of the partial charge by as an example consider again for which the bond length is thus its dipole moment will be and its percent ionic character is experimental importance of the dipole moment the electric dipole moment lies at the
