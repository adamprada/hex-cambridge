more detail next semester in most experiments the wavelength is long enough compared to the size of the system studied that one can take the electric field to be spatially constant and consider only the time dependence in this case thus the electric field varies as a simple cosine function at a single frequency the importance of the coupling between the dipole moment and the timedependent electric field is that the frequency of the field can be varied over a range of natural frequencies in a given chemical system thus chemical bonds vibrate at a particular natural frequency threeatom bending
