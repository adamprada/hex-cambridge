the bond etc at each frequency the intensity of the response can be measured and a plot of vs is produced such a plot is called an infrared spectrum the figure below shows the infrared spectrum for liquid water left and for m blue and m red koh solutions right in the left panel the solid curve is the water spectrum obtained from a computer simulation while the dashed curve is the experimentally obtained spectrum on the right the red and blue curves are from computer simulations while the inset at the upper right is the experimentally measured spectrum the
