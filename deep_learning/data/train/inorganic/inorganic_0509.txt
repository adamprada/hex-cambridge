overlap of two d orbitals in the delta bond interaction lobes are perpendicular to the axis lie between atoms comparing to the sigma and pi bond interaction the delta bond has the weakest interaction figure the difference between energies of two atomic orbitals also takes a significant contribution to the strength of orbital interaction the relative energies of atomic orbitals of x and y will dictate whether an interaction will lead to efficient overlap or not housecroft page the more similar in energy of two atomic orbitals will result in the stronger interaction in the formation of new molecular orbital
