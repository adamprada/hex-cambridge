shown in figure figure the last factor that affects the orbital interaction is the distance between orbitals the sigma bonding interaction and the pi bonding interaction have strong interaction due to their much closed orbitals the delta bonding interaction will possess the weakest interaction because their orbitals are far from each other show in figure figure the wave interaction of atomic orbitals depending on the phase relationship there are two different ways that the two orbital overlap the phase of an orbital has the same properties of the wavelike of electrons light waves interaction have two different ways one is
