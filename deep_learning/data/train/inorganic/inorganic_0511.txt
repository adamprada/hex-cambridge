the increasing negative charge increases attractions between electrons and nucleithe molecular orbital resulting from inphase interaction is defined as the bonding orbital which has lower energy than the original atomic orbital the out of phase interaction between two atomic orbitals doesnt result in electron density between the two atomic nuclei the negative charge intensity of electrons will decrease in the out of phase interaction the decreasing negative charge decreases attractions between electrons and nuclei as a consequence the out of phase interaction forms the anti bonding molecular orbital with the higher energy than the initial atomic orbital the diagram shows
