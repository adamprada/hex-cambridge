factors that affect the strength of orbital interaction symmetry of the molecule orbital the difference between orbitals energies the orbitals sizes the distance between orbitals what are homo and lumo how do they interact in the molecule orbitals the highest energy occupied molecular orbital is called homo the lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital is called lumo these orbitals are a pair and they lie very close together in energy of two molecules therefore the interaction between them is very strong what are the two types of electron waves interaction inphase and out of phase interactions how do the intensity of
