with large first ionization energies tend to have very negative electron affinities and gain electrons in chemical reactions conversely elements with small first ionization energies tend to have slightly negative or even positive electron affinities and lose electrons in chemical reactions mulliken recognized that an atoms tendency to gain or lose electrons could therefore be described quantitatively by the average of the values of its first ionization energy and the absolute value of its electron affinity robert s mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity should be a measure of the tendency
