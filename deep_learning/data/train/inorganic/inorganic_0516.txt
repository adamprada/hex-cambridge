numerator elements with a large first ionization energy and a very negative electron affinity have a large positive value in the numerator of equation so their electronegativity is high elements with a small first ionization energy and a small electron affinity have a small positive value for the numerator in equation so they have a low electronegativity inserting the appropriate data into equation gives a mulliken electronegativity value for fluorine of kjmol to compare mullikens electronegativity values with those obtained by pauling mullikens values are divided by kjmol which gives paulings value however it is more usual to use a
