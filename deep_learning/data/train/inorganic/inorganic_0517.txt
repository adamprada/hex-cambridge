electronic energy with respect to the number of electrons ie all electronegativity scales give essentially the same results for one element relative to another even though the mulliken scale is based on the properties of individual atoms and the pauling scale is based on the properties of atoms in molecules they both apparently measure the same basic property of an element in the following discussion we will focus on the relationship between electronegativity and the tendency of atoms to form positive or negative ions we will therefore be implicitly using the mulliken definition of electronegativity because of the parallels between
