how valence electrons fill in each molecular orbital the molecular orbital theory explains for polyatomic molecules how hybridization occurs molecular orbital theory has advantages over vb theory in that it can explain paradiamagnetic properties of molecules and easily deduce their bond orders from the coinciding molecular orbital diagrams molecular orbital diagram nh has valence electrons as was already discussed there is one lone pair and nh bonds resulting in a trigonal pyramidal shape based on knowledge of molecular orbital theory we fill the orbitals to obtain the lowest possible energy resulting in paired electrons in the σs σs picture here
