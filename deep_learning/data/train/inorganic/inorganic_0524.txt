laboratories that require an oxygenfree environment b noble gas compounds xenon xe reacts with elements with the largest electronegativities such as fluorine oxygen and chlorine and with the compounds containing these elements like platinum fluoride ptf although the first xenon compound was reported as xeptf the discoverer n bartlett later corrected that it was not a pure compound but a mixture of xeptfx x if this is mixed with fluorine gas and excited with heat or light fluorides xef xef and xef and are generated xef has chainlike xef square xef distorted octahedral structures although preparation of these compounds is
