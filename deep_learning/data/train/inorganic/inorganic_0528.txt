a d square planar complex crystal field energy diagram showing the transition from octahedral to square planar geometry energies of the dorbitals in nonoctahedral geometries the figure above shows what happens to the dorbital energy diagram as we progressively distort an octahedral complex by elongating it along the zaxis a tetragonal distortion by removing one of its ligands to make a square pyramid or by removing both of the ligands along the zaxis to make a square planar complex in all cases we keep the total bond order the same by making the bonds in the xy plane shorter as
