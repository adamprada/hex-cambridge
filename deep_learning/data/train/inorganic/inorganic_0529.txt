eg orbitals dorbitals with a zcomponent dxz dyz dz go down in energy as orbitals that reside in the xy plane dxy dxy rise in energy the barycenter the weighted average orbital energy remains constant also it is important to note that the splitting between the dxy and dxy orbitals stays constant at δo regardless of the nature of the distortion why would a happy octahedral complex want to lose two of its ligands to make a square planar complex this occurs frequently in d and sometimes in d complexes with large δo ie d complexes with strong field ligands
