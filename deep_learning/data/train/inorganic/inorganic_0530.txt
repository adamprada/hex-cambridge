also have a large cfse because the loss of two electrons is accompanied by the gain of two ligands this process is called oxidative addition the reverse process is called reductive elimination both processes function together in catalytic cycles such as the hydrogenation of olefins using wilkinsons catalyst the catalytic cycle is shown below the catalyst cycles between coordinate rhi d and coordinate rhiii d the complex first adds h oxidatively to give a sixcoordinate complex in which the hydrogen is formally h an olefin molecule displaces a solvent molecule using its Ï€electrons to coordinate the metal the complex rearranges
