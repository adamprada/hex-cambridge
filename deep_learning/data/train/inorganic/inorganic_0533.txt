and degrees apart from the atom directly across and opposite from it in regards to identifying each species we will be looking at three separate unique shapes with different numbers of bond pairs and lone pairs this allows us to distinguish and classifiy the octahedrals based on the following shapes octahedral square pyramidal and square planar introductionheading referencesoutside linksproblemsanswerscontributors introduction to be able to understand and distinguish the difference between the three types of octahedral species and how they differ from one molecule to the next it is essential to try to visualize shapes geometrically and in d a simple
