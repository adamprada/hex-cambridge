or different atoms there are six bonding pairs in this molecule and no lone electron pairs the molecule below has no lone pairs of electrons surrounding it thus allowing it to have a distinct shape in a three dimensional sense we may think of a x y and z coordinate plane having both its positive and negative coordinate systems another way of looking at it would be in the sense that all the faces of the molecule are present through this reference it resembles what would be a three dimensional prism all the atoms are spread apart degrees from each
