this molecule different from the previous molecule is the fact that this molecule does not consist of only bondpair atoms surrounding it there is one pair of electrons that has taken the place of one of the atoms and because these electrons are now present it gives the molecule a distict new look there are five bonding pairs and one electron pair the atoms have to arrange themselves in the most stable form possible not only limiting the bondpair to bondpair interaction but also limiting the bondpair to electronpair interaction the easiest way to visualize what this molecule looks like
