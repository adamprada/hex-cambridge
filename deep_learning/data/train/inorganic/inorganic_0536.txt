the atoms and electron pair are degrees apart from each other and from the atom directly across and opposite from it here is what a square pyramidal would look like square pyramidal bond pairs and electron pair the last of the octahedral species is known as a square planar this molecule resembles both of the previous molecules but more similarly resembles a square pyramidal it still has many of the characteristics of a square pyramidal but what makes it different is that rather than having only one pair of electrons replacing the position of an atom there are two pairs
