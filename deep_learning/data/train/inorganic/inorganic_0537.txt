to electronpair and electronpair to electronpair if you try visualizing what this would look like it almost resembles a threedimensional x with two pairs of lone electrons because the lone pairs of electrons are still present that allows this molecule to still be considered an octahedral due to the fact that it still meets the requirements of being surrounded by atoms or groups in regards to its shape the electron pairs cause repulsion thus allowing it to have its new shape the atoms and electrons are still degrees apart from eachother and degrees from the atom directly across and opposite
