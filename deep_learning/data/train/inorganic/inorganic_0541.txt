in the Ï€ orbital and a net bond order of two bonding electrons and antibonding electrons this is consistent with the experimentally observed paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule other interesting predictions of the mo theory for secondrow diatomics are that the c molecule has a bond order of and that the b molecule has two unpaired electrons both verified experimentally we can also predict using the o f ne diagram above that no has a bond order of and co has a bond order of the symbols g and u in the orbital labels which we only include in the
