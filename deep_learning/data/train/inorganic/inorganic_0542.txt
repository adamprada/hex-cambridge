as we did for hydrogenlike aos to get the shapes of s p and dorbitals to get accurate mo energies and diagrams for multielectron molecules ie all real molecules we must include the fact that electrons are correlated ie that they avoid each other in molecules because of their negative charge this problem cannot be solved analytically and is solved approximately in numerical calculations by using density functional theory dft we will learn about the consequences of electron correlation in solids such as superconductors in chapter red giant stars are characterized by the presence of c molecules in their atmospheres
