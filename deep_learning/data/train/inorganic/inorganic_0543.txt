classes of bonds and orbitals in molecules can be rigorously defined according to group theory here we will take a simple approach to this problem based on our intuitive understanding of the symmetry of threedimensional objects as illustrated in fig figure example of σ symmetry aos must have the same nodal symmetry as defined by the molecular symmetry operations or their overlap is zero for example in the hcl molecule there is a unique symmetry axis which is typically defined as the cartesian zaxis as shown in fig figure orbitals of σ and π symmetry do not interact we can
