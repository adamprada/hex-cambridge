of the clay pot shown in fig because these orbitals have the same symmetry in the point group of the molecule they can make the bonding and antibonding combinations shown in fig the mo diagram of hcl that includes all the valence orbitals of the cl atom is shown in fig two of the cl valence orbitals px and py have the wrong symmetry to interact with the h s orbital the cl s orbital has the same Ïƒ symmetry as h s but it is much lower in energy so there is little orbital interaction the energy of the
