atoms of the cyclopentadienyl groups bonded simultaneously to the central metal iron while the various coordination modes of hydrocarbon ligands were determined one after another the industrial importance of organometallic compounds of transition metals increased with the discoveries of olefin polymerization catalysts ziegler catalyst homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts wilkinson catalyst and development of catalysts for asymmetric synthesis etc the nobel prize awarded to k ziegler g natta e o fischer and g wilkinson was in recognition of this importance according to the definition of an organometallic compound at least one direct bond between a metal and a carbon atom should exist
