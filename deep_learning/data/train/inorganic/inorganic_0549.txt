carbon is expected the bonding scheme shown in figure was proposed from this point of view the mechanism by which electrons are donated to the vacant carbon monoxide orbital from the filled metal d orbital is called back donation since accumulation of superfluous electrons on a low oxidation state metal atom is prevented backdonation leads to the stabilization of the mc bond fig back donation in metal carbonyls a rise in the order of the metal carbon bond is reflected in the increase of the mc and decrease of the co stretching frequencies in vibrational spectra infrared spectra are useful
