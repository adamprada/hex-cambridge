a metal is formally a radical and it is stabilized by bonding to the metal a ligand that donates an even number of electrons to a metal is generally a neutral molecule and it is stable even if it is not bonded to the metal carbene or carbyne ligands are exceptions to this rule the chemical formula of an organometallic compound is expressed in many cases without using the square brackets usual for such a complex and we shall follow this convention in this book table hapticity and number of donating electrons of hydrocarbon ligands name hapticity number of electrons
