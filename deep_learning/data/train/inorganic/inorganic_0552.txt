ligand in this aspect allyl complexes if an allyl group chchch is bonded to a metal via a carbon atom it is a electron ligand like an alkyl group if the double bond delocalizes three carbon atoms bond to the metal simultaneously as a electron ligand this is also an odd electron and formally anionic ligand and is stabilized by being coordinated to the metal pdchacpph coch etc are wellknown examples since and coordination modes are possible in the catalytic reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons various reactions occur cyclopentadienl complexes the cyclopentadie nyl ligand ch is abbreviated as cp cme in
