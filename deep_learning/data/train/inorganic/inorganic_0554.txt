reasonably be claimed that this ligand has made the greatest contribution to organometallic chemistry of any other ligand although two cp rings are bonded to the metal in parallel in ferrocene cpticl and cpmoh have bent cp ligands and they are called bentsandwich compounds olefin complexes zeises salt kptclch is the oldest known organometallic compound and was synthesized and analyzed in ca by zeise although its coordination structure was assumed only in and confirmed by the neutron diffraction in the mode of coordination of an olefin to a transition metal is described by the dewarchattduncanson model and the bond between
