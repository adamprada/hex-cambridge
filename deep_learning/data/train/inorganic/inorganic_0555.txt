in olefin complexes arene complexes aromatic compounds are electron donors that coordinate to transition metals in the coordination mode with six carbon atoms bisbenzenechromium crch is a typical example of such a compound the compound is prepared by reducing chromium chloride in benzene and it has a sandwich structure in which a chromium atom is insertedb etween two benzene rings when a benzene ligand is replaced by three carbonyls crcoch is obtained electron rule counting valence electrons is of utmost importance in chemistry changes in the number of valence electrons has a profound influence on the bonding structure and reactions
