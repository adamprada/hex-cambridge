ligands from this viewpoint are listed in table it is important to note that even in the same ligand the number of donor electrons supplied by the ligand differs depending upon the number of ligating atoms that have coordinative interactions with the metal for example or electrons can be donated from a cyclopentadienyl ligand depending on the type of coordinative interactions with the metal when the total number of valence electrons of the metal and ligands is a transition metal organometallic compound usually has high thermal stability for example crco feco nico fech mochco etc satisfy the electron rule but
