rule for example wch e ticlch e and irclcopph e vco e coch e nich e etc do not satisfy the electron rule however the electron rule provides useful clues as to the bonding modes present in a given complex for example fechco with two pentahapto cyclopentadienyl ligands formally has electrons but if one of the ligands is monohapto the compound has electrons structural analysis has shown that this is the actual coordination of this complex exercise calculate the valence electron number of cpmnco answer they are a total of electrons from mn cp and three co c phosphine complexes
