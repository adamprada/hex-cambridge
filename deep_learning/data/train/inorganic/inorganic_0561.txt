oxidation number can be different for the same atom combined with different partners and the atom is said to be in the formal oxidation state corresponding to that oxidation number although this does not express the quantitative deviation of the actual electric charge it is convenient in counting valence electrons or in dealing with redox reactions exercise which halogen has the largest oxidizing power answer since the reduction potential of fluorine is the highest its oxidizing power is the largest b redox reactions originally oxidation meant the formation of oxides from elements or the formation of compounds by the action
