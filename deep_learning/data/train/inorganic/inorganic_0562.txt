state from to c latimer diagram a latimer diagram is a diagram in which the chemical species in the highest oxidation state is placed at the left end and a series of the reduced chemical species of the same atom are arranged to the righthand side in the order of the oxidation states and the standard reduction potentials v are written above the line which connects each state this diagram is convenient for discussing a redox reaction since electric potential differs between an acidic and a basic solution different diagrams are required depending on the ph of the solution taking
