a basic solution answer in recent years whenever a new inorganic compound is synthesized its redox properties are investigated usually by electrochemical measurements cyclic voltammetry is the technique of choice for the study of its redox properties including the electric potential the number of transferred electrons and the reversibility of the reactions etc because of the simplicity of the measurements it is approximately correct to consider that the oxidation potential corresponds to the energy level of the homo because oxidation usually takes an electron from the homo and the reduction potential to the level of the lumo since reduction adds
