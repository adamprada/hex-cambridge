of oxygen then add h to the other side to balance hydrogen write the oxidation halfreaction the bottom arrow in step indicates the oxidation halfreaction show the electrons lost on the product side balance with respect to atoms ions to balance oxygen add ho to the side with the least amount of oxygen then add h to the other side to balance hydrogen the number of electrons gained must equal the number of electrons lost find the least common multiple of the electrons gained and lost in each halfreaction multiply the electron coefficient by a number to reach the common
