the polar zone and fresh water represents only the small remaining fraction fundamental chemical and physical properties of water are very significant to chemistry the main physical properties are shown in table most of the unusual properties of water are caused by its strong hydrogen bonds physical properties of water differ considerably with the presence of isotopes of hydrogen at least nine polymorphs of ice are known and their crystal structures depend on the freezing conditions of the ice water has a bond angle of and a bond distance of pm as a free molecule it is described in section
