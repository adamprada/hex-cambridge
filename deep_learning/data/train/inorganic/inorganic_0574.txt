reactions to produce a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide from air and hydrogen using a substituted anthraquinone this dilute solution is then concentrated when deuterium peroxide is prepared in a laboratory the following reaction is applied hydrogen peroxide is decomposed into oxygen and water in the presence of catalysts such as manganese dioxide mno hydrogen peroxide may be either an oxidant or a reductant depending on its coreactants its reduction potential in an acidic solution expressed in a latimer diagram refer to section c is c silicon oxides silicon oxides are formed by taking sio tetrahedra as structural units and
