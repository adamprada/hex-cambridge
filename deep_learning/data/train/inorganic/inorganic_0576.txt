are lined and stratified minerals like mica are constructed if coordinate ions are inserted between layers if the number of oxygen atoms in the layers is not enough to form regular octahedra between layers hydroxide groups bond to the interstitial al ions muscovite kalohsialo is a type of mica with such a structure and can be eas ily peeled into layers zeolite one of the important aluminosilicates is zeolite zeolites are present as natural minerals and also many kinds of zeolites are prepared synthetically in large quantities the sio and alo tetrahedra are bonded by oxygen bridges and form holes
