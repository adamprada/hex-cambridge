called cages are the basic frames of synthetic zeolite a naalsio ho and the quadrangle portions are connected through cubes it can be seen that an octagonal tunnel b forms when eight truncated octahedra bind in this way the structure in which the hexagon portions connect through hexagonal prisms is faujasite nacaalsio ho alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cations exist in the holes and the number of these cations increases with the content of aluminum to compensate for the charge deficiency the structures of zeolites have many crevices in which cations and water are contained utilizing this cationexchange property
