oxygen atoms refer to figure since a terminal oxygen atom is bonded to each phosphorus atom the coordination polyhedron of oxygen is also a tetrahedron when the molecular po is heated a vitrified isomer is formed this is a polymer composed of similar tetrahedra of phosphorus oxide with the same composition that are connected to one another in sheets since it is very reactive with water phosphorus pentoxide is a powerful dehydrating agent it is used not only as a desiccant but also it has remarkable dehydration properties and no or so can be formed by dehydration of hno or
