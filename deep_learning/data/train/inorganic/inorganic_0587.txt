ss bond is formed this is a very strong reducing agent g metal oxides oxides of all the metallic elements are known and they show a wide range of properties in terms of structures acidity and basicity and conductivity namely an oxide can exhibit molecular dimensional chain dimensional layer or dimensional structures there are basic amphoteric and acidic oxides depending on the identity of the metallic element moreover the range of physical properties displayed is also broad from insulators to semicondutors metallic conductors and superconductors the compositions of metallic oxide can be simply stoichiometric stoichiometric but not simple or sometimes
