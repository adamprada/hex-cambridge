was the original scientist to describe the phenomena of electronegativity the best way to describe his method is to look at a hypothetical molecule that we will call xy by comparing the measured xy bond energy with the theoretical xy bond energy computed as the average of the xx bond energy and the yy bond energy we can describe the relative affinities of these two atoms with respect to each other Î´ bond energies xymeasured xyexpected if the electonegativities of x and y are the same then we would expect the measured bond energy to equal the theoretical expected bond
