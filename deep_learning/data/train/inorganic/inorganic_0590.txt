fluorine the most electronegative element pauling was able to set up relative values for all of the elements this was when he first noticed the trend that the electronegativity of an atom was determined by its position on the periodic table and that the electronegativity tended to increase as you moved left to right and bottom to top along the table the range of values for paulings scale of electronegativity ranges from fluorine most electronegative to francium least electronegative furthermore if the electronegativity difference between two atoms is very large then the bond type tends to be more ionic however
