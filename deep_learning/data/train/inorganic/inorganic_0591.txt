learning objective to quantify the shielding effect experienced by atomic electrons we have previously described the concepts of electron shielding orbital penetration and effective nuclear charge but we did so in a qualitative manner in this section we explore one model for quantitatively estimating the impact of electron shielding and then use that to calculate the effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron in an atom the model we will use is known as slaters rules jc slater phys rev slaters rules the general principle behind slaters rule is that the actual charge felt by an electron is equal to
