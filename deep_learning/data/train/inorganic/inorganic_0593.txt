other electrons in the same group electrons in groups with principal quantum number n and azimuthal quantum number l electrons in groups with principal quantum number n electrons in all groups with principal quantum number n s nsnp nd or nf the shielding numbers in table were derived semiempirically ie derived from experiments as opposed to theoretical calculations this is because quantum mechanics makes calculating shielding effects quite difficult which is outside the scope of this module calculating s sum together the contributions as described in the appropriate rule above to obtain an estimate of the shielding constant which is
