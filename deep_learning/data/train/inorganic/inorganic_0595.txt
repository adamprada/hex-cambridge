nf group ssp ignore the group to the right of the d electrons these do not contribute to the shielding constant sp sd electrons of copper atoms what is the shielding constant experienced by a valence delectron in the copper atom answer s calculating zeff one set of estimates for the effective nuclear charge was presented in figure previously we qualitatively described as being less than the actual nuclear charge because of the repulsive interaction between core and valence electrons we can quantitatively represent this difference between and as follows rearranging this formula to solve for we obtain we can
