s p the valence p electron in boron resides in the p subshell b ssp step b sp step c z step d using equation ref exercise what is the effective nuclear charge experienced by a valence delectron in copper answer summary slaters rules can be used as a model of shielding this permits us to quantify both the amount of shielding experienced by an electron and the resulting effective nuclear charge others performed better optimizations of using variational hartreefock methods for example clementi and raimondi published atomic screening constants from scf functions j chem phys references james l reed
