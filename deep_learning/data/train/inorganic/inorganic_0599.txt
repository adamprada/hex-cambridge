substantial ring strain this allotrope of p undergoes spontaneous combustion in air solid white phosphorus very slowly converts to red phosphorus a more stable allotrope that contains sheets of pyramidal p atoms each with bonds to three neighboring atoms and one lone pair white phosphorus p is a soft waxy solid that ignites spontaneously in air burning with a bright flame and generating copious white po smoke the sample shown here is photographed under water to prevent the oxidation reaction n can make Ï€bonds so n has a very strong triple bond and is a relatively inert diatomic gas chsio
