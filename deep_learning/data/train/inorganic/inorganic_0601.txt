the kinetic energy distribution of the emitted photoelectrons to study the composition and electronic state of the surface region of a sample xray photoelectron spectroscopy xps uses soft xrays with a photon energy of ev to examine electrons in corelevels ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ups using vacuum uv radiation with a photon energy of ev to examine electrons in valence levels both photoelectron spectroscopy is based upon a single photon inelectron out process the energy of a photon of all types of electromagnetic radiation is given by the planckeinstein relation where is planck constant and is the frequency hz of the
