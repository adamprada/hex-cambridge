kaya photoelectron spectroscopy uses monochromatic sources of radiation ie photons of fixed energy in ups the photon interacts with valence levels of the molecule or solid leading to ionization by removal of one of these valence electrons the kinetic energy distribution of the emitted photoelectrons ie the number of emitted photoelectrons as a function of their kinetic energy can be measured using any appropriate electron energy analyzer and a photoelectron spectrum can thus be recorded the process of photoionization can be considered in several ways one way is to look at the overall process for a species conservation of energy
