its initial level to the vacuum level free electron photoelectron spectroscopy measures the relative energies of the ground and excited positive ion states that are obtained by removal of single electrons from the neutral molecule note equation ref may look familiar to you as it the same equation einstein used to describe the photoelectric effect except the vertical ionization energy is substituted for workfunction both vertical ionization energy and workfunctions are metrics for the binding energy of an electron in the sample at a fundamental level ionization energies are welldefined thermodynamic quantities related to the heats of protonation oxidationreduction chemistry
