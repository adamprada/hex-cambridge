photoelectron spectroscopy is typically discussed in terms of the electronic structure and bonding in the ground states of neutral molecules with ionization of electrons occurring from bonding molecular orbitals lone pairs antibonding molecular orbitals or atomic cores these descriptions reflect the relationship of ionization energies to the molecular orbital model of electronic structure ionization energies are directly related to the energies of molecular orbitals by koopmans theorem which states that the negative of the eigenvalue of an occupied orbital from a hartreefock calculation is equal to the vertical ionization energy to the ion state formed by removal of an electron
