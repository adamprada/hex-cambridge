the positive ions figure within koopmans theorem the energies of the orbitals epsilon have an attractively simple physical interpretation they give the amount of energy necessary to remove ionize the electron out of the molecular orbital which corresponds to the negative of the experimentally observable ionization potential cc bync Ã¼mit kaya koopmans theorem koopmans theorem argues that the negative of the eigenvalue of an occupied orbital from a hartreefock calculation is equal to the vertical ionization energy to the ion state formed by removal of an electron from that orbital several different ionization energies can be defined depending on the
