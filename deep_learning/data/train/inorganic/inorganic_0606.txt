gives the largest overlap with the v wavefunction this is the most probable transition and usually corresponds to the vertical transition where the internuclear separations of the ionic state are similar to those of the ground state figure difference between vertical and adiabatic ionization energies for a simple harmonic oscillator system cc bync Ã¼mit kaya the geometry of an ion may be different from the neutral molecule the measured ionzation energy in a pes experiment can refer to the vertical ionization energy in which case the ion is in the same geometry as the neutral or to the adiabatic ionzaiton
