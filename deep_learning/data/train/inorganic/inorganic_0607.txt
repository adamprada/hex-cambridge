ionization energy also called adiabatic ionization energy is the lowest energy required to effect the removal of an electron from a molecule or atom and corresponds to the transition from the lowest electronic vibrational and rotational level of the isolated molecule to the lowest electronic vibrational and rotational level of the isolated ion the binding energy also called vertical ionization energy is the energy change corresponding to an ionization reaction leading to formation of the ion in a configuration which is the same as that of the equilibrium geometry of the ground state neutral molecule the workfunction is the minimum
