in a pes molecular orbital then the removal of an electron from that molecular orbital induces a significant change in the bonding in this case an increase in the bond length since the bond order has been reduced example molecular nitrogen diatomic nitrogen is more complex than hydrogen since multiple molecular orbitals are occupied four molecular orbitals are occupied the two orbitals are both occupied the uv photoelectron spectrum of has three bands corresponding to and occupied molecular orbitals both and are weakly bonding and antibonding the orbital is not resolved in this spectrum since the incident light used did
