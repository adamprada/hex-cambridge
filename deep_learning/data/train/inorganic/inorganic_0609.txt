as a result only the bonding σ orbital is occupied by electrons giving a bond order of cc bync ümit kaya important aspects of molecular orbital diagram in figure the h s energy lies well above the cl s and p atomic orbitals the valence electron configuration can be written σπ the h s orbital contributes only to the σ molecular orbitals as does one of the cl p orbitals hence the lines in figure connecting these atomic orbitals and the σ and σ molecular orbitals the remaining cl p orbitals ie those perpendicular to the bond axis are unaffected
