molecular orbitals are not observed since the incident photon energy is below their ionization energies water in the simplified valence bond theory perspective of the water molecule the oxygen atom form four hybrid orbitals two of these are occupied by the two lone pairs on the oxygen atom while the other two are used for bonding within the molecular orbital picture the electronic configuration of the molecule is where the symbols and are orbital labels based on molecular symmetry that will be discussed later figure within koopmans theorem the energy of the b homo corresponds to the ionization energy to
