ionized states the molecular orbital perspective has the lone pair in different orbitals one in a nonbonding orbital and one in the bonding orbitals we tern to the photoelectron spectroscopy to help identify which theory is more accurate ie describes reality better the photoelectron spectrum of water in figure can be interpreted as having three major peaks with some fine structure arises from vibrational energy changes the light source used in this experiment is not sufficiently energetic to ionize electrons from the lowest lying molecular orbitals figure photoelectron spectrum of water note the energy axes is flipped compared to other
