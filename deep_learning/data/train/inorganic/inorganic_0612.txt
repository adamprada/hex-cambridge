and bare little relationship to the familiar center bonds used in valence bond theory for example the and molecular orbitals all have contributions from all three atoms they are really centered molecular orbitals the bonds however can be thought of as representing a build up of the total electron density which loosely put is a total of all the orbital contributions despire this we keep the ideas of hybridization and center bonds because they are useful not because they represent reality summary a photoelecton spectrum can show the relative energies of occupied molecular orbitals by ionization ie ejection of an
