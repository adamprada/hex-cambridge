contribution of chemistry and chemists to the preparation of materials and their structural analysis has been greater than that of other branches of science material science is the application of the fundamental physical properties of materials such that basic theories and their applications converge therefore by surveying the applications in such fields the outlines of research themes and their purposes can be understood important inorganic materials are surveyed from the chemical point of view by focusing on the relationship between preparation and isolation and structure and physical properties a electric properties a semiconductor is an electrical conductor with electrical resistance
