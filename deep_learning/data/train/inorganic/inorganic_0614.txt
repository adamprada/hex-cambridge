group iv element and has four valenceelectrons although silicon semiconductors currently represent or more of all semiconductors isoelectronic compounds of iivi or iiiv groups form compound semiconductors and are also used for optical or ultra highspeed electronic devices for example zns cds gaas inp etc are typical compound semiconductors and the development of technologies to grow single crystals of these materials is remarkable light emitting diodes led or semiconductor lasers are important applications of compound semiconductors as thin films of compound semiconductors are made by mbe molecular beam epitaxy or mocvd metallorganic chemical vapor deposition special organometallic compounds such as
