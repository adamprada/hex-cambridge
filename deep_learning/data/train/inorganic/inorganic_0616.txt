the oxygen content is nonstoichiometric figure an electron donor and acceptor in a complex superconductor on the other hand molecular superconductors have also been studied representative donoracceptor complexes are composed of ttf and bedtttf figure as electron donors and clo or nidmit as electron acceptors the first example of this kind of superconductor was discovered in and of the about complexes known at present the highest tc is k recently fullerene c doped with alkali metals showed a tc of about k although thousands of superconductors are known only a few of them find ap pound superconductors are very brittle
