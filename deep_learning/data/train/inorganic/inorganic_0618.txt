or crystalline cro is added to it to improve its magnetic properties recording materials as well as semiconductor devices are indispensable to our modern informationoriented society and the role played by inorganic chemistry in the improvement of the performance of these materials is significant recently ferromagnetism of organic compounds or metal complexes has been discovered in which unpaired spins are aligned parallel in a molecule and coupled ferromagnetically the study of molecular magnets has the subject of intensive investigation molecular design to couple paramagnetic metal complexes and to make spins parallel is an interesting subject in coordination chemistry c optical
