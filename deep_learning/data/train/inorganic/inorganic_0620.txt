of these studies although the is distant it is considerably difficult quantitatively to explain the thermal stability of a known inorganic compound using our present knowledge of theoretical chemistry and it is almost impossible fully to design compounds by a rational method although the selectivity of a catalytic reaction can be explained to some extent the theoretical calculation of a reaction rate remains difficult the relation between superconductivity and structure is not understood well and critical temperatures cannot be predicted many of the structures and functions of the metalloenzymes that are the basis of biological activities are unknown the research
