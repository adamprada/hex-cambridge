cyclic hfx species are present in the gas phase warning causes burns that are slow to heal or even get progressively worse exercise extreme caution if using this solvent very few compounds exist which are strong enough f acceptors to be considered acids an example is which leads to pure hf having superacid properties pure hf has a dielectric constant of and is a good solvent like water which is surprisingly gentle it can be used for example to remove fe from metalloproteins without damaging the apoprotein primary structure no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is
