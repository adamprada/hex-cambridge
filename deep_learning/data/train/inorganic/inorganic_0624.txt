and one π bond carbon dioxide is an important reagent used in industry is a cental aspect of our global carbon cycle and is the basis for climate change lastly molecular orbital mo theory is a better tool to use than vb theory because it does not assume localization of electrons mo theory is based on linear combinations of atomic orbitals lcao mo theory mo theory is used to predict bonding antibonding and nonbonding orbitals antibonding orbitals are always higher in energy than corresonding bonding orbitals antibonding orbitals are usually indicated with an for example σsigma antibonding and σsigma bonding
