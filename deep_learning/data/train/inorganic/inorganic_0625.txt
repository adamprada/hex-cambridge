a c atom and an oo ligand fragment carbon has s and pxyz orbitals and the oo fragment has s and pxyz orbitals that are involved in the formation of molecular orbitals since co has dh symmetry the central atoms orbital symmetry lables can be obtained from the corresponding point group table sσg pzσu and pxyπu the lgo symmetry lables can be calculated using the point group table as well γσσg σu and γππg πu the mo diagram for co is more complicated than the diagram for b the follwing diagram fails to label orbital symmetries but the lgo pxy
