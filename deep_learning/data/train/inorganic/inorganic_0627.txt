is a complete set of irreducible representations for a point group a molecules point group can be determined by either elucidating each symmetry element contained in a molecule or by properly using the schreiber chart see below point groups usually consist of but are not limited to the following elements e the identity operator this operation leaves a molecule completely unchanged and exists for mathematical purposes cn the cn proper axis of rotation is a n rotation that when performed leaves a molecule the same a proper rotation with the highest value of n is known as the major axis
