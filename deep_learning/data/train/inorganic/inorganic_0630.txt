called the activation barrier ea and so the reaction may proceed very slowly the thermodynamics describes only the starting and ending position of the reaction and not the intermediate or transition state if the kinetics is slow a is described as being inert while if it proceeds quickly then a is described as being labile the conditions that distinguish them are if the reaction takes longer than minute under the conditions of concentration m temperature c then it is inert if under the same conditions the reaction time minute then it is labile in the lecture on isomerism we depend
