ph as noted above these diagrams are essentially phase diagrams that map the conditions of potential and ph most typically in aqueous solutions where different redox species are stable we saw a simple example of such a diagram in section for ho typically the water redox reactions are plotted as dotted lines on these more complicated diagrams for other elements the lines in pourbaix diagrams represent redox and acidbase reactions and are the parts of the diagram where two species can exist in equilibrium for example in the pourbaix diagram for fe below the horizontal line between the fe and
