near the h line saturating the water with air or oxygen moves the system closer to the o line where the most stable species is feo and the corrosion reaction is this oxidation reaction is orders of magnitude slower because the oxide that is formed passivates the surface therefore iron corrodes much more slowly in oxygenated solutions more generally iron and other active metals are passivated whenever they oxidize to produce a solid product and corrode whenever the product is ionic and soluble this behavior can be summed up on the colorcoded pourbaix diagram below the red and green regions
