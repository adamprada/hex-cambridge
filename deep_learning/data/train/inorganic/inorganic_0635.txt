in the activity series is also in contact with the solution and slowly corrodes so it must eventually be replaced in some cases a battery or dc power supply the anode of which oxidizes water to oxygen in the solution is used instead to apply a negative bias the white patches visible on the ships hull are zinc block sacrificial anodes another common mode of corrosion of iron and carbon steel is differential aeration in this case part of the iron object eg the base of a bridge or the drill in an oil rig is under water or in
