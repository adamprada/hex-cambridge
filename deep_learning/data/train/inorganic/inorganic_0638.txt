strongly basic organic fluorination reactions are often done in strongly acidic media such as anhydrous hf understanding the familiar chemistry of acids and bases in water helps us understand how these nonaqueous media work the acidic or basic environment of metal ions affects the stability of their oxidation states we will learn more about this in chapter transition metal complexes coordination compounds and organometallic compounds are essentially lewis acidbase complexes we can understand a great deal about their stability and reactivity by considering the acidbase character of metals and ligands we will learn about this in chapter solid acid catalysts
