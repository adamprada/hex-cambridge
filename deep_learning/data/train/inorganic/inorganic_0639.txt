however the mo description of bonding is conceptually difficult and mathematically intensive this chapter will review less rigorous but still useful models such as lewis dot structures and valence shell electronpair repulsion vsepr theory when combined with a qualitative quantum mechanical description of bonding through the concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance these simple models can help us understand a great deal about the structures stabilities and reactions of inorganic molecules ballandstick representation of chemical bonding in the molecules po and ps the theory of chemical bonding has a long history dating back to ancient greece and the atomists democritus
