commonly found in coordination complexes are neutral molecules ho nh organic bases such as pyridine co no h ethylene and phosphines pr and anions halides cn scn cyclopentadienide ch h etc the resulting complexes can be cationic eg cunh neutral ptnhcl or anionic fecn as we will see below ligands that have weak or negligible strength as br√∏nsted bases for example co cn ho and cl can still be potent lewis bases in forming transition metal complexes with ligands that are lewis bases coordinate covalent bonds also called dative bonds are typically drawn as lines or sometimes as arrows to
