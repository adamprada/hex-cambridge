storing gases especially h and co mof has a volumetric storage density of g hl close to that of liquid h when writing out the formulas of coordination compounds we use square brackets around the metal ions and ligands that are directly bonded to each other thus the compound conhclcl contains octahedral conhcl ions in which five ammonia molecules and one chloride ion are directly bonded to the metal and two cl anions that are not coordinated to the metal history coordination compounds have been known for centuries but their structures were initially not understood for example prussian blue which
