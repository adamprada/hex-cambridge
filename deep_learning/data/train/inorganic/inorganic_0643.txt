the observation that chemically different forms isomers of transition metal complexes such as conhclcl could be made the puzzle was solved by alfred werner who proposed in that these co complexes contained octahedrally coordinated metal ions that made primary covalent bonds to six ligands werner showed through conductivity measurements that solutions of coclnh contained three free cl anions and one conh cation per formula unit magnetic susceptibility measurements later confirmed the presence of diamagnetic co in both the salt and its solutions werners theory also explained the existence of two and only two structural isomers for conhcl cisconh cl transconh
