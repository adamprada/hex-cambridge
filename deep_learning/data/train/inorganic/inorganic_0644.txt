will in turn help us understand in a more quantitative way some of the heuristic concepts we have learned about in earlier chapters such as hardsoft acidbase theory at ordinary pressures the cscl structure is adopted by only three of the alkali halides cscl csbr and csi under high pressure however other alkali halides transform from the nacl to the cscl structure because of the higher madelung constant of cscl no headers as we noted in our discussion of metal and alloy structures in chapter there is an intimate connection between the structures and the physical properties of materials as
