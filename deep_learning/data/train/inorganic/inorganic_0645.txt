cell like nacl the pyrite crystal structure can be thought of as a facecentered cubic array of anions s with cations fe occupying all the octahedral holes inorganic solids often have simple crystal structures and some of these structures are adopted by large families of ionic or covalent compounds examples of the most common structures include nacl cscl nias zincblende wurtzite fluorite perovskite rutile and spinel we will develop these structures systematically from the close packed and nonclose packed lattices shown below some layered structures such as cdcl and cdi can be thought of as relatives of simple ionic lattices
