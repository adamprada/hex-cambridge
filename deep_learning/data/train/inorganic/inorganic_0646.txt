metals in the periodic table have relatively simple structures and so this is a good place to begin we will see in chapter that the structures of more complex compounds are also in many cases related to the simple structures of metals and alloys over of the elements in the periodic table exist in their pure form as metals all elemental metals except the three cs ga hg that are liquid are crystalline solids at room temperature and most have one of three simple crystal structures no headers valence bond vb theory gave us a qualitative picture of chemical bonding
