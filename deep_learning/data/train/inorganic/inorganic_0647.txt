precisely usually we settle for simplified models here too these simple models do not give very accurate orbital and bond energies but they do explain concepts such as resonance eg in the ferrocene molecule that are hard to represent otherwise we can get more accurate energies from mo theory by computational number crunching while mo theory is more correct than vb theory and can be very accurate in predicting the properties of molecules it is also rather complicated even for fairly simple molecules for example you should have no trouble drawing the vb pictures for co nh and benzene but
