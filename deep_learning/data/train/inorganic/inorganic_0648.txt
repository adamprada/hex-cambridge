as in a car engine in a car engine hydrocarbons in the fuel are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water while oxygen is reduced to water corrosion ie the formation of rust on iron is a redox reaction involving oxidation of a metal oxidation states of vanadium in acidic solution from left to right the oxidation state goes from to these four oxidation states form the basis of the vanadium flow battery a storage device for electricity generated from sunlight and wind oxidationreduction reactions are important to understanding inorganic chemistry for several reasons transition metals can have multiple oxidation states
