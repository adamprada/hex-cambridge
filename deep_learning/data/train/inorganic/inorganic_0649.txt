power ie their standard electrode potential strong oxidizing agents are typically compounds with elements in high oxidation states or with high electronegativity which gain electrons in the redox reaction examples of strong oxidizers include hydrogen peroxide permanganate and osmium tetroxide reducing agents are typically electropositive elements such as hydrogen lithium sodium iron and aluminum which lose electrons in redox reactions hydrides compounds that contain hydrogen in the formal oxidation state such as sodium hydride sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride are often used as reducing agents in organic and organometallic reactions no headers predict the shape of the following complexes
