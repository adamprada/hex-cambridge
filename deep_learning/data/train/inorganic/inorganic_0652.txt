some metal ions the rate is so slow that it takes weeks for one water molecule to exchange for another in other cases the timescale of the exchange is nanoseconds a there is an overall trend in which the rate of exchange decreases as the oxidation state of the metal increases explain this trend in terms of crystal field stabilization energy cfse how is the cfse related to the activation energy of the water exchange reaction b explain any trends you observe for the rate of water exchange among divalent metal ions c cu has an anomalously fast ligand exchange
