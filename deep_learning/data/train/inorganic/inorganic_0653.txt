a noble gas atom draw a dorbital energy diagram for this ion and predict whether it should be diamagnetic or paramagnetic would you expect to be able to form a similar complex using cu in place of au or kr in place of xe why or why not for the reaction cismocol co mocol l the reaction rate is found to vary by a factor of for two different ligands l but it is relatively insensitive to the pressure of co gas a what kind of mechanism does this reaction have b what are the signs of the activation volume
