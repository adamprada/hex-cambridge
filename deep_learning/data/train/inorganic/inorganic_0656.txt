attractive forces between molecules of water giving rise to waters high surface tension and capillary forces the capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity this property is relied upon by all vascular plants such as trees the boiling point of water like all other liquids is dependent on the barometric pressure for example on the top of mount everest water boils at c compared to c at sea level at a similar latitude since latitude modifies atmospheric pressure slightly conversely water deep in the ocean near geothermal vents
