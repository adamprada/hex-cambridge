hydrogen is a flammable gas when given off it is dangerous and the reaction of water with the more electropositive of these elements can be violently explosive so they are often stored in oil most known pure substances display simple behaviour when they are cooled they shrink liquids contract as they are cooled because the molecules move slower and they are less able to overcome the attractive intermolecular forces drawing them closer to each other once the freezing temperature is reached the substances solidify causing them to contract even more because crystalline solids are usually tightly packed water however water
