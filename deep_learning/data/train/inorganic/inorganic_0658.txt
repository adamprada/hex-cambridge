cooling to increase the density at c these opposing tendencies cancel out producing the density maximum since water expands to occupy a greater volume in the form of ice and is less dense it floats on liquid water as in icebergs fortunately this happens since in colder climates where water is susceptible to freezing if it all turned solid during the winter it would kill all the life within it the extended structure of the water molecule in liquid and solid form seen in the models below provides the explanation for the variation of density with temperature topic hierarchy no
