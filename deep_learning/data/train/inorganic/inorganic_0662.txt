equilibrium constant of a ligand substitution reaction is called a formation or stability constant the concept and the method of computing successive formation constants were proposed by n bjerrum equilibrium constants for the replacement of a hydrated ion m by other ligands l in an aqueous solution are m l rightarrow ml qquad qquad k fracmlml ml l rightarrow ml qquad qquad k fracmlmll ml l rightarrow ml qquad qquad k fracmlmll mln l rightarrow mln qquad qquad kn fracmlnmlnl and the overall formation constant is the thermodynamic stability of a substitution product becomes larger as the formation constant increases
