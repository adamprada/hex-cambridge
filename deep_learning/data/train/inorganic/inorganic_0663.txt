associative mechanism if the substitution rate of a ligand substitution of a complex is dependant upon the entering ligand y coordinating to the central metal and is insensitive to the leaving ligand x it is presumed to take the associative mechanism which increases the coordination number such a substitution reaction is often seen in planar tetracoordinate ptii complexes and the intermediate species are triangular bipyramidal pentacoordinate complexes the reaction is firstorder with respect to both the tetracoordinate complex and y and is secondorder as a whole since it is accompanied by a reduction of molecular species in the intermediate stage
