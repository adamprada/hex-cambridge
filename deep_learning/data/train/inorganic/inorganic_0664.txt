in the intermediate state this is often observed in octahedral hexacoordinate complexes and the intermediate states are pentacoordinate complexes that form by the elimination of x as the elimination is accompanied by an increase of molecular species in the intermediate stage the entropy of activation s becomes positive exercise the order of the rate of ligand substitution of ptii complexes is ho cl i pr cn for entering ligands which mechanism associative or dissociative do the substitutions take answer since they are dependent on the entering ligands the associative mechanism is more likely trans effect in squareplanar tetracoordinate complexes typically
