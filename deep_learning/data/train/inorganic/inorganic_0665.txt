of maingroup and transition metals differ greatly depending upon the identity of the metal species since the rate of water ligand exchange is well correlated withthe exchange rates of other ligands it is useful for general comparison of the exchange rates in the complexes of different metal ions for alkali and alkaline earth metals the exchange rates are very high s and the complexes of these metals are classified as labile as the dissociative mechanism is generally found in these cases ions with smaller ionicity and of larger size attract water ligands less and their exchange rates becomes higher in
