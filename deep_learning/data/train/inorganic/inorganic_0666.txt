ligandexchange rates of d and d transition metal complexes are generally slow test tube experiments easy chemical or biological reactions performed in test tubes are sometimes called test tube experiments solutions in test tubes are mixed at room temperature in air and the mixture is shaken to observe a color change or formation of precipitates and the results of the reactions are speculated on university professors occasionally attempt these sorts of experiments although easy these simple experiments show only the effects of visible light absorption and solubility however since even great discoveries can be born from such experiments they should
