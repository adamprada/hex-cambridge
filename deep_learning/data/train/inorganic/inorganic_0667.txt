that craq was converted into crho via green hocrcl this reaction established the innersphere electron transfer mechanism in which a coclcr bridge forms between co and cr and led to the nobel prize in a later year b redox reactions the oxidation number of the central metal in a transitionmetal compound can vary in a few steps from low to high namely the oxidation state of a compound is changeable by redox reactions as a consequence of this the bond distance and the bond angle between the metal and coordinating elements or between metals change and at times the whole
