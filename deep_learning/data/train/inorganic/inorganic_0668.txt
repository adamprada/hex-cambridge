which a bridging ligand is shared between two metals is called the innersphere mechanism and the one involving a direct transfer of electrons between two metals without a bridging ligand is called the outersphere mechanism innersphere mechanism when coclnh is reduced by croh an intermediate complex nhcoclcroh is formed in which the chlorine atom forms a bridge between cobalt and chromium as a result of an electron transfer from chromium to cobalt through chlorine conhcl in which cobalt is reduced from a trivalent to a divalent oxidation state and croh in which chromium is oxidized from a divalent to a
