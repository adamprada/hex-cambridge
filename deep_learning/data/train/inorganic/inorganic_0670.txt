is obtained recrystallization depends on different solubilities of the target compound and other compounds present in the impure mixture the goal of this method is to have one compound dissolved in a solvent while the other compound is not dissolved if one compound is an undissolved solid it can be filtered out of the solution in order to separate it from all the other things that are in solution solubility in a solvent is a physical property of a material just like its boiling point or melting point sodium chloride table salt has a particular solubility in cold water g
