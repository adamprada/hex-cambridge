and sodium oleate could be purified through the addition of water if the right amount of water were added and the resulting slurry were stirred together and filtered much of the sodium chloride would be removed because it is more soluble in water than is sodium oleate sodium oleate is less soluble in water than is sodium chloride so most of it would not dissolve it could be gathered or isolated by filtration the technique described above is not recrystallization it is referred to as washing the sodium oleate was washed with water to remove sodium chloride washing is simple
