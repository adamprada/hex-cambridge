exposed sodium chloride but it wouldnt touch the hidden or occluded sodium chloride that was surrounded by sodium oleate molecules stop and think how can you get all of the sodium chloride out of this mixture in other words how can you make sure there is no sodium chloride covered by sodium oleate it would be convenient if there were a switch that could be turned on and off to control dissolution when the switch is on all the sodium oleate dissolves and any sodium chloride trapped inside can get dissolved too when the switch is off the sodium oleate
