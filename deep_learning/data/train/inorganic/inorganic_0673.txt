again this solid can be filtered away from the water stop and think after filtration list the contents of the solution instead of filtering can the solution be allowed to evaporate to leave the sodium oleate behind there is one more part of this process that would make it a complete recrystallization if the sodium oleate forms an amorphous solid when it comes back out of solution we have precipitation if the sodium oleate forms a crystalline solid when it comes back out of solution we have recrystallization an amorphous solid contains molecules that are packed together in random ways
