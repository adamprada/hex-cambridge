the value of e effectively by changing the concentrations of free metal ions we can use the nernst equation to calculate the value of e from the equilibrium constant for the coupled reaction alternatively we can measure the halfcell potential with and without the coupled reaction to get the value of the equilibrium constant this is one of the best ways to measure ksp ka and kd values as an example we consider the complexation of fe and fe by cn ions which oxidation state of fe is more strongly complexed by cn we can answer this question by measuring
