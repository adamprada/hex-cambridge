and in this case we can calculate e v it follows from nfe Î´g rtlnk that thus we find that fecn is about a million times more stable as a complex than fecn solubility equlibria we can use a similar procedure to measure ksp values electrochemically for example the silver halides agcl agbr agi are sparingly soluble we can calculate the ksp of agcl by measuring the standard potential of the agclag couple this can be done very simply by measuring the potential of a silver wire which is in contact with solid agcl and m claq against a hydrogen
