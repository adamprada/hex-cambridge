that the disproportionation reaction is spontaneous at ph h m from the latimer diagram or frost plot however when we properly balance this half reaction we see that it involves protons as a reactant by le chateliers principle it follows that removing protons increasing the ph should stabilize the reactant mno thus we would expect the oxidation state of mn which is unstable in acid to be stabilized in basic media we will examine these protoncoupled redox equilibria more thoroughly in the context of pourbaix diagrams below acid mine drainage occurs when sulfide rocks such as pyrite fes are exposed
