of protons and neutrons in its nucleus since the rest mass of proton and neutrons are too small to regard to calculate the actual mass of an atom seems inconvenient for scientists in order to solve this problem relative atomic mass ar which unit is defined as th of the mass of carbon atom is introduced introduction the calculated relative atomic mass is not the mass of exact atom it is a ratio of actual mass respect to the th of the mass of carbon atom relative atomic mass has unit of according to the equation since kg at the
