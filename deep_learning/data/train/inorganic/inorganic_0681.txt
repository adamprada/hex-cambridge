the relative atomic mass for oxygen the contribution of this value is to make calculation much easier calculating relative atomic mass of an element with isotopes most of the elements in the world have isotopes therefore relative atomic mass for one element is expanded to the average mass of the naturally occurring isotopes of the element this quantity takes into account the percentage abundance of all the isotopes of an element which exist for example there are two naturally occurring isotopes of chlorine cl and cl hence the ar for cl should be the average of value of each isotopes
