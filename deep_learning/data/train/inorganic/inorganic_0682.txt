sample is found to be h h and h calculate the relative atomic mass for hydrogen what is the relationship between relative atomic mass and isotopes solutions relative atomic massweighted average of relative isotopes masses no headers the dielectric constant symbol Îµ of a solvent is a measure of its polarity the higher the dielectric constant of a solvent the more polar it is eg the dielectric constant of water is higher than that of methanol water is more polar than methanol one practical consequence is a covalent solute dissociates into ions to a greater extent in water than in
