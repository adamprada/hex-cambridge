of a solvent and its dipolar moment graph no headers the solution to the problem above must consider the quantum mechanical nature of the electron the valence electrons in na metal are in orbitals that are delocalized over the entire crystal however in the na e salt form the electrons are localized on specific anion sites this localization imparts an additional kinetic energy via the particle in a box effect that adds to the total energy from the quantum mechanical result for a particle in a onedimensional box we obtain where h planks constant x j s n energy level
