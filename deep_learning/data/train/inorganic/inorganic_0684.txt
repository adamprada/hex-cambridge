metals the situation is entirely analogous to the stabilization of aromatic molecules by electron delocalization in molecules like benzene resonance is also a quantummechanical kinetic energy effect in general the resonance stabilization energy is significantly larger in metals than it is in πdelocalized organic molecules for example the resonance energy of the six πelectrons in benzene is approximately kjmol less than half of the value we have calculated per electron in sodium metal interestingly several of the alkali metals and other metallic elements transform at ultrahigh pressures to optically transparent insulating phases in which the valence electrons are localized these
