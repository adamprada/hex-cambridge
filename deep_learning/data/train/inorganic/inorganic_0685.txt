that are more properly formulated as electrides ie as cane and caaloe in these compounds the ca al o and n atoms have their ordinary octet oxidation states and respectively and electrons act as anions filling in cagelike voids or layers in the crystal for example can adopts the anticdcl structure as shown at the right with void spaces between layers that are occupied by a d gas of electrons like other layered materials can can be easily delaminated into thin nanosheets while retaining its structure and properties as an electride these compounds are powerful reducing agents and also have
