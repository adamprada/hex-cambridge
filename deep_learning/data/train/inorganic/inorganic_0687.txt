many ways a crystal can depart itself from order thus experiences defects these defects can be grouped in different categories such as point defects line defects planar defects or volume or bulk defects we will focus on point defects specifically the defect that occurs in ionic crystal structures ie nacl called the schottky defect point defects lattice structures or crystals undergoing point defects experience one of two types atoms or ions leaving their spot thus creating vacancies atoms or ions slipping into the little gaps in between other atoms or ions those little gaps are known as interstitialssince atoms or
