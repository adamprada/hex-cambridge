nonmetal notice the figure has exactly one cation and one anion vacating their sites that is what defines a one schottky defect for a crystal of mx formulafor every cation that vacant its site the same number of anion will follow suit essentially the vacant sites come in pairs this also means the crystal will neither be too positive or too negative because the crystal will always be in equilibrium in respect to the number of anions and cations it is possible to approximate the number of schottky defects ns in a mx ionic crystal compound by using the equation
