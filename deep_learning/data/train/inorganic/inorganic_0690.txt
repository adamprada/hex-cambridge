mx is when two anions and three cations leave their sites no headers selfionization of ammonia is much weaker than water with k since ammonia is better proton acceptor than water the ionization of acids is relatively enhanced in liquid ammonia for example acetic acid is a strong acid in liquid ammonia liquid ammonia will therefore tolerate very strong bases such as that would otherwise be hydrolyzed in water ammonia is kinetically stabilized to reduction but easily oxidized by many reagents eg the reaction and is very favorable but slow in the absence of a catalyst such as fe no
