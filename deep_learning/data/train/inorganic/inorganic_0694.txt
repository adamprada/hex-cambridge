relation to quantum numbers every atom has four quantum numbers but the only one that matters in the size of the atom is the quantum number n as n increases so does the size of the orbital as n decreaes the size of the orbital decreases as well size of orbitals and atomic radii the size of the orbital determines the radius of an atom as you go down a group on the periodic table the size of the orbital increases meaning the atomic radius increases as well the increase of size in the orbital is due to the increase
