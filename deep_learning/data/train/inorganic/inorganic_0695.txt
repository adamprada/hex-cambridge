atomic radii of cations and anions follow a different trend compared to the neutral atoms cations have less electrons than their neutral atoms since there are less electrons they are more attracted to the increased positvie charge at the nucleus the electrons pack themselves closely to the nucleus which leads to a decrease in the atomic radius anions have more electrons than their neutral atoms because there are more electrons repulsion within that ion is high the repulsion between electrons cause the electrons to spread out as far away from each other as possible the spreading of the electrons within
