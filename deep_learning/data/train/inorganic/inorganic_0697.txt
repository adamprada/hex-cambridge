a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement this provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity while this flow of electrons occurs the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud this type of bond is called a metallic bond cubic and hexagonal close packing crystalline solids consist of repeating patterns of its components in three dimensions a crystal lattice and can be represented by drawing the structure of the smallest identical units that when stacked together form the crystal this basic repeating
