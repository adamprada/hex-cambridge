relative to others it can be envisaged that for a regular buildup of layers hexagonal close packing has alternate layers positioned directly abovebelow each other abab cubic close packed face centered cubic has every third layer directly abovebelow each other abcabc body centred cubic this is not a close packed structure here each metal atom is at the centre of a cube with nearest neighbors however the atoms at the centres of the adjacent cubes are only approximately further away so the coordination number can therefore be considered to be when these are included note that if the body centered
