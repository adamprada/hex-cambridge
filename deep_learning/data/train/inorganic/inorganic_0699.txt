but in transition metal groups with incomplete dorbital subshells the heavier elements have higher melting points for a given period the melting points reach a maximum at around group and then fall with increasing atomic number mercury caesium and gallium have melting points below c whereas all the other metals have sufficiently high melting points to be solids at room temperature the structures of the metals can be summarised by the table below which shows that most metals crystallise in roughly equal amounts of bcc hcp and ccp lattices crystal structure of metallic elements in the periodic table h he
