am designation refers to an ammonia solution analogous to aq used to indicate aqueous solutions without a catalyst the reaction in equation ref tends to be rather slow in many cases the alkali metal amide salt mnh is not very soluble in liquid ammonia and precipitates but when dissolved very concentrated solutions of the alkali metal are produced one mole of cs metal for example will dissolve in as little as ml g of liquid ammonia the pure metal is easily recovered when the ammonia evaporates figure solvated electrons the presence of solvated electrons e nh in solutions of alkali
