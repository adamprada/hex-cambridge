as the concentration of the metal increases above m the color changes to metallic bronze or gold and the conductivity increases to a value comparable with that of the pure liquid metals figure alkali metalliquid ammonia solutions most metals are insoluble in virtually all solvents but the alkali metals and the heavier alkaline earth metals dissolve readily in liquid ammonia to form solvated metal cations and solvated electrons which give the solution a deep blue color image copyrighted by the most common sources of the hydride nucleophile are lithium aluminum hydride lialh and sodium borohydride nabh note the hydride anion
