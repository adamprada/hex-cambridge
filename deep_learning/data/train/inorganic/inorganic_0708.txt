field ligands the spectrochemical series ranks ligands according the energy difference Î´o between the tg and eg orbitals in their octahedral complexes this energy difference is measured in the spectral transition between these levels which often lies in the visible part of the spectrum and is responsible for the colors of complexes with partially filled dorbitals ligands that produce a large splitting are called strong field ligands and those that produce a small splitting are called weak field ligands an abbreviated spectrochemical series is weak field i br cl no f oh ho pyridine nh no cn co strong field
