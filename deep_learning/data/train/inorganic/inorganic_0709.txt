strong field ligands water is a weak field ligand the electronegative o atom is strongly electronwithdrawing so there is poor orbital overlap between the electron pair on o and a metal dorbital the more electropositive c atom in the strong field ligand cn allows better orbital overlap and sharing of the electron pair note that cn typically coordinates metal ions through the c atom rather than the n atom cobalt ii complexes have different colors depending on the nature of the ligand in crystals of the red compound cobaltii nitrate dihydrate each cobalt ion is coordinated by six water molecules
