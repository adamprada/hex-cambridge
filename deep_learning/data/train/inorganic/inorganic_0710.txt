wavelength usually measured in cm energy gaps are often expressed by spectroscopists in terms of wavenumbers for example a red photon has a wavelength of about nm and a wavenumber of about cm in other energy units the same red photon has an energy of ev ev nm or kjmol ev kjmol if we compare this to the dissociation energy of a carboncarbon single bond kjmol we see that the cc bond has about twice the energy of a red photon we would need an ultraviolet photon e kjmol ev nm cm to break a cc bond we will see
