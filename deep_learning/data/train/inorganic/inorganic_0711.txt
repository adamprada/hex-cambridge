larger δo than co complexes in general elements in the nd and rd transition series the d and d elements have larger splitting than those in the d series for a given metal in one oxidation state eg co the trend in δo follows the spectrochemical series thus δo is larger for cocn which contains the strong field cn ligand than it is for coho with the weak field ligand ho the d and d elements are similar in their size and their chemistry in comparing δo values for complexes in the d d and d series eg comparing elements
