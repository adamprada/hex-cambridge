addition of protons to the nucleus in crossing the lanthanide series contracts the sizes of the atomic orbitals the important result is that the valence orbitals of the d and d elements have similar sizes and thus the elements resemble each other in their chemistry much more than they resemble their cousins in the d series for example the chemistry of ru is very similar to that of os as illustrated below but quite different from that of fe both os and ru form volatile molecular tetroxides mo oso is used in epoxidation reactions and as a stain in electron
