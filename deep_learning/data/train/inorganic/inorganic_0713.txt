in its salts and in concentrated solution because it absorbs in the green range conh is strawcolored because it absorbs in the blue range cocn looks red absorbs in the violet and ultraviolet part of the spectrum this is consistent with the idea that cn is a stronger field ligand than nh because the energy of a uv photon is higher than that of a redorange photon this method is applicable to most transition metal complexes as the majority of them absorb somewhere in the visible range nm to cm or have uv transitions that tail into the visible making
