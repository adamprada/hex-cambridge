from the combination of one s atomic orbital and three p atomic orbitals can then describe by four new wave functions equations ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz plotting any of these four wave functions gives a picture representation of a sp orbital each hybrid orbital consists of a large lobe and a small lobe pointing in two opposite direction figure the bond angle is o when the graphs of the four wave functions are combined the resulting picture shows the tetrahedral arrangement of the four
