it has scharacter and pcharacter since the s orbital is closer to the nucleus and thus lower in energy than the p orbital the electrons of sp hybridized species are held farther from the nucleus than those in sp scharacter and sp scharacter hybridized species the closer the electrons are to the nucleus the more stable they are therefore when bearing the negative charge sp species are less stable than sp and sp species put differently sp species are less likely to get deprotonated leaving a pair of electron behind hybridization and bond lengthbond strength the greater the scharacter the
