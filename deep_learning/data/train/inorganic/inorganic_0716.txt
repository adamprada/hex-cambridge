ch answers a and b just like the energy diagram in fig for carbon each sp orbital has electron for nitrogen the first sp orbital has electrons then one electron for each of the remaining three all of them dont for get the elctron pairs a and d carbon has four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals each orbital overlaps with a partially filled s atomic orbital of hydrogen to form sigma bonds to visualize hydrogen atoms are placed at the four corner of the tetrahedroncontributors quynh nhu nguyen normal vs inverse spinel structuremagnetism of ferrite spinelsferroelectric perovskites there are three more
