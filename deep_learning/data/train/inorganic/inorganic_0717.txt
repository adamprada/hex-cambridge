abo in the normal spinel structure there is a closepacked array of anions the asite cations fill of the tetrahedral holes and the bsite cations fill of the octahedral holes a polyhedral view of the normal spinel unit cell is shown at the left and a simplified view with the contents of the back half of the cell removed for clarity is shown above each unit cell contains eight formula units and has a composition abo inverse spinels have a closely related structure with the same large unit cell in which the asite ions and half of the bsite ions
