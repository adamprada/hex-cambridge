field stabilization energy cfse of ions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites for spinels that contain d elements such as cr mn fe co and ni the electron configuration is typically high spin because o is a weak field ligand as an example we can consider magnetite feo this compound contains one fe and two fe ions per formula unit so we could formulate it as a normal spinel fefeo or as an inverse spinel fefefeo which one would have the lowest energy dorbital energy diagram for fe first we consider the crystal field energy of the fe ion which
