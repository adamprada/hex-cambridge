on octahedral sites and feo is an inverse spinel fefefeo ferrites are compounds of general formula miifeo we can see that magnetite is one example of a ferrite with m fe other divalent metals m mg mn co ni zn also form ferrites ferrites can be normal or inverse spinels or mixed spinels depending on the cfse of the mii ion based on their cfse fe co and ni all have a strong preference for the octahedral site so those compounds are all inverse spinels znfeo is a normal spinel because the small zn ion d fits more easily into
