mn ion is a high spin d system with zero cfse the two mn ions are high spin d with higher cfse on the octahedral sites δo than on the tetrahedral site δt δo feo is an inverse spinel since the fe ion is a high spin d system with zero cfse fe is a high spin d system with more cfse on an octahedral site than on a tetrahedral one nifeo is again an inverse spinel since ni a d ion prefers the octahedral site and the cfse of fe a d ion is zero fecro is a normal
