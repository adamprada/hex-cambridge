of technological interest because of their magnetic ordering which can be ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the structure normal or inverse and the nature of the metal ions feo cofeo and nifeo are all inverse spinels and are ferrimagnets the latter two compounds are used in magnetic recording media and as deflection magnets respectively illustration of antiferromagnetic superexchange between two transition metal cations through a shared oxygen atom in order to understand the magnetism of ferrites we need to think about how the unpaired spins of metal ions are coupled in oxides if an oxide ion is shared by two
