crystal are coupled together identically it works out that ions on the tetrahedral sites will all have one orientation eg spin down and ions on all the octahedral sites will have the opposite orientation eg spin up if the number of spins on the two sites is the same then the solid will be antiferromagnetic however if the number of spins is unequal as in the case of feo cofeo and nifeo then the solid will be ferrimagnetic this is illustrated above for feo the spins on the fe sites cancel because half of them are up and half are
