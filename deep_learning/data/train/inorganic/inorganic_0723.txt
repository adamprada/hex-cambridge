is related to the fcc lattice in the sense that the a site cations and the three o atoms comprise a fcc lattice the bsite cations fill of the octahedral holes and are surrounded by six oxide anions abx perovskite structure a b and x are white blue and red respectively the coordination of the a ions in perovsite and the arrangement of bo octahedra is best understood by looking at the reo structure which is the same structure but with the asite cations removed in the polyhedral representation of the structure shown at the right it can be seen
