structure compounds with that structure can be reversibly intercalated by small ions such as li or h which then occupy sites in the cuboctahedral cavity for example smart windows that darken in bright sunlight contain the electrochromic material wo which has the reo structure in the sunlight a photovoltaic cell drives the reductive intercalation of wo according to the reaction wo is a light yellow compound containing d wvi in contrast hxwo which is mixedvalent wvwvi dd has a deep blue color such coloration is typical of mixedvalence transition metal complexes because their delectrons can be excited to delocalized conduction
