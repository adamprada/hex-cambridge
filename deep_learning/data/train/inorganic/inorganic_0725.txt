orthorhombic depending on whether the cation moves towards a vertex face or edge of the bo octahedron moving the cation offcenter in the octahedron creates an electric dipole in ferroelectrics these dipoles align in neighboring unit cells through cooperative rotation and tilting of octahedra the crystal thus acquires a net electrical polarization tetragonal distortion of the perovskite unit cell in the ferroelectric oxide pzt pbtixzrx ferroelectricity behaves analogously to ferromagnetism except that the polarization is electrical rather than magnetic in both cases there is a critical temperature tc above which the spontaneous polarization of the crystal disappears below tc the
