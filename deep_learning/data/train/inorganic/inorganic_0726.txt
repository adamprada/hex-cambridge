adressable magnetic memory halide perovskites abx x cl br i can be made by combining salts of monovalent a ions a cs nh rnh and divalent metal salts such as pbcl or pbi these compounds have sparked recent interest as light absorbers for thin film solar cells that produce electricity from sunlight lead and tin halide perovskites can be grown as thin films from solution precursors or by thermal evaporation at relatively low temperatures in some lead halide perovskites the mobility of electrons and holes is very high comparable to that of more expensive iiiv semiconductors such as gaas which
