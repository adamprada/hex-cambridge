also being structures the rutile structure can be described as a distorted version of the nias structure with half the cations removed recall that compounds with the nias structure were typically metallic because the metal ions are eclipsed along the stacking axis and thus are in relatively close contact in rutile the mo octahedra share edges along the tetragonal caxis and so some rutile oxides such as nbo ruo and iro are also metallic because of dorbital overlap along that axis these compounds are important as electrolyzer catalysts and catalyst supports because they combine high catalytic activity with good electronic
