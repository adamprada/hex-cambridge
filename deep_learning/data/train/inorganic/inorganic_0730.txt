they are kinetically inert because ligand substitution requires that they dissociate lose a ligand associate gain a ligand or interchange gain and lose ligands at the same time in the transition state these distortions in coordination geometry lead to a large activation energy if the cfse is large even if the product of the ligand exchange reaction is also a stable complex for this reason complexes of pt ir both low spin d and pt square planar d have very slow ligand exchange rates there are two other important factors that contribute to complex stability hardsoft interactions of metals and
