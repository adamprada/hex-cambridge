cycle for cuf the compound should be marginally stable Î´hfo kjmol with respect to the elements why then is cuf unknown to gain insight into this question we first construct a bornhaber cycle for the formation of cuf from the elements this compound is stable with respect to the elements by kjmol combining the two cycles we see that the disproportionation of cuf to cu and cuf is spontaneous from similar cycles we can also predict that the reaction auf auf au should be spontaneous why is the lowest oxidation state unstable for these fluorides the key point is that
