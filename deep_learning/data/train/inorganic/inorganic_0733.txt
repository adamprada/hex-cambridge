will give larger el values than iodides which have larger anions thus the disproportionation reaction becomes more favorable for cuf than it is for cui the stability of the lower vs higher oxidation state thus depends on the size of the anion for example in fluorides cuf is unstable but cuf is stable however in iodides cui is stable whereas cui is unstable from this we can develop a broad conclusion small anions of tend to stabilize higher oxidation states whereas large anions s br i stabilize lower oxidation states note that this trend has to do with the size
