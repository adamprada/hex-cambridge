with the positions of the cations and anions reversed figure figure unit cell of the fluorite structure from two equivalent perspectives in the antifluorite structure the blue positions are taken by the anion the red positions by the cation cc bysa paburr via source the same crystal structure is found in numerous ionic compounds with formula ab such as ceria ceo zirconia cubic zro uranium dioxide uo in the corresponding antistructure called the antifluorite structure anions and cations are swapped such as beryllium carbide bec or lithium oxide lio potassium sulfate kso contributors and attributions httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantistructure introductionapplicationsreferencescontributors this page is
