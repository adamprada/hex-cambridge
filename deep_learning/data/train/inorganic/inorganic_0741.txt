acids although it is not hazardous one should not prolong their exposure to cscl cscl is an ionic compound that can be prepared by the reaction figure coordination cubes public domain solid state via wikipedia cscl crystallize in a primitive cubic lattice which means the cubic unit cell has nodes only at its corners the structure of cscl can be seen as two interpenetrating cubes one of cs and one of cl the ions are not touching one another touching would cause repulsion between the anion and cation some may mistake the structure type of cscl with nacl but really
