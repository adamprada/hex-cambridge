and a bent shapecalcium fluoride is a polyatomic molecule that contains one calcium molecule and two fluoride molecules calcium fluoride is a quasilinear molecule the bonds are created from the single electrons of calcium and the single electron from fluoride has its electrons contained with in the d orbitals and are able to move between dyz and dz squared the molecule in linear when they are in the dz orbitals the molecule is also the most stable in this shape when the electrons are in the dyz orbitals the molecule becomes bent the molecule resonates between these two shapes making
