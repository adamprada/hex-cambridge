maps crystal structures according to the average principal quantum numbers of the atoms and their electronegativity difference the basic ideas behind such a plot are the greater the electronegativity difference the more ionic is the compound higher ionicity results in higher coordination numbers because anions like to surround cations and vice versa higher principal quantum numbers result in less sp hybridization less directional bonding and therefore higher coordination number we saw this trend before with the structures of elements in group iv descending the group the coordination number increases progressively from carbon to pb the lines in the mooserpearson diagram
