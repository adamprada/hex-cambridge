the perovskite structure unique a ferro and piezoelectric properties and high oxygen ion vacancy tolerance q list modern applications of the perovskite structure a sofcs ram devices and htscs q why are perovskite type materials especially useful in sofcs solid oxide fuel cells a high tolerance for oxygen ion deficiencies raises conductivity q what is the difference between cubic and orthorhombic perovskite a the dimensions of the orthorhombic unit cell are unequal q given that perovskites in an orthorhombic configuration have lattice constants of roughly a b and c angstromsa and using the figures above determine the density each calcium
