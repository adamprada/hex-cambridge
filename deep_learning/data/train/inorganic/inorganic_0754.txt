and fblock elements differs considerably this chapter describes the properties and chemistry of mainly dblock transition metals central metals properties of dblock transition metals differ considerably between the first d and the second series metals d although the differences in properties between the second and the third series d metals is not pronounced metallic radii of elements from scandium sc to copper cu to pm are significantly smaller than those of yttrium y to silver ag to pm or those of lanthanum la to gold au to pm further metal compounds of the first series transition metals are rarely coordinate
