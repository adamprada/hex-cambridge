the other hand whereas mii and miii compounds are common among the first series transition metals these oxidation states are generally uncommon in compounds of second and third series metals for example there are relatively few moiii or wiii compounds compared with many criii ones aqua ions ions with water ligands are very common among compounds of first series metals but few are known amongst the second and third metal compounds metal carbonyl cluster compounds of first series transition metals with mm bonds in low oxidation states exist but halide or sulfide cluster compounds are rare in general metalmetal bonds
