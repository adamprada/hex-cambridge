dblock transition metals are different not only in the upper and lower positions in the periodic table but also in the left and right groups the group to metals are now often referred to as early transition metals and they are generally oxophilic and halophilic smaller numbers of d electrons and the hardness of these elements explain their affinity toward hard oxygen and halogens in the absence of bridging ligands the formation of metalmetal bonds is difficult for these elements organometallic compounds of these metals are known strongly to activate ch bonds in hydrocarbons late transition metals in the groups
