coordinated by ligands are referred to as metal complexes most ligands are neutral or anionic substances but cationic ones such as the tropylium cation are also known neutral ligands such as ammonia nh or carbon monoxide co are independently stable molecules in their free states whereas anionic ligands such as cl or ch are stabilized only when they are coordinated to central metals representative ligands are listed in table according to the ligating elements common ligands or those with complicated chemical formula are expressed in abbreviated forms those ligands with a single ligating atom are called monodentate ligands and those
