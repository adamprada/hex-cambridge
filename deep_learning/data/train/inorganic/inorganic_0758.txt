determined by the size of the central metal the number of d electrons or steric effects arising from the ligands complexes with coordination numbers between and are known in particular to coordination are the most stable electronically and geometrically and complexes with these coordination numbers are the most numerous figure complexes with the respective coordination numbers are described below figure structure of coordination two coordinate complexes many electronrich d ions viz cu ag and au form linear complexes such as clagcl or hnaunh a zerovalent complex pdpcy with very bulky tricyclohexylphosphine ligands is also known generally stable coordinate complexes are
