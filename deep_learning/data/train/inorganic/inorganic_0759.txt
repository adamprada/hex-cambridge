reported examples include rhclpme irclcopme niclpet and ptclnh et ch cis and trans geometrical isomers are possible for complexes with two different kinds of ligands and were first noted when a werner synthesized coordinate ptclnh as tetrahedral complexes do not give geometrical isomers werner was able to conclude that his coordinate complexes were square planar recently cisptclnh cisplatin has been used for the treatment of tumors and it is noteworthy that only the cis isomer is active exercise write the formal name of cisptclnh answer cisdiamminedichloroplatinum five coordinate complexes trigonal bipyramidal dh feco or square pyramid cv vooh are examples
