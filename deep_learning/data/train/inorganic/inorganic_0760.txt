pseudorotation figure berrys pseudorotation six coordinate complexes when six ligands coordinate to a central metal octahedral oh coordination is the most stable geometry and the majority of such complexes assume this structure in particular there are a number of cr and co complexes which are inert to ligand exchange reactions represented by crnh or conh they have been particularly important in the history of the development of coordination chemistry moco rhcl etc are also octahedral complexes in the case of mixed ligands cis and transmab and mer and facmab geometrical isomers and for chelate ligands maa and maa optical isomers
