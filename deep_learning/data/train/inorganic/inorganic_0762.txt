replaced by triangular co ions because of this symmetry lowering transparent crystals calcite are birefringent as illustrated below calcite crystals are birefringent meaning that their refractive indices are different along the two principal crystal directions this gives rise to the phenomenon of double refraction nias structure the nacl structure can be described a facecentered cubic lattice with all of the octahedral holes filled what if we start with a hexagonalclose packed lattice rather than a facecentered cubic lattice nickel arsenide crystal structure the nias trigonal prisms are shaded gray one octahedron of six as atoms surrounding a ni atom is
