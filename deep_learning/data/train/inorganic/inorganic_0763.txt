eclipsed along the layer stacking axis are occupied by ni unlike the nacl structure where the anion and cation sites are interchangeable nias has unique anion and cation sites the layer stacking sequence for nias is shown below a c b c a c b c the nias structure cannot be adopted by ionic compounds because of the eclipsing cations because the cationcation repulsions would be internally destabilizing for an ionic compound this structure is mainly adopted by covalent and polar covalent mx compounds typically with soft x anions s se p as and lowvalent transition metal cations for example
