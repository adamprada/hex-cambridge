harlow pearson education why substitutional alloys occur bondingsummaryreferencesproblemssolutions when a molten metal is mixed with another substance there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form atom exchange or interstitial mechanism the relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur when the atoms are relatively similar in size the atom exchange method usually happens where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent this is called a substitutional alloy examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass in which some
