as conductors the different amount and strength of covalent bonds can change depending on the different specific metals involved and how they are mixed the covalent bonding is what is responsible for the crystal structure as well as the melting point and various other physical properties figure examples of substitutional metal alloys depending on the specific type of substitutional alloy they can have multiple crystal structures two of the possible structures include face center cubic left and cubic center cubic right the structure of the metal alloy is not limited to these two structures but combined they represent a large
