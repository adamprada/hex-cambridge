different from those of its constituent elements alloys can be formed by substituting one metal atom for another of similar size in the lattice substitutional alloys by inserting smaller atoms into holes in the metal lattice interstitial alloys or by a combination of both although the elemental composition of most alloys can vary over wide ranges certain metals combine in only fixed proportions to form intermetallic compo references smallman r e ngan a h w smallman r e physical metallurgy and advanced materials amsterdam butterworth heinemann wang f e bonding theory for metals and alloys amsterdam elsevier dickinson o t
