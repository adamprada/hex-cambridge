headers sometimes new symmetry operations form by carrying out two or more simpler operations successively to result in an indistinguishable configuration for example the improper rotation axis that was introduced in the last section results from rotation about an axis of rotation cn followed by reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis h note also that cn in this case need not be a symmetry element for the molecule for example staggered ethane has an s symmetry element although it does not have a c another example of a symmetry element that results from a combination of two different
