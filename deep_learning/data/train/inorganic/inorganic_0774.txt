rli and grignard reagents rmgx useful in a broad range of organic reactions linet deprotonates ch bonds to generate reactive carbanions rli and rmgx are powerful nucleophiles the use of superbases in nonaqueous media allows us to rank the acidities and measure the pkas of different classes of molecules this ranking is particularly important in understanding the reactions of organic molecules note that the order of acidities for hydrocarbons is alkynes alkenes aromatics alkanes this ordering has to do with the hybridization of the carbon atom that forms the carbanion the negatively charged lone pair of the carbanion is stabilized
