by no followed by reflection in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis sn symmetry operations and elements identity e all molecules have the identity element the identity operation is doing nothing to the molecule it doesnt rotate reflect or invertit just is proper rotation and proper axis cn a proper rotation is just a simple rotation operation about an axis the symbol for any proper rotation or proper axis is cn where n is the degree of rotation thus a rotation is a c rotation around a c axis and a rotation is a c rotation about a c
