center i the inversion operation requires a point of symmetry a center of symmetry within a molecule in other words a point at the center of the molecule that can transform xyz into xyz coordinate structures of tetrahedron triangles and pentagons lack an inversion center improper rotation sn improper rotation is a combination of a rotation with respect to an axis of rotation cn followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to that cn axis in short and sn operation is equivalent to cn followed by references introduction to molecular symmetry by j s ogden inorganic chemistry by catherine
