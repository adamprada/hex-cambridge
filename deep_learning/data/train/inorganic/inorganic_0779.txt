degree around the axis bisecting the c atom then it can be superimposed on the original molecule we then see the symmetry for the co why should all of the five symmetry elements be done on a molecule in order to find the point group the molecule belongs to why is performing only one or two of the symmetry elements not enough for recognizing the point group one or two of the symmetry elements will not be able to tell us everything about the molecules symmetry since those one or two properties do not tell us everything about the molecule
