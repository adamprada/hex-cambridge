elements should be done on the molecule in order to find the point group of the molecule why is important to find symmetry in molecules symmetry tells us about bounding for that molecular bonding no headers tetrahedral complexes are formed with late transition metal ions co cu zn cd and some early transition metals ti mn especially in situations where the ligands are large in these cases the small metal ion cannot easily accommodate a coordination number higher than four examples of tetrahedal ions and molecules are cocl mncl and tix x halogen tetrahedral coordination is also observed in some
