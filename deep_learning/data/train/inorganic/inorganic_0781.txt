the ligand lone pairs therefore these two orbitals form a low energy doubly degenerate e set the dxy dyz and dxz orbitals point at the edges of the cube and form a triply degenerate t set while the t orbitals have more overlap with the ligand orbitals than the e set they are still weakly interacting compared to the eg orbitals of an octahedral complex the resulting crystal field energy diagram is shown at the right the splitting energy δt is about the splitting of an octahedral complex formed with the same ligands for d elements δt is thus small
