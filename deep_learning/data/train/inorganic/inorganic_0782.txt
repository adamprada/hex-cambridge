gypsum that absorbs moisture from gases the indicator dye in drierite is cobalt ii chloride which is is a light pink when wet octahedral and deep blue when dry tetrahedral the reversible hydration reaction is deep blue tetrahedral cocl light pink octahedral coho no headers in ccp and hcp lattices there are two tetrahedral holes per packing atom a stoichiometry of either mx or mx gives a structure that fills all tetrahedral sites while an mx structure fills only half of the sites an example of an mx structure is fluorite caf whose structure is shown in the figure at
