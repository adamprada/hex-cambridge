terms of geometry ca is in cubic coordination with eight f neighbors and the fluoride ions are tetrahedrally coordinated by four ca ions the coordination geometry is consistent with the caf stoichiometry in all crystal structures the ratio of the coordination numbers is the inverse of the stoichiometric ratio the three interpenetrating fcc lattices have ca at etcf at etc and f at etc looking more closely at the tetrahedral sites in fluorite we see that they fall into two distinct groups t and t if a tetrahedron is oriented with a vertex pointing upwards along the stacking axis the
