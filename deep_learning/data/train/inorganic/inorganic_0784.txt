image tetrahedrally bonded compounds with a stoichiometry mx compounds have only half of the tetrahedral sites either the t or t sites filled in this case both the m and the x atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated the zincblende and wurtzite structures are tetrahedral structures based on fcc and hcp lattices respectively both structures are favored by pblock compounds that follow the octet rule and these compounds are usually semiconductors or insulators the zincblende structure shown below can be thought of as two interpenetrating fcc lattices one of anions and one of cations offset from each other by a translation of
