the chair version of cyclohexane the chair conformation allows for a relatively long distance between opposite atoms in the ring and as a result it is more sterically favorable than the boat form the sequence of closepacked layers in zincblende filling only the t sites and leaving the t sites empty is shown below a b t t b c t t c a t t the zincblende unit cell the wurtzite structure is a close relative of zinc blende based on filling half the tetrahedral holes in the hcp lattice like zincblende wurtzite contains planes of fused sixmembered rings
