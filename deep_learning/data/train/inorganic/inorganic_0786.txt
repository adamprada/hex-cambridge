and nhf the layered structure of wurtzite is abbaabb and the layer sequence with t sites filled is illustrated below a b t t b a t t a b t t b the chair and boat conformations of sixmembered zns rings in the wurtzite structure an interesting consequence of the layer stacking in the wurtzite structure is that the crystals are polar when cleaved along the caxis the stacking axis crystals of zno zns and gan have one negatively charged face and an opposite positively charged face an applied electric field interacts with the crystal dipole resulting in compression
