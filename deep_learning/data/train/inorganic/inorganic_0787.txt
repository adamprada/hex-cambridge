and is wurtzitetype the undistorted wurtzite and zinc blende structures are typically found for ax compounds with eight valence electrons which follow the octet rule ax compounds with nine or ten electrons such as gase and gaas crystallize in distorted variants of the wurtzite structure in gase the extra electrons form lone pairs and this creates layers in the structure as can be seen in the figure below to the right of gase the structures of as sb and sbas show an ever further breakdown of the structure into layers as more valence electrons are added hexagonal ice is the
