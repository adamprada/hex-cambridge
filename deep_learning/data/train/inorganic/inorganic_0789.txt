chemists when solving for lattice energy this equation proposed by max born and alfred landé states that lattice energy can be derived from ionic lattice based on electrostatic potential and the potential energy due to repulsion to solve for the bornlandé equation you must have a basic understanding of lattice energy lattice energy decreases as you go down a group as atomic radii goes up lattice energy goes down going across the periodic table atomic radii decreases therefore lattice energy increases the bornlandé equation was derived from these two following equations the first is the electrostatic potential energy with is
