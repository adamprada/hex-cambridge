by an ea and a ca each base is likewise characterized by its own eb and cb the e and c parameters refer respectively to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form these parameters have been empirically obtained by using enthalpies for adducts that form only Ïƒ bonds between the acid and base as well as adducts that have no steric repulsion between the acid and base this equation reproduces and predicts the enthalpy change h of a reaction between many acids and a bases h is a measure
