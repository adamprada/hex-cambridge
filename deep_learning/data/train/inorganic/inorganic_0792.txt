for the reaction of pyridine chn and bishexafloroacetyacetonatocopper ii cuhfacac shows how these parameters are used in this case w since neither the acid nor the base is a dimer selected parameters can be found at the wikipedia page for the ecw model however the ·êÉh calculated for the reaction of meb with men is less negative than that observed this discrepancy is attributed to steric repulsion between the methyl groups on the b and n atoms the difference between the calculated and observed values can then be taken as the amount of the steric effect a value otherwise not
