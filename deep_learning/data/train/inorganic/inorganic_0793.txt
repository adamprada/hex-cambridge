three lewis bases acetonitrile ammonia and dimethyl sulfide illustrates that there is no unique ordering of lewis base strengths the cramerbopp plot is a visual tool for comparing lewis base strengths with the range of possible lewis acid partners and similar plots can be constructed to examine selected lewis acids against the range of possible lewis bases these plots show that two properties are needed to completely define acid and base strength and that any attempt to define strength with one property or parameter is limited in its utility for dragos quantitative ecw model the two properties are electrostatic and
