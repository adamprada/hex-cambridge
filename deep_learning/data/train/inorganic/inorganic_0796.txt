linksproblemscontributors hydrogen is the simplest atoms which only contains an electron and a proton the ground state of hydrogen is the lowest allowed energy level and has zero angular momentum however it is the most stable state in which a single electron occupied the s atomic orbital introduction the third law of thermodynamics states that a system at absolute zero temperature exists in its ground state therefore its entropy is determined by the degeneracy of the ground statethe ground state is the lowest energy state and the energy of the ground sate is called zeropoint energy the diameter of a
