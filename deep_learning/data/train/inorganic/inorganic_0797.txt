ρsrψsrπaera next we need to consider that ρs is in spherical coordinates dvrsinφdr dθ dφ and then multiplied by r since ψs is spherically symmetric we have to integrate over θ and φ to get the radial probability density psrarera energy level of the ground state of hydrogen in order to find out the energy of the particle we used the equation ehnml where h is the planck constant n is the energy state m is the mass of the particle and l is the widththe ground state of hydrogen corresponds to energy level nthe principle quantum number thus langular
