nevertheless p is the most reactive form of phosphorus for example spontaneously inflaming in air boron and carbon capable of forming and bonds respectively could have been included here too but see below elements with extended structures boron is a somewhat anomalous case because it is electron deficient the allotropic forms of boron are all hased on the icosahedral b unit in this unit each boron has nearest neighbours and since the units are weakly bonded to form more extended frameworks the borons that will have more remote neighbours as well there are nowhere near enough electrons and atomic orbitals
