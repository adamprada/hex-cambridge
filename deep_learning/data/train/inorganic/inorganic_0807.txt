thought to be inert elements of the first short period li f they are poor representatives of their groups the second short period elements are much better for this the reason is connected to their small size and lack of empty dorbitals which limits their coordination number to in the absence of multicentre bonding to achieve their normal valencies be b and c use a valence state where one of the s electrons is promoted to the psubshell electron deficient li be and b compounds are lewis acids this involves a change in hybridization the extent to which the coordination
