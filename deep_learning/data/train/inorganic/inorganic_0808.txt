even more polarizing than li so no compounds containing it exist covalency is the norm eg bef and beho which hydrolyses extensively to beoh containing species for li be and b there is a marked similarity to the diagonally related mg al and c although the valencies differ the chemical behaviour such as covalency of halides or coordination chemistry tends to be somewhat similar for example there are close parallels between the lithium alkyls and the magnesium alkyls or between beryllium halides and the aluminium halides for b c and n there are no longlived compounds in which the elements
