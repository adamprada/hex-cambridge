triple bond o is much more reactive partly because it is a biradical f is very reactive because the filled porbitals perpendicular to the bond repel each other covalent bonds covered as part of the previous section elements of the second short period na to ar these elements are much more representative of the chemistry of the elements below them in their groups this specially true for the nonmetalic elements the elements of this period and those below it do not tend to use their porbitals for pbonding rather the empty dorbitals are used if pbonding occcurs for example aside
