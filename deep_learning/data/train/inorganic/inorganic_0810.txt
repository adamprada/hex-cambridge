can be invoked to explain valence states where the coordination number exceeds and the octet is exceeded also examples include pcl sf and if the possibility of higher coordination numbers lead also to different reactivity eg ccl which is inert to hydrolysis and sicl the metals differ from the first memeber of their group eg sodium does not form covalent compounds aluminum is a cationforming metal quite unlike boron and the coordination numbers are often rather than for these second row elements the remainder of the nontransition elements this section contains a groupbygroup summary of the properties characterizing each group
