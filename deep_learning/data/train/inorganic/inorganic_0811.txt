valent states group ia or see text table the elements have chemistry dominated by the ionic state the behaviour going down a group is wellbehaved the following decrease down a group melting points and heats of sublimation lattice energies mostly effective hydrated radii and hydration energies ionization enthalpies group iia or and iib or see text table for group iia mg ca sr ba and ra which all form the ionic state there are again wellbehaved trends including those mentioned for group ia and adding solubility of the sulphates and carbonates thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrates which decrease
