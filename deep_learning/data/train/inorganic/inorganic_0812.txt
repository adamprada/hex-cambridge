easily produced in its reactions it also readily forms the mercurous ion hg group iiia or and iiib or see text table the text includes the group iiia elements and the rest of the lanthanides among the nontransition metals because of the relative simplicity of their chemistry they all behave as quite electropositive elements and form the ion scandium behaves as if it falls somewhere between aluminum and gallium in terms of its covalency the lanthanides are so similar to each another that separation is difficult cation exchange chromatography is used all the group iiib elements form compounds containing the
