carbon and the rest is perhaps most marked knowing the chemistry of carbon is almost useless for predicting the chemistry of the remaining elements the chemistry of carbon is dominated by its extraordinary ability to catenate while silicon can form analogues to the hydrocarbons multiple bonding is not viable and the sio bond is the important bond in silicon chemistry the chemistry of the group ivb elements in their iv oxidation state is predominantly covalent sicl is a liquid as is pbch the infamous antiknock gasoline additive the covalent bonds generally weaken on descending the group the divalent state of
