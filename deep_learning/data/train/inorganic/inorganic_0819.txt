reactions and for the calculations of reaction heat determination of reaction mechanism and understanding of electrochemistry enthalpy since enthalpy is the heat content of a system under constant pressure the changeh is negative in an exothermic reaction and positive in an endothermic reaction the standard reaction enthalpy h is the enthalpy change between mol of products and reactants in the standard state pa and k the standard enthalpy of formation hf of a compound is the standard reaction enthalpy for the formation of the compound from its constituent elements since enthalpy is a state function the standard reaction enthalpy is
