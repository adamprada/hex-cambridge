and corresponds to the extent of disorder as entropy becomes larger the larger the disorder of a system gibbs energy this quantity is defined as a spontaneous reaction occurs when gibbs energy of a reaction is negative at constant temperature and pressure the standard gibbs free energy g is related to the equilibrium constant k of the reaction k is larger than when g becomes negative and the reaction proceeds to the right no headers welcome to the chemistry library this living library is a principal hub of the libretexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to develop the
