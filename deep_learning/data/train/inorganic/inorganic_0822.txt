with respect to hydration structures involving a comparable number of water molecules structure from lancaster site in theodor grotthuss proposed a theory of water conductivity he envisioned the electrolytic reaction as a sort of bucket line where each oxygen atom simultaneously passes and receives a single hydrogen atom it was an astonishing theory to propose at the time since the water molecule was thought to be oh not ho and the existence of ions was not fully understood the theory became known as the grotthuss mechanism the transport mechanism is now thought to involve the interconversion between the eigen and
