pairs and bonding domains around a central atom because vsepr considers all bonding domains equally ie a single bond a double bond and a half bond all count as one electron domain one can use either an octet or hypervalent structure provided that the number of lone pairs which should be the same in both is calculated correctly for example in either the hypervalent or octet structure of the iion above there are three lone pairs on the central i atom and two bonding domains we then follow these steps to obtain the electronic geometry determine the number of lone
