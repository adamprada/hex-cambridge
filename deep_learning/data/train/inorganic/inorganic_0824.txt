by considering the lone pairs to be present but invisible the most commonly used methods to determine molecular structure xray diffraction neutron diffraction and electron diffraction have a hard time seeing lone pairs but they can accurately determine the lengths of bonds between atoms and the bond angles the table below gives examples of electronic and molecular shapes for steric numbers between and we are most often concerned with molecules that have steric numbers between and bonding electron pairs lone pairs electron domains steric shape ideal bond angle examples bond angle example image linear co trigonal planar bf bent so
