nh bonds more than they repel each other this lone pair repulsion exerts even more steric influence in the case of water where there are two lone pairs similarly the axial fsf angle in the seesaw molecule sf is a few degrees less than because of repulsion by the lone pair in the molecule geometrical isomers for some molecules in the table we note that there is more than one possible shape that would satisfy the vsepr rules for example the xef molecule has a steric number of five and a trigonal bipyramidal geometry there are three possible stereoisomers one
