that the px and py orbitals lie in the equatorial plane we assume that the spherical s orbital is shared equally by the five electron domains in the molecule the two axial bonds share the pz orbital and the three equatorial bonds share the px and py orbitals we can then calculate the bond orders to axial and equatorial f atoms as follows because fluorine is more electronegative than a lone pair it prefers the axial site where it will have more negative formal charge in general by this reasoning lone pairs and electropositive ligands such as ch will always
