blush in conflict with our picture of atomic orbitals for an atom such as oxygen we know that the s orbital is spherical and that the px py and pz orbitals are dumbellshaped and point along the cartesian axes the water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms bound to oxygen not at a angle but at an angle of given the relative orientations of the atomic orbitals how do we arrive at angles between electron domains of and so on to understand this we will need to learn a little bit about the quantum mechanics of electrons in atoms and molecules
