of the hamiltonian in classical mechanics it is the form it most commonly takes in quantum mechanics combining these together yields the familiar form used in the schrödinger equation for hydrogenlike oneelectron atoms the schrödinger equation can be written as where z is the nuclear charge e is the electron charge and r is the position of the electron the radial potential term on the right side of the equation is due to the coulomb interaction ie the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron in which ε is the dielectric constant permittivity of free space and is the
