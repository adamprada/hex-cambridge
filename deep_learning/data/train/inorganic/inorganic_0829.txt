schrödinger equation can be used to describe chemical systems that are more complicated than the hydrogen atom eg multielectron atoms molecules infinite crystals and the dynamics of those systems if we substitute the appropriate potential energy function vrt into the hamiltonian the math becomes more complicated and the equation must be solved numerically in those cases so for our purposes we will stick with the simplest case of timeinvariant oneelectron hydrogenlike atoms without going into too much detail about the schrödinger equation we can point out some of its most important properties the equation derives from the fact that the
