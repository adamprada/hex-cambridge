the second derivative with respect to three spatial coordinates of ψ thus the schrödinger equation is a differential equation the second term on the right side of the equation represents the coulomb potential pe ie the attractive energy between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron the solutions to the schrödinger equation are a set of energies e which are scalar quantities and wavefunctions aka atomic orbitals ψ which are functions of the spatial coordinates you will sometimes see the energies referred to as eigenvalues and the orbitals as eigenfunctions because mathematically the schrödinger equation is an eigenfunctioneigenvalue
