equation eg the s s px py and pz orbitals represent probability amplitudes for finding the electron at a particular point xyz in space a probability amplitude can have either or sign we typically represent the different signs by shading or by and signs on the two lobes of a p orbital the square of the probability amplitude ψ is always a positive number and represents the probability of finding the electron at a point xyz in space because the total probability of finding the electron somewhere is the wavefunction must be normalized so that the integral of ψ over
