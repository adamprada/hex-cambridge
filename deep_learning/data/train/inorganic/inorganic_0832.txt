equation as such any sum of solutions to the schr√∂dinger equation is also a valid solution however we still impose the constraint that our hybrid orbitals must be orthogonal and normalized rules for orbital hybridization add and subtract atomic orbitals to get hybrid orbitals we get the same number of orbitals out as we put in the energy of a hybrid orbital is the weighted average of the atomic orbitals that make it up the coefficients are determined by the constraints that the hybrid orbitals must be orthogonal and normalized for sp hybridization as in the bef or co molecule
