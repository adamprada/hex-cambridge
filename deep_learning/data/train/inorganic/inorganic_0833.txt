energy of the s and pz orbitals linear combinations of the s and pz atomic orbitals make two spz hybrids the pxand py orbitals are unchanged for an isolated be atom which has two valence electrons the lowest energy state would have two electrons spinpaired in the s orbital however these electrons would not be available for bonding by promoting these electrons to the degenerate spz hybrid orbitals they become unpaired and are prepared for bonding to the f atoms in bef this will occur if the bonding energy in the promoted state exceeds the promotion energy the overall bonding
