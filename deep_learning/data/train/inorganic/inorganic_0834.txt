sp hybrid as in ch ho etc we combine all four atomic orbitals to make four degenerate hybrids the lobes of the sp hybrid orbitals point towards the vertices of a tetrahedron or alternate corners of a cube consistent with the tetrahedral bond angle in ch and the nearly tetrahedral angles in nh and ho similarly we can show that we can construct the trigonal bipyramidal electronic shape by making sp and sp hybrids and the octahedral geometry from three sets of sp hybrids the picture that emerges from this is that the atomic orbitals can hybridize as required by
