cs with oxygen show an unusual trend when lithium reacts with oxygen we obtain the binary oxide lio as expected from combining an element in group i with one in group vi curiously the oxide that forms most readily when sodium metal is oxidized is not nao but is instead the peroxide nao which we can formulate as nao with potassium rubidium and cesium we obtain the superoxides mo which contain the superoxide radical anion o and should be formulated as mo while it is possible to make nao ko rbo and cso by reaction of the appropriate metal nitrate
