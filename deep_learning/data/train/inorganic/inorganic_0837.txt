the anticdcl structure this is odd because cdcl has a layered structure that we normally associate with polar covalent mx compounds see section in cso six cs cations surround each o anion in an octahedron each cs is coordinated to three o ions and the cs ions contact each other across a van der waals gap the juxtaposition of cs ions near each other is clearly electrostatically unfavorable so why does cso prefer the anticdcl structure to antifluorite the answer has to do with the crowding of alkali ions around oxygen as illustrated for ko at the right because eight
