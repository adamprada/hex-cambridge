cs tend to form superoxides spacefilling models of the crystal structures of ko top and cso bottom oxygen atoms are red potassium ions are blue and cesium ions are magenta another way that we can rationalize this trend is through the energetics of forming the oxides peroxides and superoxides lets calculate the enthalpy change per mole of metal for forming a metal oxide mo from the metal and oxygen we can use hess law to write this as a sum of reactions reaction Î´h overall to get the enthalpy change for the overall reaction the heat of formation of mole
