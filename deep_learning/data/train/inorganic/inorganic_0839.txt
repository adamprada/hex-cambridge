enthalpies by subtracting rt or rt as appropriate metal δhlmo δhlmo δhlmo li kj kj kj na k rb cs as expected the lattice energies for mo and mo are comparable the latter being somewhat smaller in magnitude because of the larger size of the o anion the lattice energies of the superoxides mo are about those of the corresponding peroxides because both the anion and cation are singly charged and there are only two ions per formula unit now putting it all together we can use the lattice energies and heats of formation of the individual ions to compare
