batteries the alkali oxides are quite interesting in the context of metalair batteries because of their potential for extremely high energy storage on a mass basis such batteries have alkali metal typically li or zn anodes and utilize oxygen from the air at the cathode although lithium is the lightest and therefore the most energydense alkali metal there are materials problems associated with the formation of li dendrites when the battery is recharged and also with the slow kinetics of the fourelectron interconversion between og and o at the cathode for this reason superoxide batteries are currently being studied as
