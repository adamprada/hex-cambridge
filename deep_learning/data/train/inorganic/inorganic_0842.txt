a solidthe solid or crystal absorbs the energy as phonons quantized vibration states of the solid but there is a probability that no phonons are created and the whole lattice acts as the mass resulting in a recoilles emission of the gamma ray the new radiation is at the proper energy to excite the next ground state nucleus the probability of recoilles events increases with decreasing transition energy doppler effect the doppler shift describes the change in frequency due to a moving source and a moving observer is the frequency measured at the observer is the velocity of the wave
