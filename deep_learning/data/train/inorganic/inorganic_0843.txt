increasing frequencies the corresponding energy also increase and the same is true in the reverse case where frequencies decrease and therefore energy decreases the energy differences between hyperfine states are minimal fractions of an ev and the energy variation is achieved by the moving the source toward and away from the sample in an oscillating manner commonly at a velocity of a few mmsthe transmittance is then plotted against the velocity of the source and a peak is seen at the energy corresponding to the resonance energy in the above spectrum the emission and absorption are both estimated by the
