both conditions are met by fe and it is thus used extensively in mössbauer spectroscopy in the figure to the right the red colored boxes of the periodic table of elements indicate all elements that have isotopes visible using the mössbauer technique hyperfine interactions mössbauer spectroscopy allows the researcher to probe structural elements of the nucleus in several ways termed isomer shift quadrupole interactions and magnetic splitting these are each explained by the following sections as individual graphs but in practice mössbauer spectrum are likely to contain a combination of all effects isomer shift an isomeric shift occurs when non
