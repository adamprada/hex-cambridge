be influenced by the shielding pdf electronsfrom the measured delta shift there is information about the valance state of the absorbing atom the energy level diagram for shift shows the change in source velocity due to different sources used the shift may be either positive or negative quadrupole interaction the hamiltonian for quadrupole interaction using nuclear excited state is given by where the nuclear excited states are split into two degenerate doublets in the absence of magnetic interactions for the asymmetry parameter doublets are labeled with magnetic quantum numbers and where the doublet has the higher energy the energy difference
