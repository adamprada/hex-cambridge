independent where and b is actually a combination of the applied and internal magnetic fields the electronic zeeman term is far larger then the nuclear zeeman term meaning the electronic term dominates the equation so is approximated by and and pulling out a followed by leaves substituting the internal magnetic field with results in a combined magnetic field term involving both the applied magnetic field and the internal magnetic field which is simplified by using the effective magnetic field references gütlich p link r trautwein a mössbauer spectroscopy and transition metal chemistry inorganic chemistry concepts v berlin springerverlag g j
