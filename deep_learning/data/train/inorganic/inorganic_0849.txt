cells is rock salt nacl sodium chloride an octahedral geometric unit cell the whole lattice can be reproduced when the unit cell is duplicated in a three dimensional structure these unit cells are imperative for quite a few metals and ionic solids crystallize into these cubic structures calculating with unit cells is a simple task because edgelengths of the cell are equal along with all ‚Å∞ angles simple cubic unit cells simple cubic unit cells indicate when lattice points are only at the corners they are the simplest hence the title repetitive unit cell the lattice points at the corners
