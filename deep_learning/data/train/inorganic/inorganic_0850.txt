part of each unit cell giving us one atom corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell atom to calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows r an example of a simple cubic unit cell is polonium bodycentered cubic unit cells bodycentered cubic bcc unit cells indicate where the lattice points appear not only at the corners but in the center of the unit cell as well the atoms touch one another along the cubes diagonal crossing but the atoms dont touch the edge of the cube all atoms are identical
