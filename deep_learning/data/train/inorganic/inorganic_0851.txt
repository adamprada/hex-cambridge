is a common mistake for cscl to be considered bcc but it is not instead it is nonclosed packed facecentered cubic unit cells facecentered cubic fcc unit cells indicate where the lattice points are at both corners and on each face of the cell this is a more common type of unit cell since the atoms are more tightly packed than that of a simple cubic unit cell like the bcc the atoms dont touch the edge of the cube but rather the atoms touch diagonal to each face its packing efficiency is the highest with a percentage of atoms
