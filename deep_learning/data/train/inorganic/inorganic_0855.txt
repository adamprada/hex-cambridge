field magnets are acted on by forces and torques when placed within an external applied magnetic field figure in a uniform external field a magnet experiences no net force but a net torque the torque tries to align the magnetic moment of the magnet with the external field the magnetic moment of a magnet points from its south pole to its north pole figure a magnet will feel a force to realign in an external field ie go from a higher energy to a lower energy the energy of this system is determined by equation ref and classical can vary
