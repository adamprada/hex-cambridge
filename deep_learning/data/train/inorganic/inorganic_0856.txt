zeeman effect lets now use our current knowledge to predict what the zeeman effect for the p to s transition in hydrogen would look like and then compare this prediction with a more complete theory to understand the zeeman effect which uses a magnetic field to remove the degeneracy of different angular momentum states we need to examine how an electron in a hydrogen atom interacts with an external magnetic field since magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles we should look for a relationship between the angular momentum and the magnetic dipole moment the relationship between the
