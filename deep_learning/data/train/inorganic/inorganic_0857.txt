particle and its magnetic moment is commonly expressed as a ratio called the gyromagnetic ratio gyro is greek for turn so gyromagnetic simply relates turning angular momentum to magnetism now you also know why the greek sandwiches made with meat cut from a spit turning over a fire are called gyros in the specific case of an electron exercise calculate the magnitude of the gyromagnetic ratio for an electron to determine the energy of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field we need to include the operator form of the hydrogen atom hamiltonian the hamiltonian always consists of all the
