again we simply calculate the expectation value of the energy using the existing hydrogen atom wavefunctions and the new hamiltonian operator where and exercise show that the expectation value the expectation value approach provides an exact result in this case because the hydrogen atom wavefunctions are eigenfunctions of both and if the wavefunctions were not eigenfunctions of the operator associated with the magnetic field then this approach would provide a firstorder estimate of the energy first and higher order estimates of the energy are part of a general approach to developing approximate solutions to the schr√∂dinger equation this approach called
