number degeneracy of the hydrogen atom is removed by the magnetic field for example the three states and which are degenerate in zero field have different energies in a magnetic field as shown in figure figure the zeeman effect emission when an electron switches from a p orbital to a s orbital occurs at only one energy in the absence of a magnetic field but can occur at three different energies in the presence of a magnetic field the state for which the component of angular momentum and hence also the magnetic moment in the external field direction is zero
