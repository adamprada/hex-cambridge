a magnetic dipole oriented a with and b against the applied magnetic field exercise carry out the steps going from equation to equation exercise consider the effect of changing the magnetic field on the magnitude of the zeeman splitting sketch a diagram where the magnetic field strength is on the xaxis and the energy of the three p orbitals is on the yaxis to show the trend in splitting magnitudes with increasing magnetic field be quantitative calculate and plot the exact numerical values using a software package of your choice exercise based on your calculations in exercise sketch a luminescence
