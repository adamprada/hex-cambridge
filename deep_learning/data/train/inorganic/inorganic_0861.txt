of threecenter bonding we can draw the h ion and also h and h in either a linear or triangular geometry walsh correlation diagram for h a few important points about this diagram for the linear form of the ion the highest and lowest mos are symmetric with respect to the inversion center in the molecule note that the central s orbital has g symmetry so by symmetry it has zero overlap with the u combination of the two s orbitals on the ends this makes the Ïƒu orbital a nonbonding orbital in the triangular form of the molecule the
