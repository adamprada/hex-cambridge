about this mo diagram in the linear form of the molecule which has inversion symmetry the s and p orbitals of the x atom factor into three symmetry classes s σg pz σu px py πu similarly we can see that the two h s orbitals make two linear combinations one with σg symmetry and one with σu symmetry they look like the bonding and antibonding mos of the h molecule which is why we say we use that problem to solve this one the πu orbitals must be nonbonding because there is no combination of the h s orbitals
