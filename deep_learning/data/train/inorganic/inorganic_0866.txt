vsepr valence shell electron pair repulsion model is the what helps us identify how a molecule may or may not be trigonal bipyramidal trigonal bipyramidal species the central atom of the triognal bipyramidal species is bonded to separate molecules this means that the central atom must have an extended valence shell in order to all for the bonds to occur the central atom is thus typically a pblock atom there are two different ways to classify the x atoms either as axial or equitorial it is important to understand the difference between the two so that we can reference them
