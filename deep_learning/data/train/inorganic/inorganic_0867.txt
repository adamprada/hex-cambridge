pairs the bond angles between the equatorial atoms is degrees the bond angles between the axial and equitorial atoms is degrees the bond angles between the two axial atoms is degrees the angles formed by these atoms is the most stable conformation that can be maintained by the trigonal bipyramidal species other common shapes for coordinate molecules as we have already discussed when the central atom has bonding pairs of electrons those electrons being shared between two atoms the shape of the molecule is trigonal bipyramidal this section gives a little bit of information about how the shape of a
