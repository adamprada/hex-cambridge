to be is equatorial to the central atom this allows for the least amount of electronelectron repulsion possible this shape is called seesaw the next possible shape is where there are two lone pairs on the central atom once again the best place for these two molecules is equatorial to the central atom for the least amount of electron repulsion to occur this molecule is called tshaped the last alternate shape for a coordinate system is when there are three lone pairs these are all equatorial to the central atom to establish the lowest energy conformation this molecule is considered
