trigonal bipyramidal structure we must place lone pairs far away from each other and bond pairs the seesaw shape maximizes the bond angles of the single lone pair and the other atoms in the molecule the lone pair is in an equatorial position offering and degree bond angles compared to only degree bond angles if placed at the axial position the t shaped structure minimizes the remaining bond pairbond pair angles at degrees and maximizes the lone pairlone pair bond angle at the linear structure does the same by making sure that the lone pairs are kept at a maximum
