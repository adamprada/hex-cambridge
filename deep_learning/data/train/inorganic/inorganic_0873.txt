alloys can be quite complicated when considering the crystal structures of metals and alloys it is not sufficient to think of each atom and its neighboring ligands as an isolated system instead think of the entire metallic crystal as a network of atoms connected by a sea of shared valence electrons the electrons are delocalized because there are not enough of them to fill each bond between atoms with an electron pair for example in the crystal structures of sblock and pblock metals each atom has either or nearest neighbors but the maximum number of s p electrons is thus
