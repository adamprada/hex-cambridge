atomscell metal atoms can be approximated as spheres and therefore are not efficient in packing the same way a stack of cannonballs has some empty spaces between the balls different unit cells have different packing efficiencies the number of atoms that is included in the unit cell only includes the fractions of atoms inside of the box atoms on the corners of the unit cell count as ⅛ of an atom atoms on a face count as ½ an atom in the center counts as a full atom using this lets calculate the number of atoms in a simple cubic
