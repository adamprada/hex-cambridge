its hexagonal relative hcp has the most efficient packing many metals adopt either the fcc or hcp structure hexagonal close packed hcp like the fcc structure the packing density of hcp is the unit cell of a bcc metal contains two atoms calculating the packing fraction the packing fractions of the crystal structures shown above can be calculated by dividing the volume of the atoms in the cell by the volume of the cell itself the volume of the atoms in the cell is equal to the number of atomscell times the volume of a sphere Ï€r the volume of
