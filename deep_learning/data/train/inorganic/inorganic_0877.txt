generally valence electrons can participate in the formation of chemical bonding but core electrons cannot while core electrons are not involved in bonding they influence the chemical reactivity of an atom the electron configuration of a oxygen atom is which may be shorted where the stands for the configuration of helium similarly the configuration of calcium with electrons can be written where the stands for the configuration of argon electronic configurations that are the same as noble gases are very stable since they have a full octet except helium with a full s orbital the electrons in oxygen do not
