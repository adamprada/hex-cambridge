electrons in the are the valence electrons all others are core electrons the periodicity of valance electrons can be seen in the periodic table basically the periodicity is only applied to the main group elements while in transition metals rules are complex the core electrons remain the same in the increase of group numbers in the main group elements on the other hand the valance electrons increase by one from left to right of a main period and remain the same down the column of a main group this evolution gives periodical change in property of a period and similar
