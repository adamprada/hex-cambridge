electrons so there is not always a certain number of apparent valence electrons the number of apparent valence electrons for the first transition metal period is shown in the table below under construction figure valence electrons for transition metals relationship with chemical reactivity the chemical reactivity of an atom is mainly determined by valence electrons atoms which have a complete shell of valence electrons tend to be chemically inert atoms with one or two valence electrons are highly reactive this phenomenon can be explained by hunds rule which states that orbitals that are empty halffull or full are more stable
