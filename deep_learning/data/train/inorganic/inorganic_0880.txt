down a group more shells are occupied by electrons which increases the size of the atom the more core electron shells an atom has the larger the size of the atom and the farther the valence electrons are from the nucleus thus the valence electrons will experience less effective nuclear charge and will be easily lost for example and can both react with water but k has a more radical reaction because it has more shells of core electrons which makes the valence electron in its outermost orbital much easier to lose than the valence electron of na references miessler
