a single bond hydrogen has only one valence outer electron so two hydrogen atoms are needed to make a bond this allows accurate predictions about the shapes of simple molecules in case of h the shape is simply linear because valence bond theory involves only valence electrons lewis dot structures are useful in representing a molecule however there are some drawbacks for certain bond predictions such as bond dissociation energy and magnetism ultimately a different atom which has more valence electrons can pair with other atoms to form a molecule with more than one bond for instance carbon has valence
