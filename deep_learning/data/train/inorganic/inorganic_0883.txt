it is impossible to know which electron belongs to ha or hb also since these two molecules are the same they have equal attraction on the electrons they share this is because their orbitals overlap and they now share the electrons the electrons are allowed to spin in their respective orbitals draw backs of valence bond theory although valence bond theory together with hybridization and vsepr predicts simple structures relatively well it becomes difficult to predict accurate energies of a bond it also fails to predict aspects of magnetism that can be explained by molecular orbital theory references brown ian
