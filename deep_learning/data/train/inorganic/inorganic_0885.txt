states of atoms in molecules in still more than a decade before modern quantum theory would adequately describe the shapes of atomic orbitals lewis proposed the octet theory based on the empirically observed rules of valence ie the combining ratios of atoms in molecules this theory in hindsight can be rationalized for s and pblock elements by observing that maingroup atoms can use their four valence orbitals s px py and pz to accommodate up to eight electrons some or all of which may be shared with other atoms in lewis model the valence electrons of an atom were situated
