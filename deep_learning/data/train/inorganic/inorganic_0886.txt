the lewis picture is powerful in its simplicity it can be readily used to rationalize or predict the combining ratios of atoms to sort plausible and unlikely structures for molecules including large ones and to rationalize the acidbase properties of many molecules it is important to remember that the model is built on a shaky prequantum mechanical description of atoms and so with it we will make mistakes nevertheless it is useful to see how far we can go with the lewis model figure examples of lewis dot diagrams showing chemical bonds between carbon hydrogen and oxygen and nonbonding electron
