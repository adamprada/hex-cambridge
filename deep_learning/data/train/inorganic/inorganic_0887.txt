electrons bonds the number of lone pairs is obtained by difference vs now draw the molecule starting with the four bonds and adding eight lone pairs to complete the octets count the shared and unshared electrons around each atom in the nitrate ion and you will see that all atoms are octet and that the total number of valence electrons v is if you do the nv calculation according to the rules above you should always get an octet structure the charges on atoms in a molecule or an extended solid such as sio can be estimated from xray photoelectron
