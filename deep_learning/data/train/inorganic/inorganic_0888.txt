in group their formal charge is the doubly bonded o has a formal charge of zero the n atom has a formal charge of because it owns valence electrons and is in group note that the formal charge is not the same thing as the oxidation number or oxidation state in the nitrate ion the oxidation state of nitrogen is and the oxidation state of oxygen is the formal charge is typically closer to the real charge on the atom as measured eg by xray photoelectron spectroscopy oxidation states are a useful bookkeeping device for keeping track of oxidationreduction reactions
