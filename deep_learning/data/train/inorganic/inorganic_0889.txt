so are shown below in this case and in many lewis structures we will draw we leave off the implied lone pairs around the peripheral atoms try calculating the number of bonds in each of these molecules using the nv method and fill in the lone pairs that are not explicitly drawn in in cases where more than one valence bond structure is possible we can use formal charges to decide which structures should be more or less stable the rules are the formal charges on atoms are minimized in stable structures zero being the best case negative formal charges
