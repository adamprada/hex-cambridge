in the molecule thus neither structure is completely happy but the formal charge rules tell us that the electrondeficient structure on the left is more stable the electron deficiency of bfmakes it a powerful lewis acid in the case of onf the structure on the left is unfavorable for two reasons first it places a positive formal charge on f the most electronegative atom second there is another possible structure right that has zero formal charge which is preferable to one with nonzero charge this means that the structure on the right with a double bond between n and o
