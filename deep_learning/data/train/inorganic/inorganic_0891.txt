of oxygen atoms in the molecule with and formal charges these structures also suggest that ozone should have one single and one double bond experimentally by electron diffraction however we find that the molecule is symmetric with both oo bond lengths the same the real instantaneous structure is the average of the two forms as shown below in the classical lewis picture of the molecule we can rationalize resonance by observing that electrons being thousands of times lighter than the nuclei of atoms move very fast on the timescale of molecular vibrations thus in the time it takes for the
