regulating damaging chemicals in the instantaneous structure of ozone the formal charge is shared between the two terminal oxygen atoms and therefore each one has a formal charge of the oo bonds are the average of a single and a double bond ie each oo bond order is similarly the nitrate anion has three resonance structures and experimentally by xray crystallography of nitrate salts we find that all the no bonds in the ion are the same in this case in the averaged structure each o atom has a formal charge of and the no bond order is inequivalent resonance
