and there is a positive charge on the oxygen atom the real structure is thus a weighted average of the first two nobond resonance an interesting and useful kind of inequivalent resonance structure is one in which there is a bond order of zero between two of the atoms this concept of nobond resonance is important in understanding the bonding in many halogen and hydrogencontaining compounds the idea is illustrated below for the generic molecule xyz where z might be an electronegative halogen atom such as f by moving the bonding electrons from the yz bond onto the z atom
