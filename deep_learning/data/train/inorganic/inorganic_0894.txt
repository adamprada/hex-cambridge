in a compound where the bond order is one and it should be relatively easy to break the yz bond some molecular examples of nobond resonance are shown below in the molecule onf the nf bond is unusually long relative to the nf bond in nf in which the bond order is this can be explained by the nobond resonance forms shown on the right similarly in the lewis acidbase adduct formed by combining bh with co we can explain the long bh bonds using nobond resonance forms that place a partial positive charge on the h atoms nobond resonance
