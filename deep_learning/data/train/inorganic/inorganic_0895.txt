picture is not an accurate description of the bonding a better representation of i can be obtained with nobond resonance structures as shown below we will see that this picture is consistent with the mo description of i in chapter the deep blue color of starchiodine solutions results from the complexation of linear polyiodide ions in by the starch amylose lefthanded helix the interior of the helix is hydrophobic in electron donor solvents such as ethanol and water i and salts of i have a brown color the result of a charge transfer interaction between the solvent and solute we
