the bonding in dsp and dsp hybrids for and coordinate molecules respectively however realistic molecular orbital calculations show that the phosphorus and sulfur d orbitals are too high in energy to contribute significantly to bonding in pf and sf for these molecules we can use nobond resonance to make reasonable octet structures that predict polar bonds between the central atom and f spacefilling model of sulfur hexafluoride sf is surprisingly unreactive with water relative to other compounds that contain sf bonds the tight packing of f atoms around s prevents nucleophilic attack by water in other cases such as pch
