number of electrons associated with the central atom in a study gillespie and silvi found that the population of the valence shell is greater than eight for compounds with electropositive ligands such as pch and less than eight for compounds such as pf they concluded that these valence electron shell populations depend primarily on the coordination numbers and electronegativities of the central atoms and their ligands and that there is no fundamental difference between the bonding in hypervalent and nonhypervalent lewis octet molecules this reminds us that the octet rule is not a law of nature but rather an empirical
