the electronic structure of one molecule we can write down the same solution for all other molecules that are isoelectronic for example we noted above that i and xef which both have valence electrons have the same valence bond structure we can further expect that isoelectronic molecules will have the same shapes and very often similar physical properties the four molecules and ions below all contain three nonhydrogen atoms and valence electrons all of them are linear molecules with two double bonds the four molecules and ions shown below them all contain four nonhydrogen atoms and valence electrons these four
