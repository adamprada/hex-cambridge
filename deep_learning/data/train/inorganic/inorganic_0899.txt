linear and similar physical properties co sublimes at c whereas no melts at c and boils at c isoelectronic solids the isoelectronic principle works not just for molecules but for extended solids as well one technologically important set of isoelectronic solids are the pblock semiconductors the group element si is the most widely used semiconductor for electronics but as we will discuss later it is not a good light emitter lightemitting diodes leds which are used in lasers high efficiency lighting and display technologies are made from compounds that are isoelectronic with si and ge especially gaas gap alas and
