spectroscopy aka infrared ir spectroscopy is a highly useful and beneficial tool for determining structures and functional groups contained in compounds although used for many different structure types of polyatomic molecules this particular module is dedicated to triatomic molecules with bent and linear spacial molecular geometry introduction triatomic molecules are molecules that contain three atoms the atoms in triatomic molecules can all be the same as in i all be different as in hcn or can be a mix like co examples include ho which is a bent and has a bond angle of o and a linear triatomic molecule
