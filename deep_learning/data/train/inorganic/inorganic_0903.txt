have any lone pairs surrounding it will give rise to a linear molecule examples include and this electronic configuration gives the central atom a sp hybridization triatomic molecules where the central atom does not use all of its electron pairs in the bonds between the other two atoms will under certain circumstances also give rise to a linear species when the central atom is surrounded by three or four lone pairs in addition to the two elements already attached will also give rise to a linear molecule examples include bent molecules there are also several ways to give rise to
