broglie as and by rearrangement on waves quantum mechanically an electron can be described by a wave function oscillating in space and time that has mean values equal to the expectation values of observables corresponding to given operators according to the born interpretation of quantum mechanics the complex conjugate of this wavefunction icorrelates to the electrons positional probability density electrons are fermions they are charged particles when they are confined by a potential to a limited space they display harmonics analogous to those of other wavelike phenomena this occurs most notable in atoms and molecules the hydrogen atom proves the
