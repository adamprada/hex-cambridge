in a higher orbital when this process occurs via interaction with electromagnetic radiation it is referred to as absorption similarly the regression of an electron into a lower energy orbital results in the release of electromagnetic radiation and is referred to as emission because of the quantized energy levels demanded by a bound system electrons in a molecule or atom can only absorb or emit light at specific frequencies which depend on the properties of the system certain materials have energy level spacing such that excitation by an energy source can produce a greater number of electrons in an excited
