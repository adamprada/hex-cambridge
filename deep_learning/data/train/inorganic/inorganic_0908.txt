forces described by coulombs law rotational motion of a charged particle produces an electric field the potential of an electron attraction to positive charge can be used to store energy in chemical form the motion of electrons by batteries or other sources through conductive media such as copper wire can be facilitated to do work computer light electronic absorption and emission within roughly to nm produces radiation that is in the visible spectrum the sky is blue because of the interaction of light from the sun with electrons in atoms in the atmosphere in whats known as scattering scattering of
