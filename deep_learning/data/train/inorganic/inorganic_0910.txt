phase transformations in iron catalysts eg those used for fischertropsch synthesis while initially consisting of hematite feo these catalysts transform into a mixture of magnetite feo and several iron carbides the formation of carbides appears to improve catalytic activity however it can also lead to the mechanical breakup and attrition of the catalyst particles which can cause difficulties in the final separation of catalyst from reaction products m√∂ssbauer spectroscopy has also been used to determine the relative concentration change in the oxidation state of antimony sb during the selective oxidation of olefins during calcination all the sb ions in an
