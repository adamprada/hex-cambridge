the technique is used to determine the oxidation state of iron examples of prominent ironcontaining biomolecules are ironsulfur proteins ferritin hemes including the cytochromes these studies are often supplemented by analysis of related model complexes an area of particular interest is the characterization of intermediates involved in oxygen activation by iron proteins vibrational spectra of iron enrched biomolecules can be acquired using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopynrvs in which the sample is scanned through a range of synchrotrongenerated xrays centered at the mossbauer absorbance frequency stokes and antistokes peaks in the spectrum correspond to low frequency vibrational many below cm with
