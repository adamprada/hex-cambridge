polycrystalline metal samples so much lower by a factor of than they are in perfect single crystals the answer has to do with the motion of dislocations consider the picture below which shows planes of metal atoms near a dislocation the individual atoms are numbered to help you see which bonds are broken and which are formed the arrows indicate force applied under shear stress notice how the dislocation moves by breakingmaking metalmetal bonds the key point here is that we can induce plastic deformation shear by breaking only one line of metalmetal bonds at a time along the dislocation
