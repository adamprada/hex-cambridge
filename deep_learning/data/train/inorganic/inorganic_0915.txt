a structural material or a knife that can hold a decent edge there are several ways we can overcome to some extent this problem use single crystals and anneal out all the dislocations expensive especially with large items like turbine blades and impossible with very large items like airplane wings or bridges work hardening of the metal this moves all dislocations to grain boundaries the dislocation essentially becomes part of the grain boundary since a grain boundary is a planar defect it is much less responsive to stress than a line defect introduce impurity atoms that is alloying elements or
