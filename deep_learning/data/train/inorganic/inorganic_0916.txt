struck many times with a hammer the copper wire becomes stiffer and it is possible to hang a weight from it dislocations move to the crystal grain boundaries during work hardening effectively halting their motion and at the same time making the individual crystal grains smaller because the crystal grains are now smaller the amount of grain boundary area has increased and with it the free energy of the material annealing reverses the process by lowering the free energy when the wire is annealed in a flame heated so that atoms can move and rearrange the crystal grains grow and
