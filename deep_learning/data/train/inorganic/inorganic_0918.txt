a ligand π orbital this situation is called backbonding because the ligand donates σelectron density to the metal and the metal donates πelectron density to the ligand the ligand is thus acting as a σdonor and a πacceptor in πbackbonding the metal donates π electrons to the ligand π orbital adding electron density to an antibonding molecular orbital this results in weakening of the co bond which is experimentally observed as lengthening of the bond relative to free co in the gas phase and lowering of the co infrared stretching frequency dd π bonding occurs when an element such phosphorus
