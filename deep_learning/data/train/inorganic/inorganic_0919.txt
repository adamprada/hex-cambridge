and a filled orthogonal porbital bonds to a metal as shown above at the right for an o ligand this occurs in early transition metal complexes in this example o is acting as both a σdonor and a πdonor this interaction is typically drawn as a metalligand multiple bond eg the vo bond in the vanadyl cation vo typical πdonor ligands are oxide o nitride n imide rn alkoxide ro amide rn and fluoride f for late transition metals strong πdonors form antibonding interactions with the filled dlevels with consequences for spin state redox potentials and ligand exchange rates πdonor
