of different organic functional groups and protic solvents than the grubbs catalysts which are based on ru complexes a chiral schrock catalyst polymerizes a norbornadiene derivative to a highly stereoregular isotactic polymer synthesis of a grubbs olefin metathesis catalyst no headers inorganic compounds use s p and d orbitals and more rarely f orbitals to make bonding and antibonding combinations these combinations result in σ π and δ bonds and antibonds you are already familiar with σ and π bonding in organic compounds in inorganic chemistry π bonds can be made from p andor dorbitals δ bonds are more rare
