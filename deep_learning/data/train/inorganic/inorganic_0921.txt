of heavier elements are rare because the larger cores of the atoms prevent good πoverlap for this reason compounds containing cc double bonds are very common but those with sisi bonds are rare δ bonds are generally quite weak compared to σ and π bonds compounds with metalmetal δ bonds occur in the middle of the transition series transition metal dorbitals can also form σ bonds typically with sp hybrid orbitals of appropriate symmetry on ligands for example phosphines rp are good σ donors in complexes with transition metals as shown below pπdπ bonding is also important in transition metal
