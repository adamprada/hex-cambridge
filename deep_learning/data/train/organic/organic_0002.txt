single bond distance and with no electronic theory as a guide interestingly all of the subsequent developments of the quantum mechanical theory of chemical bonds has not altered this edifice in significant ways indeed for a long time a goal of molecular quantum mechanics was simply to be able to corroborate that when an organic chemist draws a single line between two carbon atoms to show that they are bonded he in fact knows what he is doing and that when he draws two or three bonds between the carbons to indicate a double or triple bond quantum mechanics supports
