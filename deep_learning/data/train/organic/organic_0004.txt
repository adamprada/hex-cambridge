avogadros hypothesis allowed assignment of relative molecular weights from measurements of gas densities then with analytical techniques that permit determination of the weight percentages of the various elements in a compound it became possible to set up a selfconsistent set of relative atomic weights from these and the relative molecular weights one can assign molecular formulas for example if one finds that a compound contains carbon atomic weight hydrogen atomic weight and bromine atomic weight then the ratios of the numbers of atoms are dividing each of the last set of numbers by the smallest gives which suggests a molecular
