each of the hydrogens on the same carbon a convenient way of representing organic molecules in three dimensions which shows the tetrahedral relationships of the atoms very clearly uses the socalled ballandstick models the sticks that represent the bonds or valences form the tetrahedral angles of e the question of rotational isomers the tetrahedral carbon does not solve all problems without additional postulates for example there are two different compounds known with the same formula these substances which we call isomers can be reasonably written as however ballandstick models suggest further possibilities for the second structure for example and this
