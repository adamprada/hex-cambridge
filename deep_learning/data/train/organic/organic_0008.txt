as and do not have separate stable existence but are interconverted by rotation around the bond so rapidly that they are indistinguishable from one another thus there is only one isomer corresponding to the different possible rotational angles and a total of only two isomers of formula as we shall see the idea of free rotation required extensive modification some years after it was first proposed but it was an extremely important paradigm which as often happens became so deeply rooted as to become essentially an article of faith for later organic chemists free rotation will be discussed in more
