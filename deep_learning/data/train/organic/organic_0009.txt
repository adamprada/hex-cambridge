isomers can give for the pair of isomers substitution of a bromine for a hydrogen will be seen to give only one possibility with one compound and two with the other therefore if we have two bottles one containing one isomer and one the other and run the substitution test the compound that gives only one product is and the one that gives a mixture of two products is further it will be seen that the test besides telling which isomer is and which is establishes the structures of the two possible isomers and thus only can be formed from
