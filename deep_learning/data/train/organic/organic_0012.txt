change favors as the product because the reaction to form it is a simple replacement of bromine bonded to carbon by whereas formation of would entail a much more drastic rearrangement of bonds the argument is really a subtle one involving an assessment of the reasonableness of various possible reactions on the whole however it works rather well and in the specific case of the isomers is strongly supported by the fact that treatment of with strong hydrobromic acid converts it back to in contrast the isomer of structure reacts with to form two molecules of in each case bonds
