that it is a simple straightforward process to make all of the possible substitution products of a compound such as in fact as will be shown later direct substitution of bromine for hydrogen with compounds such as this does not occur readily and when it does occur the four possible substitution products indeed are formed but in far from equal amounts because there are differences in reactivity for substitution at the different positions actually some of the substitution products are formed only in very small quantities fortunately this does not destroy the validity of the substitution method but does make
