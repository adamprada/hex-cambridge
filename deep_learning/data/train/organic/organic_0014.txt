the neutralization of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide solution are extremely fast at ordinary temperatures but the same is not often true of reactions of organic compounds for example treated in two different ways is converted to gaseous compounds one having the formula and the other the compound ethene reacts very quickly with bromine to give but the compound ethane does not react with bromine except at high temperatures or when exposed to sunlight or similar intense light the reaction products then are and and later and and so on we clearly can characterize as reactive and as unreactive toward
