addition and substitution became much clearer with the development of the structure theory that called for carbon to be tetravalent and hydrogen univalent ethene then was assigned a structure with a carbontocarbon double bond and ethane a structure with a carbontocarbon single bond addition of bromine to ethene subsequently was formulated as breaking one of the carboncarbon bonds of the double bond and attaching bromine to these valences substitution was written similarly but here bromine and a bond are involved we will see later that the way in which these reactions actually occur is much more complicated than these simple
