events by which the reactants become converted to the products such information is of extraordinary value in defining and understanding the range of applicability of given reactions for practical preparations of desired compounds the distinction we have made between unsaturated and reactive is best illustrated by a definite example ethene is unsaturated and reactive toward bromine but tetrachloroethene will not add bromine at all under the same conditions and is clearly unreactive but is it also saturated the answer is definitely no because if we add a small amount of aluminum bromide to a mixture of tetrachloroethene and bromine addition
