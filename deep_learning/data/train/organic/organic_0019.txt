and e however and are not superimposable on each other meaning that the arrangement of ligands around the chiral center in and in is different and are mirror images of each other meaning that the arrangement of ligands around the chiral center in is the exact opposite of that in chiral centers in and are said to have opposite absolute configurations according to rs convention if the absolute configuration at the chiral center in is r that at the chiral center in is s or vice versa relative configuration the relative configuration is the experimentally determined relationship between two enantiomers
