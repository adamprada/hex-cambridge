that the ester will be related in configuration to the acid because esterification should not affect the configuration about the chiral carbon atom it happens that the methyl ester so obtained is levorotatory so we know that lactic acid and methyl lactate have the same relative configuration at the asymmetric carbon even if they possess opposite signs of optical rotation however we still do not know the absolute configuration that is we are unable to tell which of the two possible configurations of lactic acid or corresponds to the dextro or acid and which to the levo or acid until
