compounds whose configurations are related to glyceraldehyde are said to belong to the series and those related to glyceraldehyde belong to the series at the time the choice of absolute configuration for glyceraldehyde was made there was no way of knowing whether the configuration of glyceraldehyde was in reality or however the choice had a chance of being correct and we now know that the configuration is in fact the correct configuration of glyceraldehyde this was established through use of a special xray crystallographic technique which permitted determination of the absolute disposition of the atoms in space of sodium rubidium
