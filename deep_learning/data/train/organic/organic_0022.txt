two reactions each of which is stereospecific and inverts the configuration section reduction of the azide group leaves the configuration unchanged when there are several chiral carbons in a molecule the configuration at one center usually is related directly or indirectly to glyceraldehyde and the configurations at the other centers are determined relative to the first thus in the aldehyde form of the important sugar glucose there are four chiral centers and so there are possible stereoisorners the projection formula of the isomer that corresponds to the aldehyde form of natural glucose is by convention for sugars the configuration of
