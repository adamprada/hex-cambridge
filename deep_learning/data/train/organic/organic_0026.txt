or c c or t h d h h when there is a tie in above establish relative priority by proceeding to the next atoms along the chain until the first difference is observed multiple bonds are treated as if each bond of the multiple bond is bonded to a unique atom for example the ethenyl group chch has higher priority than the ethyl group chch the ethenyl carbon priority is two bonds to carbon atoms and one bond to a hydrogen atom compared with the ethyl carbon that has only one bond to a carbon atom and two bonds
