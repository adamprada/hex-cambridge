position now consider the diagram above on the right where a curved arrow is drawn clockwise cw from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent in the r configuration rectus latin right the r or s is then added as a prefix in parenthesis to the name of the enantiomer of interest a locator number is required if there is more than one chiral center otherwise the person reading the name is expected to recognize the chiral center example the two chiral compounds below are drawn to emphasize the chiral carbon with the full chemical name below each
