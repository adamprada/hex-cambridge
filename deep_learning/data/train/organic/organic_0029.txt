is priority the aldehyde or the choh to determine this we move one more bond away from the chiral center for the aldehyde we have a double bond to an oxygen while on the choh group we have a single bond to an oxygen if the atom is the same double bonds have a higher priority than single bonds therefore the aldehyde group is assigned priority and the choh group the priority with our priorities assigned we look next at the priority group the hydrogen and see that it is pointed back away from us into the plane of the
