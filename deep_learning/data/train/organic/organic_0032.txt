for the treatment of a form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma in brazil thalidomide is used in the treatment of leprosy but despite safety measures children are still being born with thalidomiderelated defects exercise determine the stereochemical configurations of the chiral centers in the biomolecules shown below exercise should the r enantiomer of malate have a solid or dashed wedge for the co bond in the figure below exercise using solid or dashed wedges to show stereochemistry draw the r enantiomer of ibuprofen and the s enantiomer of methylerythritolphosphate structures are shown earlier in this chapter without stereochemistry solutions
