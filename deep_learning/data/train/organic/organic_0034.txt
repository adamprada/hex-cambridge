the remaining ligand in place does not change the absolute configuration at the chiral center manipulating fischer projections with change to configuration the operations that do change the absolute configuration at a chiral center in a fischer projection can be summarized as two rules rule rotation of the fischer projection by ยบ in either direction changes the absolute configuration at the chiral center rule interchanging any two ligands on the chiral center changes the absolute configuration at the chiral center the above rules assume that the fischer projection under consideration contains only one chiral center however with care they can
