ion could theoretically act as an acid it has after all a proton to donate but this is not a reaction that we would normally consider to be relevant in anything but the most extreme conditions the relative acidity of different compounds or functional groups in other words their relative capacity to donate a proton to a common base under identical conditions is quantified by a number called the acid dissociation constant abbreviated ka the common base chosen for comparison is water we will consider acetic acid as our first example when a small amount of acetic acid is added
