courses other than analytical or physical chemistry to simplify the discussion for general chemistry and organic chemistry courses the activities of all of the solutes are replaced with molarities and the activity of the solvent usually water is defined as having the value of in our example we added a small amount of acetic acid to a large amount of water water is the solvent for this reaction therefore in the course of the reaction the concentration of water changes very little and the water can be treated as a pure solvent which is always assigned an activity of the
