small this means that very little dissociation actually takes place and there is much more acetic acid in solution at equilibrium than there is acetate ion acetic acid is a relatively weak acid at least when compared to sulfuric acid ka or hydrochloric acid ka both of which undergo essentially complete dissociation in water a number like x is not very easy either to say or to remember chemists often use pka values as a more convenient term to express relative acidity pka is related to ka by the following equation doing the math we find that the pka of
