at all have pka values above the lower the pka value the stronger the acid table representative acid constants it is important to realize that pka is not the same thing as ph pka is an inherent property of a compound or functional group while ph is the measure of the hydronium ion concentration in a particular aqueous solution any particular acid will always have the same pka assuming that we are talking about an aqueous solution at room temperature but different aqueous solutions of the acid could have different ph values depending on how much acid is added to
