while table provides the pka values of only a limited number of compounds it can be very useful as a starting point for estimating the acidity or basicity of just about any organic molecule here is where your familiarity with organic functional groups will come in very handy what for example is the pka of cyclohexanol it is not on the table but as it is an alcohol it is probably somewhere near that of ethanol pka likewise we can use table to predict that parahydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde an intermediate compound in the biosynthesis of morphine has a pka in the
