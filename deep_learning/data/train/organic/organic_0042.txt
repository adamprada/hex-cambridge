first as you continue your study of organic chemistry it will be a very good idea to commit to memory the approximate pka ranges of some important functional groups including water alcohols phenols ammonium thiols phosphates carboxylic acids and carbons next to carbonyl groups socalled acarbons these are the groups that you are most likely to see acting as acids or bases in biological organic reactions a word of caution when using the pka table be absolutely sure that you are considering the correct conjugate acidbase pair if you are asked to say something about the basicity of ammonia nh
