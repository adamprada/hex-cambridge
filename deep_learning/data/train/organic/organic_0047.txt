water is no longer required to be present in the solution for acid and base reactions to occur brønstedlowry definition jn brønsted and tm lowry independently developed the theory of proton donors and proton acceptors in acidbase reactions coincidentally in the same region and during the same year the arrhenius theory where acids and bases are defined by whether the molecule produces hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion when dissolved in water was too limiting because not all chemical reactions especially organic reactions occur in water the brønstedlowry theory defines an acid a proton donor while a base is a proton
