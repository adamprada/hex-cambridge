then that substance is the acid donates hydrogen ions if the number of hydrogens has increased then that substance is the base accepts hydrogen ions these definitions are normally applied to the reactants on the left if the reaction is viewed in reverse a new acid and base can be identified the substances on the right side of the equation are called the conjugate acid and conjugate base compared to those on the left also note that an acid turns into a conjugate base and the base turns into the conjugate acid after the reaction is over conjugate acidbase pairs
