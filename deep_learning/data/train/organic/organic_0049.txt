always write a conjugate acidbase pair as the acid followed by its conjugate base in the reverse reaction the cl ion in solution acts as a base to accept a proton from ho forming ho and hcl thus ho and ho constitute a second conjugate acidbase pair in general any acidbase reaction must contain two conjugate acidbase pairs which in this case are hclcl and hoho all acidbase reactions contain two conjugate acidbase pairs similarly in the reaction of acetic acid with water acetic acid donates a proton to water which acts as the base in the reverse reaction ho
