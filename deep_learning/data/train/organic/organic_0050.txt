the hydroxide ion acts as a base the conjugate acidbase pairs for this reaction are nhnh and hooh example aniline chnh is slightly soluble in water it has a nitrogen atom that can accept a hydrogen ion from a water molecule just like the nitrogen atom in ammonia does write the chemical equation for this reaction and identify the br√∏nstedlowry acid and base solution chnh and ho are the reactants when chnh accepts a proton from ho it gains an extra h and a positive charge and leaves an oh ion behind the reaction is as follows because chnh accepts
