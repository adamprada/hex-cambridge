and will typically either have vacant orbitals or a polar bond involving hydrogen such that it can donate h which has an empty s orbital lewis base a species that donates an electron pair and will have lonepair electrons of pi bonding electrons lewis acids neutral compounds of boron aluminum and the other group elements bf alcl which possess only six valence electrons have a very strong tendency to gain an additional electron pair because these compounds are only surrounded by three electron groups they are sp hybridized contained a vacant p orbital and are potent lewis acids trimethylamines lone
