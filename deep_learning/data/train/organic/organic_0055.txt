however their positive charges do attract electron donorsthe interaction between a magnesium cation mg and a carbonyl oxygen is a common example of a lewis acidbase reaction the carbonyl oxygen the lewis base donates a pair of electrons to the magnesium cation the lewis acid as we will see in chapter when we begin the study of reactions involving carbonyl groups this interaction has the very important effect of increasing the polarity of the carbonoxygen double bond the eightelectron rule does not hold throughout the periodic table in order to obtain noble gas configurations some atoms may need eighteen electrons
