however they are actually not so common instead protons are generally always bound to a lewis base hydrogen is almost always covalently or coordinately bonded to another atom many of the other elements commonly found in compounds with hydrogen are more electronegative than hydrogen as a result hydrogen often has a partial positive charge making is still act as a lewis acid a acidbase reaction involving protons might better be expressed as figure proton transfer from one site to another the lewis acidbase interactions we have looked at so far are slightly different here instead of two compounds coming together
