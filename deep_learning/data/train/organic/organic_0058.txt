of electrons available to share with another atom to form a bond the most readily available electrons are those that are not already in bonds bonding electrons are low in energy nonbonding electrons are higher in energy and may be stabilized when they are delocalized in a new bond lewis bases usually have nonbonding electrons or lone pairs this makes oxygen and nitrogen compounds common lewis bases lewis bases may be anionic or neutral the basic requirement is that they have a pair of electrons to donate figure some common organic examples of lewis bases most oxygen nitrogen and sulfur
