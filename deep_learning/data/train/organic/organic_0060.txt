also show where bonds are forming figure donation of electrons from a lewis base to a lewis acid the electrons donated from a lewis base to a lewis acid form a new bond a new larger compound is formed from the smaller lewis acid and lewis base this compound is called a lewis acidbase complex a simple example of lewis acidbase complexation involves ammonia and boron trifluoride the nitrogen atom has a lone pair and is an electron donor the boron has no octet and is an electron acceptor the two compounds can form a lewis acidbase complex or a
