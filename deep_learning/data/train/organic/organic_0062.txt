octet so it has an empty p orbital that can accept electrons c the oxygen atom in thf has lone pair electrons contained in a sp hybridized orbital d the boron in borane has six electrons around it so it would only need one lone pair donor to reach an octet e show using arrow notation the reaction to form a lewis acidbase complex f the borane initially reacts with water in air g after the boranethf complex is formed the boron atom has a complete octet making it less reactive exercises questions q for the following molecules state wither
