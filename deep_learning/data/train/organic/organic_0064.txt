the active site has evolved to fit one particular substrate and to catalyze one particular reaction other molecules do not fit in this active site nearly so well as fructose bisphosphate here are two closeup views of the same active site pocket showing some of the specific hydrogenbonding interactions between the substrate and active site amino acids the first image below is a threedimensional rendering directly from the crystal structure data the substrate is shown in spacefilling style while the active site amino acids are shown in the ball and stick style hydrogens are not shown the color scheme is
