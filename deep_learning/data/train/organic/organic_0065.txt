reaction is through entropy reduction by bringing order to a disordered situation remember that entropy is a component of gibbs free energy and thus a component of the activation energy lets turn again to our previous example from section c of a biochemical nucleophilic substitution reaction the methylation of adenosine in dna the reaction is shown below with nonreactive sections of the molecules depicted by variously shaped bubbles for the sake of simplicity in order for this reaction to occur the two substrates reactants must come into contact in precisely the right way if they are both floating around free
