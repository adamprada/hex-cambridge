more favorable new interactions with the functional groups lining the active site in a sense sam is moving from one solvent water to another solvent the active site where many new energetically favorable interactions are possible remember these new contacts between sam and the active site groups are highly specific to sam and sam alone no other molecule can fit so well in this precise active site environment and thus no other molecule will be likely to give up its contacts to water and bind to the active site the second substrate also has a specific spot reserved in the
