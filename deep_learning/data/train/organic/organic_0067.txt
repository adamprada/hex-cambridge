ordered situation with everything set up for the reaction to proceed this is what is meant by entropy reduction the entropic component of the energy barrier has been lowered looking a bit deeper though it is not really the noncovalent interaction between enzyme and substrate that are responsible for catalysis remember all catalysts enzymes included accelerate reactions by lowering the energy of the transition state with this in mind it should make sense that the primary job of an enzyme is to maximize favorable interactions with the transition state not with the starting substrates this does not imply that enzymesubstrate
