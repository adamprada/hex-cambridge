carbonsulfur bond has already begun to break in many enzymatic reactions certain active site amino acid residues contribute to catalysis by increasing the reactivity of the substrates often the catalytic role is that of acid andor base in our dna methylation example the nucleophilic nitrogen is deprotonated by a nearby aspartate side chain as it begins its nucleophilic attack on the methyl group of sam we will study nucleophilicity in greater detail in chapter but it should make intuitive sense that deprotonating the amine increases the electron density of the nitrogen making it more nucleophilic notice also in the figure
