therein lies the problem there are two transition states to which ts does the enzyme maximize its contacts recall that the first step the loss of the chloride leaving group to form the carbocation intermediate is the slower ratelimiting step it is this step that our hypothetical enzyme needs to accelerate if it wants to accelerate the overall reaction and it is thus the energy of ts that needs to be lowered by hammonds postulate we also know that the intermediate i is a close approximation of ts so the enzyme by stabilizing the intermediate will also stabilize ts as
