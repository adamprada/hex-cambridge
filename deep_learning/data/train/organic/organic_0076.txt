chloroform and koh the detailed mechanism of the formation of dichlorocarbene is given below note that the deprotonation of chloroform generates the trichloromethanide anion which spontaneously expels the chloride anion the highly strained nature of cyclopropane compounds makes them very reactive and interesting synthetic targets additionally cyclopropanes are present in numerous biological compounds one common method of cyclopropane synthesis is the reaction of carbenes with the double bond in alkenes or cycloalkenes methylene hc is simplest carbene and in general carbenes have the formula rc other species that will also react with alkenes to form cyclopropanes but do not follow
