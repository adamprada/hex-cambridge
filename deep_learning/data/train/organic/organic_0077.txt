paired electrons or two different sp orbitals to from a triplet carbene with unpaired electrons the chemistry of triplet and singlet carbenes is quite different but can be oversimplified to the statement singlet carbenes usually retain stereochemistry while triplet carbenes do not the carbenes discussed in this section are singlet and thus retain stereochemistry the reactivity of a singlet carbene is concerted and similar to that of electrophilic or nucleophilic addition although triplet carbenes react like biradicals explaining why sterochemistry is not retained the highly reactive nature of carbenes leads to very fast reactions in which the rate determining step
