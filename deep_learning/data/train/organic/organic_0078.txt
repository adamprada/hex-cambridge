generally formed along with the main reaction hence the starting material is diazomethane not methylene in the above case cisbutene is converted to cisdimethylcyclopropane likewise below the trans configuration is maintained additional types of carbenes and carbenoids in addition to the general carbene with formula rc there exist a number of other compounds that behave in much the same way as carbenes in the synthesis of cyclopropane halogenated carbenes are formed from halomethanes an example is dicholorcarbene clc these halogenated carbenes will form cyclopropanes in the same manner as methylene but with the interesting presence of two halogen atoms in
