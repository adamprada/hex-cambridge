copper metal what would be the result of a simmonssmith reaction that used transpentene as a reagent what starting material could be used to form cisdiethylcyclopropane what would the following reaction yield draw the product of this reaction what type of reaction is this answers the product will be a bicyclic ring bicycloheptane the stereochemistry will be retained making a cyclopropane with trans methyl and ethyl groups transethylmethylcyclopropane the cis configuration will be maintained from reagent to product so we would want to start with cishexene a simmons smith reagent or methylene could be used as the carbene or carbenoid
