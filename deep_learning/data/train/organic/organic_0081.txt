bromide released from the first step takes the role of thenucleophile and reacts with the cyclic bromonium ion with back side orientation therefore the stereochemistry of the product is a vicinial dihalides through antiaddition halogens that are commonly used in this type of the reaction are br and cl in thermodynamical terms i is too slow for this reaction because of the size of its atom and f is too vigorous and explosive solvents that are used for this type of electrophilic halogenation are inert eg ccl can be used in this reaction because halogen with negative charge can attack
