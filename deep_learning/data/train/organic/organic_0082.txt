electrons of alkene double bond electrophile halogen cl or br regiochemistry none stereochemistry antiadditon step the addition the brbr bond polarizes heterolytic cleavage occurs and br with the positive charge forms a intermediate cycle with the double bond step the bromide anion reacts with either carbon of the bridged bromonium ion from the back side of the ring the ring opens up and the two halogens are in the antiposition relative to each other exercise what is the mechanism of adding cl to the cyclohexene a reaction of br molecule in an inert solvent with alkene follows a syn addition
