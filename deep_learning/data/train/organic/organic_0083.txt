of hydrohalic acids hx with symmetrical alkenes this section looks at the reaction of symmetrical alkenes like ethene butene or cyclohexene with hydrogen halides such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide since these alkenes have identical groups attached to each end of the carboncarbon double bond regioselectivity does not apply addition to symmetrical alkenes all alkenes undergo addition reactions with the hydrogen halides a hydrogen atom joins to one of the carbon atoms originally in the double bond and a halogen atom to the other for example with ethene and hydrogen chloride you get chloroethane with butene you get chlorobutane
