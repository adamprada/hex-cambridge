halides provide both a electrophile proton and a nucleophile halide first the electrophile will attack the double bond and take up a set of Ï€ electrons attaching it to the molecule this is basically the reverse of the last step in the e reaction deprotonation step the resulting molecule will have a single carbon carbon bond with a positive charge on one of them carbocation the next step is when the nucleophile halide bonds to the carbocation producing a new molecule with both the original hydrogen and halide attached to the organic reactant the second step will only occur if
