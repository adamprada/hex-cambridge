halides react with alkenes the hydrogenhalogen bond has to be broken the bond strength falls as you go from hf to hi and the hydrogenfluorine bond is particularly strong because it is difficult to break the bond between the hydrogen and the fluorine the addition of hf is bound to be slow variation of rates when you change the alkene this applies to unsymmetrical alkenes as well as to symmetrical ones for simplicity the examples given below are all symmetrical ones but they dont have to be reaction rates increase as the alkene gets more complicated in the sense of
