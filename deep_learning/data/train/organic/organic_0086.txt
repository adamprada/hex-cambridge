negative the area around the double bonds becomes the more negatively charged that region becomes the more it will attract molecules like hydrogen chloride the more important reason though lies in the stability of the intermediate ion formed during the reaction the three examples given above produce these carbocations carbonium ions at the halfway stage of the reaction the stability of the intermediate ions governs the activation energy for the reaction as you go towards the more complicated alkenes the activation energy for the reaction falls that means that the reactions become faster exercise draw the bondline structures for the
