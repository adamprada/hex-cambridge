in any format contributors and attributions in recent years great progress has been made in quantummechanical calculations of the properties of small organic molecules by socalled ab initio methods which means calculations from basic physical theory using only fundamental constants without calibration from known molecular constants calculations that are calibrated by one or more known properties and then used to compute other properties are called semiempirical calculations it should be made clear that there is no single unique ab initio method rather there is a multitude of approaches all directed toward obtaining useful approximations to mathematical problems for which no
