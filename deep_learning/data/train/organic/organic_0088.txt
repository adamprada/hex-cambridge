enhance ones qualitative understanding of chemical bonding to be sure this should not be regarded as a necessary condition for making calculations but it also must be recognized that the whole qualitative orbital and hybridization approach to chemical bonding presented in this chapter was evolved from mathematical models used as starting points for early ab initio and semiempirical calculations the success of any given ab initio method is judged by how well it reproduces known molecular properties the efforts of many chemical theorists now are being directed to making calculations that could lead to useful new qualitative concepts of bonding
