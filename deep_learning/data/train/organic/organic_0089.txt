gvb method avoids specific hybridization assignments for the orbitals and calculates an optimum set of orbitals to give the most stable possible electronic configuration for the specified positions of the atomic nuclei electronamplitude contour diagrams of the gvb orbitals for ethene are shown in figure let us be clear about what these contour lines represent they are lines of equal electron amplitude analogous to topological maps for which contour lines are equalaltitude lines the electron amplitudes shown are those calculated in the planes containing the nuclei whose positions are shown with crosses in general the amplitudes decrease with distance from
