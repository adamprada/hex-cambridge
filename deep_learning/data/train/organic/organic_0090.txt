of opposite phase to the solid lines top shows both bonding carbon orbitals almost middleleft is the carbon orbital and middleright the hydrogen orbital of one of the bonds and bottom represents a side view of the orbitals in perpendicular section to the plane drawings furnished by dr w a goddard iii the physical significance of electron amplitude is that its square corresponds to the electron density a matter that we will discuss further in chapter the amplitude can be either positive or negative but its square the electron density is positive and this is the physical property that can
