similar sets of orbitals for the other ethene bonds when we look at the molecule edgewise perpendicular to the bond we see the contours of the individual essentially type orbitals for bonding ethyne shows two sets of these orbitals as expected figure representation of an onion with a quarter cut away the edges of the layers on the cut horizontal surface correspond to the electronamplitude contours shown in figure what is the difference between the gvb orbitals and the ordinary hybrid orbitals we have discussed previously in this chapter consider the like orbitals upper part of figure and the hybrids
