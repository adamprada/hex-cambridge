on in this context a carbon is primary if it is bonded to one other carbon secondary if bonded to two tertiary if bonded to three and quaternary if bonded to four thus either carbon of ethane is primary the carbon in propane is secondary and the carbon of dimethylpropane is quaternary the situation with regard to naming alkyl substituents has been muddied considerably by the fact that the iupac rules allow use of trivial names for a few alkyl groups thus secbutyl sometimes is used in place of methylpropyl and tertbutyl in place of dimethylethyl these and other examples
