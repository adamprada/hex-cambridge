each isomer in several different ways and you may inadvertently count the same isomer more than once alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of singlebonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups alkanes are often called saturated hydrocarbons because they have the maximum possible number of hydrogens per carbon in section thealkane molecule ethane was shown to contain a cc sigma bond by adding more cc sigma bond larger and more complexed alkanes can be formed methane ch ethane ch and propane ch are the beginning of a series of compounds in which any two members
