series in figure the sequence starts with ch and a ch unit is added in each step moving up the series any family of compounds in which adjacent members differ from each other by a definite factor here a ch group is called a homologous series the members of such a series called homologs have properties that vary in a regular and predictable manner figure members of a homologous series each succeeding formula incorporates one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms more than the previous formula the homologous series allows us to write a general formula for alkanes cnhn using
