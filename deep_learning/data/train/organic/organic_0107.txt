terms of reaction conditions and the factors affecting the rates of the reaction there is no difference whatsoever between these alkenes and the symmetrical ones described above the problem comes with the orientation of the addition of the hydrogen and the halogen across the double bond markovnikovs rule if hcl adds to an unsymmetrical alkene like propene there are two possible ways it could add however in practice there is only one major product according to markovnikovs rule markovnikovs rule when hx is added to an unsymmetrical alkene the hydrogen becomes attached to the carbon with the most hydrogens attached
