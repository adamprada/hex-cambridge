reactants a and b under the same conditions giving the constitutionally isomeric products c d and e there are two possibilities the three products form in equal amounts ie of the total product is c another d the remaining e these percentages are called relative yields of the products if this is what is observed the overall reaction between a and b is not regioselective one product forms in greater amounts than the others say for example the relative yields of c d and e are and respectively if this is what is observed the overall reaction between a and
