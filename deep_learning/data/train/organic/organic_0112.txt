carbontocarbon double bond the double bond makes alkenes more reactive than alkanes olefin is another term used to describe alkenes the alkene group can also be called a vinyl group and the carbons sharing the double bond can be called vinyl carbons alkenes nomenclature of alkenes is covered in chapter condensed structural formulas for the first eight alkenes are listed in table along with some relevant physical propoerties thus chch stands for the double bond is shared by the two carbon atoms and does not involve the hydrogen atoms although the condensed formula does not make this point obvious note
