valence electrons carbon is at its most stable lowest energy state it has all of the electrons that it wants so it is no longer reactive this forms a total of three bonds to each carbon atom giving them an hybridization since the carbon atom is forming three sigma bonds instead of the four that it can it only needs to hybridize three of its outer orbitals instead of four it does this by using the electron and two of the electrons leaving the other unchanged this new orbital is called an hybrid because thats exactly what it is it
