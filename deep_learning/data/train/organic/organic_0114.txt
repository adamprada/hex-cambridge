one sigma bond formed by overlap of sp hybrid orbitals and one pi bond formed by overlap of parallel p orbitals in ethene there is no free rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond because these two carbons also share a bond a bond is only formed when there is adequate overlap between both top and bottom porbitals free rotation the porbitals cause them to be from each other breaking the bond because there would be no overlap since the bond is essential to the structure of ethene it must not break so there can be not free rotation about the
