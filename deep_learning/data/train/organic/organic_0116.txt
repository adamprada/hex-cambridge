learning objective interpret and draw reaction energy diagrams for alcohol dehydration reactions propose mechanisms for dehydration reactions predict the products and specify the reagents for alkene synthesis from alcohol dehydration reactions predict and explain the stereochemistry of e eliminations to form alkenes especially from cyclohexanes dehydration of alcohols to yield alkenes one way to synthesize alkenes is by dehydration of alcohols alcohols undergo e or e mechanisms to lose water and form a double bond this mechanism is analogous to the alkyl halide mechanism the only difference is that hydroxide is a very poor leaving group so an extra step
