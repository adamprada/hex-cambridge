of alcohols may dehydrate through a slightly different mechanism pathway however the general idea behind each dehydration reaction is that the oh group in the alcohol donates two electrons to h from the acid reagent to form an alkyloxonium ion this ion acts as a very good leaving group for either the e or e mechanism the deprotonated acid the conjugate base then reacts with one of the betahydrogens to form a double bond primary alcohols and the e mechanism primary alcohols undergo bimolecular elimination e mechanism while secondary and tertiary alcohols undergo unimolecular elimination e mechanism the relative reactivity
