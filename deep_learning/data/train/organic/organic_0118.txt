alkyloxonium ions however the ion leaves first and forms a carbocation as the reaction intermediate the water molecule which is a stronger base than the hso ion then abstracts a proton from an adjacent carbon forming a double bond for example in the mechanism below that the alkene formed depends on which proton is abstracted the red arrows show formation of the more substituted butene while the blue arrows show formation of the less substituted butene recall the general rule that more substituted alkenes are more stable than less substituted alkenes and trans alkenes are more stable than cis alkenes
