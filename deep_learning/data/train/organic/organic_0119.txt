less substituted double bond is presumed due to steric hindrance of the methylene group hydrogen atoms which interferes with the approach of base at that site the second example shows two elimination procedures applied to the same Âºalcohol the first uses the single step pocl method which works well in this case because sn substitution is retarded by steric hindrance the second method is another example in which an intermediate sulfonate ester confers halogenlike reactivity on an alcohol in every case the anionic leaving group is the conjugate base of a strong acid carbocation rearrangements and the e mechanism carbocation
