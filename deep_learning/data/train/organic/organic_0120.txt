alkyl halides learning objective interpret and draw reaction energy diagrams for dehydrohalogenation of rxs propose mechanisms for a dehydrohalogenation reactions predict the products and specify the reagents for alkene synthesis from dehydrohalogenation of rxs predict and explain the stereochemistry of e eliminations to form alkenes especially from cyclohexanes alkene synthesis by elimination of alkyl halides is discussed in detail in chapter sections the major learning objectives are summarized briefly in this section alkene synthesis by elimination of alkyl halides when considering whether an elimination reaction is likely to occur via an e or e mechanism we really need to consider
