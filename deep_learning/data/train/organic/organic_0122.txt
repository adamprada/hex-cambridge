for a suitable synthesis of dimethylhexyne you would choose to attack iodoethane with the anion of dimethylbutyne rather than to attack iodomethylpropane with the anion of butyne the reasons will be made clear in chapter nucleophilic substitution reactions of acetylides acetylide anions are strong bases and strong nucleophiles therefore they are able to displace halides and other leaving groups in substitution reactions the product is a substituted alkyne because the ion is a very strong base the substitution reaction is most efficient with methyl or primary halides without substitution near the reaction center secondary tertiary or even bulky primary substrates
