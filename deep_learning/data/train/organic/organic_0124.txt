primary secondary tertiary and quaternary carbon atoms are explained in the following discussion a convenient way of memorizing this classification scheme is to remember that a primary carbon atom is attached directly to only one other carbon atom a secondary carbon atom is attached directly to two carbon atoms and so on the iupac system requires first that we have names for simple unbranched chains and second that we have names for simple alkyl groups that may be attached to the chains an alkyl group is formed by removing one hydrogen from the alkane chain the removal of this hydrogen
