an acidity orderis a list of compounds arranged in order of increasing or decreasing acidity the general ideas discussed in this section should already be familiar to you from your previous exposure to chemistry and from the review in section a slightly different account of why terminal alkynes are stronger acids than are alkenes or alkanes is given below however the argument is still based on the differences between sp sp and sphybrid orbitals the carbons of a triple bond are sphybridized an sphybrid orbital has a s character and a p character whereas an sphybrid orbital is s and
