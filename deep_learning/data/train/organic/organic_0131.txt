sodium amide and a terminal alkyne is an acidbase reaction the sodium acetylide product is of course a salt terminal alkynes can also form salts with certain heavymetal cations notably silveri and copperi in the laboratory component of this course you will use the formation of an insoluble silver acetylide as a method for distinguishing terminal alkynes from alkenes and nonterminal alkynes metal acetylides are explosive when dry they should be destroyed while still wet by warming with dilute nitric acid acidity of terminal alkynes formation of acetylide anions terminal alkynes are much more acidic than most other hydrocarbons removal
