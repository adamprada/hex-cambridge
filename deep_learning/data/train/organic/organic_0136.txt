symmetrical alkenes like ethene or butene are dealt with first these are alkenes where identical groups are attached to each end of the carboncarbon double bond addition to symmetrical alkenes all alkenes undergo addition reactions with the hydrogen halides a hydrogen atom joins to one of the carbon atoms originally in the double bond and a halogen atom to the other for example with ethene and hydrogen chloride you get chloroethane with butene you get chlorobutane what happens if you add the hydrogen to the carbon atom at the righthand end of the double bond and the chlorine to the
