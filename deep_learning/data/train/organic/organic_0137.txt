pi electrons attaching it to the molecule this is basically the reverse of the last step in the e reaction deprotonation step the resulting molecule will have a single carboncarbon bond with a positive charge on one of them carbocation the next step is when the nucleophile halide bonds to the carbocation producing a new molecule with both the original hydrogen and halide attached to the organic reactant the second step will only occur if a good nucleophile is used mechanism of electrophilic addition of hydrogen halide to ethene mechanism of electrophilic addition of hydrogen halide to propene all of
