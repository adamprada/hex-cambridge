multistep synthesis with correct regiochemistry and stereochemistry using the reactions studied to date introduction the study of organic chemistry introduces students to a wide range of interrelated reactions alkenes for example may be converted to structurally similar alkanes alcohols alkyl halides epoxides glycols and boranes cleaved to smaller aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids and enlarged by carbocation and radical additions as well as cycloadditions most of these reactions are shown in the alkene reaction map below all of these products may be subsequently transformed into a host of new compounds incorporating a wide variety of functional groups consequently the logical
