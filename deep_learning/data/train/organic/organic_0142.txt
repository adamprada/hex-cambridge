of the exercises simple multistep syntheses a one or two step sequence of simple reactions is not that difficult to deduce for example the synthesis of mesohexanediol from hexyne can occur by more than one multistep pathway one approach would be to reduce the alkyne to cis or transhexene before undertaking glycol formation permanaganate or osmium tetroxide hydroxylation of cishexene would form the desired meso isomer from transhexene it would be necessary to first epoxidize the alkene with a peracid followed by ring opening with acidic or basic hydrolysis longer multistep syntheses require careful analysis and thought since many options
