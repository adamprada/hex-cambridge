relevant functional group conversion reactions retrosynthesis is the approach of working backwards from the product to the starting material in the first example we are asked to synthesize butanol from acetylene the carbon chain doubles in size indicating an acetylide sn reaction with an alkyl halide primary alcohol formation from an antimarkovnikov alkene hydration reaction hydroborationoxidation is more likely than a substitution reaction applying retrosynthesis we work backwards from the alcohol to the alkene to the alkyne from an acetylide reaction that initially builds the carbon chain retrosynthesis working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each transformation identified from
