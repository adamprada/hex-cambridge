of both bromine atoms to the same carbon atom also supports the idea that hydrohalogenation occurs on an alkyne and not an alkene the formation of the geminal dihalide also indicates hydrohalogenation instead of halogenatioin because halogenation produces vicinal dihalides with this insight the retrosynthesis indicates the following series of chemical transformations retrosynthesis working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each transformation in the third example we are asked to produce oxoheptanal from methylcyclohexane counting the carbons the starting material and product both contain seven carbon atoms and there is a cleavage reaction of an alkene under reductive conditions
