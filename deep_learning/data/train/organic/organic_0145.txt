be used for the second step to follow an e mechanism and form methylcyclohexene the aldhyde group on the final product indicates gentle oxidative cleavage by any of several reaction pathways these reactions can be combined in to the following multistep synthesis reaction maps to build functional group conversion mastery after working through the examples above we can see how important it is to memorize all of the functional group reactions studied in the first ten chapters we can apply the knowledge of these reactions to the wisdom of multistep syntheses please note the reagents for each chemical transformation have
