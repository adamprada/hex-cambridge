converted to structurally similar alkanes alcohols alkyl halides epoxides glycols and boranes cleaved to smaller aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids and enlarged by carbocation and radical additions as well as cycloadditions all of these products may be transformed subsequently to a host of new compounds incorporating a wide variety of functional groups and thereby open to even further elaboration consequently the logical conception of a multistep synthesis for the construction of a designated compound from a specified starting material becomes one of the most challenging problems that may be posed a one or two step sequence of simple reactions is
