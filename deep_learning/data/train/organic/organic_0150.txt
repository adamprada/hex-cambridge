synthetic constructions each simpler structure so generated becomes the starting point for further disconnections leading to a branched set of interrelated intermediates a retrosynthetic transform is depicted by the symbol as shown below for previous examples once a complete analysis has been conducted the desired synthesis may be carried out by application of the reactions underlying the transforms the above diagram does not provide a complete set of transforms for these target compounds when a starting material is specified as in the above problems the proposed pathways must reflect that constraint thus the methylpentanone and methylbutyrate ester options in example
