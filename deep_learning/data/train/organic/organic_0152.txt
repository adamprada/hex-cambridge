of these compounds the special properties associated with the benzene nucleus are retained a few examples of benzenoid hydrocarbons follow and it will be noticed that the hydrocarbon substituents include alkyl alkenyl and alkynyl groups many have trivial names indicated in parentheses the hydrocarbon group from benzene itself is called a phenyl group and often is abbreviated as or less preferably by the symbol generally aryl groups are abbreviated as in contrast to alkyl groups for which we use thus is a methylsubstituted arene whereas is an alkylsubstituted benzene when there are two or more substituents on a benzene ring
