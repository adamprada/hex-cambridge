carboncarbon single bond can occur without changing the overlap of the sp hybrid orbitals there is no significant electronic energy barrier to rotation consequently many different arrangements of the atoms are possible each corresponding to different degrees of rotation differences in threedimensional structure resulting from rotation about a Ïƒ bond are called differences in conformation and each different arrangement is called a conformational isomer or conformer structural isomers unlike conformational isomers which do not differ in connectivity structural isomers differ in connectivity as illustrated here for propanol and propanol although these two alcohols have the same molecular formula cho the
