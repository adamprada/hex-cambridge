bonds are broken in going from a to d or from b to c these alternative representations are not structural isomers the three structural isomerseither a or d either b or c and ehave distinct physical and chemical properties stereoisomers molecules with the same connectivity but different arrangements of the atoms in space are called stereoisomers there are two types of stereoisomers geometric and optical geometric isomers differ in the relative positions of substituents in a rigid molecule simple rotation about a cc σ bond in an alkene for example cannot occur because of the presence of the π bond
