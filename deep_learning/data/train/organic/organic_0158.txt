bases introduction in the swedish chemist svante arrhenius proposed two specific classifications of compounds termed acids and bases when dissolved in an aqueous solution certain ions were released into the solution as defined by arrhenius acidbase reactions are characterized by acids which dissociate in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions h and bases which form hydroxide oh ions arrhenius received the lowest passing score for his doctoral thesis with these innovative ideas about acids and bases ten years later he was awarded the nobel prize for his insights acids are defined as a compound or element that releases hydrogen h
