listed in table ammoniadoes not have hydroxide as part of its formula how does this compound increase the amount of hydroxide ion in aqueous solution instead of dissociating into hydroxide ions ammonia molecules react with water molecules by taking a hydrogen ion from the water molecule to produce an ammonium ion and a hydroxide ion because this reaction of ammonia with water causes an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions in solution ammonia satisfies the arrhenius definition of a base many other nitrogencontaining compounds are bases because they too react with water to produce hydroxide ions in aqueous solution
