the ground state with energy to an excited state of configuration and energy the difference in energy is related directly to the frequency or wavelength of the absorbed quantum of radiation by the equation in which is plancks constant and is the velocity of light the relationship often is called the bohr frequency condition for chemical reactions we usually express energy changes in for absorption of one quantum of radiation by each atom or each molecule in one mole the energy change is related to by as defined corresponds to one einstein of radiation what we have developed here is
