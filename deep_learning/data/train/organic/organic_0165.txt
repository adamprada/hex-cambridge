these molecules in such a way to minimize repulsions between like charges a basically tetrahedral arrangement will be expected because this will place the nuclei and electron pairs as widely separated as possible the water molecule could be formulated this way as in with the figure abbreviated atomicorbital model of ethane showing only the orbitals of the outershell electrons oxygen at the center of the tetrahedron the simple picture predicts that the bond angle should be tetrahedral but actually it is there are two schools of thought as to why the angle is one idea is that the repulsion model
