water the angle will be less than tetrahedral because the larger repulsion between the two unshared pairs will tend to push the bonding pairs closer together a similar but smaller effect is expected for ammonia because now the repulsion is only between the one unshared pair and bonding pairs the ammonia angle is which is only slightly smaller than the tetrahedral value of the alternative point of view of why the bond angle of water is starts with the premise that in the simplest approximation the angle should be to see how this comes about let us compare with you
