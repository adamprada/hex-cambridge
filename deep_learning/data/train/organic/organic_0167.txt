between the hydrogen nuclei is expected to widen the bond angle an argument in favor of this formulation is provided by the bond angle in which is this is much closer to the expected for bond orbitals and the hydrogens in would not be expected to repel each other as much as in because sulfur is a larger atom than oxygen both ways of formulating the orbitals used in the bonding of water molecules are in current use arguments can be advanced in favor of both highly sophisticated quantummechanical calculations which we will say more about later suggest that oxygen
