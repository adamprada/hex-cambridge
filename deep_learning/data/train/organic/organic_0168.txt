figure abbreviated atomicorbital model of methanol showing the orbitals of the outershell electrons only c compounds with double bonds recall from chapter that bond angles in compounds with carboncarbon double bonds such as ethene are closer to than to the normal tetrahedral value of there are several way sin which a carboncarbon double bond can be formulated in terms of atomicorbital models one very popular approach is to consider that ethene has two hybridized carbons that form one carboncarbon bond and four carbonhydrogen bonds by overlap of the six orbitals as shown in figure the remaining carboncarbon bond is formulated
