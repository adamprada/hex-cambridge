are found to be rather than the predicted for bonds an explanation of this discrepancy using further electronrepulsion arguments will be discussed later in the chapter figure schematic representation of overlap and overlap of orbitals the simple elegance of the sigma model of ethene should not be taken as proving that there actually are two different kinds of bonds between the carbons the representation of double bonds is not really unique given hybridization of the carbons so there are bonds to the hydrogens it is possible to take the and orbitals used for the and bonds rehybridize them and so
