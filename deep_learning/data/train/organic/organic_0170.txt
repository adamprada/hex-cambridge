not be very stable here the orbitals are not in position to overlap effectively in the manner the favored configuration is expected to have the axes of the orbitals parallel because considerable energy would have to be expended to break the double bond and to permit rotation about the remaining bond restricted rotation and stable cistrans isomers are expected similar conclusions can be reached on the basis of the model of the double bond figure orientation of orbitals in twisted configuration of ethene d compounds with triple bonds ethyne is an organic compound that usually is formulated with hybrid bonds
