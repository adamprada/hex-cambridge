bond energies table and their acidities section these differences in properties are in keeping with the different states of hybridization of the carbon orbitals that we have postulated for ethane ethene and ethyne e more on hybrid bond orbitals and molecular geometry a summary of the directional character of the hybrid atomic orbitals discussed so far is given in table by referring to this table it usually is possible to deduce the nature of the bonding orbitals for most organic compounds from the molecular geometry if this is known thus a tetrahedral molecule with four attached ligands uses hybrid orbitals
