as bonded to carbon in or to boron in imply hybridization for the central atom and a planar triangular arrangement if ligands two ligands as in imply hybridization and linear geometry in many of our later discussions of organic reactions we will be concerned with cationic radical and anionic carbon species that are substitution products of and because of the importance of these entities you should know how to formulate them and related substances such as with atomic orbitals perhaps the most straightforward way is to start from and see what changes in the bonds we would expect as the
