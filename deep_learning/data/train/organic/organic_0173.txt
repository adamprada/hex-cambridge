and the extra electron in a orbital or with orbitals for the bonds and the extra electron in an orbital the actual structure of has the hydrogens and carbons in a plane left therefore it appears that the repulsions between the bonding electron pairs is greater than the repulsions between the extra electron and the bonding pairs the actual structure corresponds to the one in which the bonding pairs are as far apart as possible f more on interelectronic repulsion and bond angles molecules of the type which have four identical ligands on the central atom and no unshared electrons
