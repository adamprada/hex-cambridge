except that one of the ligands now has a double complement of bonding electrons therefore the carbon orbitals are expected to be directed in one plane to give bond angles that deviate somewhat from because of the high density of electrons in the multiple bond thus the angle shrinks to whereas the angles open up to because repulsion between electrons in the bonds is greater than between electrons in the bonds electronattracting power or electronegativity of the ligands also is important in determining bond angles thus for compounds of the type in which is a more electronattracting group than carbon
