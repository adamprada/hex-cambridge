ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations the valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element electron configurations the electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also
