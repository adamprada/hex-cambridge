electrons electrons exhibit a negative charge and are found around the nucleus of the atom in electron orbitals defined as the volume of space in which the electron can be found within probability the four different types of orbitals spd and f have different shapes and one orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons the p d and f orbitals have different sublevels thus can hold more electrons as stated the electron configuration of each element is unique to its position on the periodic table the energy level is determined by the period and the number of electrons is
