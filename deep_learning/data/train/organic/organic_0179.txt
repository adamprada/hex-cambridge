up to electrons the d subshell has orbitals that hold up to electrons and the f subshell has orbitals with electrons example hydrogen and helium the first three quantum numbers of an electron are n l ml only two electrons can correspond to these which would be either ms or ms as we already know from our studies of quantum numbers and electron orbitals we can conclude that these four quantum numbers refer to the s subshell if only one of the ms values are given then we would have s denoting hydrogen if both are given we would have
