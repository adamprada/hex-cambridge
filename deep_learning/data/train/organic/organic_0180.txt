negatively charged electrons fill orbitals they first try to get as far as possible from each other before having to pair up example oxygen and nitrogen if we look at the correct electron configuration of the nitrogen z atom a very important element in the biology of plants s s p we can clearly see that p orbitals are halffilled as there are three electrons and three p orbitals this is because hunds rule states that the three electrons in the p subshell will fill all the empty orbitals first before filling orbitals with electrons in them if we look
