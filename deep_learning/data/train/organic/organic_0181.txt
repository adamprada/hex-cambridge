order of levels filled is then s s p s p s d p s d p s f d p s f d and p the general order in which orbitals are filled is depicted in figure subshells corresponding to each value of n are written from left to right on successive horizontal lines where each row represents a row in the periodic table the order in which the orbitals are filled is indicated by the diagonal lines running from the upper right to the lower left accordingly the s orbital is filled prior to the d orbital because
