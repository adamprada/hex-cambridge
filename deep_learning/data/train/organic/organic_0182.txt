in multielectron atoms if you write the subshells for each value of the principal quantum number on successive lines the observed order in which they are filled is indicated by a series of diagonal lines running from the upper right to the lower left the aufbau process aufbau comes from the german word aufbauen meaning to build when writing electron configurations orbitals are built up from atom to atom when writing the electron configuration for an atom orbitals are filled in order of increasing atomic number however there are some exceptions to this rule example rd row elements following the
