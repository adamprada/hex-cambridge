preceding phosphorus in the periodic table then subtract its number of electrons from those in phosphorus to obtain the number of valence electrons in phosphorus referring to figure draw an orbital diagram to represent those valence orbitals following hunds rule place the valence electrons in the available orbitals beginning with the orbital that is lowest in energy write the electron configuration from your orbital diagram ignore the inner orbitals those that correspond to the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas and write the valence electron configuration for phosphorus solution a because phosphorus is in the third row of the
