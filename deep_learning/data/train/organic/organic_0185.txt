phosphorus means that we ignore the ne closed shell this gives a valenceelectron configuration of sp exercise draw an orbital diagram and use it to derive the electron configuration of chlorine z what is its valence electron configuration answer nesp sp the sixth row of the periodic table will be different from the preceding two because the f orbitals which can hold electrons are filled between the s and the d orbitals the elements that contain f orbitals in their valence shell are the lanthanides when the p orbitals are finally filled we have reached the next and last known
