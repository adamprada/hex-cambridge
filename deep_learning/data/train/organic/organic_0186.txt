using the periodic table as a guide we obtain s row electrons sp row electrons sp row electrons sdp row electrons sdp row electrons row electrons after filling the first five rows we still have more electrons to accommodate according to figure we need to fill the s electrons f electrons and d electrons orbitals the result is mercurys electron configuration sspspsdpsdpsfd hg xesfd with a filled d subshell a sfd valence shell configuration and a total of electrons you should always check to be sure that the total number of electrons equals the atomic number summary based on the
