of space with different probabilities of having an electron one way of representing electron probability distributions was illustrated in figure for the s orbital of hydrogen because ψ gives the probability of finding an electron in a given volume of space such as a cubic picometer a plot of ψ versus distance from the nucleus r is a plot of the probability density the s orbital is spherically symmetrical so the probability of finding a s electron at any given point depends only on its distance from the nucleus the probability density is greatest at r at the nucleus and
