on each spherical shell recall that the electron probability density is greatest at r part b in figure so the density of dots is greatest for the smallest spherical shells in part a in figure in contrast the surface area of each spherical shell is equal to Ï€r which increases very rapidly with increasing r part c in figure because the surface area of the spherical shells increases more rapidly with increasing r than the electron probability density decreases the plot of radial probability has a maximum at a particular distance part d in figure most important when r is
