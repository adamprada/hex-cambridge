of the dots is therefore greatest in the innermost shells of the onion c the surface area of each shell given by Ï€r increases rapidly with increasing r d if we count the number of dots in each spherical shell we obtain the total probability of finding the electron at a given value of r because the surface area of each shell increases more rapidly with increasing r than the electron probability density decreases a plot of electron probability versus r the radial probability shows a peak this peak corresponds to the most probable radius for the electron pm which
