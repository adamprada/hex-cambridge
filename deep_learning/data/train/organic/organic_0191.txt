the wavelike behavior of the electron and the heisenberg uncertainty principle figure compares the electron probability densities for the hydrogen s s and s orbitals note that all three are spherically symmetrical for the s and s orbitals however and for all other s orbitals as well the electron probability density does not fall off smoothly with increasing r instead a series of minima and maxima are observed in the radial probability plots part c in figure the minima correspond to spherical nodes regions of zero electron probability which alternate with spherical regions of nonzero electron probability figure probability densities
