the wave function is negative c in these plots of electron probability as a function of distance from the nucleus r in all directions radial probability the most probable radius increases as n increases but the s and s orbitals have regions of significant electron probability at small values of r s orbitals three things happen to s orbitals as n increases figure they become larger extending farther from the nucleus they contain more nodes this is similar to a standing wave that has regions of significant amplitude separated by nodes points with zero amplitude for a given atom the
