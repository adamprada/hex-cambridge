as the value of l increases the number of orbitals in a given subshell increases and the shapes of the orbitals become more complex because the p subshell has l with three values of ml and there are three p orbitals figure the colors correspond to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is positive orange and negative blue the electron probability distribution for one of the hydrogen p orbitals is shown in figure because this orbital has two lobes of electron density arranged along the z axis with an electron density of zero in the xy
