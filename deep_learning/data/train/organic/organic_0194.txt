wave that describes the electron motion not to positive or negative charges figure the three equivalent p orbitals of the hydrogen atom the surfaces shown enclose of the total electron probability for the px py and pz orbitals each orbital is oriented along the axis indicated by the subscript and a nodal plane that is perpendicular to that axis bisects each p orbital the phase of the wave function is positive orange in the region of space where x y or z is positive and negative blue where x y or z is negative just as with the s orbitals
