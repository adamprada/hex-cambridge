compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations the valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element exercises what kind of orbital is show below of s s or s which is furthest from the nucleus of s s or s which is the lowest in energy what is the l value for a p orbital solutions pz there are three p orbitals each of which is orientated
