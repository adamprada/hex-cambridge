the characteristics of its components atoms consist of electrons protons and neutrons although this is an oversimplification that ignores the other subatomic particles that have been discovered it is sufficient for discussion of chemical principles some properties of these subatomic particles are summarized in table which illustrates three important points electrons and protons have electrical charges that are identical in magnitude but opposite in sign relative charges of and are assigned to the electron and proton respectively neutrons have approximately the same mass as protons but no charge they are electrically neutral the mass of a proton or a neutron
