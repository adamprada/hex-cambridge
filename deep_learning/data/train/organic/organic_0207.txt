a bit more than a right angle reflecting the common o bond angle each carbon has an axial and an equatorial bond each face of the cyclohexane ring has three axial and three equatorial bonds each face alternates between axial and equatorial bonds then looking at the up bond on each carbon in the cyclohexane ring they will alternate axialequatorialaxial ect when looking down at a cyclohexane ring the equatorial bonds will form an equator around the ring the axial bonds will either face towards you or away these will alternate with each axial bond the first axial bond will
