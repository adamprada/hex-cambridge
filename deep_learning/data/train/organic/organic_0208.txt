position in the next section will discuss the energy differences between these two possible conformations below are the two possible chair conformations of methylcyclohexane created by a ringflip although the conformation which places the methyl group in the equatorial position is more stable by kjmol the energy provided by ambient temperature allows the two conformations to rapidly interconvert the figure below illustrates how to convert a molecular model of cyclohexane between two different chair conformations this is something that you should practice with models notice that a ring flip causes equatorial groups to become axial and viceversa example for the
