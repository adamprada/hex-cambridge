going either straight up or straight down equatorial bonds will be roughly in the plane of the cyclohexane ring only slightly up or down sometimes it is valuable to draw in the additional bonds on the carbons of interest with this it can be concluded that the bromine and chlorine substituents are attached in equatorial positions and the ch substituent is attached in an axial position exercises draw two conformations of cyclohexyl amine chnh indicate axial and equatorial positions draw the two isomers of dihydroxylcyclohexane identify which are equatorial and axial in the following molecule label which are equatorial and
