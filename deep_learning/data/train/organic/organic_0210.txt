state university organic chemistry with a biological emphasis by tim soderberg university of minnesota morris dr kelly matthews harrisburg area community college layne morsch university of illinois springfield some chiral organic biomoleculescontributors and attributions learning objective recognize and explain biochemical applications of chirality some chiral organic biomolecules there are a number of important biomolecules that could occur as enantiomers including amino acids and sugars in most cases only one enantiomer occurs although some fungi for example are able to produce mirrorimage forms of these compounds we will look later at some of these biomolecules but first we will look at
