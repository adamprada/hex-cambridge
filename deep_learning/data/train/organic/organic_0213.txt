than h so this group has higher priority the secondhighest priority is the branch that reaches the oxygen at the third bond from the chiral center comparing atoms stepbystep to assign configuration how different exactly are these two compounds and carvone are they completely different isomers with different physical properties in most ways the answer is no these two compounds have the same appearance colorless oil the same boiling point c the same refractive index and specific gravity however they have optical rotations that are almost exactly opposite values two enantiomers have the same physical properties enantiomers have opposite optical
