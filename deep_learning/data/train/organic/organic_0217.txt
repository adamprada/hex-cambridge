critical to their metabolic role as the entry point of electrons into the electron transport phase of respiration electrons harvested from the oxidation of fuel molecules are channeled one by one by fmnh into the electron transport chain where they eventually reduce molecular oxygen nadh is incapable of single electron transfer all it can do is transfer two electrons in the form of a hydride to fmn the regenerated fmnh is then able to continue sending single electrons into the transport chain you will learn more details about this process in a biochemistry class because flavins are capable of singleelectron
