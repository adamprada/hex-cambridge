for example the enolate intermediate first donates a single electron to fad forming a radical semiquinone intermediate step the second electron is transferred when the semiquinone intermediate abstracts a hydrogen from cb in a homolytic fashion step scientists are still not sure which mechanism the hydride transfer mechanism that we saw in section b or the single electron transfer detailed above more accurately depicts what is going on in this reaction the conjugated elimination catalyzed by chorismate synthase section b is another example of a reaction where the participation of flavin throws doubt on the question of what is the
