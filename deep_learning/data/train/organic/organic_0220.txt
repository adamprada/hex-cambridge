at the first enolforming step in the reaction below the second step is simply a tautomerization from the enol to the ketone product notice in this mechanism that an ecb elimination is not possible there is no electronwithdrawing group like a carbonyl to stabilize the carbanion intermediate that would form if the proton were abstracted first there is however an electrondonating group the lone pair on a nitrogen that can stabilize a positivelycharged intermediate that forms when the water leaves another good example of a biological elike reaction is the elimination of phosphate in the formation of enolpyruvylshikimatephosphate epsp an
