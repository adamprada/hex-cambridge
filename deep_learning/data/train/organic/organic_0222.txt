this phosphate ester can take the form of a simple monophosphate arrow in the figure below a diphosphate arrow or a nucleotide monophosphate arrow due to resonance delocalization of the developing negative charge phosphates are excellent leaving groups heres a specific example from dna nucleotide biosynthesis here the oh group on ribofuranose is converted to a diphosphate a much better leaving group ammonia is the nucleophile in the second step of this snlike reaction what is important for now is that in each case an alcohol has been converted into a much better leaving group and is now primed for
