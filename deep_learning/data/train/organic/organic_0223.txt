is called an omethyltransferase in both cases though a basic amino acid side chain is positioned in the active site in just the right place to deprotonate the nucleophilic group as it attacks increasing its nucleophilicity the electrophile in both reactions is a methyl carbon so there is little steric hindrance to slow down the nucleophilic attack the methyl carbon is electrophilic because it is bonded to a positivelycharged sulfur which is a powerful electron withdrawing group the positive charge on the sulfur also makes it an excellent leaving group as the resulting product will be a neutral and very
