a bond the answer is that two overlapping atomic figure representation of the formation of an bond by sharing of electrons in overlapping orbitals orbitals can be considered to combine to give one lowenergy bonding molecular orbital and one highenergy antibonding molecular orbital see the top part of figure a orbitals that overlap as shown in figure a are said to overlap in the sigma manner and the bonding orbital is called a sigma orbital the antibonding orbital is called a orbital read sigma star two paired electrons suffice to fill the orbital any additional electrons must go into the
