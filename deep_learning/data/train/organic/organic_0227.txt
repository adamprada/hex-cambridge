sigma bond results in many different possible threedimensional arrangements of the atoms pi bonds are rigid pi bonds are created from overlapping p orbitals the lobes of the p orbitals prevent the atoms sharing pi bonds from rotating as shown in the diagram below double and triple bonds cannot rotate the pi bonds in double and triple bonds prevent these bonds from rotating this rigidity has an effect on the physical structure of compounds and can influence chemical reactivity for now we want to build the habit of looking at static drawings and diagrams of organic compounds and visualizing their
