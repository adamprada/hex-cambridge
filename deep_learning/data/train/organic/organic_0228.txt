acids and bases ones that focus on proton transfer a brønstedlowry acid is any species that can donate a proton h to another molecule a brønstedlowry base is any species that can accept a proton from another molecule in short a brønstedlowry acid is a proton donor pd while a brønstedlowry base is a proton acceptor pa a brønstedlowry acid is a proton donor while a brønstedlowry base is a proton acceptor let us use the reaction of ammonia in water to demonstrate the brønstedlowry definitions of an acid and a base ammonia and water molecules are reactants while the
