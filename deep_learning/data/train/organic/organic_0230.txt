molecule to the ho molecule to make chloride ions and hydronium ions as the hydrogen ion donor hcl acts as a brønstedlowry acid as a hydrogen ion acceptor ho is a brønstedlowry base so hcl is an acid not just in the arrhenius sense but also in the brønstedlowry sense moreover by the brønstedlowry definitions ho is a base in the formation of aqueous hcl so the brønstedlowry definitions of an acid and a base classify the dissolving of hcl in water as a reaction between an acid and a basealthough the arrhenius definition would not have labeled ho a
