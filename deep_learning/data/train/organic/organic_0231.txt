accepts a proton from ho it gains an extra h and a positive charge and leaves an oh ion behind the reaction is as follows because chnh accepts a proton it is the brønstedlowry base the ho molecule because it donates a proton is the brønstedlowry acid exercise identify the brønstedlowry acid and the brønstedlowry base in this chemical equation answer brønstedlowry acid hpo brønstedlowry base ho exercise which of the following compounds is a bronstedlowry base hcl hpo hpo nh chnh answer a brønstedlowry base is a proton acceptor which means it will take in an h this eliminates
