all acidbase reactions involve the transfer of protons between acids and bases for example consider the acidbase reaction that takes place when ammonia is dissolved in water a water molecule functioning as an acid transfers a proton to an ammonia molecule functioning as a base yielding the conjugate base of water and the conjugate acid of ammonia in the reaction of ammonia with water to give ammonium ions and hydroxide ions ammonia acts as a base by accepting a proton from a water molecule which in this case means that water is acting as an acid in the reverse reaction
