the top right the conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong base is a very weak acid example identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium solution similarly in the reaction of acetic acid with water acetic acid donates a proton to water which acts as the base in the reverse reaction is the acid that donates a proton to the acetate ion which acts as the base once again we have two conjugate acidbase pairs the parent acid and its conjugate base and the parent base and
