of as the point when a solution cannot dissolve anymore of a substance added to it in terms of degrees of unsaturation a molecule only containing single bonds with no rings is considered saturated chchch methyoxypentane unlike saturated molecules unsaturated molecules contain double bonds triple bonds andor rings chchchch chlorooctyne calculating the degree of unsaturation dou if the molecular formula is given plug in the numbers into this formula is the number of carbons is the number of nitrogens is the number of halogens f cl br i is the number of hydrogens as stated before a saturated molecule contains
