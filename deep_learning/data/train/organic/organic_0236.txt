the molecule needs to be classified as saturated hence the dob formula divides by the formula subtracts the number of xs because a halogen x replaces a hydrogen in a compound for instance in chloroethane chcl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane ch for a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present therefore we add the number of nitrogens n this can be seen with chn compared to ch oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements as seen in alcohols
