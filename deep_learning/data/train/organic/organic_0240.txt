by no means universally accepted a more common explanation involving the concept of an inductive effect is given below it is a general principle in chemistry that the more a charge is dispersed the more stable is the species carrying the charge put simply a species in which a positive charge is shared between two atoms would be more stable than a similar species in which the charge is borne wholly by a single atom in a tertiary carbocation the positively charged carbon atom attracts the bonding electrons in the three carboncarbon sigma Ïƒ bonds and thus creates slight positive
