available for this purpose while a primary carbocation has only one alkyl group available thus the observed order of stability for carbocations is as follows tertiary secondary primary methyl stability of carbocation intermediates we know that the ratelimiting step of an sn reaction is the first step formation of the this carbocation intermediate the rate of this step and therefore the rate of the overall substitution reaction depends on the activation energy for the process in which the bond between the carbon and the leaving group breaks and a carbocation forms according to hammonds postulate section b the more stable
