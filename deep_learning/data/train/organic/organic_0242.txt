to stabilize it conversely a carbocation will be destabilized by an electron withdrawing group alkyl groups methyl ethyl and the like are weak electron donating groups and thus stabilize nearby carbocations what this means is that in general more substituted carbocations are more stable a tertbutyl carbocation for example is more stable than an isopropyl carbocation primary carbocations are highly unstable and not often observed as reaction intermediates methyl carbocations are even less stable alkyl groups are electron donating and carbocationstabilizing because the electrons around the neighboring carbons are drawn towards the nearby positive charge thus slightly reducing the electron
