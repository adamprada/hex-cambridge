effect of the ester carbonyl recall that inductive effects whether electronwithdrawing or donating are relayed through covalent bonds and that the strength of the effect decreases rapidly as the number of intermediary bonds increases in other words the effect decreases with distance in species b the positive charge is closer to the carbonyl group thus the destabilizing electronwithdrawing effect is stronger than it is in species a in the next chapter we will see how the carbocationdestabilizing effect of electronwithdrawing fluorine substituents can be used in experiments designed to address the question of whether a biochemical nucleophilic substitution reaction is
