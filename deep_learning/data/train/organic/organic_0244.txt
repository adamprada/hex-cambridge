charge results in significant stabilization as a result benzylic and allylic carbocations where the positively charged carbon is conjugated to one or more nonaromatic double bonds are significantly more stable than even tertiary alkyl carbocations because heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen are more electronegative than carbon you might expect that they would by definition be electron withdrawing groups that destabilize carbocations in fact the opposite is often true if the oxygen or nitrogen atom is in the correct position the overall effect is carbocation stabilization this is due to the fact that although these heteroatoms are electron withdrawing groups
