possible in fact in these carbocation species the heteroatoms actually destabilize the positive charge because they are electron withdrawing by induction finally vinylic carbocations in which the positive charge resides on a doublebonded carbon are very unstable and thus unlikely to form as intermediates in any reaction example in which of the structures below is the carbocation expected to be more stable explain answer in the carbocation on the left the positive charge is located in a position relative to the nitrogen such that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen can be donated to fill the empty orbital
