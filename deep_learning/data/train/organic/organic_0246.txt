the nitrogen atoms answer when considering the possibility that a nucleophilic substitution reaction proceeds via an sn pathway it is critical to evaluate the stability of the hypothetical carbocation intermediate if this intermediate is not sufficiently stable an sn mechanism must be considered unlikely and the reaction probably proceeds by an sn mechanism in the next chapter we will see several examples of biologically important sn reactions in which the positively charged intermediate is stabilized by inductive and resonance effects inherent in its own molecular structure example state which carbocation in each pair below is more stable or if they
