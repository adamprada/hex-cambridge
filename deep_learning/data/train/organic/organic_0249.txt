primary energetic consideration stabilization of the carbocation via solvation is also an important consideration because carbocations are highly reactive the strength of the base is not important and weak bases can be used since sn and e reactions behave similarly they often compete against each other many times both these reactions will occur simultaneously to form different products from a single reaction however one can be favored over another through thermodynamic control heating the reaction favors elimination over substitution in order of decreasing importance the factors impacting e reaction pathways are structure of the alkyl halide stability of the carbocation
