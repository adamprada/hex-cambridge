the leaving group e reactions only require a neighboring hydrogen this is due to the fact that the leaving group has already left the molecule the final product is an alkene along with the hb byproduct and leaving group salt once again we see the two steps of the e mechanism a base deprotonates a beta carbon to form a pi bond in this case we see a mixture of products rather than one discrete one this is the case because the carbocation has two nearby carbons that are capable of being deprotonated but that only one forms a major
