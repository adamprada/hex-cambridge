means of carbocation rearrangement to move the positive charge to a nearby carbon secondary and tertiary carbons form more stable carbocations thus this formation occurs quite rapidly secondary carbocations can be subject to the e reaction pathway but this generally occurs in the presence of a good strong base adding a weak base to the reaction disfavors e essentially pushing towards the e pathway in many instances solvolysis occurs rather than using a base to deprotonate this means heat is added to the solution and the solvent itself deprotonates a hydrogen the medium can effect the pathway of the reaction
