mechanism below we can see two possible pathways for the reaction either one leads to a plausible resultant product however only one forms a major product as stated by zaitsevs rule deprotonation of the most substituted carbon results in the most substituted alkene this then becomes the most stable product due to hyperconjugation and is also more common than the minor product exercises which of these steps is the rate determining step a or b what is the major product formed c or d in order to produce the most stable alkene product from which carbon should the base deprotonate
