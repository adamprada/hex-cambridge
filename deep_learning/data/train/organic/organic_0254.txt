reactive via the sn mechanism because carbocation stability is the primary energetic consideration stabilization of the carbocation via solvation is also an important consideration alkyl halide structure and carbocation stability the first order kinetics of sn reactions suggest a twostep mechanism in which the ratedetermining step consists of carbocation formation from the ionization of the alkyl halide as shown in the diagram below in this mechanism the carbocation is a highenergy intermediate the bonds immediately to nearby nucleophiles the only reactant that is undergoing change in the first ratedetermining step is the alkyl halide so we expect such reactions would
