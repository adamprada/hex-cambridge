subsequent section of this chapter benzyl carbocation the relative stability of carbocations is summarized below carbocation stability ch chch chch chchch chch chc consequently we expect that ºalkyl halides will be more reactive than their º and ºcounterparts in reactions that follow an sn mechanism this is opposite to the reactivity order observed for the sn mechanism allylic and benzylic halides are exceptionally reactive by either mechanism this trend is summarized in the diagram below effects of leaving group an sn reaction speeds up with a good leaving group this is because the leaving group is involved in the ratedetermining
