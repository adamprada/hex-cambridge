leaving groups as you go from left to right on the periodic table electron donating ability decreases and thus ability to be a good leaving group increases halides are an example of a good leaving group whos leavinggroup ability increases as you go down the column the two reactions below is the same reaction done with two different leaving groups one is significantly faster than the other this is because the better leaving group leaves faster and thus the reaction can proceed faster figure below methyl sulfate ion mesylate ion triflate ion tosylate ion chso chso cfso chchso solvent effects
