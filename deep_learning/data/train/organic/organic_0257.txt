as water ε formic acid ε dimethyl sulfoxide ε acetonitrile ε are generally considered better ionizing solvents than are some common organic solvents such as ethanol ε acetone ε methylene chloride ε ether ε below is the same reaction conducted in two different solvents the relative reaction rate in water ε is times faster than in methanol ε solvation refers to the solvents ability to stabilize ions by encasing them in a sheath of weakly bonded solvent molecules anions are solvated by partial positive charges of hydrogenbonding solvents cations are often best solvated by the nucleophilic sites on a solvent
