the ratedetermining step so this concern is not relevant in fact polar protic solvents actually speed up the rate of sn reactions because the polar solvent helps stabilize the transition state and carbocation intermediate since the carbocation is unstable anything that can stabilize this even a little will speed up the reaction polar aprotic solvents have a dipole moment but their hydrogen is not highly polarized polar aprotic solvents are not used in sn reactions because some of them can react with the carbocation intermediate and give an unwanted sideproduct rather polar protic solvents are preferred for unimolecular substitution reactions
