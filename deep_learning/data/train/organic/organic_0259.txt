with a mixture of water and formic acid where the water and formic acid are competing nucleophiles two different products are formed chcoh and chcocoh the relative yields of these products depends on the concentrations and relative reactivities of the nucleophiles with a higher electron density water is considered the stronger nucleophile and the tertiary alcohol will be the major product if there are equal concentrations of competing nucleophiles exercises rank the following by increasing reactivity in an sn reaction bromopentene and bromopentene undergo sn reaction at almost the same rate but one is a secondary halide while the other
