literally means not enough affinity l parum not enough affins affinity arise because their chemical affinity for most common reagents may be regarded as saturated or satisfied thus none of the or bonds in a typical saturated hydrocarbon for example ethane are attacked at ordinary temperatures by a strong acid such as sulfuric acid or by an oxidizing agent such as bromine in the dark oxygen or potassium permanganate under ordinary conditions ethane is similarly stable to reducing agents such as hydrogen even in the presence of catalysts such as platinum palladium or nickel however all saturated hydrocarbons are attacked
