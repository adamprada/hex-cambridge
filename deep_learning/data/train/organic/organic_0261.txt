up to contains normal and branched alkanes from to natural gas is mainly methane and ethane bottled gas liquefied petroleum gas is mainly propane and butane gasoline boiling point from to contains mostly hydrocarbons from to over compounds have been identified in gasoline and these include continuouschain and branched alkanes cycloalkanes and alkylbenzenes arenes the branched alkanes make better gasoline than their continuouschain isomers because they give less knock in highcompression gasoline engines kerosine boiling point to contains hydrocarbons from to much of this fraction is utilized as jet engine fuels or is cracked to simpler alkanes and alkenes light
