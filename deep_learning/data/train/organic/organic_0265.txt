of spatial arrangement in order to understand stereoisomerism and chirality spatial arrangement of atoms concern how different atomic particles and molecules are situated about in the space around the organic compound namely its carbon chain in this sense spatial arrangement of an organic molecule are different another if an atom is shifted in any threedimensional direction by even one degree this opens up a very broad possibility of different molecules each with their unique placement of atoms in threedimensional space stereoisomers stereoisomers are as mentioned above contain different types of isomers within itself each with distinct characteristics that further separate
