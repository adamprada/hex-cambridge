middle demotes the mirror plane figure comparison of chiral and achiral molecules a bromochlorofluoromethane is a chiral molecule whose stereocenter is designated with an asterisk rotation of its mirror image does not generate the original structure to superimpose the mirror images bonds must be broken and reformed b in contrast dichlorofluoromethane and its mirror image can be rotated so they are superimposable note that even if one were to flip over the left molecule over to the right the atomic spatial arrangement will not be equal this is equivalent to the left hand right hand relationship and is aptly referred
