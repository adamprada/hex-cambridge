armodafinil and are a good example of a stereogenic sulfur center stereogenic nitrogen singlebonded nitrogen is pyramidal in shape with the nonbonding electron pair pointing to the unoccupied corner of a tetrahedral region since the nitrogen in these compounds is bonded to three different groups its configuration is chiral the nonidentical mirrorimage configurations are illustrated in the following diagram the remainder of the molecule is represented by r and the electron pair is colored yellow if these configurations were stable there would be four additional stereoisomers of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine however pyramidal nitrogen is normally not configurationally stable it rapidly
