phosphorus center of phosphate ion and organic phosphate esters for example is tetrahedral and thus is potentially a stereocenter we will see in chapter how researchers in order to investigate the stereochemistry of reactions at the phosphate center incorporated sulfur andor o and o isotopes of oxygen the normal isotope is o to create chiral phosphate groups phosphate triesters are chiral if the three substituent groups are different contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university william reusch professor emeritus michigan state u virtual textbook of organic chemistry prof steven farmer sonoma state university organic chemistry
