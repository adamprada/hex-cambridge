occurs naturally in both enantiomeric forms carvone is a secondary metabolite that means it is a naturallyoccurring compound that is not directly connected to the very basic functions of a cell such as selfreplication or the production of energy the role of secondary metabolites in nature is often difficult to determine however these compounds often play roles in selfdefense acting as deterrents against competitor species in a sort of smallscale chemical warfare scenario they are also frequently used in communications this role has been studied most extensively among insects which use lots of compounds to send information to each other
