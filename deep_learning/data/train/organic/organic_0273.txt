connected to a c and two hs just like the first one the third c is part of a little threecarbon group attached to the sixmembered ring at the second bond from the chiral center it is connected to only one h and has two bonds to another c this is counted as two bonds to c and one to h those first two carbon groups are identical so far however the third group is different it has an extra bond to c whereas the others have an extra bond to h c has a higher atomic number than h
