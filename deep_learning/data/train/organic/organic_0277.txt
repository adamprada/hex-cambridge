be a onestage partitioning between gas and liquid phases and clearly could be made much more efficient by contacting the gas layer repeatedly with fresh water carried through many separate operations this partitioning procedure is at best a tedious process especially if the compounds to be separated are similar in their distributions between the phases however partitioning can be achieved nearly automatically by using chromatographic columns which permit a stationary phase to be contacted by a moving phase to illustrate suppose a sample of a gaseous mixture of ammonia and methane is injected into a long tube column filled with
