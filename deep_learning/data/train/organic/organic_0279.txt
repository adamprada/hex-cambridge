repetitive partitions possible in a long column detection often is achieved simply by measuring changes in thermal conductivity of the effluent gases a schematic diagram of the apparatus and a typical separation pattern are shown in figures and the method is extraordinarily useful for detection of minute amounts of impurities provided these are separated from the main peak glc also can be used effectively to purify materials as well as to detect impurities to do this the sample size and the size of the apparatus may be increased or an automatic system may be used wherein the products from many
