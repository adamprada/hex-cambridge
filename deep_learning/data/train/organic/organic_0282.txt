than would be practical for gravityflow tswett columns automatic monitoring of the column effluent by ultraviolet spectroscopy section or by changes in the refractive index usually provides an effective means of determining how the separation is proceeding with such techniques chromatograms similar to figure are obtained highpressure liquid chromatography hplc has great advantages for analysis and separation of highmolecularweight heatsensitive compounds that are unsuitable for glc an ingenious variation of solidliquid chromatography is to use a solid support to which material is attached that has a specific affinity for a particular substance to be separated the technique is especially useful
