that you can define and use in context the key term below cistrans stereoisomers study notes your previous studies in chemistry may have prepared you to discuss the nature of a carboncarbon double bond if not you should review section of this course before beginning the present section it is particularly important that you make molecular models of some simple alkenes to gain insight into the geometry of these compounds geometric isomerism also known as cistrans isomerism or ez isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of
