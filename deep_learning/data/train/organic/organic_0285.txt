on think about what happens in molecules where there is unrestricted rotation about carbon bonds in other words where the carboncarbon bonds are all single the next diagram shows two possible configurations of dichloroethane these two models represent exactly the same molecule you can get from one to the other just by twisting around the carboncarbon single bond these molecules are not isomers if you draw a structural formula instead of using models you have to bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bonds you must accept that these two structures represent the same molecule but
