diagrams above how to recognize the possibility of geometric isomerism you obviously need to have restricted rotation somewhere in the molecule compounds containing a carboncarbon double bond have this restricted rotation other sorts of compounds may have restricted rotation as well but we are concentrating on the case you are most likely to meet when you first come across geometric isomers if you have a carboncarbon double bond you need to think carefully about the possibility of geometric isomers what needs to be attached to the carboncarbon double bond think about this case although weve swapped the righthand groups around
