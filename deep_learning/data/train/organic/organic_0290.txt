the cis and trans isomers cis and trans isomers are unique compounds with their own unique melting points boiling points densities etc further explanation in general if any two sp carbons in a ring have two different substituent groups not counting other ring atoms stereoisomerism is possible this is similar to the substitution pattern that gives rise to stereoisomers in alkenes indeed one might view a double bond as a twomembered ring four other examples of this kind of stereoisomerism in cyclic compounds are shown below if more than two ring carbons have different substituents not counting other ring atoms
