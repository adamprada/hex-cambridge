class of molecules that exhibit stereoisomerism dibromocyclopentane can exist as two different stereoisomers cisdibromocyclopentane and transdibromocyclopentane the cisdibromocyclopentane and transdibromocyclopentane stereoisomers of dibromocyclopentane are shown below both molecules have the same molecular formula and the same atom connectivity they differ only in the relative spatial orientation of the two bromines on the ring in cisdibromocyclopentane both bromine atoms are on the same face of the cyclopentane ring while in transdibromocyclopentane the two bromines are on opposite faces of the ring stereoisomers require an additional nomenclature prefix be added to the iupac name in order to indicate their spatial orientation disubstituted
