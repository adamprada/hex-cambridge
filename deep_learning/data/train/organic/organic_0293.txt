different substituent groups not counting other ring atoms cistrans stereoisomerism is possible however the cistrans designations are not used if both groups are on the same carbon for example the chlorine and the methyl group are on the same carbon in chloromethylcyclohexane and the trans prefix should not be used if more than two ring carbons have substituents the stereochemical notation distinguishing the various isomers becomes more complex and the prefixes cis and trans cannot be used to formally name the molecule however the relationship of any two substituents can be informally described using cis or trans for example in
