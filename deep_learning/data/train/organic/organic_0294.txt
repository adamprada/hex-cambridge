can be determined by looking at the type of bonds attached to the substituents if the substituents are both on the same side of the ring cis they would both have either dash bonds or wedge bonds if the the substituents are on opposite side of the ring trans one substituent would have a dash bond and the other a wedge bond because both bromo substituents have a wedge bond they are one the same side of the ring and are cis the name of this molecule is cisdibromocyclohexane b example b shows the cycloalkane ring roughly perpendicular to the
