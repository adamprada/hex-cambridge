features in organic compounds that commonly are known as functional groups in fact a traditional approach to the subject of organic chemistry involves the classification of compounds according to their functional groups thus the structural features and are the functional groups of alkenes alkynes carbonyl compounds alcohols amines and nitriles respectively it will be helpful to look at the structural features of some of the major types of organic compounds even though the details of their chemistry will not be discussed until later chapters examples of the structures arranged in accord with their functional groups are given in table the
