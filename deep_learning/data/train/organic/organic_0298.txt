properties alcohols are structurally related to water in that both possess a hydroxyl function we may then expect the chemistry of alcohols to be similar to that of water in fact both are weak acids because the group has a reactive proton that it can donate to a sufficiently strongly basic substance written as here water and alcohols both are weak bases because the oxygens of their groups have unshared electron pairs to use in bonding with a proton donated by an acid we can carry the analogy further to include carboxylic acids which also have a hydroxyl function they
