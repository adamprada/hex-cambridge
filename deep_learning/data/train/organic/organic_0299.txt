and one of these depends more on types of reactions than on functional groups b classifications by reaction types the rationale of classification by reaction types is that different functional groups may show the same kinds of reactions thus as we have just seen alcohols carboxylic acids and amines all can accept a proton from a suitably strong acid fortunately there are very few different types of organic reactions at least as far as the overall result that they produce the most important are acidbase substitution addition elimination and rearrangement reactions some examples of these are given below and you
