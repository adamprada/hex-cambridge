with oxygen or hydrogen respectively they frequently fall into one of the categories already mentioned reduction of ethene to ethane is clearly addition as is oxidation of ethene to oxacyclopropane reactions that lead to substantial degradation of molecules into smaller fragments are more difficult to classify an example is the combustion of ethane to carbon dioxide and water all of the chemical bonds in the reactants are broken in this reaction it seems pointless to try to classify this as anything but a complete combustion or oxidation reaction contributors and attributions john d robert and marjorie c caserio basic principles
