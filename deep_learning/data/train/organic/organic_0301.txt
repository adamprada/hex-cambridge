breaking of compound by an electrophile such that becomes bonded to by the electron pair of the bond thus reagents that donate an electron pair in chemical reactions are said to be nucleophilic nucleus loving thus the bond also can be considered to be broken by the nucleophile which donates its electron pair to while leaves as with the electrons of the bond thus by definition electrophiles are electronpair acceptors and nucleophiles are electronpair donors these definitions correspond closely to definitions used in the generalized theory of acids and bases proposed by g n lewis according to lewis an acid
