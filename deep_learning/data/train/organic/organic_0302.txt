as a base because one of the electron pairs on oxygen can abstract a proton from a reagent such as hydrogen fluoride alternatively the hydronium ion is an acid because it can accept electrons from another reagent eg fluoride ion by donating a proton a proton donor can be classified as an electrophile and a proton acceptor as a nucleophile for example hydrogen chloride can transfer a proton to ethene to form the ethyl cation therefore hydrogen chloride functions as the electrophile or acid and ethene functions as the nucleophile or base what then is the difference between an acid
