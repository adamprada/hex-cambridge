strength of reagents as electrophiles or nucleophiles we usually are not referring to chemical equilibria but to reaction rates a good nucleophile is a reagent that reacts rapidly with a particular electrophile in contrast a poor nucleophile reacts only slowly with the same electrophile consequently it should not then be taken for granted that there is a parallel between the acidity or basicity of a reagent and its reactivity as an electrophile or nucleophile for instance it is incorrect to assume that the strengths of a series of bases in aqueous solution will necessarily parallel their nucleophilicities toward a carbon
