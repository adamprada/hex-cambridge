bases examples are and and good electrophiles are not always strong acids by either the bronstedlowry or lewis definitions examples are in what follows we will be concerned with the rates of ionic reactions under nonequilibrium conditions we shall use the term nucleophilic repeatedly and we want you to understand that a nucleophile is any neutral or charged reagent that supplies a pair of electrons either bonding or nonbonding to form a new covalent bond in substitution reactions the nucleophile usually is an anion or a neutral molecule or the operation of each of these is illustrated in the following
