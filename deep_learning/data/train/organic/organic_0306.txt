kilocalories liberated on complete combustion of one mole of hydrocarbon when the reactants and the products are in standard states and at the same temperature usually not all chemical reactions that occur spontaneously liberate heat some actually absorb heat by convention is given a negative sign when heat is evolved exothermic reaction and a positive sign when heat is absorbed endothermic reaction the heat evolved or absorbed also is called the enthalpy change for the combustion of of methane at we find by experiment corrected from constant volume to constant pressure if necessary that the reaction is exothermic by this
