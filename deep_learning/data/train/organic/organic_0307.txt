the aid of bond energies the necessary bond energies are given in table and it is important to notice that they apply only to complete dissociation of gaseous substances to gaseous atoms at also they do not apply without suitable corrections to many compounds such as benzene that have more than one double bond this limitation will be discussed in chapters and to calculate for the combustion of one mole of methane first we break bonds as follows using for the energy of each of the bonds and then for the energy of the double bond in oxygen then we
