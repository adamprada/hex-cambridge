solutions and ionic substances are involved are considered in chapters and it is important to recognize that the bond energies listed in table for all molecules other than diatomic molecules are average values that the bond energy is stated to be does not mean that if the hydrogens of methane were detached one by one would have to be put in at each step actually the experimental evidence is in accord with quite different energies for the separate dissociation steps the moral is that we should try to avoid using the bond energies in table as a measure of for
