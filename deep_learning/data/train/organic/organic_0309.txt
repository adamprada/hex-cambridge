of combustion of some hydrocarbons are given in table negative discrepancies represent heats of combustion smaller than expected from the average bond energies and positive values correspond to larger than expected heats of combustion comparing isomers in table we see that methylpropane and tetramethylbutane give off less heat when burned than do butane and octane and this is a rather general characteristic result of chain branching cyclopropane has a of combustion of greater than expected from bond energies and this clearly is associated with the abnormal bond angles in the ring these matters will be discussed in detail in chapter
