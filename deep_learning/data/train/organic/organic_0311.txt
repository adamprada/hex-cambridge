rules for the simplifies structures rely on the neutral bonding patterns for carbon orygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur primarily since organic compounds have a hydrocarbon backbone the atoms that are not carbon and hydrogen are called heteroatoms deoxycytidine contains seven heteroatoms four oxygen atoms land three nitrogen atoms heteroatoms are a primary source of chemical reactivity for organic chemistry heteroatoms atoms in an organic compound that are not carbon or hydrogen typically oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur the ability to quickly and efficiently draw large structures and determine formal charges is not terribly hard to come by all it takes
