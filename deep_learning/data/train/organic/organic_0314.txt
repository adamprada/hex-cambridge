the octet rule if it has two bonds and two lone pairs as in water it will have a formal charge of zero if it has one bond and three lone pairs as in hydroxide ion it will have a formal charge of if it has three bonds and one lone pair as in hydronium ion it will have a formal charge of when we get to our discussion of free radical chemistry in chapter we will see other possibilities such as where an oxygen atom has one bond one lone pair and one unpaired free radical electron giving it
