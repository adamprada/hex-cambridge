phosphorus although both of these elements have other bonding patterns that are relevant in laboratory chemistry in a biological context sulfur almost always follows the same bondingformal charge pattern as oxygen while phosphorus is present in the form of phosphate ion po where it has five bonds almost always to oxygen no lone pairs and a formal charge of zero remember that atoms of elements in the third row and below in the periodic table have expanded valence shells with d orbitals available for bonding and the the octet rule does not apply finally the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and
