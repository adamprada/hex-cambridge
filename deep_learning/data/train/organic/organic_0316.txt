you have gotten the hang of drawing lewis structures it is not always necessary to draw lone pairs on heteroatoms as you can assume that the proper number of electrons are present around each atom to match the indicated formal charge or lack thereof occasionally though lone pairs are drawn if doing so helps to make an explanation more clear exercise draw one structure that corresponds to each of the following molecular formulas using the common bonding patters covered above be sure to include all lone pairs and formal charges where applicable and assume that all atoms have a full
