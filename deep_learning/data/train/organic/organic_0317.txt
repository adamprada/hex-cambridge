amounts of halogen some examples are shown below the ocean is the largest known source for atmospheric methyl bromide and methyl iodide furthermore the ocean is also estimated to supply of atmospheric methyl chloride with other significant contributions coming from biomass burning salt marshes and woodrotting fungi many subsequent chemical and biological processes produce polyhalogenated methanes synthetic organic halogen compounds are readily available by direct halogenation of hydrocarbons and by addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes many of these have proven useful as intermediates in traditional synthetic processes some halogen compounds shown in the box have been used as pesticides
