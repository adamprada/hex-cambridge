eg cclf and other chlorofluorocarbons used as refrigeration gases and fire extinguishing agents alkyl halides provide nice examples for learning about two very important organic reaction mechanism types nucleophilic substitution and betaelimination in learning about these mechanisms in the context of alkyl halide reactivity we will also learn some very fundamental ideas about three main players in many organic reactions nucleophiles electrophiles and leaving groups well start with an overview of the substitution and elimination reactions which alkyl halides undergo contributors learning objective predict the products and specify the reagents for sn sn e and e reactions with stereochemistry propose
