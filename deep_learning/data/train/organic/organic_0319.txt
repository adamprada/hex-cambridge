to occur the relevant carbocation intermediate must be relatively stable strong nucleophile favor substitution and strong bases especially strong hindered bases such as tertbutoxide favor elimination the nature of the halogen substituent on the alkyl halide is usually not very significant if it is cl br or i in cases where both sn and e reactions compete chlorides generally give more elimination than do iodides since the greater electronegativity of chlorine increases the acidity of betahydrogens indeed although alkyl fluorides are relatively unreactive when reactions with basic nucleophiles are forced elimination occurs note the high electronegativity of fluorine the following
