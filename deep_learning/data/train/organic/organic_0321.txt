may be formed allyl hcchch rapid sn substitution for º and ºhalides for ºhalides a very slow sn substitution or if the nucleophile is moderately basic e elimination in high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile sn and e products may be observed rapid sn substitution for º halides e elimination will compete with substitution in ºhalides and dominate in the case of ºhalides in high dielectric ionizing solvents sn and e products may be formed nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles will give sn substitution in the case of º and ºhalides ºhalides will probably give e elimination
