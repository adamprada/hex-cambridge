example in equation for consistency alkyl bromides have been used in these examples similar reactions occur when alkyl chlorides or iodides are used but the speed of the reactions and the exact distribution of products will change in order to understand why some combinations of alkyl halides and nucleophiles give a substitution reaction whereas other combinations give elimination and still others give no observable reaction we must investigate systematically the way in which changes in reaction variables perturb the course of the reaction the following general equation summarizes the factors that will be important in such an investigation friendly reminder
