by surrounded groups and any carbocation intermediate would be highenergy and thus unlikely when the leaving group is attached to a tertiary allylic or benzylic carbon a carbocation intermediate will be relatively stable and thus an sn mechanism is favored these patterns of reactivity of summarized below alkyl halide structure possible substitution reactions methyl and primary sn only secondary sn and sn tertiary sn only primary and secondary benzylic and allylic sn and sn tertiary benzylic and allylic sn only vinyl and aryl no reaction the nucleophile powerful nucleophiles especially those with negative charges favor the sn mechanism weaker nucleophiles
