step bimolecular transition state carbocation formation rate law rate krxnu rate krx stereochemisty inversion of configuration mixed configuration solvent polar aprotic polar protic for example the reaction below has a tertiary alkyl bromide as the electrophile a weak nucleophile and a polar protic solvent well assume that methanol is the solvent thus wed confidently predict an sn reaction mechanism because substitution occurs at a chiral carbon we can also predict that the reaction will proceed with racemization in the reaction below on the other hand the electrophile is a secondary alkyl bromide with these both sn and sn mechanisms are
