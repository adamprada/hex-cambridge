alkyl halides favor this mechanism when reacted with a strong nucleophile and weak base in a polar aprotic solvent a geometric isomerismb chiralityc optical activityd properties of enantiomerscontributors and attributions a geometric isomerism we have defined isomers in a very general way as nonidentical molecules that possess the same number and kind of atoms however there are several ways in which isomers can be nonidentical among the alkenes and butene are position isomers because in these compounds the double bond has a different position in the carbon chain most but not all alkenes have stereoisomers that are not identical because
