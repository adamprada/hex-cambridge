the parts of the molecule are not free to rotate with respect to each other about this bond therefore the isomers do not interconvert without breaking the double bond and they exist as different compounds each with its own chemical and physical properties ballandstick models of cis and transbutene are shown in figure and the rigidity of the double bond is simulated in the model by a pair of stiff springs or bent sticks connecting the two carbons of the double bond it should be clear to you that there will be no cistrans isomers of alkenes in which one
