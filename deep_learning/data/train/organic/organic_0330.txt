of dimethylcyclopropane respect to the ring in the cis isomer the methyl groups both are situated above or below the plane of the ring and in the trans isomer they are situated one above and one below as shown in figure interconversion of these isomers does not occur without breaking one or more chemical bonds stereoisomers that do not interconvert rapidly under normal conditions and therefore are stable enough to be separated specifically are called configurational isomers thus cis and transbutene are configurational isomers as are cis and transdimethylcyclopropane the terms cistrans isomerism or geometric isomerism commonly are used to
