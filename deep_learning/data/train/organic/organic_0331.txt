the longest continuous chain is trans as it passes through the double bond notice that cistrans isomerism is not possible at a carboncarbon triple bond as for butyne because the bonding arrangement at the triply bonded carbons is linear many compounds have more than one double bond and each may have the potential for the cis or trans arrangement for example hexadiene has three different configurations which are designated as transtrans ciscis and transcis because the two ends of this molecule are identically substituted the transcis becomes identical with cistrans b chirality the most important type of stereoisomerism is that
