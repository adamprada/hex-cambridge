stereoisomerism is chlorobutane which can exist in two spatial configurations and that correspond to reflections of each other these isomers are specifically called enantiomers to be convinced that there really are two nonidentical forms of this molecule you should construct molecular models of both configurations and try to superimpose them as in figure if you put and together and and together you find that and are on opposite sides and and are on opposite sides no matter how you turn the models around they cannot be superimposed unless you break bonds at the number carbon and interchange the positions of
