images the pressing question at this point is how can we tell whether a substances will be chiral or achiral the most common origin of chirality in molecules and the one originally recognized by vant hoff and le bel is the presence of one or more atoms usually carbon atoms each of which forms coplanar bonds to four different atoms or groups this is the case for chlorobutane because the second tetrahedral carbon along the chain is bonded to four different groups hydrogen chlorine methyl and ethyl therefore there is a pair of enantiomers and another example is bromochlorotrifluoroethane which
