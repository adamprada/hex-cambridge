four different attached groups there may be more than one chiral carbon and you should be alert to the fact that structural differences in the attached groups do not necessarily show up at the first or even the second position along a chain as an example consider the chirality of trimethylcyclohexane carbons and are clearly achiral because each is connected to two identical groups which for these atoms are hydrogens the same is true for because it is connected to two groups you might conclude that also is an achiral position because it is connected to two groups but this
