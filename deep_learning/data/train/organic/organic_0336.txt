expected that when he crystallized this acid or its salts he would obtain crystals that would be identical with their mirror images however crystallization of the sodium ammonium salt of racemic acid from water at temperatures below gave crystals of two different shapes and these shapes were mirror images of one another pasteur carefully picked apart the two kinds of crystals and showed that one of them was identical with the corresponding salt of tartaric acid except that it rotated the plane of polarization of polarized light in the opposite direction this separation of racemic acid into two optically active
