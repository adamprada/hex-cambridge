symbolized by either d or the enantiomer that rotates the plane to the left is levorotatory symbolized by l or a racemic mixture then can be designated as dl or and will have no net optical rotation it is very important to know that d l or do not designate configurations thus although butanol actually has configuration and butanol has configuration there is no simple way to predict that a particular sign of rotation will be associated with a particular configuration methods used in assigning the true configurations to enantiomers will be discussed later figure schematic representation of the rotation
