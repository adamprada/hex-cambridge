must be determined using achiral reagents in a solvent made up of achiral molecules or in short in an achiral environment thus the melting and boiling points but not the optical rotations of and will be identical in an achiral environment how a chiral environment or chiral reagents influence the properties of substances such as and will be considered in chapter in the older literature chiral centers often are called asymmetric centers and you may be confused by the difference between asymmetric and dissymmetric both asymmetric and dissymmetric molecules or objects are chiral an asymmetric object has no symmetry at
