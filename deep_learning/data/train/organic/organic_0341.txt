or conformations are shown in figure in endon views of the models the eclipsed conformation is seen to have the hydrogens on the forward carbon directly in front of those on the back carbon the staggered conformation has each of the hydrogens on the forward carbon set between each of the hydrogens on the back carbon it has not been possible to obtain separate samples of ethane that correspond to these or intermediate orientations because actual ethane molecules appear to have essentially free rotation about the single bond joining the carbons free or at least rapid rotation is possible around
