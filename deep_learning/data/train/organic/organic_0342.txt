eclipsed conformations figure potentialenergy curve for rotation about the bond in ethane the energy difference between eclipsed and staggered ethane is approximately this is shown in figure as the height of the peaks eclipsed forms separating the valleys staggered forms on a curve showing the potential energy of ethane as the methyl groups rotate with respect to each other through rotation then is not strictly free because there is a energy barrier to overcome on eclipsing the hydrogens even so the barrier is low enough that rotation is very rapid at room temperature occurring on the order of times per
