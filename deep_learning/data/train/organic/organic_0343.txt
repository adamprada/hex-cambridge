gauche syn or skew conformations and have a torsional angle of between the two methyl groups forms and actually are nonidentical mirror images but bond rotation is so rapid that the separate enantiomeric conformations cannot be isolated the populations of the two gauche forms are equal at room temperature of each so any optical rotation caused by one form is exactly canceled by an opposite rotation caused by the other figure conformational energies and rotational barriers in butane the difference in energy between the anti and gauche forms is the energies are relative to conformation as zero the populations of
