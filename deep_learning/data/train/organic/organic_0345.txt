on the middle bond between c and c below are two representations of butane in a conformation which puts the two ch groups c and c in the eclipsed position with the two cc bonds at a o dihedral angle if we rotate the front blue carbon by clockwise the butane molecule is now in a staggered conformation this is more specifically referred to as the gauche conformation of butane notice that although they are staggered the two methyl groups are not as far apart as they could possibly be a further rotation of gives us a second eclipsed conformation
