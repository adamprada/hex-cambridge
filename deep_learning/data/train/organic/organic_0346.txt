forced too close together clearly steric strain is lower in the anti conformation in the same way steric strain causes the eclipsed a conformation where the two methyl groups are as close together as they can possibly be to be higher in energy than the two eclipsed b conformations the diagram below summarizes the relative energies for the various eclipsed staggered and gauche conformations the following diagram illustrates the change in potential energy that occurs with rotation about the cc bond at smaller rotational increments potential curve vs dihedral angle of the cc bond of butane because the anti conformation
