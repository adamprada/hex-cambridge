strain remains high cyclopentane has very little angle strain the angles of a pentagon are ยบ but its eclipsing strain would be large about kjmol if it remained planar consequently the fivemembered ring adopts nonplanar puckered conformations whenever possible rings larger than cyclopentane would have angle strain if they were planar however this strain together with the eclipsing strain inherent in a planar structure can be relieved by puckering the ring cyclohexane is a good example of a carbocyclic system that virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in
