aliphatic counterparts lets take a look at the basic shapes of some common rings many biologically important compounds are built around structures containing rings so its important that we become familiar with them in nature three to sixmembered rings are frequently encountered so well focus on those cyclopropane a three membered ring has no rotational freedom whatsoever a plane is defined by three points so the three carbon atoms in cyclopropane are all constrained to lie in the same plane this lack of flexibility does not allow cyclopropane to form more stable conformers which are nonplanar the main source of
