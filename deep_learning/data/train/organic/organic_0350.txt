strain is partially overcome by using socalled banana bonds where the overlap between orbitals is no longer directly in a line between the two nuclei as shown here in three representations of the bonding in cyclopropane the constrained nature of cyclopropane causes neighboring ch bonds to all be held in eclipsed conformations cyclopropane is always at maximum torsional strain this strain can be illustrated in a newman projections of cyclopropane as shown from the side newman projection of cyclopropane cyclopropane isnt large enough to introduce any steric strain steric strain does not become a factor until we reach six membered
