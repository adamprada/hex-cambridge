ch ring hydrogens to slightly deviate away from being completely eclipsed this conformation relives some of the torsional strain but increases the angle strain because the ring bond angles decreases to o in a line drawing this butterfly shape is usually shown from the side with the near edges drawn using darker lines the deviation of cyclobutanes ring ch bonds away from being fully eclipsed can clearly be seen when viewing a newman projections signed down one of the cc bond newman projection of cyclobutane with bond angles of o rather than o degrees cyclobutane has significant amounts of angle
