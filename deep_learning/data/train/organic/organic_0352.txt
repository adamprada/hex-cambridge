torsional strain cyclopentane addops a nonplanar conformation even though it slightly increases angle strain the lowest energy conformation of cyclopentane is known as the envelope with four of the ring atoms in the same plane and one out of plane notice that this shape resembles an envelope with the flap open the outofplane carbon is said to be in the endo position endo means inside the envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope however the neighboring carbons are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap d structure of cyclopentane notice that
