viewing a newman projections of cyclopentane signed down one of the cc bond show the staggered ch bonds newman projection of cyclopentane the angle strain in the envelope conformation of cyclopentane is low the ideal angle in a regular pentagon is about o very close to the preferred o tetrahedral bond angle there is some torsional strain in cyclopentane the envelope conformation reduces torsional strain by placing some bonds in nearly staggered positions however other bonds are still almost fully eclipsed cyclopentane is not large enough to allow for steric strain to be created overall cyclopentane has very little ring
