is one thymidine t deoxynucleotide from a stretch of dna since the ribose has lost one of the oh groups at carbon of the ribose ring this is part of a deoxyribonucleic acid dna if the oh at carbon of the ribose ring was present this would be part of a ribonucleic acid rna the lowestenergy conformations for ribose are envelope forms in which either c or c are endo on the same side as the c substituent exercises if cyclobutane were to be planar how many hh eclipsing interactions would there be assuming kjmol per hh eclipsing interaction what
