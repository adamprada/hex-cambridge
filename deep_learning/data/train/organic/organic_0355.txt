the ring carbon attached to the methyl group would most likely be the endo carbon the large methyl group would create the most torsional strain if eclipsed being in the endo position would place the bonds is a more staggered position which would reduce strain questions q if cyclobutane were to be planar how many hh eclipsing interactions would there be and assuming kjmol per hh eclipsing interaction what is the strain on this planar molecule q in the two conformations of transcyclopentane one is more stable than the other explain why this is solutions s there are eclipsing interactions
