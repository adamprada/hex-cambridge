part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring cyclohexane has the possibility of forming multiple conformations each of which have structural differences which lead to different amounts of ring strain conformations of cyclohexane a planar structure for cyclohexane is clearly improbable the bond angles would necessarily be ยบ ยบ larger than the ideal tetrahedral angle also every carbonhydrogen bond in such a structure would be eclipsed the resulting angle and eclipsing strains would severely destabilize this structure the ring strain of planar cyclohexane is in excess of kjmol so it rarely discussed other
