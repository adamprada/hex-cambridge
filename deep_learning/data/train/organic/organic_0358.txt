the optimal tetrahedral o so angle strain has been eliminated also the ch ring bonds are staggered so torsional strain has also been eliminated this is clearly seen when looking at a newman projection of chair cyclohexane sighted down the two central cc bonds newman projection of cyclohexane interactive element the d structure of chair cyclohexane how to draw the chair conformation boat conformation of cyclohexane the boat conformation of cyclohexane is created when two carbon atoms on opposite sides of the sixmembered ring are both lifted up out of the plane of the ring creating a shape which slightly
