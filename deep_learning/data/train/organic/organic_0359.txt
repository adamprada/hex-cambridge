flagpole hydrogens are shown in red twistboat conformation of cyclohexane the boat form is quite flexible and by twisting it at the bottom created the twistboat conformer this conformation reduces the strain which characterized the boat conformer the flagpole hydrogens move farther apart the carbons they are attached to are shifted in opposite directions one forward and one back and the eight hydrogens along the sides become largely but not completely staggered though more stable than the boat conformation the twistboat sometimes skewboat conformation is roughly kjmol less stable than the chair conformation a twistboat structure of cyclohexane half chair
