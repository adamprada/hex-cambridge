some of the rings bond angles to reach o and for some of ch bonds to not be fully eclipsed overall the half chair conformation is roughly kjmol less stable than the chair conformation conformation changes in cyclohexane ring flips cyclohexane is rapidly rotating between the two most stable conformations known as the chair conformations in what is called the ring flip shown below the importance of the ring flip will be discussed in the next section ring flip describes the rapid equilibrium of cyclohexane rings between the two chair conformations it is important to note that one chair does
