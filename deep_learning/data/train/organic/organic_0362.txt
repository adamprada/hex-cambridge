is equatorial the most stable conformation will be the one with the bulkiest substituent in the equatorial position steric bulk decreases in the order tertbutyl isopropyl ethyl methyl hydroxyl halogens monosubstituted cyclohexanes in the previous section it was stated that the chair conformation in which the methyl group is equatorial is more stable because it minimizes steric repulsion and thus the equilibrium favors the more stable conformer this is true for all monosubstituted cyclohexanes the chair conformation which places the substituent in the equatorial position will be the most stable and be favored in the ring flip equilibrium disubstituted cyclohexanes
