cyclohexanes the more stable chair conformation can often be determined empirically or by using the energy values of steric interactions previously discussed in this chapter note in some cases there is no discernable energy difference between the two chair conformations which means they are equally stable dimethylcyclohexane does not have cis or trans isomers because both methyl groups are on the same ring carbon both chair conformers have one methyl group in an axial position and one methyl group in an equatorial position giving both the same relative stability the steric strain created by the diaxial interactions of a methyl
