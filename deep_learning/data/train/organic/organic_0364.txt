calculated from the values in table and is approximately kjmol the conformer with the tertbutyl group axial is approximately kjmol kjmol kjmol less stable then the conformer with the tertbutyl group equatorial solving for the equilibrium constant k shows that the equatorial is preferred about over axial this means that tertbutylmethylcyclohexane will spend the majority of its time in the more stable conformation with the tertbutyl group in the equatorial position cis and trans stereoisomers of dimethylcyclohexane in cisdimethylcyclohexane both chair conformations have one methyl group equatorial and one methyl group axial as previously discussed the axial methyl group creates
