diaxial interactions which creates x kjmol kjmol of steric strain this conformer is kjmol kjmol kjmol less stable than the other conformer the equilibrium will therefore favor the conformer with both methyl groups in the equatorial position cis and trans stereoisomers of dimethylcyclohexane a similar conformational analysis can be made for the cis and trans stereoisomers of dimethylcyclohexane for cisdimethylcyclohexane one chair conformation has both methyl groups in axial positions creating diaxial interactions the other conformer has both methyl groups in equatorial positions thus creating no diaxial interaction because the methyl groups are not on adjacent carbons in the cyclohexane
