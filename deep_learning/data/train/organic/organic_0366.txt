axial positions creating diaxial interactions the other conformer places both substituents in equatorial positions creating no diaxial interactions this diequatorial conformer is the more stable regardless of the substituents aeea each chair conformation places one substituent in the axial position and one substituent in the equatorial position if the substituents are the same there will be equal diaxial interactions in both conformers making them equal in stability however if the substituents are different then different diaxial interactions will occur the chair conformation which places the larger substituent in the equatorial position will be favored substitution type chair conformation relationship csdisubstituted
