the axial position because the methyl group is larger and has a greater diaxial interaction than the chloro the most stable conformer will place it the equatorial position as shown in the structure on the right using the diaxial energy values given in the previous sections we can calculate that the conformer on the right is kjmol kjmol kjmol more stable than the other example for transchloromethylcyclohexane draw the most stable chair conformation and determine the energy difference between the two chair conformers solution based on the table above transdisubstitued cyclohexanes should have one chair conformation with both substituents axial
