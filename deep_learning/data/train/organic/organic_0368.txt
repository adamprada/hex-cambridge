calculate that the conformer on the right is kjmol kjmol kjmol more stable than the other conformational analysis of complex six membered ring structures cyclohexane can have more than two substituents also there are multiple six membered rings which contain atoms other than carbon all of these systems usually form chair conformations and follow the same steric constraints discussed in this section because the most commonly found rings in nature are six membered conformational analysis can often help in understanding the usual shapes of some biologically important molecules in complex six membered ring structures a direct calculation of diaxial energy
