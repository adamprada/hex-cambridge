all equatorial substituents is the most stable and glucose will most commonly be found in this conformation example the six carbon sugar fructose in aqueous solution is also a sixmembered ring in a chair conformation which of the two possible chair conformations would be expected to be the most stable solution the lower energy chair conformation is the one with three of the five substituents including the bulky choh group in the equatorial position pictured on the right the left structure has axial substituents while the structure on the right only has two axial substituents exercises draw the two chair
