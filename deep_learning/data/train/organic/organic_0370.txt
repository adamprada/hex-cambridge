the relationship of two substituents on a ring from cis to trans you would need to break and reform two covalent bonds ring flips involve only rotation of single bonds exercises questions q for the following molecules draw the most stable chair conformation and explain why you chose this as an answer transdimethylcyclohexane cisdimethylcyclohexane solutions s the most stable conformation would be to have the methyl groups equatorial reducing steric interaction the most stable conformation would be to have the groups equatorial this would reduce the strain if they were axial contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of
