of energy versus bond rotation for ethane and discuss the graph in terms of torsional strain key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below conformation conformer conformational isomer dihedral angle eclipsed conformation newman projection staggered conformation strain energy torsional strain eclipsing strain study notes you should be prepared to sketch various conformers using both sawhorse representations and newman projections each method has its own advantages depending upon the circumstances notice that when drawing the newman projection of the eclipsed conformation of ethane you cannot clearly draw the rear hydrogens exactly behind the
