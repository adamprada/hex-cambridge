molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations in order to better visualize these different conformations it is convenient to use a drawing convention called the newman projection in a newman projection we look lengthwise down a specific bond of interest in this case the carboncarbon bond in ethane we depict the front atom as a dot and the back atom as a larger circle the six carbonhydrogen bonds are shown as solid lines protruding from the two carbons at angles which is what the actual tetrahedral
