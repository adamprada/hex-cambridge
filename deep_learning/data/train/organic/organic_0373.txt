electrons in them is maximized maximizing the distance between the electrons decreases the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons and results in a more stable structure if we now rotate the front ch group clockwise the molecule is in the highest energy eclipsed conformation and the hydrogens on the front carbon are as close as possible to the hydrogens on the back carbon this is the highest energy conformation because of unfavorable electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the front and back ch bonds the energy of the eclipsed conformation is approximately kcalmol kjmol higher than that of the staggered conformation
