in ethane creates a barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another this rotational barrier is not large enough to prevent rotation except at extremely cold temperatures so at normal temperatures the carboncarbon bond is constantly rotating however at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other conformer the potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds as shown in figure figure the potential energy
