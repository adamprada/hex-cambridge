considering conformations about the c c and c c bonds shows a few possible permutations the most stable conformation is anti at both bonds whereas less stable conformations contain gauche interactions one gauchegauche conformer is particularly unfavorable because methyl groups are aligned with parallel bonds in close proximity this conformation is called syn this type of steric hindrance across five atoms is called a synpentane interaction synpentane interactions have an energetic cost of about kcalmol relative to the antianti conformation and are therefore disfavored figure staggered conformations of pentane exercises draw newman projections of the eclipsed and staggered conformations of
