monosubstituted cyclohexanes compared to their axial counterparts using the concept of diaxial interaction compare the gauche interactions in butane with the diaxial interactions in the axial conformer of methylcyclohexane arrange a given list of substituents in increasing or decreasing order of diaxial interactions key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below diaxial interaction study notes diaxial interactions are steric interactions between an axial substituent located on carbon atom of a cyclohexane ring and the hydrogen atoms or other substituents located on carbon atoms and be prepared to draw newmantype projections for cyclohexane
