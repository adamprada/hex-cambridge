δe rtlnk in this equation δe is the energy difference between the two conformations r is the gas constant jmolk t is the temperature in kelvin and k is the equilibrium constant for the ring flip conversion using this equation we can calculate a k value of which means about methylcyclohexane molecules have the methyl group in the equatorial position at o c the energy difference between the two conformations comes from strain called diaxial interactions created when the axial methyl group experiences steric crowding with the two axial hydrogens located on the same side of the cyclohexane ring because
