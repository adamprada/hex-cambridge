created due the steric crowding of two methyl group with a o dihedral angle when looking at the a newman projection of axial methylcyclohexane the methyl group is at a o dihedral angle with the ring carbon in the rear this creates roughly the same amount of steric strain as the gauche conformer of butante given that there is actually two such interactions in axial methylcyclohexane it makes sense that there is kjmol kjmol of steric strain in this conformation the newman projection of equatorial methylcyclohexane shows no such interactions and is therefore more stable newman projections of methyl cyclohexane
