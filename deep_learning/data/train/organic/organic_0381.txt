two conformations is δe e equatorial e axial kjmol kjmol after converting oc to kelvin and kjmol to jmol we can use the equation δe rt lnk to find that δert lnk or x jmol kjmol k k lnk from this we calculate that k because the ring flip reaction is an equilibrium we can say that k equatorial axial if assumption is made that equatorial x then axial must be x plugging these values into the equilibrium expression produces k x x after plugging in the calculated value for k x can be solved algebraically x x x x
