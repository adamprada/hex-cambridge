interactions involved key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below anti conformation gauche conformation eclipsed conformation steric repulsion strain in butane there are three rotating carboncarbon sigma bonds to consider but we will focus on the middle bond between c and c below are two representations of butane in a conformation which puts the two ch groups c and c in the eclipsed position eclipsed interaction energy kcalmol energy kjmol hh hch chch the chch groups create the significantly larger eclipsed interaction of kjmol there are also two hh eclipsed interactions at
