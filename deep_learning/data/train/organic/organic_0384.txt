a staggered conformation this is more specifically referred to as the gauche conformation of butane notice that although they are staggered the two methyl groups are not as far apart as they could possibly be there is still significant steric repulsion between the two bulky groups a further rotation of gives us a second eclipsed conformation b in which both methyl groups are lined up with hydrogen atoms due to steric repulsion between methyl and hydrogen substituents this eclipsed conformation b is higher in energy than the gauche conformation however because there is no methyltomethyl eclipsing it is lower in
