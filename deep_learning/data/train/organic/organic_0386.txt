newman projection change given the molecule but for typical alkanes a full conformational analysis involves a full o rotation in o increments this will produce three staggered conformers and three eclipsed conformers typically the staggered conformers are more stable and the eclipsed conformers are less stable the least stable conformer will have the largest groups eclipsed while the most stable conformer will have the largest groups anti o to each other example draw the newman projection of dimethylbutane along the cc bond then determine the least stable conformation first draw the molecule and locate the indicated bond because the question
