in this example the substituents are also chs and an h move the substituents through two o rotations to create the remaining two eclipsed newman projections leave the substituents on the back carbon in place attempting to rotate the front and back carbons simultaneously is a common mistake and often leads to incorrect newman projections compare the newman projections by looking the eclipsed interactions remember that the order of torsional strain interactions are chch chh hh the third structure has two chch torsional interactions which will make it the least stable conformer of dimethyl butane example draw newman projections of
