is part of two or more rings hydrogens attached to bridge head carbons are often referred to as bridge head hydrogens the two rings can also be connected by a bridge containing one or more carbons to form a bridged bicyclic molecule lastly the two rings can be joined with a singe bridge head carbon to form spiro bicyclic molecules naming fused and bridged compounds fused and bridged bicyclic compounds are follow similar naming conventions count the total number of carbons in both rings this is the parent name eg ten carbons in the system would be decane count the
