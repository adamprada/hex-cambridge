ring systems as expected the connection of two rings has defined effects on the possible conformations however the ideas previously discussed in this chapter can be used for conformational analysis fused rings have the possibility of two isomers where the bridgehead hydrogens are either cis or trans along the shared bond these two isomers have significant differences in flexibility and stability as seen in bicyclodecane more commonly known as decalin if the positioning of the bridgehead hydrogens are shown in a fused ring the prefix cis or trans should be included in the name the transisomer is the easiest to
