both held in a chair conformations in comparison the chairchair forms of cisdecalin are relatively flexible and inversion of both rings at once occurs fairly easily interactive element the d structure of cisdecalin the flexibility of cisdecalin allows for a substituent to interconvert between axial and equatorial conformations in much the same fashion as cyclohexane equatorial substituents tend to create less steric strain and create a more stable conformer a major difference in cisdecalin is the fact that one of cc bonds coming away from the fused edge is held an an axial position this is true in both ringflip
