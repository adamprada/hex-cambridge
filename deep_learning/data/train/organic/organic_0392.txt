carbon bridge in norbornane holds the cyclohexane ring at the bottom in a boat conformation creating torsional strain from eclipsing bonds along the edge also the carbon bridge forms a cyclopentane ring shown in red below making up the right side of the structure with increased angle strain throughout the whole molecule polycyclic systems in nature fused ring systems like decalin are very common in natural products in fact similar ring systems are found in steroids which are an important class of lipids steroids generally have structures that include three sixmembered rings and a fivemembered ring connected by three fused
