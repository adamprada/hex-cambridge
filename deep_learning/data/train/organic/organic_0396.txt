the equivalent alkane each carbon is bonded to four other atoms so such compounds are still considered to be saturated with hydrogen table examples of simple cycloalkanes name cyclopropane cyclobutane cyclopentane cyclohexane cycloheptane cycloalkane molecular formula ch ch ch ch ch cnhn structural formula chn line formula although the customary line drawings of simple cycloalkanes are geometrical polygons the actual shape of these compounds in most cases is very different cyclic systems are a little different from openchain systems in an open chain any bond can be rotated degrees going through many different conformations complete rotation isnt possible in a
