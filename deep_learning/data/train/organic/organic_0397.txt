the baeyer theory and the experimental evidence of ring strain many of the properties of cyclopropane and its derivatives are similar to the properties of alkenes in the famous german organic chemist a baeyer suggested that cyclopropane and cyclobutane derivatives are different from cyclopentane and cyclohexane because their ccc angles cannot have the tetrahedral value of at the same time baeyer hypothesized that the difficulties encountered in synthesizing cycloalkane rings from c upward was the result of the angle strain that would be expected if the large rings were regular planar polygons see table baeyer also believed that cyclohexane had
