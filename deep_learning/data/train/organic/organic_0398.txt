proposed a definitive way to distinguish between the baeyer and sachse cyclohexanes as will be discussed in section the result now known as the sachsemohr theory was complete confirmation of the idea of nonplanar large rings table strain in cycloalkane rings and heats of combustion of cycloalkanes compound n angle strain at each ch heat of combustion δho kcalmol heat of combustion δho per chn kcalmol total strain kcalmol ethene cyclopropane cyclobutane cyclopentane cyclohexane cycloheptane cyclooctane cyclononane cyclodecane cyclopentadecane open chain alkane ring strain in cycloalkanes ring strain occurs because the carbons in cycloalkanes are sp hybridized which means that
