a high ring strain however molecules such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane would have a much lower ring strain because the bond angle between the carbons is much closer to o below are some examples of cycloalkanes ring strain can be seen more prevalently in the cyclopropane and cyclobutane models below is a chart of cycloalkanes and their respective heats of combustion δhcomb the δhcomb value increases as the number of carbons in the cycloalkane increases higher membered ring and the δhcombch ratio decreases the increase in δhcomb can be attributed to the greater amount of london dispersion forces however the
