there is steric repulsion between atoms eclipsing torsional strain exists when a cycloalkane is unable to adopt a staggered conformation around a cc bond and bond angle strain is the energy needed to distort the tetrahedral carbons enough to close the ring the presence of angle strain in a molecule indicates that there are bond angles in that particular molecule that deviate from the ideal bond angles required ie that molecule has conformers cyclopropane a three membered ring has no rotational freedom whatsoever so the three carbon atoms in cyclopropane are all constrained to lie in the same plane at
