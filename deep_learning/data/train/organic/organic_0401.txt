oblique view the dark lines mean that those sides of the ring are closer to you however the ring isnt big enough to introduce any steric strain which does not become a factor until we reach six membered rings until that point rings are not flexible enough for two atoms to reach around and bump into each other the really big problem with cyclopropane is that the ccc bond angles are all too small all the carbon atoms in cyclopropane appear to be tetrahedral these bond angles ought to be degrees the angles in an equilateral triangle are actually degrees
