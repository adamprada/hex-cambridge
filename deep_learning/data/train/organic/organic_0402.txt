possible however in three dimensions cyclobutane is flexible enough to buckle into a butterfly shape relieving torsional strain a little bit when it does that the bond angles get a little worse going from degrees to degrees in a line drawing this butterfly shape is usually shown from the side with the near edges drawn using darker lines with bond angles of rather than degrees cyclobutane has a lot of ring strain but less than in cyclopropane torsional strain is still present but the neighbouring bonds are not exactly eclipsed in the butterfly cyclobutane is still not large enough that
