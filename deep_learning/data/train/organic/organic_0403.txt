a regular pentagon is about degrees very close to a tetrahedral bond angle cyclopentane distorts only very slightly into an envelope shape in which one corner of the pentagon is lifted up above the plane of the other four and as a result ring strain is entirely removed the envelope removes torsional strain along the sides and flap of the envelope however the neighbouring carbons are eclipsed along the bottom of the envelope away from the flap there is still some torsional strain in cyclopentane again there is no steric strain in this system rings larger than cyclopentane would have
