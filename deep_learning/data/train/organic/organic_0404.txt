molecule in the two conformations of ciscyclopentane one is more stable than the other explain why this is answer there are eclipsing interactions two per cc bond the extra strain on this molecule would be kjmol kjmol x the first conformation is more stable even though the methyl groups are cis in the model on the left they are eclipsing due the conformation therefore increasing the strain within the molecule contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state university chris p schaller phd college of saint benedict saint johns university william
