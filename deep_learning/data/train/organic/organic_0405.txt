virtually eliminates eclipsing and angle strain by adopting nonplanar conformations cycloheptane and cyclooctane have greater strain than cyclohexane in large part due to transannular crowding steric hindrance by groups on opposite sides of the ring cyclohexane conformations aka chair flips cyclohexane is rapidly rotating between the two most stable conformations known as the chair conformations in what is called the chair flip shown below several other notable cyclohexane conformations occur during the transition from one chair conformer to the other the boat the twist and the halfchair the relative energies of the conformations is a direct reflection of their relative
