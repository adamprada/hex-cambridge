are aligned parallel to the symmetry axis of the ring in the figure above the equatorial hydrogens are colored blue and the axial hydrogens are in bold since there are two equivalent chair conformations of cyclohexane in rapid equilibrium all twelve hydrogens have equatorial and axial character the figure below illustrates how to convert a molecular model of cyclohexane between two different chair conformations this is something that you should practice with models notice that a ring flip causes equatorial hydrogens to become axial and viceversa how to draw stereo bonds up and down bonds there are various ways to
