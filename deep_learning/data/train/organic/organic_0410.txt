reflecting the common degree bond angle as cautioned before it is usually easier to draw and see what is happening at the four corners of the chair than at the two middle positions try to use the corners as much as possible because axial bonds are parallel to each other substituents larger than hydrogen generally suffer greater steric crowding when they are oriented axial rather than equatorial consequently substituted cyclohexanes will preferentially adopt conformations in which the larger substituents assume equatorial orientation when the methyl group in the structure above occupies an axial position it suffers steric crowding by the
