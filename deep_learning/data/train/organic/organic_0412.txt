within a molecule which makes it easier for one to figure out the molecular structure du degrees of unsaturation number of pi bonds number of rings alkenes rccr and alkynes rccr are called unsaturated hydrocarbons because they have fewer hydrogen atoms than does an alkane with the same number of carbon atoms as is indicated in the following general formulas calculating the degree of unsaturation du if the molecular formula is given plug in the numbers into this formula is the number of carbons is the number of nitrogens is the number of halogens f cl br i is the
