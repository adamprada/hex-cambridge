to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated hence the dob formula divides by the formula subtracts the number of xs because a halogen x replaces a hydrogen in a compound for instance in chloroethane chcl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane ch for example consider compounds having the formula ch the formula of the fivecarbon alkane pentane is ch so the difference in hydrogen content is this difference suggests such compounds may have a
