illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for a given degree of unsaturation each row corresponds to a different combination one degree of unsaturation is equivalent to ring or double bond bond two degrees of unsaturation is equivalent to double bonds ring and double bond rings or triple bond bonds when the du is or greater the presence of benzene rings is very likely du possible combinations of rings bonds of rings of double bonds of triple bonds remember the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor
