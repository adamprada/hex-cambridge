bdes for sp hybridized carbonsreferencesfurther readingexercisesanswerscontributors and attributions objectives after completing this section you should be able to predict the value of δh for a gasphase reaction given the necessary bond dissociation energy data predict the dissociation energy of a particular bond given δh for a reaction involving the bond and any other necessary bond dissociation energy data outline the limitations of using bond dissociation energies to predict whether or not a given reaction will occur key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bond dissociation energy solvation study notes the idea
