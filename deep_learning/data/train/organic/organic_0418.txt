ab can occur either heterolytically where the shared pair of electron goes with one partner or another or or homolytically where one electron stays with each partner the products of homolytic cleavage are radicals and the energy that is required to break the bond homolytically is called the bond dissociation energy bde and is a measure of the strength of the bond calculation of the bde the bde for a molecule ab is calculated as the difference in the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants for homolysis officially the iupac definition of bond dissociation energy refers to the
