a bond breaks or is formed does not affect the bde bond dissociation energies are useful in assessing the energetics of chemical processes for chemical reactions combining bond dissociation energies for bonds formed and bonds broken in a chemical reaction using hesss law can be used to estimate reaction enthalpies example chlorination of methane consider the chlorination of methane the overall reaction thermochemistry can be calculated exactly by combining the bdes for the bonds broken and bonds formed ch ch h bdechh cl cl bdecl h cl hcl bdehcl ch cl chcl bdechcl because reaction enthalpy is a state function
