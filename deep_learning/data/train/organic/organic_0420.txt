smaller the difference in energies accounts for the selectivity in the halogenation of hydrocarbons with different types of ch bonds table representative ch bdes in organic molecules rh do kjmol d kjmol rh do kjmol d kjmol chh hcchh chchh chh chchh hcch chch hcchchh hcoh chchh chcoh trends in ch bdes it is important to remember that ch bdes refer to the energy it takes to break the bond and is the difference in energy between the reactants and the products therefore it is not appropriate to interpret bdes solely in terms of the stability of the radical products
