strongest ch bond ch bonds on primary carbons are stronger than those on secondary carbons which are stronger than those on tertiary carbons interpretation of ch bdes for sp hybridized carbons the interpretation of the bdes in saturated molecules has been subject of recent controversy as indicated above the variation in bdes with substitution has traditionally been interpreted as reflecting the stabilities of the alkyl radicals with the assessment that more highly substituted radicals are more stable as with carbocations although this is a popular explanation it fails to account fo the fact the bonds to groups other than h
