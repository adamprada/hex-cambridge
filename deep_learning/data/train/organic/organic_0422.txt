substituents which is released in the nearly planar radicals considering that bdes reflect the relative energies of reactants and products either explanation can account for the trend in bdes another factor that needs to be considered is the electronegativity the pauling definition of electronegativity says that the bond dissociation energy between unequal partners is going to be dependent on the difference in electrongativities according to the expression where and are the electronegativities and the bond energies are in ev therefore the variation in bdes can be interpreted as reflecting variation in the electronegativities of the different types of alkyl fragments
