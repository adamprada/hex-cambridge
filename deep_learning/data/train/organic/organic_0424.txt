is exothermic or endothermic suggest possible transitionstate structures for simple onestep processes assess the likelihood of a reaction occurring at room temperature given the value of the activation energy δg key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below activation energy δg reaction energy diagram transition state study notes you may have been taught to use the term activated complex rather than transition state as the two are often used interchangeably similarly the activation energy of a reaction is often represented by the symbol eact or ea you may recall from general chemistry
