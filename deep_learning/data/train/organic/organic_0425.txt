energy between reactants and products and whether a reaction is downhill exergonic energy releasing or uphill endergonic energy absorbing when we talk about kinetics on the other hand we are concerned with the rate of the reaction regardless of whether it is uphill or downhill thermodynamically first lets review what this energy diagram tells us about the thermodynamics of the reaction illustrated by the energy diagram above the energy level of the products is lower than that of the reactants this tells us that the change in standard gibbs free energy for the reaction Î´grnx is negative in other words
