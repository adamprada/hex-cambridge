at equilibrium r jkmol or cal kmol t temperature in kelvin k if you do the math you see that a negative value for δgrnx an exergonic reaction corresponds as it should by intuition to keq being greater than an equilibrium constant which favors product formation in a hypothetical endergonic energyabsorbing reaction the products would have a higher energy than reactants and thus δgrnx would be positive and keq would be less than favoring reactants now lets move to kinetics look again at the energy diagram for exergonic reaction although it is downhill overall it isnt a straight downhill run
