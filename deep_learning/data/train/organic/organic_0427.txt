any definable lifetime it may help to imagine a transition state as being analogous to the exact moment that a baseball is struck by a bat transition states are drawn with dotted lines representing bonds that are in the process of breaking or forming and the drawing is often enclosed by brackets here is a picture of a likely transition state for a substitution reaction between hydroxide and chloromethane this reaction involves a collision between two molecules for this reason we say that it has second order kinetics the rate expression for this type of reaction is rate kreactant reactant
