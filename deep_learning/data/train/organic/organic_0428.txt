is one more interesting and useful expression consider a simple reaction where the reactants are a and b and the product is ab this is referred to as a condensation reaction because two molecules are coming together or condensing if we know the rate constant k for the forward reaction and the rate constant kreverse for the reverse reaction where ab splits apart into a and b we can simply take the quotient to find our equilibrium constant this too should make some intuitive sense if the forward rate constant is higher than the reverse rate constant equilibrium should lie
