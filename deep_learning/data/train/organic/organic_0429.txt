and equilibrium state the relationship between δg and keq and use this relationship to determine the value of either of the two variables given the other state the relationship between gibbs freeenergy enthalpy and entropy and use the relationship to calculate any one of δg δh and δs given the other two make a qualitative assessment of whether δs for a given process is expected to be positive or negative key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below exergonic endergonic exothermic endothermic enthalpy change heat of reaction δh entropy change δs reaction
