equilibrium constant for the hypothetical chemical reaction the equilibrium constant is defined as the notation a signifies the molar concentration of species a an alternative expression for the equilibrium constant involves partial pressures note that the expression for the equilibrium constant includes only solutes and gases pure solids and liquids do not appear in the expression for example the equilibrium expression for the reaction is the following observe that the gasphase species and appear in the expression but the solids and do not appear the equilibrium constant is most readily determined by allowing a reaction to reach equilibrium measuring the
