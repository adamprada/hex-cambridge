one reactants to two products results in a large positive δsº at ºc k δgº kcalmol calmole kcalmole kcalmole thus the entropy change opposes the enthalpy change but is not sufficient to change the sign of the resulting free energy change which is endergonic indeed cyclobutane is perfectly stable when kept at room temperature because the entropy contribution increases with temperature this energetically unfavorable transformation can be made favorable by raising the temperature at ºc k this is now an exergonic reaction and the thermal cracking of cyclobutane to ethene is known to occur at higher temperatures where r cal
