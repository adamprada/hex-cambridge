will trigger an alert indicating the large imbalance such numbers imply applications to organic reactions the equation below can also be useful without performing any calculations conceptually this equation helps us compare the energetics of reaction mechanisms to predict the major products for example if δg then k and products are favored over reactants if δg then k and reactants are favored over products if δg then k and the system is at equilibrium recognizing the underlying energetics of equilibrium the stability of charged reactants and products can be used to predict reaction equilibrium reaction conditions can also be adjusted
