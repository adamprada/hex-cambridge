step in a multistep reaction has its own activation energy the overall activation energy is the difference in energy between the reactants and the transition state of the slowest ratedetermining step the ratedetermining step that is the one that controls the overall rate of reaction is the step with the highest activation energy a second model for a nucleophilic substitution reaction is called the dissociative or sn mechanism in this picture the cx bond breaks first before the nucleophile approaches this results in the formation of a carbocation because the central carbon has only three bonds it bears a formal
