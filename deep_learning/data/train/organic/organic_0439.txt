completely from the vicinity of the reaction before the nucleophile begins its attack because the leaving group is no longer in the picture the nucleophile is free to attack from either side of the planar sphybridized carbocation electrophile this means that about half the time the product has the same stereochemical configuration as the starting material retention of configuration and about half the time the stereochemistry has been inverted in other words racemization has occurred at the carbon center as an example the tertiary alkyl bromide below would be expected to form a racemic mix of r and s alcohols
