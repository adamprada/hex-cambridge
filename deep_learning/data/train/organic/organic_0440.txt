carbocation species is a reaction intermediate a potential energy diagram for an sn reaction shows that the carbocation intermediate can be visualized as a kind of valley in the path of the reaction higher in energy than both the reactant and product but lower in energy than the two transition states exercise draw structures representing ts and ts in the reaction above use the soliddash wedge convention to show three dimensions answer recall that the first step of the reaction above in which two charged species are formed from a neutral molecule is much the slower of the two steps
