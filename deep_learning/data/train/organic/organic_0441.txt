speed up the process so as to avoid waiting several millennia for the reaction to reach completion we could supply enough energy in the form of heat from a flame to push some of the sugar molecules over the high energy hill heat would be released from the resulting exothermic reaction and this energy would push more molecules over their energy hills and so on the sugar would literally burn up a second way to make the reaction go faster is to employ a catalyst you probably already know that a catalyst is an agent that causes a chemical reaction
