not do anything at all to fructose the details of these reactions are discussed in section b glucose kinase is able to find and recognize glucose out of all of the other molecules floating around in the chemical soup of a cell a different enzyme fructokinase specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose we have already learned section that enzymes are very specific in terms of the stereochemistry of the reactions that they catalyze enzymes are also highly regiospecific acting at only one specific part of a molecule notice that in the glucose kinase reaction above only one of the alcohol
