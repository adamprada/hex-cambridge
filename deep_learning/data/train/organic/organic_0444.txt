remarkably good job of explaining the bonding geometry and properties of many organic compounds there are some areas however where the valence bond theory falls short it fails to adequately account for example for some interesting properties of compounds that contain alternating double and single bonds in order to understand these properties we need to think about chemical bonding in a new way using the ideas of molecular orbital mo theory another look at the h molecule bonding and antibonding sigma molecular orbitals lets consider again the simplest possible covalent bond the one in molecular hydrogen h when we described
