a new molecular orbital mo in which a pair of electrons is delocalized around two hydrogen nuclei an important principle of quantum mechanical theory is that when orbitals combine the number of orbitals before the combination takes place must equal the number of new orbitals that result orbitals dont just disappear we saw this previously when we discussed hybrid orbitals one s and three p orbitals make four sp hybrids when two atomic s orbitals combine in the formation of h the result is two molecular orbitals called sigma Ïƒ orbitals according to mo theory the first sigma orbital is
