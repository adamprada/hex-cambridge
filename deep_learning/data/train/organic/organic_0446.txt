molecule is eggshaped encompassing the two nuclei and with the highest likelihood of electrons being in the area between the two nuclei the highenergy antibonding sigmastar orbital can be visualized as a pair of droplets with areas of higher electron density near each nucleus and a node area of zero electron density midway between the two nuclei remember that we are thinking here about electron behavior as wave behavior when two separate waves combine they can do so with what is called constructive interference where the two amplitudes reinforce one another or destructive interference where the two amplitudes cancel one
