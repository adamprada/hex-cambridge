different colors when orbital lobes of the same phase overlap constructive wave interference increases the electron density when regions of opposite phase overlap the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes when p orbitals overlap end to end they create σ and σ orbitals if two atoms are located along the xaxis in a cartesian coordinate system the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx bonding and σpx antibonding read as sigmapx and sigmapx star respectively just as with sorbital overlap the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei which is a
