denoted in mo diagrams like the one below with the greek letter psi ψ instead of π in the bonding ψ orbital the two shaded lobes of the pz orbitals interact constructively with each other as do the two unshaded lobes remember the shading choice represents mathematical and signs for the wavefunction therefore there is increased electron density between the nuclei in the molecular orbital this is why it is a bonding orbital in the higherenergy antibonding ψ orbital the shaded lobe of one pz orbital interacts destructively with the unshaded lobe of the second pz orbital leading to a
