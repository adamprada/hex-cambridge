electron the electrons become paired in the orbital overlap bonding the atoms together the simplest example valence bond theory can be demonstrated by the h molecule we can see from the periodic table that each hydrogen atom has a single valence electron if hydrogen atoms come together to form a bond then each hydrogen atom effectively has a share in both electrons and thus each resembles the noble gas helium and is more stable the electrons shared in the orbital overlap are represented by a single dash between the atoms valence bond theory describes a chemical bond as the overlap
