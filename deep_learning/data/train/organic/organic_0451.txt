than those that have less overlap ne more characteristic of the covalent bond in h is important to consider at this point the two overlapping s orbitals can be visualized as two spherical balloons being pressed together this means that the bond has cylindrical symmetry if we were to take a crosssectional plane of the bond at any point it would form a circle this type of bond is referred to as a Ïƒsigma bond the energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap the energy diagram below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two
