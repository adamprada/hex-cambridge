move closer together the overlap increases so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei at some specific distance between the atoms which varies depending on the atoms involved the energy reaches its lowest most stable value this optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is called the the bond lengths between the two atoms the bond is stable because at this point the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration figure a plot of potential energy versus internuclear distance for the
