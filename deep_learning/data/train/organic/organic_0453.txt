in general the length of a typical carboncarbon single bond in an organic molecule is about pm while carboncarbon double bonds are about pm carbonoxygen double bonds are about pm and carbonhydrogen bonds are in the range of to pm the strength of covalent bonds in organic molecules ranges from about kjmol for a carboniodine bond in thyroid hormone for example about kjmole for a typical carbonhydrogen bond and up to over kjmole for a carboncarbon triple bond representative bond energies and lengths exercises for the following energy diagram for energy vs intermolecular distance is for a fluorine molecule f
