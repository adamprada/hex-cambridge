and metallic bonds in this chapter each type of bond and the general properties found in typical substances in which the bond type occurs will be discussed ionic bonds results from electrostatic forces that exist between ions of opposite charge these bonds typically involve a metal with a nonmetal covalent bonds result from the sharing of electrons between two atoms the bonds typically involve one nonmetallic element with another metallic bonds are found in solid metals copper iron aluminum with each metal atom bonded to several neighboring metal atoms and the bonding electrons are free to move throughout the dimensional
