lewis dot symbolsthat can be used for predicting the number of bonds formed by most elements in their compounds each lewis dot symbol consists of the chemical symbol for an element surrounded by dots that represent its valence electrons lewis dot symbols provide a convenient representation of valence electrons allows you to keep track of valence electrons during bond formation consists of the chemical symbol for the element plus a dot for each valence electron to write an elements lewis dot symbol we place dots representing its valence electrons one at a time around the elements chemical symbol up to
