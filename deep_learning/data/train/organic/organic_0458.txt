predict the number of bonds that an element will form in a compound consider the symbol for nitrogen in figure the lewis dot symbol explains why nitrogen with three unpaired valence electrons tends to form compounds in which it shares the unpaired electrons to form three bonds boron which also has three unpaired valence electrons in its lewis dot symbol also tends to form compounds with three bonds whereas carbon with four unpaired valence electrons in its lewis dot symbol tends to share all of its unpaired valence electrons by forming compounds in which it has four bonds lewis symbols
