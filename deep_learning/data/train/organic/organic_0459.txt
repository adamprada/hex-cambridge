rule explains the stoichiometry of most compounds in the s and p blocks of the periodic table we now know from quantum mechanics that the number eight corresponds to one ns and three np valence orbitals which together can accommodate a total of eight electrons remarkably though lewiss insight was made nearly a decade before rutherford proposed the nuclear model of the atom common exceptions to the octet rule are helium whose s electron configuration gives it a full n shell and hydrogen which tends to gain or share its one electron to achieve the electron configuration of helium lewiss
