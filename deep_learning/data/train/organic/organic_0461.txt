undergo any explosive reactions unlike the sodium and chlorine that it is made of why referring to the octet rule atoms attempt to get a noble gas electron configuration which is eight valence electrons sodium ssps has one valence electron so giving it up would result in the same electron configuration as neon ssp chlorine sspsphas seven valence electrons so if it takes one it will have eight an octet chlorine has the electron configuration of argon sspsp when it gains an electron the lewis structure of an ionic compound show the movement of electrons for nacl sodium is in
