fluorine and chlorine often form ions in order to achieve a full octet the principle elements of organic chemistry carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen instead tend to fill their octet by sharing electrons with other atoms forming covalent bonds consider the simplest case of hydrogen gas an isolated hydrogen atom has only one electron located in the s orbital if two hydrogen atoms come close enough so that their respective s orbitals overlap the two electrons can be shared between the two nuclei and a covalently bonded h molecule is formed in the lewis structure of h each pair of
