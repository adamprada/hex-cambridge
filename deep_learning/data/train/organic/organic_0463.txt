that although a carbon atom has a total of six electrons its lewis symbol has four unpaired electrons following lewis theory the carbon atom wants to form four covalent bonds to fill its octet in a methane molecule the central carbon atom shares its four valence electrons with four hydrogen atoms thus forming four bonds and fulfilling the octet rule for the carbon and the doublet rule for each of the hydrogens the next relatively simple organic molecule to consider is ethane which has the molecular formula ch if we draw each atoms lewis symbol separately we can see that
