importance of including nonbonding valence shell electron pairs when viewing such configurations methane ammonia water bonding configurations are readily predicted by valenceshell electronpair repulsion theory commonly referred to as vsepr in most introductory chemistry texts this simple model is based on the fact that electrons repel each other and that it is reasonable to expect that the bonds and nonbonding valence electron pairs associated with a given atom will prefer to be as far apart as possible the bonding configurations of carbon are easy to remember since there are only three categories configuration bonding partners bond angles example tetrahedral ยบ
