course it is the configuration of atoms not electrons that defines the the shape of a molecule and in this sense ammonia is said to be pyramidal not tetrahedral the compound boron trifluoride bf does not have nonbonding valence electrons and the configuration of its atoms is trigonal nice treatments of vsepr theory have been provided by oxford and purdue the best way to study the threedimensional shapes of molecules is by using molecular models many kinds of model kits are available to students and professional chemists two electron groups our first example is a molecule with two bonded atoms
