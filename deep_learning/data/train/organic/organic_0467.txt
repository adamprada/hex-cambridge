electrons and each oxygen atom contributes six the lewis electron structure is the carbon atom forms two double bonds each double bond is a group so there are two electron groups around the central atom like beh the arrangement that minimizes repulsions places the groups apart once again both groups around the central atom are bonding pairs bp so co is designated as ax vsepr only recognizes groups around the central atom thus the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms do not influence the molecular geometry with two bonding pairs on the central atom and no lone pairs the molecular
