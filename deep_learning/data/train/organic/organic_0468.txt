six valence electrons as you learned previously the lewis electron structure of one of three resonance forms is represented as the structure of co is a resonance hybrid it has three identical bonds each with a bond order of we minimize repulsions by placing the three groups apart figure all electron groups are bonding pairs bp with three bonding groups around the central atom the structure is designated as ax we see from figure that the molecular geometry of co is trigonal planar in our next example we encounter the effects of lone pairs and multiple bonds on molecular geometry
