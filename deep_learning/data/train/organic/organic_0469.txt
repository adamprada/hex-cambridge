more space near the central atom than a bonding pair figure thus bonding pairs and lone pairs repel each other electrostatically in the order bpbp lpbp lplp in so we have one bpbp interaction and two lpbp interactions the molecular geometry is described only by the positions of the nuclei not by the positions of the lone pairs thus with two nuclei and one lone pair the shape is bent or v shaped which can be viewed as a trigonal planar arrangement with a missing vertex figures and figure the difference in the space occupied by a lone pair of
