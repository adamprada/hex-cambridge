occupy more space than those of a single bond for example in a molecule such as cho ax whose structure is shown below the double bond repels the single bonds more strongly than the single bonds repel each other this causes a deviation from ideal geometry an hch bond angle of rather than four electron groups one of the limitations of lewis structures is that they depict molecules and ions in only two dimensions with four electron groups we must learn to show molecules and ions in three dimensions ax ch the central atom carbon contributes four valence electrons and
