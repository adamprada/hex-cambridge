three bonding pairs and one lone pair repulsions are minimized by directing each hydrogen atom and the lone pair to the corners of a tetrahedron with three bonding pairs and one lone pair the structure is designated as axe this designation has a total of four electron pairs three x and one e we expect the lpbp interactions to cause the bonding pair angles to deviate significantly from the angles of a perfect tetrahedron there are three nuclei and one lone pair so the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal in essence this is a tetrahedron with a vertex missing figure
