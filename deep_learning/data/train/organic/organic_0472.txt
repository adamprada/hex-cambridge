a significant deviation from idealized tetrahedral angles with two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electrons the structure has significant lone pair interactions there are two nuclei about the central atom so the molecular shape is bent or v shaped with an hoh angle that is even less than the hnh angles in nh as we would expect because of the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the central atom rather than one this molecular shape is essentially a tetrahedron with two missing vertices exercises questions q list the bond angles for each of the following compounds
