of molecular models assign rs configurations to wedgeandbrokenline structures containing two chiral carbon atoms with or without the aid of molecular models determine with or without the aid of molecular models whether two wedgeandbrokenline structures containing two chiral carbon atoms are identical represent a pair of enantiomers or represent a pair of diastereomers draw the wedgeandbrokenline structure of a specific stereoisomer of a compound containing two chiral carbon atoms given its iupac name and rs configuration key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below diastereomer diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not related
