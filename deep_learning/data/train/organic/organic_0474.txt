of the other two molecule ss is enantiomer of rr and diasteromer of rs and sr sss mirror image is rr and they are not superimposable so they are enantiomers rs and sr are not mirror image of ss and are not superimposable to each other so they are diasteromers figure diastereomers vs enantiomers tartaric acid cho is an organic compound that can be found in grape bananas and in wine the structures of tartaric acid itself is really interesting naturally it is in the form of rr stereocenters artificially it can be in the meso form rs which is
