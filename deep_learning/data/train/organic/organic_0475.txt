the stereochemistry of sugar molecules employing names of historical origin in addition to the designators d and l you will learn about this system if you take a biochemistry class we will use the dl designations here to refer to different sugars but we wont worry about learning the system as you can see derythrose is a chiral molecule c and c are stereocenters both of which have the r configuration in addition you should make a model to convince yourself that it is impossible to find a plane of symmetry through the molecule regardless of the conformation does derythrose
