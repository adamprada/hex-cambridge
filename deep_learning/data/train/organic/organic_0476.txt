called dthreose is not a mirror image of erythrose dthreose is a diastereomer of both derythrose and lerythrose the definition of diastereomers is simple if two molecules are stereoisomers same molecular formula same connectivity different arrangement of atoms in space but are not enantiomers then they are diastereomers by default in practical terms this means that at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite in a pair of diastereomers by definition two molecules that are diastereomers are not mirror images of each other lthreose the enantiomer of dthreose has the r configuration at c and the
