including dglucose itself in lglucose all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to dglucose that leaves diastereomers of dglucose these are molecules in which at least one but not all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to dglucose one of these diastereomers a sugar called dgalactose is shown above in dgalactose one of four stereocenters is inverted relative to dglucose diastereomers which differ in only one stereocenter out of two or more are called epimers dglucose and dgalactose can therefore be refered to as epimers as well as diastereomers example draw the structure of lgalactose the enantiomer of dgalactose draw
