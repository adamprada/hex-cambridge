should confirm this for yourself the mirror image of compound a is compound b which has the s configuration at both chiral centers if we were to pick up compound a flip it over and put it next to compound b we would see that they are not superimposable again confirm this for yourself with your models a and b are nonsuperimposable mirror images in other words enantiomers now look at compound c in which the configuration is s at chiral center and r at chiral center compounds a and c are stereoisomers they have the same molecular formula and
