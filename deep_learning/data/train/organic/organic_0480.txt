c and the two are not superimposable therefore c and d are a pair of enantiomers compound d is also a diastereomer of compounds a and b this can also seem very confusing at first but there some simple shortcuts to analyzing stereoisomers stereoisomer shortcuts if all of the chiral centers are of opposite rs configuration between two stereoisomers they are enantiomers if at least one but not all of the chiral centers are opposite between two stereoisomers they are diastereomers note these shortcuts to not take into account the possibility of additional stereoisomers due to alkene groups we will
