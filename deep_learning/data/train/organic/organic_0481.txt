acid itself is really interesting naturally it is in the form of rr stereocenters artificially it can be in the meso form rs which is achiral rr tartaric acid is enantiomer to is mirror image which is ss tartaric acid and diasteromers to mesotartaric acid figure rr and ss tartaric acid have similar physical properties and reactivity however mesotartaric acid have different physical properties and reactivity for example melting point of rr ss tartaric is about degree celsius and melting point of mesotartaric acid is about degree celsius diastereomers vs enantiomers in sugar chemistry derythrose is a common fourcarbon sugar
