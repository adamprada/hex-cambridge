a plane of symmetry through the molecule regardless of the conformation does derythrose have an enantiomer of course it does if it is a chiral molecule it must the enantiomer of erythrose is its mirror image and is named lerythrose once again you should use models to convince yourself that these mirror images of erythrose are not superimposable notice that both chiral centers in lerythrose both have the s configuration note in a pair of enantiomers all of the chiral centers are of the opposite configuration what happens if we draw a stereoisomer of erythrose in which the configuration is
