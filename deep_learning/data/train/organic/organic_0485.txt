illustrated for a cisdisubstituted epoxide which of course could be prepared from the corresponding cisalkene this hydration of an epoxide does not change the oxidation state of any atoms or groups the mechanism for the ring opening of epoxides depends on the reaction conditions and is discussed in more detail in the next section of this chapter syn dihydroxylation osmium tetroxide oxidizes alkenes to give glycols through syn addition a glycol also known as a vicinal diol is a compound with two oh groups on adjacent carbons dihydroxylated products glycols are obtained by reaction with aqueous potassium permanganate ph or
