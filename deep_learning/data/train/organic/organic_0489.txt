thing as ph the former is an inherent property of a compound or functional group while the latter is the measure of the hydronium ion concentration in a particular aqueous solution ph log ho additional reagents can be added to a reaction solution to change the ph of the reaction conditions beyond the effects of an individual compound relative acidity and pka values an application of the hendersonhasselbach equation is the ability to determine the relative acidity of compounds by comparing their pka values the stronger an acid the greater the ionization the lower the pka and the lower the
