not at all acidic pkavalues are above not on our table the two protons on the carbon next to the carbonyl are slightly acidic with pka values around according to the table the most acidic proton is on the phenol group so if the compound were to be subjected to a single molar equivalent of strong base this is the proton that would be donated acidic basic environments everything is relative in reactivity because our goal is understanding dynamic chemical reactivity we do not need to know the specific amount of the protonated and unprotonated forms of a compound we
