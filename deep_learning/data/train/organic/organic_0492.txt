and acetic acid becomes deprotonated to form acetate chco conversely the pka of phenol is at ph the environment is considered acidic for phenol and it remains primarily protonated it is also important to remember that organic chemistry does not have to occur in water so pka values can be as high as exercise complete the table below to indicate whether each compound exists predominantly in its protonated acidic environment or deprotonated basic environment form compound pka ph environment ph environment ph environment answer compound pka ph environment ph environment ph environment kekul√© aka lewis structurescondensed formulaline formulaexample converting between
