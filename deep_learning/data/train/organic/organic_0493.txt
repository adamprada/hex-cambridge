bonds each oxygen atom has two bonds each hydrogen atom has one bond through general chemistry you may have already experienced looking at molecular structures using lewis structures because organic chemistry can involve large molecules it would be beneficial if lewis structures could be abbreviated the three different ways to draw organic molecules include kekul√© formulas condensed formulas and skeletal structures also called linebond strutures or line formulas during this course you will view molecules written in all three forms it will be more helpful if you become comfortable going from one style of drawing to another and look at
