multiple substituents including the hydrogens line formulas omit the symbols for carbon and hydrogen entirely unless the hydrogen is bonded to an atom other than carbon each straight line segment represents a bond the ends and intersections of the lines are carbon atoms and the correct number of hydrogens is calculated from the tetravalency of carbon nonbonding valence shell electrons are omitted in these formulas kekulé aka lewis structures a kekulé formula or structural formula displays the atoms of the molecule in the order they are bonded it also depicts how the atoms are bonded to one another for example
