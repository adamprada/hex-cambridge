next hydrogen then its possible that there are double or triple bonds in example c the carbon is double bonded to oxygen and single bonded to another oxygen notice how cooh means cooh instead of chcooh because carbon does not have a complete octet and oxygens line formula because organic compounds can be complex at times lineangle formulas are used to write carbon and hydrogen atoms more efficiently by replacing the letter c with lines a carbon atom is present wherever a line intersects another line hydrogen atoms are omitted but are assumed to be present to complete each of
