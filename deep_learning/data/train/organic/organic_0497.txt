but could be easily drawn in see practice problems although we do not usually draw in the hs that are bonded to carbon we do draw them in if they are connected to other atoms besides carbon example is the oh group above in example a this is done because it is not always clear if the noncarbon atom is surrounded by lone pairs or hydrogens also in example a notice how the oh is drawn with a bond to the second carbon but it does not mean that there is a third carbon at the end of that bond
