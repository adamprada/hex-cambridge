the double barbed arrow represents the movement of two electrons they usually involve lone pair electrons or pi bonds there are only three types of electron motion in resonance they are a lone pair forms a pi bond to an adjacent atom a pi bond forms a new pi bond to an adjacent atom a pi bond forms a lone pair on adjacent atom lets look at the resonance within acrylic acid to demonstrate these three types of resonance the curved arrow in structure a represents the type resonance motion the pi bond between the carbon and oxygen breaks to
