resonance example below are a few more examples of legal resonance expressions confirm for yourself that the octet rule is not exceeded for any atoms that formal charges are correct and identify which type of electron movement is being represented by each arrow exercise draw the resonance contributors that correspond to the curved twoelectron movement arrows in the resonance expressions below then identify the type of resonance motion in each structure below answer exercise in each resonance expression identify the type of resonance motion then draw curved arrows on the leftside contributor that shows how we get to the rightside
