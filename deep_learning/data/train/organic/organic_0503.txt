is commonly used to the polarity in certain double bonds type i example type ii type ii resonance is only seen with a charge and usually involves a positive charge on oxygen or nitrogen being shared onto a carbon the carbocation form has only six valence electrons on the carbon so it is a less stable form than the major form which has complete octets type ii example type iii type iii resonance is very common and important because is serves to stabilize positive charges negative charges or lone pairs it is sometimes referred to as allylic resonance especially in
