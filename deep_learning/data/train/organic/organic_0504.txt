bonds if a carbocation is adjacent to a double bond then three p orbitals can overlap and share the two pi electrons another kind of conjugated pi system in which the positive charge is shared over two carbons exercise each of the illegal resonance expressions below contains one or more mistakes explain what is incorrect in each answer the first pair are not resonance structures since there is an additional hydrogen on the second structure oxygen the second pair pushed electrons toward nitrogen which already has a lone pair and would exceed its octet the third pair includes a structure
