pi system in this carbocation is composed of seven p orbitals containing six delocalized pi electrons example draw the major resonance contributor of the structure below include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how you got from the given structure to your structure explain why your contributor is the major one in what kind of orbitals are the two lone pairs on the oxygen solution in the structure above the carbon with the positive formal charge does not have a complete octet of valence electrons using the curved arrow convention a lone pair on the oxygen can be
