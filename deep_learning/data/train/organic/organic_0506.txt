the oxygen is in an unhybridized p orbital and is part of the conjugated pi system and the other is located in an sp orbital also note that one additional contributor can be drawn but it is also minor because it has a carbon with an incomplete octet exercise the figure below shows how the negative formal charge on an oxygen of an enol can be delocalized to the carbon indicated by an arrow more resonance contributors can be drawn in which negative charge is delocalized to three other atoms on the molecule a circle these atoms that can also
