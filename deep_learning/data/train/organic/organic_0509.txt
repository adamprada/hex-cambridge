for sulfate so there isnt a most favorable resonance of the sulfate ion because they are all identical in charge and there is no change in electronegativity between the oxygen atoms below is the resonance for chcoo formal charges are displayed in red the lewis structure with the most formal charges is not desirable because we want the lewis structure with the least formal charge the resonance for hpo and the formal charges in red the resonance for cho and the formal charges in red the resonance hybrid for po hybrid bonds are in red the resonance hybrid for no
