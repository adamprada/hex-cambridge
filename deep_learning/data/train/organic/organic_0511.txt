d and f orbitals have different sublevels thus can hold more electrons as stated the electron configuration of each element is unique to its position on the periodic table the energy level is determined by the period and the number of electrons is given by the atomic number of the element orbitals on different energy levels are similar to each other but they occupy different areas in space the s orbital and s orbital both have the characteristics of an s orbital radial nodes spherical volume probabilities can only hold two electrons etc but as they are found in different
