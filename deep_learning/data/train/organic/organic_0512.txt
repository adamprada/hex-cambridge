writing electron configurations for more information on how electron configurations and the periodic table are linked visit the connecting electrons to the periodic table module rules for assigning electron orbitals occupation of orbitals electrons fill orbitals in a way to minimize the energy of the atom therefore the electrons in an atom fill the principal energy levels in order of increasing energy the electrons are getting farther from the nucleus the order of levels filled looks like this s s p s p s d p s d p s f d p s f d and p one way
