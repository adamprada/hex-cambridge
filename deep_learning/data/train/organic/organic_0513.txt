opposing spins otherwise they would have the same four quantum numbers which is forbidden one electron is spin up ms and the other would spin down ms this tells us that each subshell has double the electrons per orbital the s subshell has orbital that can hold up to electrons the p subshell has orbitals that can hold up to electrons the d subshell has orbitals that hold up to electrons and the f subshell has orbitals with electrons example hydrogen and helium the first three quantum numbers of an electron are n l ml only two electrons can correspond
