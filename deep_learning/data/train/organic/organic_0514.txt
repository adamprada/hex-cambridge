with similar energy also referred to as degenerate before pairing with another electron in a halffilled orbital atoms at ground states tend to have as many unpaired electrons as possible when visualizing this processes think about how electrons are exhibiting the same behavior as the same poles on a magnet would if they came into contact as the negatively charged electrons fill orbitals they first try to get as far as possible from each other before having to pair up example oxygen and nitrogen if we look at the correct electron configuration of the nitrogen z atom a very important
