electronegativity down a group as you go down a group electronegativity decreases if it increases up to fluorine it must decrease as you go down the chart shows the patterns of electronegativity in groups and explaining the patterns in electronegativity the attraction that a bonding pair of electrons feels for a particular nucleus depends on the number of protons in the nucleus the distance from the nucleus the amount of screening by inner electrons why does electronegativity increase across a period consider sodium at the beginning of period and chlorine at the end ignoring the noble gas argon think of
