electronegativity decreases because the bonding pair of electrons is increasingly distant from the attraction of the nucleus consider the hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride molecules the bonding pair is shielded from the fluorines nucleus only by the s electrons in the chlorine case it is shielded by all the ssp electrons in each case there is a net pull from the center of the fluorine or chlorine of but fluorine has the bonding pair in the level rather than the level as it is in chlorine if it is closer to the nucleus the attraction is greater dipole moments occur
