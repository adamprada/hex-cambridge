element creating a partial negative charge while the less electronegative element has a partial positive charge the larger the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms the more polar the bond to be considered a polar bond the difference in electronegativity must on the pauling scale since the two electrical partial charges have opposite sign and equal magnitude and are separated by a distance a dipole is established dipole moment is measured in debye units which is equal to the distance between the charges multiplied by the charge debye equals x coulombmeters figure the electron distribution in a nonpolar covalent
