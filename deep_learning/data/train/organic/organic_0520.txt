polarity and structure of molecules the shape of a molecule and the polarity of its bonds a molecule that contains polar bonds might not have any overall polarity depending upon its shape the simple definition of whether a complex molecule is polar or not depends upon whether its overall centers of positive and negative charges overlap if these centers lie at the same point in space then the molecule has no overall polarity and is non polar figure charge distrubtions if a molecule is completely symmetric then the dipole moment vectors on each molecule will cancel each other out making
