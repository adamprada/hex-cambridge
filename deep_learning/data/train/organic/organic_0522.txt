clcccl does not have a net dipole moment example chcl ccl the key polar bond is pm measurement reveals d from this data ionic character can be computed if this bond were ionic based on proton electron μdd example hcl since measurement d ionic x hcl u d measured hcl bond length pm if ionic μdd ionic x a spectrum of bonds the implication of all this is that there is no clearcut division between covalent and ionic bonds in a pure covalent bond the electrons are held on average exactly half way between the atoms in a polar bond
