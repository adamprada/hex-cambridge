iodine end of the bond lithium iodide for example dissolves in organic solvents like ethanol not something which ionic substances normally do summary no electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a pure nonpolar covalent bond a small electronegativity difference leads to a polar covalent bond a large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond example polar bonds vs polar molecules in a simple diatomic molecule like hcl if the bond is polar then the whole molecule is polar what about more complicated molecules figure left ccl right chcl consider ccl left panel in figure above which as a molecule
