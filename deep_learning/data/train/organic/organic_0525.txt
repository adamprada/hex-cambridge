detailed account of photochemistry is given in chapter figure schematic representation of electronic vibrational and rotational energy levels the vertical scale is greatly distorted rotational energy levels are normally apart vibrational energy levels are apart while electronic transitions involve the transition of an electron from the ground state to an excited electronic state is accompanied by vibrational and rotational changes in the molecule as shown in figure in condense phase samples it usually is not possible to resolve the resulting absorption bands well enough to see the fine structure due to vibrationrotation transitions consequently absorptions due to electronic excitation are
