at about the same wavelength and intensity for many simple compounds of the type and in which is an alkyl group in a very schematic way we can write there also is an absorption of propanone with at the maximum is not shown in figure which is a different kind of excitation this is ascribed to raising an electron in the bonding orbital section c of the carbonoxygen double bond to the orbital such transitions are called and occur generally for substances with double bonds table lists the wavelengths of maximum absorption for some typical electronic absorption bands of simple
