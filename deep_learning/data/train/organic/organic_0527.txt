would be expected that an alkadiene would give an absorption spectrum similar to that of ethene but with a larger because there are more double bonds per mole to absorb radiation this expectation is more or less realized for compounds such as hexadiene and dimethylenecyclobutane which have isolated double bonds but not for butadiene or ethenylbenzene which have conjugated double bonds section in general conjugated systems of double bonds absorb radiation of longer wavelengths and with greater intensity than corresponding systems of isolated double bonds this means that the difference in energy between the normal and excited states of conjugated
