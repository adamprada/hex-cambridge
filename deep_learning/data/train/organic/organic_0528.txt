see section of the several conventional valencebond structures that can be written for butadiene four of which are shown here only structure has a low enough energy to be dominant for the ground state of butadiene now when the molecule is excited to the extent of by ultraviolet light its energy is so large that pairing schemes such as and which are too unfavorable to contribute very much to the ground state can be very important for the excited state thus the stabilization energy of the excited state which has a multiplicity of nearly equalenergy pairing schemes is expected to
