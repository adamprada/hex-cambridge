the absorption at for butanone is an transition and with butenone this absorption shifts to longer wavelengths there is also an intense absorption band for butenone at which is a transition with butanone a corresponding absorption occurs at which is out of the range of the spectrometer used to take the spectra of figure conjugation also can influence infrared spectra transitions arising from and stretching vibrations generally are more intense and are shifted to slightly lower frequencies longer wavelengths for conjugated compounds relative to nonconjugated compounds thus the stretching of butene occurs at whereas that of butadiene is observed at
