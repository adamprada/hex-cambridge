as detailed information for our purposes here the main points to remember are a weak absorption suggests an transition of an isolated carbonyl group if this absorption is found in the region an aldehyde or ketone is probable somewhat stronger absorptions between and may correspond to transitions strong absorptions usually are characteristic of transitions if absorption occurs above a conjugated system of multiple bonds is indicated each additional carboncarbon double bond shifts about to longer wavelengths and enhances the intensity of absorption conjugation also shifts of transitions to longer wavelengths if we are dealing with compounds for which the wavelengths
