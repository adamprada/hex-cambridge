the orbitals subshells and shells spatially and energetically converting electron configurations to orbital diagrams is a useful skill as we transition to organic chemistry these skills are practiced in the next section the wave nature of light a wave is a periodic oscillation by which energy is transmitted through space all waves are periodic repeating regularly in both space and time waves are characterized by several interrelated properties electronic structure arrangement of electrons in atoms electromagnetic radiation aka radiant energy form of energy that has wave characteristics and carries energy through space all types of electromagnetic radiation move through a
