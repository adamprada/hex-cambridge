plancks theory energy is always emitted or absorbed in wholenumber multiples of hv for example hv hv hv and so forth we say that the allowed energies are quantized that is their values are restricted to certain quantities quantized energy and photons blackbody radiation is the radiation emitted by hot objects and could not be explained with classical physics max planck postulated that energy was quantized and may be emitted or absorbed only in integral multiples of a small unit of energy known as a quantum the energy of a quantum is proportional to the frequency of the radiation the
