certain amount of energy is required for the electron to overcome the attractive forces that hold it within the metal if the photons have less energy that this energy threshold the electrons cannot escape from the metal surface if a photon has sufficient energy an electron is emitted if the photon has more energy than necessary the excess appears as kinetic energy of the emitted electron line spectra and the bohr model there is an intimate connection between the atomic structure of an atom and its spectral characteristics most light is polychromatic and contains light of many wavelengths light that
