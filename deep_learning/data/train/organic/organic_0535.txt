spectrum containing radiation of only specific wavelengths with and constant bohrs model electrons in a permitted orbit have a specific energy and are said to be in an allowed energy state an electron in an allowed energy state will not radiate energy and therefore will not spiral into the nucleus rydberg constant x j principal quantum number corresponds to the different allowed orbits for the electron all energies given by this equation will be negative the lower more negative the energy is the more stable the atom is the lowest energy state is that for which n ground state lowest
