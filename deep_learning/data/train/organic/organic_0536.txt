a higher energy state but is emitted when the electron moves to a lower energy state if then e is positive radiant energy is absorbed if then e is negative radiant energy is emitted the wave behavior of matter an electron possesses both particle and wave properties louis de broglie showed that the wavelength of a particle is equal to plancks constant divided by the mass times the velocity of the particle the electron in bohrs circular orbits could thus be described as a standing wave one that does not move through space werner heisenbergs uncertainty principle states that it
