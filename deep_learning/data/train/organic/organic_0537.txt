electrons in atoms and molecules and their energies that is described by quantum mechanics because of waveparticle duality scientists must deal with the probability of an electron being at a particular point in space to do so required the development of quantum mechanics which uses wavefunctions to describe the mathematical relationship between the motion of electrons in atoms and molecules and their energies wave functions represented by ψ square of wave function ψ provides information about an electrons location when it is in an allowed energy state probability density represented by ψ value that represents the probability that an electron
