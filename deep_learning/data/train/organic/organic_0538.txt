and is farther away from the nucleus the second quantum number l can have integral values from to n for each value of n this quantum number defines the shape of the orbital generally designated by the letters s p d and f these correspond to values ranging from to the magnetic quantum number ml can have integral values between l and l including zero this quantum number describes the orientation of the orbital in space electron shell collection of orbitals with the same value of n subshell one or more orbitals with the same set of n and l
