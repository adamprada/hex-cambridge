of finding the electron occurring at the nucleus orbitals with values of n and l contain one or more nodes orbitals with l are p orbitals and contain a nodal plane that includes the nucleus giving rise to a dumbbell shape orbitals with l are d orbitals and have more complex shapes with at least two nodal surfaces l orbitals are f orbitals which are still more complex the s orbitals s orbital most stable spherically symmetric figure indicates that the probability decreases as we move away from the nucleus all s orbitals are spherically symmetric nodal surfaces nodes intermediate
