electron spin quantum number which can have values of ½ or ½ for any electron corresponding to the two possible orientations of an electron in a magnetic field this is important for chemistry because the pauli exclusion principle implies that no orbital can contain more than two electrons with opposite spin although the shapes of the orbitals for manyelectron atoms are the same as those for hydrogen the presence of more than one electron greatly changes the energies of the orbitals in hydrogen the energy of an orbital depends only on its principal quantum number however in manyelectron atoms electronelectron
