n zeff decreases with increasing value of l in a manyelectron atom for a given value of n the energy of an orbital increases with increasing value of l degenerate orbitals that have the same energy electron spin and the pauli exclusion principle electron spin property of the electron that makes it behave as though it were a tiny magnet the electron behaves as if it were spinning on its axis electron spin is quantized electron spin quantum number denoted as ms it can only have two possible values ½ and ½ which we can interpret as indicating the two
