obtained using hydrogenlike orbitals it is possible to construct the periodic table by filling up the available orbitals beginning with the lowestenergy orbitals the aufbau principle which gives rise to a particular arrangement of electrons for each element its electron configuration hunds rule says that the lowestenergy arrangement of electrons is the one that places them in degenerate orbitals with parallel spins electron configuration the way in which the electrons are distributed among the various orbitals the most stable or ground electron configuration of an atom is that in which the electrons are in the lowest possible energy level orbital
