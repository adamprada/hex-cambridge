the bonds and how to predict what the angle will be if we proceed as we did with the bond we might try to formulate bond formation in by bringing two hydrogen atoms in the state up to beryllium in the ground state table but there is a problem in the groundstate configuration of beryllium the orbital is full and cannot accommodate any more electrons the way around this is to promote one of the electrons of beryllium to a orbital the resulting beryllium atom called the valence state then could form a bond with a hydrogen by overlap of
