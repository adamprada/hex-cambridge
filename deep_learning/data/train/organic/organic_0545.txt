of bonds one as in and the other as in this is intuitively unreasonable for such a simple compound furthermore the bond angle is unspecified by this picture because the orbital is spherically symmetrical and could form bonds equally well in any direction however if we forget about the orbitals and only consider the possible repulsions between the electron pairs and between the hydrogen nuclei we can see that these repulsions will be minimized when the bond angle is thus arrangement should be more favorable than with a angle less than unfortunately we cannot check this particular bond angle by
