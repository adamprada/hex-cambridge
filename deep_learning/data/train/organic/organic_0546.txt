orbital and particularly on how far out they extend from the nucleus figure shows how far and orbitals extend relative to one another bonding with these orbitals as in and does not utilize the overlapping power of the orbitals to the fullest extent with we have overlap that uses only part of the orbital and with only a part of the orbital molecules such as can be formulated with better overlap and equivalent bonds with the aid of the concept of orbital hybridization this concept published independently by l pauling and j c slater in involves determining which if any
