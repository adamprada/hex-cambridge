consideration of minimum electronpair and internuclear repulsions henceforth we will proceed on the basis that molecules of the type may form hybrid bonds figure diagram of two hybrid orbitals composed of an orbital and a orbital one of the orbitals solid line has its greatest extension in the plus direction while the other orbital dotted line has its greatest extension in the minus direction bonds utilizing both of these orbitals would form at an angle of on the basis of repulsion between electron pairs and between nuclei molecules such as and in which the central atom forms three covalent bonds
