is shown with a different kind of line with atoms such as carbon and silicon the valencestate electronic configuration to form four covalent bonds has to be repulsion between the electron pairs and between the attached nuclei will be minimized by formation of a tetrahedral arrangement of the bonds the same geometry is predicted from hybridization one one and three orbitals which gives four hybrid orbitals directed at angles of to each other the predicted relative overlapping power of hybrid orbitals is figure figure diagram of the hybrid orbitals contributors and attributions john d robert and marjorie c caserio basic
