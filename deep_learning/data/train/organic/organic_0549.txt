introduction we are going to start by looking at ethene because it is the simplest molecule containing a carboncarbon double bond what is true of cc in ethene will be equally true of cc in more complicated alkenes ethene ch is often modeled as shown above the double bond between the carbon atoms is of course two pairs of shared electrons what the diagram doesnt show is that the two pairs arent the same as each other one of the pairs of electrons is held on the line between the two carbon nuclei as you would expect but the other
