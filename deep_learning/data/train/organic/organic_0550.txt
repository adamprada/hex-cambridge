called a pi bond the electrons in the pi bond are free to move around anywhere in this shaded region and can move freely from one half to the other the pi electrons are not as fully under the control of the carbon nuclei as the electrons in the sigma bond because the pi bond electrons lie exposed above and below the rest of the molecule they are relatively open to reaction with other compounds electrophilic addition reactions ears in a sense the pi bond is an unnecessary bond the structure would hold together perfectly well with a single bond
