general molecule xy as the electrophile reacting with ethene the atoms x and y are added to the carbon chain across the vinylic carbons as shown below understanding the electrophilic addition mechanism the mechanism for the reaction between ethene and a molecule xy begins by recognizing the electrophilic nature of xy trends in relative electronegativity help identify bonds to create partial positives within polar compounds as shown below we are going to assume that y is more electronegative than x so that the pair of electrons is pulled slightly towards the y end of the bond this polarity means that
