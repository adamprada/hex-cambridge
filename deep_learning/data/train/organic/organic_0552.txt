below in the final step the lone pair on y is attracted to the positively charged carbocation and they react to form a second covalent bond and the product below ear mechanism the movements of the electrons for the ear mechanism are shown with curved arrows regiochemistry and regioselective reactions regiochemistry is the orientation of the electrophile relative to the pi bond of the alkene electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes can be regioselective depending on the symmetry and structure of the alkene the details will be discussed in a later sections of this chapter stereoselective reactions different stereoisomeric reactants produce
