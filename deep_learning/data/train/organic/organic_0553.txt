alkene as an example write the mechanism for the reaction of a protic acid hx with an alkene sketch a reaction energy diagram for the electrophilic addition of an acid hx to an alkene key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below carbocation carbonium ion electrophilic addition reaction study notes an electrophilic addition reaction is a reaction in which a substrate is initially attacked by an electrophile and the overall result is the addition of one or more relatively simple molecules across a multiple bond the mechanism for the addition of hydrogen
