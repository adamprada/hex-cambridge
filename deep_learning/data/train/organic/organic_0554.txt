fact organic chemists are rarely interested in the inorganic products of their reactions furthermore most organic reactions are nonquantitative in nature in many of the reactions in this course the percentage yield is indicated beneath the products you are not expected to memorize these figures the question of yield is very important in organic chemistry where two five ten or even twenty reactions may be needed to synthesize a desired product for example if a chemist wishes to prepare compound d by the following reaction sequence and each of the individual steps gives only a yield one mole of a
