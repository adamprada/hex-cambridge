in the double bond and a halogen atom to the other for example with ethene and hydrogen chloride you get chloroethane figure electrophilic addition of hcl to ethene with butene you get chlorobutane figure electrophilic addition of hcl to butene what happens if you add the hydrogen to the carbon atom at the righthand end of the double bond and the chlorine to the lefthand end you would still have the same product the chlorine would be on a carbon atom next to the end of the chain you would simply have drawn the molecule flipped over in space that
