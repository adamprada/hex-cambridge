on one of them carbocation the next step is when the nucleophile halide bonds to the carbocation producing a new molecule with both the original hydrogen and halide attached to the organic reactant the second step will only occur if a good nucleophile is used figure mechanism of electrophilic addition of hydrogen halide to ethene figure mechanism of electrophilic addition of hydrogen halide to propene all of the halides hbr hcl hi hf can participate in this reaction and add on in the same manner although different halides do have different rates of reaction due to the hx bond getting
