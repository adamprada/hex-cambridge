to be slow variation of rates when you change the alkene this applies to unsymmetrical alkenes as well as to symmetrical ones for simplicity the examples given below are all symmetrical ones but they dont have to be reaction rates increase as the alkene gets more complicated in the sense of the number of alkyl groups such as methyl groups attached to the carbon atoms at either end of the double bond for example there are two ways of looking at the reasons for this both of which need you to know about the mechanism for the reactions alkenes react
