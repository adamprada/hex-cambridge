the type chxy and for the existence of optical isomerism in molecules of the type chxyz determine whether two differently oriented wedgeandbrokenline structures are identical or represent a pair of enantiomers key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below enantiomer study notes stereoisomers are isomers that differ in spatial arrangement of atoms rather than order of atomic connectivity one of the most interesting types of isomer is the mirrorimage stereoisomer a nonsuperimposable set of two molecules that are mirror images of one another the existence of these molecules are determined by a
