their importance from the energy they carry mainly in a form of potential energy since potential energy can be widely affected due to changes in atomic placement it is important to understand the concept of an isomer a molecule sharing the same atomic connectivity as another but differing in structural arrangements this section is devoted to a specific type of isomer called stereoisomers and their property of chirality figure figure two enantiomers of a tetrahedral complex from wikipedia the concepts of steroisomerism and chirality command a great deal of importance in modern organic chemistry as these ideas help to explain
