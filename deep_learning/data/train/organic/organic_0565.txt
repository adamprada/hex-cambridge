are isomers because their atoms are different from others in terms of spatial arrangement spatial arrangement first and foremost one must understand the concept of spatial arrangement in order to understand stereoisomerism and chirality spatial arrangement of atoms concern how different atomic particles and molecules are situated about in the space around the organic compound namely its carbon chain in this sense spatial arrangement of an organic molecule are different another if an atom is shifted in any threedimensional direction by even one degree this opens up a very broad possibility of different molecules each with their unique placement of
