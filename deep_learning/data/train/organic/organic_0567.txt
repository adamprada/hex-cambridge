reality if one were to create a plane that runs through the other two atoms they will be able to create what is known as bisecting plane the images on either side of the plan is the same as the other figure figure in this case the molecule is considered achiral in other words to distinguish chiral molecule from an achiral molecule one must search for the existence of the bisecting plane in a molecule all chiral molecules are deprive of bisecting plane whether simple or complex as a universal rule no molecule with different surrounding atoms are achiral chirality
