spatial orientation of ring substituents to relatively few arrangements consequently reactions conducted on such substrates often provide us with information about the preferred orientation of reactant species in the transition state stereoisomers are particularly suitable in this respect so the results shown here contain important information about the e transition state the most sensible interpretation of the elimination reactions of and substituted halocyclohexanes is that this reaction prefers an anti orientation of the halogen and the betahydrogen which is attacked by the base these anti orientations are colored in red in the above equations the compounds used here all have
