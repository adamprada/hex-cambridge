alkene actually a racemic mixture this reflects the fixed anti orientation of these hydrogens to the chlorine atom to assume a conformation having an axial bromine the transisomer must tolerate serious crowding distortions such conformers are therefore present in extremely low concentration and the rate of elimination is very slow indeed substitution by hydroxide anion predominates a similar analysis of the chloromethylcyclohexane isomers explains both the rate and regioselectivity differences both the chlorine and methyl groups may assume an equatorial orientation in a chair conformation of the transisomer as shown in the top equation the axial chlorine needed for the
