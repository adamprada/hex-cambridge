the sn mechanism in this drawing the α and β carbon atoms are undergoing a rehybridization from sp to sp and the developing πbond is drawn as dashed light blue lines the symbol r represents an alkyl group or hydrogen since both the base and the alkyl halide are present in this transition state the reaction is bimolecular and should exhibit second order kinetics we should note in passing that a syntransition state would also provide good orbital overlap for elimination and in some cases where an antiorientation is prohibited by structural constraints synelimination has been observed alkyl halide chains
