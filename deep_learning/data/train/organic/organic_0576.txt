in the example below for glyceraldehyde converting between perspective and fischer formulas it can be useful to convert between perspective formulas and fischer projections below is one approach using rlactic acid as an example step hold the molecule so that a the chiral center is on the plane of the paper b two bonds are coming out of the plane of the paper and are on a horizontal plane c the two remaining bonds are going into the plane of the paper and are on a vertical plane step push the two bonds coming out of the plane of the
