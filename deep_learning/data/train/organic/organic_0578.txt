of electrons around an atom in a molecule formal charge is assigned to an atom in a molecule by assuming that electrons in all chemical bonds are shared equally between atoms regardless of relative electronegativity to calculate formal charges we assign electrons in the molecule to individual atoms according to these rules nonbonding electrons are assigned to the atom on which they are located bonding electrons are divided equally between the two bonded atoms so one electron from each bond goes to each atom the formal charge of each atom in a molecule can be calculated using the following equation
