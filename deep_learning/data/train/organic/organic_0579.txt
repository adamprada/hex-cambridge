has no nonbonding electrons and one bond using equation to calculate the formal charge on hydrogen we obtain formal charge of h valence e lone pair e x bond pair e the sum of the formal charges of each atom must be equal to the overall charge of the molecule or ion in this example the nitrogen and each hydrogen has a formal charge of zero when summed the overall charge is zero which is consistent with the overall neutral charge of the nh molecule typically the structure with the most formal charges of zero on atoms is the more
