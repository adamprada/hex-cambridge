nonbonding electrons associated with each atom and then use equation to calculate the formal charge on each atom solution the lewis electron structure for the nh ion is as follows the nitrogen atom in ammonium has zero nonbonding electrons and bonds using equation the formal charge on the nitrogen atom is therefore formal charge of n valence e lone pair e x bond pair e formalchargen each hydrogen atom in has one bond and zero nonbonding electrons the formal charge on each hydrogen atom is therefore formal charge of h valence e lone pair e x bond pair e formalchargeh
