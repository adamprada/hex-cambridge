with small structures but this method becomes unreasonably timeconsuming when dealing with larger structures it would be exceptionally tedious to determine the formal charges on each atom in deoxycytidine one of the four nucleoside building blocks that make up dna using equation as you get more experience with organic structures you will be able to quickly look at this type of complicated structure and determine charges on each atom you need to develop the ability to quickly and efficiently draw large structures and determine formal charges fortunately this only requires some practice with recognizing common bonding patterns organic chemistry only
