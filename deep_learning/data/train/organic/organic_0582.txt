methanol ethane ethene and ethyne there are four bonds to the carbon atom and each carbon atom has a formal charge of zero in other words carbon is tetravalent meaning that it commonly forms four bonds carbon is tetravalent in most organic molecules but there are exceptions later in this chapter and throughout this book are examples of organic ions called carbocations and carbanions in which a carbon atom has a positive or negative formal charge respectively carbocations occur when a carbon has only three bonds and no lone pairs of electrons carbocations have only valence electrons and a formal
