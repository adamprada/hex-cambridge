such because they are too reactive to be present in that form in aqueous solution nonetheless the idea of a proton will be very important when we discuss acidbase chemistry and the idea of a hydride ion will become very important much later in the book when we discuss organic oxidation and reduction reactions as a rule though all hydrogen atoms in organic molecules have one bond and no formal charge oxygen the common arrangement of oxygen that has a formal charge of zero is when the oxygen atom has bonds and lone pairs other arrangements are oxygen with bond
