an oxygen atom has one bond two lone pairs and one unpaired free radical electron giving it a formal charge of zero for now however concentrate on the three main nonradical examples as these will account for most oxygen containing molecules you will encounter in organic chemistry nitrogen nitrogen has two major bonding patterns both of which fulfill the octet rule if a nitrogen has three bonds and a lone pair it has a formal charge of zero if it has four bonds and no lone pair it has a formal charge of in a fairly uncommon bonding pattern negatively
