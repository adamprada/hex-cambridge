their valence shell as well as s and p orbitals and thus are not bound by the octet rule halogens the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are very important in laboratory and medicinal organic chemistry but less common in naturally occurring organic molecules halogens in organic compounds usually are seen with one bond three lone pairs and a formal charge of zero sometimes especially in the case of bromine we will encounter reactive species in which the halogen has two bonds usually in a threemembered ring two lone pairs and a formal charge of these rules if learned and
