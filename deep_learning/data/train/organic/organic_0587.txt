drawing the lewis structure of ionic molecular compounds the hydroxide ion oh is drawn simply by showing the oxygen atom with its six valence electrons then adding one more electron to account for the negative charge by changing the number of valence electrons the bonding characteristic of oxygen are now changed now the oxygen has three nonbonding lone pairs and can only form one bond to a hydrogen to draw a lewis structure of the hydronium ion ho you again start with the oxygen atom with its six valence electrons then take one away to account for the positive charge
