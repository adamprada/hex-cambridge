of valence electrons placing one electron pair between the c and each o gives oco with electrons left over dividing the remaining electrons between the o atoms gives three lone pairs on each atom this structure has an octet of electrons around each o atom but only electrons around the c atom no electrons are left for the central atom to give the carbon atom an octet of electrons we can convert two of the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms to bonding electron pairs there are however two ways to do this we can either take one electron pair
