structure observed experimentally remember though that formal charges do not represent the actual charges on atoms in a molecule or ion they are used simply as a bookkeeping method for predicting the most stable lewis structure for a compound note the lewis structure with the set of formal charges closest to zero is usually the most stable example the thiocyanate ion scn which is used in printing and as a corrosion inhibitor against acidic gases has at least two possible lewis electron structures draw two possible structures assign formal charges on all atoms in both and decide which is the
