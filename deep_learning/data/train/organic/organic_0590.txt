that the carbon atom in each of these structures shares four bonding pairs the number of bonds typical for carbon so it has a formal charge of zero continuing with sulfur we observe that in a the sulfur atom shares one bonding pair and has three lone pairs and has a total of six valence electrons the formal charge on the sulfur atom is therefore in b the sulfur atom has a formal charge of in c the sulfur atom has a formal charge of continuing with the nitrogen we observe that in a the nitrogen atom shares three bonding
