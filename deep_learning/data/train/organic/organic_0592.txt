charged intermediates attract nucleophiles to give addition productsthe electrophilic character of the halogens is well known fluorine adds uncontrollably with alkenes and the addition of iodine is unfavorable so these are not useful preparative methods chlorine cl and bromine br react selectively with the double bond of alkenes so we will focus on these reactions the addition of chlorine and bromine to alkenes as shown below produces vicinal dihalocompounds in this reaction we can assume that the solvent was something that is not nucleophilic such as tetrahydrofuran thf rccr x rcxcrx if this same reaction is performed in a nucleophilic
