is the halogen chcch hobr chcohchbr chcch chscl chcclchsch mechanisms explain the regioselectivity xho or xroh the regioselectivity of halohydrin formation from an alkene reaction with a halogen in a nucleophilic solvent is analogous to the oxymercurationdemercuration pathway the halogen molecule takes the role of electrophile accepting nucleophilic pi electrons from the alkene while simultaneously forming a bond with the other vinyl carbon to create a bromonium or chloroium ion the bromonium or chloronium ion formation stabilizes the positive charge and prevents carbocation rearrangement the solvent takes the role of the nucleophile because it is present is a much greater
