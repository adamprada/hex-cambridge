or rscl the regioselectivity of the hypohalous acids and sulfenyl chloride reactions may be explained by the same mechanism we used to rationalize the markovnikov rule bonding of an electrophilic species to the double bond of an alkene forms preferentially to produce the more stable more highly substituted carbocation this intermediate should then combine rapidly with a nucleophilic species to produce the addition product to apply this mechanism we need to determine the electrophilic moiety in each of the reagents by using electronegativity differences we can dissect common addition reagents into electrophilic and nucleophilic moieties as shown on the right
