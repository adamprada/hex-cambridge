carry over in the naming of individual compounds incorporating the groups as we progress in our study of organic chemistry it will become extremely important to be able to quickly recognize the most common functional groups because they are the key structural elements that define how organic molecules react for now we will only worry about drawing and recognizing each functional group as depicted by lewis and line structures much of the remainder of your study of organic chemistry will be taken up with learning about how the different functional groups tend to behave in organic reactions drawing abbreviated organic
