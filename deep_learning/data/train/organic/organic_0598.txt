the common functional groups found in organic chemistry will be described tables of these functional groups can be found at the bottom of the page hydrocarbons the simplest functional group in organic chemistry which is often ignored when listing functional groups is called an alkane characterized by single bonds between two carbons and between carbon and hydrogen some examples of alkanes include methane ch is the natural gas you may burn in your furnace or on a stove octane ch is a component of gasoline alkanes alkenes sometimes called olefins have carboncarbon double bonds and alkynes have carboncarbon triple bonds
