geometric forms cis or trans or z and e which will be explained in detail in chapter the cis and trans forms of a given alkene are different molecules with different physical properties there is a very high energy barrier to rotation about a double bond in the example below the difference between cis and trans alkenes is readily apparent alkanes alkenes and alkynes are all classified as hydrocarbons because they are composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms alkanes are said to be saturated hydrocarbons because the carbons are bonded to the maximum possible number of hydrogens in other
