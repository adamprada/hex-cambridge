of a phosphate and in an acid chloride the carbonyl carbon is bonded to a chlorine nitriles and imines in a nitrile group a carbon is triplebonded to a nitrogen nitriles are also often referred to as cyano groups molecules with carbonnitrogen double bonds are called imines or schiff bases phosphates phosphorus is a very important element in biological organic chemistry and is found as the central atom in the phosphate group many biological organic molecules contain phosphate diphosphate and triphosphate groups which are linked to a carbon atom by the phosphate ester functionality because phosphates are so abundant in
