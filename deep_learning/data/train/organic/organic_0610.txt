column in comparable amounts furthermore most gasolines and jet fuels are blends with very carefully controlled compositions that cannot vary as their original feedstocks did to make petroleum refining more profitable the less volatile lowervalue fractions are converted to more volatile highervalue mixtures that have carefully controlled formulas the first process used to accomplish this transformation is cracking in which the larger and heavier hydrocarbons in the kerosene and higherboilingpoint fractions are heated to temperatures as high as c hightemperature reactions cause the carboncarbon bonds to break which converts the compounds to lighter molecules similar to those in the gasoline
