octane rating of chemists assign octane ratings to different blends of gasoline by burning a sample of each in a test engine and comparing the observed knocking with the amount of knocking caused by specific mixtures of nheptane and isooctane for example the octane rating of a blend of isooctane and nheptane is simply the average of the octane ratings of the components weighted by the relative amounts of each in the blend converting percentages to decimals we obtain the octane rating of the mixture as shown in figure many compounds that are now available have octane ratings greater than
