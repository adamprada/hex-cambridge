they can lead to compounds in which the new bond to carbon in the alkyl group is to chlorine bromine iodine oxygen sulfur carbon nitrogen or phosphorus depending on the nature of the nucleophile used nucleophilic substitutions are especially important for alkyl halides but they should not be considered to be confined to alkyl halides many other alkyl derivatives such as alcohols ethers esters and onium ions also can undergo reactions if conditions are appropriate the scope of reactions is so broad that it is impossible to include all the various alkyl compounds and nucleophiles that react in this manner
