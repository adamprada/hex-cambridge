slightly polar bond however the solvents that best dissolve slightly polar organic compounds seldom will dissolve the common rather highly polar nucleophilic agents such as and in practice relatively polar solvents or solvent mixtures such as propanone acetone aqueous propanone ethanol aqueous dioxacyclohexane dioxane and so on provide the best compromise for reactions between alkyl compounds and saltlike nucleophilic reagents the importance of the solvent in stabilizing ions can be evaluated from the estimated thermochemistry of ionic reactions discussed in section examples of onium cations are contributors and attributions john d robert and marjorie c caserio basic principles of organic
