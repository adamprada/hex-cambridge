for an industrial process one way of visualizing the problems involved is with energy diagrams which show the energy in terms of some arbitrary reaction coordinate that is a measure of progress between the initial and final states figure diagrams such as figure may not be familiar to you and a mechanical analogy may be helpful to provide better understanding of the very important ideas involved consider a twolevel box containing a number of tennis balls an analog to an energetically favorable reaction would be to have all of the balls figure schematic energy diagrams for reactions that are energetically
