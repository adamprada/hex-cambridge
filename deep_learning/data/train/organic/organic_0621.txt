to occurrence of the favorable process the situation here has a parallel in the left side of figure where we show an energy barrier to the spontaneous conversion of reactants to products for an energetically favorable chemical reaction now if we shake the box hard enough the balls on the upper level can acquire enough energy to bounce over the barrier and drop to the lower level the balls then can be said to acquire enough activation energy to surmount the barrier at the molecular level the activation energy must be acquired either by collisions between molecules as the result
