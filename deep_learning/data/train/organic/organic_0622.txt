between the lower and upper levels however if we shake the box vigorously and continuously no matter whether we start with all of the balls on the lower or upper level an equilibrium will be set up with on the average most of the balls in the energetically more favorable lower level but some in the upper level as well to maintain a constant average fraction of the balls at each level with vigorous and continued shaking the rate at which balls go from the upper to the lower level must be equal to the rate that they go in
