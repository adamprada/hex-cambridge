unfavorable right side of figure but as with our analogy when equilibrium is established we expect the major portion of the molecules to be in the more favorable energy state what happens when methane is mixed with chlorine no measurable reaction occurs when the gases are mixed and kept in the dark at room temperature clearly either the reaction is energetically unfavorable or the energy barrier is high the answer as to which becomes clear when the mixture is heated to temperatures in excess of or when exposed to strong violet or ultraviolet light whereby a rapid or even explosive
