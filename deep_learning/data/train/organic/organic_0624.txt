be fast we consider these and some related questions in detail because they are important questions and the answers to them are relevant in one way or another to the study of all reactions in organic chemistry a the question of the equilibrium constant presumably methane could react with chlorine to give chloromethane and hydrogen chloride or chloromethane could react with hydrogen chloride to give methane and chlorine if conditions were found for which both reactions proceeded at a finite rate equilibrium finally would be established when the rates of the reactions in each direction became equal at equilibrium the
