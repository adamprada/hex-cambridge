were less than the reaction initially would proceed faster to the left and at equilibrium there would be more methane and chlorine present than chloromethane and hydrogen chloride for methane chlorination we know from experiment that the reaction goes to the right and that is much greater than unity naturally it would be helpful in planning other organic preparations to be able to estimate in advance it is a common experience to associate chemical reactions with equilibrium constants greater than one with the evolution of heat in other words with negative values there are in fact many striking examples formation
