which is the gas constant and is the absolute temperature in degrees kelvin for our calculations we shall use as and you should not forget to convert to tables of values for formation of particular compounds at various temperatures and states from the elements are available in handbooks and the literature with these we can calculate equilibrium constants quite accurately for example handbooks give the following data which are useful for methane chlorination combining these with proper regard for sign gives and so unfortunately insufficient values for formation reactions are available to make this a widely applicable method for calculating
