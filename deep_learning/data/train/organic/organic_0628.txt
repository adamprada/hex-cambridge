for for which is is and is obviously there is something unfavorable about the entropy change from carbon and hydrogen to nonane the important thing is that there is a great difference in the constraints on the atoms on each side of the equation in particular hydrogen molecules in the gaseous state have great translational freedom and a high degree of disorder the greater part of which is lost when the hydrogen atoms become attached to a chain of carbons this makes for a large negative which corresponds to a decrease in the differences in constraints of the carbons are
