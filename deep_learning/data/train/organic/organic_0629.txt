the bonds there is an even greater loss in entropy on forming cyclohexane from ethene because substantially more freedom is lost in orienting three ethene molecules to form a ring for simple reactions with the same number of molecules on each side of the equation with no ring formation or other unusual changes in the constraints between the products and reactants usually is relatively small in general for such processes we know from experience that usually is greater than if is more negative than and usually is less than for more positive than we can use this as a rule
