prevent equilibrium from being established has many applications in organic chemistry as will be seen later when this approach is inapplicable a change in reagents is necessary thus iodine does not give a useful conversion with dimethylpropane to give iododimethylpropane because the position of equilibrium is too far to the left alternative routes with favorable values are required development of ways to make indirectly by efficient processes what cannot be made directly is one of the most interesting and challenging activities of organic chemists c why do methane and chlorine fail to react in the dark at to reach an
