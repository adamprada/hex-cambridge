collision of chlorine with methane as visualized with ballandstick models first this mechanism involves a very precisely oriented fourcenter collision between chlorine and methane that would have a low probability of occurrence ie a large decrease in entropy because a precise orientation means high molecular ordering second it requires pushing a chlorine molecule sufficiently deeply into a methane molecule so one of the chlorine atoms comes close enough to the carbon to form a bond and yield chloromethane figure graph of the potential energy of pairs of neon atoms as a function of the internuclear distance the energy values are
