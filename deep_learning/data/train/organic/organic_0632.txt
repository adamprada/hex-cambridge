cpk type section which have radii scaled to correspond to actual atomic interference radii that is the interatomic distance at the point where curves of the type of figure start to rise steeply with such models the degree of atomic compression required to bring the nonbonded atoms to within nearbonding distance is more evident than with the ballandstick models it may be noted that fourcenter reactions of the type postulated in figure are encountered only rarely if the concerted fourcenter mechanism for formation of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride from chlorine and methane is discarded all the remaining possibilities are stepwise
