involve dissociation of chlorine into chlorine atoms and the breaking of a bond of methane to give a methyl radical and a hydrogen atom the methyl radical like chlorine and hydrogen atoms has one election not involved in bonding atoms and radicals usually are highly reactive so formation of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride should proceed readily by reactions and the crux then will be whether steps and are reasonable under the reaction conditions in the absence of some external stimulus only collisions due to the usual thermal motions of the molecules can provide the energy needed to break the bonds
