which again is too much to be gained by thermal agitation therefore we can conclude that reactions can not be an important mechanism for chlorination of methane at room temperature one might ask whether dissociation into ions would provide viable mechanisms for methane chlorination part of the answer certainly is not in the vapor phase as the following thermochemical data show ionic dissociation simply does not occur at ordinarily accessible temperatures by collisions between molecules in the vapor state what is needed for formation of ions is either a highly energetic external stimulus such as bombardment with fastmoving electrons or
