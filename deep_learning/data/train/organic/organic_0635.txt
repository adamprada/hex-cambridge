or both however methane is colorless and chlorine is yellowgreen this indicates that chlorine not methane interacts with visible light a photon of nearultraviolet light such as is absorbed by chlorine gas provides more than enough energy to split the molecule into two chlorine atoms once produced a chlorine atom can remove a hydrogen atom from a methane molecule and form a methyl radical and a hydrogen chloride molecule the bonddissociation energies of and suggest that this reaction is endothermic by about the attack of a chlorine atom on a methane hydrogen is not expected to require a precisely oriented
