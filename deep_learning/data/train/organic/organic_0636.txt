molecular chlorine is expected to require somewhat more oriented collision than for a chlorine atom reacting with methane the chlorine molecule probably should be endwise not sidewise to the radical but the interatomic repulsion probably should not be much different the net result of and is formation of chloromethane and hydrogen chloride from methane and chlorine notice that the chlorine atom consumed in the first step is replaced by another one in the second step this kind of sequence of reactions is called a chain reaction because in principle one atom can induce the reaction of an infinite number of
