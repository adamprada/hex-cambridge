must occur which for methane chlorination is activation and conversion of chlorine molecules to chlorine atoms by light second chainpropagation steps convert reactants to products with no net consumption of atoms or radicals the propagation reactions occur in competition with chainterminating steps which result in destruction of atoms or radicals putting everything together we can write the chaintermination reactions are expected to be exceedingly fast because atoms and radicals have electrons in unfilled shells that normally are bonding as a result bond formation can begin as soon as the atoms or radicals approach one another closely without need for other
