concentration of is and the concentration the probability of encounters between two atoms will be proportional to and between and atoms it will be thus other things being the same propagation would be favored over termination by a factor of under favorable conditions the methanechlorination chain may go through to cycles before termination occurs by radical or atom combination consequently the efficiency or quantum yield of the reaction is very high in terms of the amount of chlorination that occurs relative to the amount of the light absorbed the overall rates of chain reactions usually are slowed very much by
