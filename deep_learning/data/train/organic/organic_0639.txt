which atoms or radicals combine can well be expected to be extremely fast because each entity has a potentially bonding electron in an outer unfilled shell and bringing these together to form a bond does not require that other bonds be broken for the reaction the methane hydrogen and carbon valence shells are filled and as approaches it can combine with a hydrogen only if a bond is broken this kind of process is associated with a barrier but is very different from a nonreactive encounter such as two neon atoms coming together see figure as and get closer together
