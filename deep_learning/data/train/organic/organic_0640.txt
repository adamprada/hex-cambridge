welldefined structure and definite thermodynamic properties the difference between the average energy of the reactants and the energy of the transition state is called the activation energy figure we expect this energy to be smaller lower barrier if a weak bond is being broken and a strong bond is being made the perceptive reader will notice that we are suggesting a parallel between reaction rate and because depends on the difference in strengths of the bonds being broken and formed yet previously section a we pointed out that the energy barrier for a reaction need bear no relationship to how
