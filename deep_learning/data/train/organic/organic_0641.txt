is very much in accord with experience for example the chlorination of methylbenzene toluene in sunlight leads to the substitution of a methyl hydrogen rather than a ring hydrogen for the reason that the methyl bonds are weaker and are attacked more rapidly than the ring bonds this can be seen explicitly in the values for the chainpropagation steps calculated from the bonddissociation energies of table methyl substitution observed ring substitution not observed the of ringhydrogen abstraction is unfavorable by because of the high bond energy thus this step is not observed it is too slow in comparison with the
