attack by two nucleophileschloride ion and bromide ionand in fact a mixture of two products both produced by anti attack is formed halogens can act as electrophiles to which can be attacked by a pi bond from an alkene pi bonds represents a region of electron density and therefore function as a nucleophiles how is it possible for a halogen to obtain positive charge to be an electrophile introduction a halogen molecule for example br approaches a double bond of the alkene electrons in the double bond repel electrons in the bromine molecule causing polarization of the halogenhalogen bond this
