either of the two carbons in the cyclic ion from the back side of the cycle as in the sn reaction therefore stereochemistry of the product is anti addition of vicinal dihalides step in the first step of the addition the brbr bond polarizes heterolytic cleavage occurs and br with the positive charge forms a cyclic intermediate with the two carbons from the alkene step in the second step bromide anion attacks either carbon of the bridged bromonium ion from the back side of the ring the ring opens up and two halogens are have anti stereochemistry halogens that are
