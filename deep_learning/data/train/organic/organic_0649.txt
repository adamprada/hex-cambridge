halohydrin from an alkene and a mixture of halogen and water predict the mechanism of the addition reaction that occurs between a given reagent and an alkene basing your prediction on mechanisms you have studied in this chapter identify the alkene the reagents or both that should be used to produce a given halohydrin by an addition reaction identify nbromosuccinimide in aqueous dimethyl sulphoxide as an alternative source of bromine for producing bromohydrins key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bromohydrin halohydrin study notes bromohydrin and chlorohydrin are examples of halohydrins
