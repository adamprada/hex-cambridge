initiates addition reactions to the double bond of alkenes lewis acids like the halogens boron hydrides and certain transition metal ions are able to bond to the alkene pielectrons and the resulting complexes rearrange or are attacked by nucleophiles to give addition productsthe electrophilic character of the halogens is well known chlorine cl and brominebr react selectively with the double bond of alkenes and these reactions are what we will focus on fluorine adds uncontrollably with alkenesand the addition of iodine is unfavorable so these are not useful preparative methods the addition of chlorine and bromine to alkenes as shown
