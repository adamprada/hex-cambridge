chcch hobr chcohchbr chcch chscl chcclchsch the regioselectivity of the above reactions may be explained by the same mechanism we used to rationalize the markovnikov rule thus bonding of an electrophilic species to the double bond of an alkene should result in preferential formation of the more stable more highly substituted carbocation and this intermediate should then combine rapidly with a nucleophilic species to produce the addition product to apply this mechanism we need to determine the electrophilic moiety in each of the reagents by using electronegativity differences we can dissect common addition reagents into electrophilic and nucleophilic moieties as
