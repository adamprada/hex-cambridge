the ions or molecules dissolved in that solvent breaking a covalent bond between two partners ab can occur either heterolytically where the shared pair of electron goes with one partner or another ab rightarrow a b or ab rightarrow a b or homolytically where one electron stays with each partner ab rightarrow a b the products of homolytic cleavage are radicals and the energy that is required to break the bond homolytically is called the bond dissociation energy bde and is a measure of the strength of the bond calculation of the bde the bde for a molecule ab is
