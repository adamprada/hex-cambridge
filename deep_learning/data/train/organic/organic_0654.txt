bond dissociation energy or enthalpy is a state function and consequently does not depend on the path by which it occurs therefore the specific mechanism in how a bond breaks or is formed does not affect the bde bond dissociation energies are useful in assessing the energetics of chemical processes for chemical reactions combining bond dissociation energies for bonds formed and bonds broken in a chemical reaction using hesss law can be used to estimate reaction enthalpies example chlorination of methane consider the chlorination of methane ch cl rightarrow chcl hcl the overall reaction thermochemistry can be calculated exactly by
