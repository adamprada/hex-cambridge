the ch bond lengths longer bonds formed with sp orbitals are consequently weaker shorter bonds formed with orbitals that have more scharacter are similarly stronger ch bdes vary with substitution among sp hybridized systems methane has the strongest ch bond ch bonds on primary carbons are stronger than those on secondary carbons which are stronger than those on tertiary carbons interpretation of ch bdes for sp hybridized carbons the interpretation of the bdes in saturated molecules has been subject of recent controversy as indicated above the variation in bdes with substitution has traditionally been interpreted as reflecting the stabilities of
