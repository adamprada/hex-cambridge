ch bonds and the coh bonds in alcohols actually increase with more substitution gronert has proposed that the variation in bdes is alternately explained as resulting from destabilization of the reactants due to steric repulsion of the substituents which is released in the nearly planar radicals considering that bdes reflect the relative energies of reactants and products either explanation can account for the trend in bdes another factor that needs to be considered is the electronegativity the pauling definition of electronegativity says that the bond dissociation energy between unequal partners is going to be dependent on the difference in electrongativities
