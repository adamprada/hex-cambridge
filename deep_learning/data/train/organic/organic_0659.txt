misleading or even useless for instance the analytical criterion is of no help with possible mixtures of isomers because these mixtures have the same elemental composition the simple physical criteria are not applicable to substances that decompose when one attempts to determine the melting point or boiling point furthermore boiling points are not very helpful for liquids that are mixtures of substances with nearly the same boiling point or are azeotropes similar difficulties may be encountered with mixtures of solid substances that form mixed crystals or are eutectics much sharper criteria for the purity of organic compounds now are provided
