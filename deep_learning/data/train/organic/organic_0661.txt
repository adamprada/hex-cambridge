while the root of the word describes the nature of that formation or decomposition so hetero meaning different reactions involve asymmetrical bond making or breaking and homo meaning same involve symmetrical processes because one pair of electrons constitutes a single bond the unsymmetrical making or breaking of that bond in a hetero processes are described as polar reactions similarly symmetrical homo processes of bond making and breaking are called radical reactions radicals sometimes referred to as free radicals are highly reactive neutral chemical species with one unpaired electron in later sections we discuss radical and polar reactions in more detail
