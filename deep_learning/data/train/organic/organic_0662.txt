a single electron the use of these symbols in bondbreaking and bondmaking reactions is illustrated below if a covalent single bond is broken so that one electron of the shared pair remains with each fragment as in the first example this bondbreaking is called homolysis if the bond breaks with both electrons of the shared pair remaining with one fragment as in the second and third examples this is called heterolysis bondbreaking bondmaking other arrow symbols chemists also use arrow symbols for other purposes and it is essential to use them correctly the reaction arrow the equilibrium arrow the resonance
