to a base or nucleophile nucleophile an atom ion or molecule that has an electron pair that may be donated in bonding to an electrophile or lewis acid using these definitions it is clear that carbocations called carbonium ions in the older literature are electrophiles and carbanions are nucleophiles carbenes have only a valence shell sextet of electrons and are therefore electron deficient in this sense they are electrophiles but the nonbonding electron pair also gives carbenes nucleophilic character as a rule the electrophilic character dominates carbene reactivity carbon radicals have only seven valence electrons and may be considered electron
