assumed by these intermediates becomes important when considering the stereochemistry of reactions in which they play a role a simple tetravalent compound like methane ch has a tetrahedral configuration carbocations have only three bonds to the charge bearing carbon so it adopts a planar trigonal configuration carbanions are pyramidal in shape tetrahedral if the electron pair is viewed as a substituent but these species invert rapidly at room temperature passing through a higher energy planar form in which the electron pair occupies a porbital radicals are intermediate in configuration the energy difference between pyramidal and planar forms being very small
