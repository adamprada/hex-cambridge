is an acidbase equilibrium in which hcl protonates the oxygen atom of the alcohol the resulting conjugate acid then loses water in a second step to give a carbocation intermediate finally this electrophile combines with the chloride anion nucleophile to give the final product the addition reaction shown on the left can be viewed as taking place in two steps the first step can again be considered an acidbase equilibrium with the pielectrons of the carboncarbon double bond functioning as a base the resulting conjugate acid is a carbocation and this electrophile combines with the nucleophilic bromide anion the elimination
