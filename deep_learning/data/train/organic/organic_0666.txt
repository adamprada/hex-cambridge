atom colored red here and a differently located double bond the equilibrium between tautomers is not only rapid under normal conditions but it often strongly favors one of the isomers acetone for example is keto tautomer even in such onesided equilibria evidence for the presence of the minor tautomer comes from the chemical behavior of the compound tautomeric equilibria are catalyzed by traces of acids or bases that are generally present in most chemical samples contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state university william reusch professor emeritus michigan state u
