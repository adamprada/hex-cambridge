orbitals overlap allowing the two electrons to form a pair within the two overlapping orbitals these two electrons are now attracted to the positive charge of both of the hydrogen nuclei with the result that they serve as a sort of chemical glue holding the two nuclei together bonding in methane now lets turn to methane the simplest organic molecule recall the valence electron configuration of the central carbon this picture however is problematic how does the carbon form four bonds if it has only two halffilled p orbitals available for bonding a hint comes from the experimental observation that
