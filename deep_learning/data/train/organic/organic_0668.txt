the carbon occupies a single sp orbital the sp hybrid orbitals like the p orbitals of which they are partially composed are oblong in shape and have two lobes of opposite sign unlike the p orbitals however the two lobes are of very different size the larger lobes of the sp hybrids are directed towards the four corners of a tetrahedron meaning that the angle between any two orbitals is o this geometric arrangement makes perfect sense if you consider that it is precisely this angle that allows the four orbitals and the electrons in them to be as far
