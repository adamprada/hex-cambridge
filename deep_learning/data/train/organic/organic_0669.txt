previously we drew a lewis structure of methane in two dimensions using lines to denote each covalent bond we can now draw a more accurate structure in three dimensions showing the tetrahedral bonding geometry to do this on a twodimensional page though we need to introduce a new drawing convention the solid dashed wedge system in this convention a solid wedge simply represents a bond that is meant to be pictured emerging from the plane of the page a dashed wedge represents a bond that is meant to be pictured pointing into or behind the plane of the page normal
