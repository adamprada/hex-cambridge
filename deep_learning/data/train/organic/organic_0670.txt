bonding in chloroform chcl solutions the bonding arrangement here is also tetrahedral the three nh bonds of ammonia can be pictured as forming the base of a trigonal pyramid with the fourth orbital containing the lone pair forming the top of the pyramid recall from your study of vsepr theory in general chemistry that the lone pair with its slightly greater repulsive effect pushes the three nh sbonds away from the top of the pyramid meaning that the hnh bond angles are slightly less than tetrahedral at rather than vsepr theory also predicts accurately that a water molecule is bent
