effect of distorting this porbital angle to both the hybrid orbital and the nonhybrid orbital models present reasonable explanations for the observed bonding arrangement in water so we will not concern ourselves any further with the distinction exercise draw in the same style as the figures above an orbital picture for the bonding in methylamine solution formation of bonds and hybridization the valence bond theory along with the hybrid orbital concept does a very good job of describing doublebonded compounds such as ethene three experimentally observable characteristics of the ethene molecule need to be accounted for by a bonding model
