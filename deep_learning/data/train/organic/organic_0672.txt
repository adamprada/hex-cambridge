orbital unhybridized the three sp hybrids are arranged with trigonal planar geometry pointing to the three corners of an equilateral triangle with angles of between them the unhybridized pz orbital is perpendicular to this plane in the next several figures sp orbitals and the sigma bonds to which they contribute are represented by lines and wedges only the pz orbitals are shown in the spacefilling mode the carboncarbon double bond in ethene consists of one sbond formed by the overlap of two sp orbitals and a second bond calleda Ï€ pi bond which is formed by the sidebyside overlap of
