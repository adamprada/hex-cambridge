atoms of the group form a single plane conversely sbonds such as the carboncarbon single bond in ethane chch exhibit free rotation and can assume many different conformations or shapes this is one of the main subjects of chapter exercise circle the six atoms in the molecule below that are locked into the same plane exercise what kinds of orbitals are overlapping in bonds ad indicated below exercise what is wrong with the way the following structure is drawn solutions a similar picture can be drawn for the bonding in carbonyl groups such as formaldehyde in this molecule the carbon
