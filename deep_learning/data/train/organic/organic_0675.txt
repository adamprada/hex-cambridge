after hybridization these five electrons are placed in the four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals the electron configuration of nitrogen now has one sp hybrid orbital completely filled with two electrons and three sp hybrid orbitals with one unpaired electron each the two electrons in the filled sp hybrid orbital are considered nonbonding because they are already paired these electrons will be represented as a lone pair on the structure of nh the three unpaired electrons in the hybrid orbitals are considered bonding and will overlap with the s orbitals in hydrogen to form nh sigma bonds note this bonding configuration
