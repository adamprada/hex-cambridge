hybridized orbital from carbon to form the cn sigma bond the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen are contained in the last sp hybridized orbital due to the sp hybridization the nitrogen has a tetrahedral geometry however the hnh and hnc bonds angles are less than the typical o due to compression by the lone pair electrons oxygen bonding in ho the oxygen in ho has six valence electrons after hybridization these six electrons are placed in the four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals the electron configuration of oxygen now has two sp hybrid orbitals completely filled with two electrons and
