sposh orbital overlap the two remaining sp hybrid orbitals each contain two electrons in the form of a lone pair methanol the oxygen is sp hybridized which means that it has four sp hybrid orbitals one of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with s orbitals from a hydrogen to form the oh sigma bonds one of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with an sp hybridized orbital from carbon to form the co sigma bond both the sets of lone pair electrons on the oxygen are contained in the remaining sp hybridized orbital due to the sp hybridization the oxygen has
