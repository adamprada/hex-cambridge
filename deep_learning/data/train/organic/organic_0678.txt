the opo bond angle varies from to o methyl phosphate an organophosphate sulfur methanethiol dimethyl sulfide sulfur has a bonding pattern similar to oxygen because they are both in period of the periodic table because sulfur is positioned in the third row of the periodic table it has the ability to form an expanded octet and the ability to form more than the typical number of covalent bonds in biological system sulfur is typically found in molecules called thiols or sulfides in a thiol the sulfur atom is bonded to one hydrogen and one carbon and is analogous to an
