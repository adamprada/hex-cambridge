double bond electrophilic hydration is the reverse of dehydration of alcohols and so begins the circular nature of organic chemistry alcohols can be dehydrated to form alkenes and alkenes can undergo electrophilic addition reactions to form alcohols electrophilic hydrogen is essentially a proton a hydrogen atom stripped of its electrons electrophilic hydrogen is commonly used to help break double bonds or restore catalysts electrophilic hydration of alkenes has practical applications in making alcohols for fuels and reagents for other reactions the basic reaction under certain temperatures given below is the following in later sections we will learn that mercury ii
