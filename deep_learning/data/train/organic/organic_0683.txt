available to help out by using overlap with the positive charge which creates greater carbocation stability in other words carbocations form on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond carbocations are also stabilized by resonance but resonance is not a large factor in this case because any carboncarbon double bonds are used to initiate the reaction and other double bonded molecules can cause a completely different reaction if the carbocation does originally form on the less substituted part of the alkene carbocation rearrangements occur to form more substituted products carbocation rearrangements a review hydride shifts a hydrogen atom
