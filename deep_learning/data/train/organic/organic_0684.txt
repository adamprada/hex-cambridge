the major product because the oh substitutent is attached to the more substituted carbon when the reactant undergoes hydration the proton attaches to carbon the carbocation is therefore on carbon hydride shift now occurs when the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon formally switch places with the carbocation the carbocation is now ready to be attacked by ho to furnish an alkyloxonium ion because of stability and hyperconjugation the final step can be observed by another water molecule attacking the proton on the alkyloxonium ion to furnish an alcohol we see this mechanism below alkyl shifts if no hydrogen atoms are
