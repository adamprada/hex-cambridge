or atom is going into or out of the plane of the board whenever the bond is a simple single straight line the molecule that is bonded is equally likely to be found going into the plane of the board as it is out of the plane of the board this indicates that the product is a racemic mixture there is no stereochemical control in acidcatalyzed hydration reactions the carbocation intermediate has the trigonal planar geometry of sp hybridization which allows the subsequent reaction with water from either orientation electrophilic hydration adopts a stereochemistry wherein the substituent is equally likely
