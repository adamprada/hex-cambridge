equilibrium with the alcohol product to sway the equilibrium one way or another the temperature or the concentration of the nonnucleophilic strong acid can be changed for example less sulfuric or phosphoric acid and an excess of water help synthesize more alcohol product lower temperatures help synthesize more alcohol product is there a better way to add water to synthesize an alcohol from an alkene a more efficient pathway does exist see oxymercuration demercuration a special electrophilic addition oxymercuration does not allow for rearrangements but it does require the use of mercury which is highly toxic detractions for using electrophilic
