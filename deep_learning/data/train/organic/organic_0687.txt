stereochemistry of hydroborationoutside linksreferencesexercisesquestionssolutionscontributors and attributions objectives after completing this section you should be able to identify hydroboration followed by oxidation as a method for bringing about the apparently nonmarkovnikov addition of water to an alkene write an equation for the formation of a trialkylborane from an alkene and borane write an equation for the oxidation of a trialkylborane to an alcohol draw the structure of the alcohol produced by the hydroboration and subsequent oxidation of a given alkene determine whether a given alcohol should be prepared by oxymercurationdemercuration or by hydroborationoxidation and identify the alkene and reagents required to
