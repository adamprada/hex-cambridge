in the alkene bouble bond furthermore the borane acts as a lewis acid by accepting two electrons in its empty p orbital from an alkene that is electron rich this process allows boron to have an electron octet a very interesting characteristic of this process is that it does not require any activation by a catalyst the hydroboration mechanism has the elements of both hydrogenation and electrophilic addition and it is a stereospecific syn addition meaning that the hydroboration takes place on the same face of the double bond this leads cis stereochemistry introduction hydroborationoxidation of alkenes has been a
