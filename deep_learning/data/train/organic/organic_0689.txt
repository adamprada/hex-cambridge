octetbhbh the mechanism step part hydroboration of the alkene in this first step the addittion of the borane to the alkene is initiated and prceeds as a concerted reaction because bond breaking and bond formation occurs at the same time this part consists of the vacant p orbital of the boron electrophile pairing with the electron pair of the bondof the nucleophile transition state note that a carbocation is not formed therefore no rearrangement takes place part the anti markovnikov addition of boron the boron adds to the less substituted carbon of the alkene which then places the hydrogen on
