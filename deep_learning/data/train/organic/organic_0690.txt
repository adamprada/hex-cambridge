in the removal of a hydroxide ion two more of these reactions with hydroperoxide will occur in order give a trialkylborate part this is the final part of the oxidation process in this part the trialkylborate reacts with aqueous naoh to give the alcohol and sodium borate if you need additional visuals to aid you in understanding the mechanism click on the outside links provided here that will take you to other pages and media that are very helpful as well stereochemistry of hydroboration the hydroboration reaction is among the few simple addition reactions that proceed cleanly in a syn
