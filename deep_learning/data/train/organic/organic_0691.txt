with retention of configuration so the overall addition of water is also syn the hydroboration of Î±pinene also provides a nice example of steric hindrance control in a chemical reaction in the less complex alkenes used in earlier examples the plane of the double bond was often a plane of symmetry and addition reagents could approach with equal ease from either side in this case one of the methyl groups bonded to c colored blue in the equation covers one face of the double bond blocking any approach from that side all reagents that add to this double bond must
