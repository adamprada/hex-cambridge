less than ºc tertiary alcohol less than ºc butwhy does electrophilic hydration work an alkene placed in an aqueous nonnucleophilic strong acid immediately reaches out with its double bond and attacks one of the acids hydrogen atoms meanwhile the bond between oxygen and hydrogen performs heterolytic cleavage toward the oxygenin other words both electrons from the oxygenhydrogen single bond move onto the oxygen atom a carbocation is formed on the original alkene now alkane in the moresubstituted position where the oxygen end of water attacks with its nonbonded valence electrons oxygen has total valence electrons because it is found in
