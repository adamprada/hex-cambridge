hydrogen now that the reaction is complete the nonnucleophilic strong acid is regenerated as a catalyst and an alcohol forms on the most substituted carbon of the current alkane at lower temperatures more alcohol product can be formed what is regiochemistry and how does it apply regiochemistry deals with where the substituent bonds on the product zaitsevs and markovnikovs rules address regiochemistry but zaitsevs rule applies when synthesizing an alkene while markovnikovs rule describes where the substituent bonds onto the product in the case of electrophilic hydration markovnikovs rule is the only rule that directly applies see the following for
