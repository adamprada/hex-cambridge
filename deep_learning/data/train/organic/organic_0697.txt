creates greater carbocation stability in other words carbocations form on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond carbocations are also stabilized by resonance but resonance is not a large factor in this case because any carboncarbon double bonds are used to initiate the reaction and other double bonded molecules can cause a completely different reaction if the carbocation does originally form on the less substituted part of the alkene carbocation rearrangements occur to form more substituted products hydride shifts a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom next to the carbocation leaves that carbon to bond with the
