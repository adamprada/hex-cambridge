due to stabilization of the reactive intermediate similar stabilization is also seen in bromination addition to alkenes introduction carbocation rearrangement is a process in which the carbocation intermediate can form a more stable ion with carbocation rearrangement the reaction would not be able to hydrate quickly under mild conditions and be produced in high yields this reaction is very fast and proceeds with yield this reaction involves a mercury acting as a reagent attacking the alkene double bond to form a mercurinium ion bridge a water molecule will then attack the most substituted carbon to open the mercurium ion bridge
