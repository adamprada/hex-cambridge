reaction it is unlikely that the ยบ carbon will remain as such a hydride shift actually occurs from the carbon of the methylcyclopentene to where the carbocation had formed this reaction will have poor yields due to a very unstable intermediate for a brief moment carbocations can form on the two center carbons which are more stable than the outer two carbons the carbocations have an sp hybridization and when the water is added on the carbons change their hybridization to sp this makes the methyl and alcohol groups equally likely to be found going into or out of the
