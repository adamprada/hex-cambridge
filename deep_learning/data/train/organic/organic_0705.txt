and nucleic acids it is important to note that tautomerism is not restricted to ketoenol systems other examples include imineenamine tautomerism and nitrosooxime tautomerism however at the moment you need only concern yourself with ketoenol tautomerism notice how hydroboration complements hydration in the chemistry of both alkenes and alkynes reaction hydration of alkynes as with alkeneshydration addition of water to alkynes requires a strong acid usually sulfuric acid and is facilitated by mercuric sulfate however unlike the additions to double bonds which give alcohol products addition of water to alkynes gives ketone products except for acetylene which yields acetaldehyde the
