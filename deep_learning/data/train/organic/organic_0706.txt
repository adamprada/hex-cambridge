keto tautomer even in such onesided equilibria evidence for the presence of the minor tautomer comes from the chemical behavior of the compound tautomeric equilibria are catalyzed by traces of acids or bases that are generally present in most chemical samples the three examples shown below illustrate these reactions for different substitutions of the triplebond the tautomerization step is indicated by a red arrow for terminal alkynes the addition of water follows the markovnikov rule as in the second example below and the final product ia a methyl ketone except for acetylene shown in the first example for internal alkynes
