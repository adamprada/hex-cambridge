electrons of the triple bond acts as a lewis base and attacks the proton therefore protinating the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents the second step is the attack of the nucleophilic water molecule on the electrophilic carbocation which creates an oxonium ion next you deprotonate by a base generating an alcohol called an enol which then tautomerizes into a ketone tautomerism is a simultaneous proton and double bond shift which goes from the enol form to the keto isomer form as shown above in figure now lets look at some hydration reactions hydration of terminal alkyne produces methyl ketones
