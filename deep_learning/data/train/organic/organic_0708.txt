coming in and deprotinating the molecule once deprotinated you have an enol which then gets tautomerized tautomerism is shown here when the proton gets attacked by the double bond Ï€ electrons forming a covalent bond between the carbon and the hydrogen on the less substituted carbon electrons from the oxygen end up moving to the carbon forming a double bond with carbon and giving itself a positive charge which then gets attacked by the base the base deprotinates the oxygen resulting in the more stable final product at equilibrium which is a ketone exercise draw the structure of the product
