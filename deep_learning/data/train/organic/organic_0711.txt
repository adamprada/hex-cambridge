atom colored red here and a differently located double bond the equilibrium between tautomers is not only rapid under normal conditions but it often strongly favors one of the isomers acetone for example is keto tautomer even in such onesided equilibria evidence for the presence of the minor tautomer comes from the chemical behavior of the compound tautomeric equilibria are catalyzed by traces of acids or bases that are generally present in most chemical samples the three examples shown below illustrate these reactions for different substitutions of the triplebond the tautomerization step is indicated by a red arrow for terminal
