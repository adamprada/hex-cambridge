rule a useful functional group conversion for multiple step syntheses is to hydrate terminal alkynes to produce methyl ketones hydration of alkyne mechanism the first step is an acidbase reaction where the Ï€ electrons of the triple bond acts as a lewis base and reacts with the proton therefore protonating the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents as expected by markovnikovs rule in the second step the nucleophilic water molecule reacts with the electrophilic carbocation to produce an oxonium ion the oxonium ion is deprotonated by a base to produce an enol which immediately tautomerizes into a ketone the hydration
