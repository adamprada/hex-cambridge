rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached the general formula for a cyclic hydrocarbon containing one ring is cnhn as shown in cyclohexane ch below akenes contain at least one carboncarbon double bond and alkynes contain at least one carboncarbon triple bond alkenes have the general formula cnhn alkynes have the general formula cnhn the ratio of carbon to hydrogen increased because hydrogen atoms are replaced with pi bonds as shown in transbutene ch and butyne ch below since both double and triple bonds include pi bonds alkenes and alkynes share similar chemical reactivity aromatic hydrocarbons also known as arenes
