it easier to figure out the molecular structure degree of unsaturation du can be calculated with the equation below and the molecular formula du cnxh where c is the number of carbons n is the number of nitrogens x is the number of halogens f cl br i and h is the number of hydrogens from the molecular formula as stated before a saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane thus the number of hydrogens
