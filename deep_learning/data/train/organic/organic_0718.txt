chloroethane chcl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane ch for a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present therefore we add the number of nitrogens n this can be seen with chn compared to ch oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements as seen in alcohols the same number of hydrogens in ethanol choh matches the number of hydrogens in ethane ch the following chart illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for
