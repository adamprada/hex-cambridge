is the degree of unsaturation for benzene solution thinking it through the molecular formula for benzene is ch thus du where c nx and h du can equal ring or double bond this corresponds to benzene containing ring and double bonds even though there are other possible structures with a du like the ones shown below we will learn the benzene rings have unusual stability and occur frequently in the world of organic chemistry when the du for a compound is we can assume the presence of at least one benzene ring exercise are the following molecules saturated or unsaturated
