triple bonds andor rings however you can also determine the molecular formula and solve for the degrees of unsaturation by using the formula a b one double bond and the double bond from the carbonyl c d use the formula to solve a b c d a saturated b unsaturated c unsaturated d unsaturated a remembera saturated molecule only contains single bonds b the molecule can contain any of these combinations i double bonds ii rings iii double bonds rings iv double bond rings v double bonds ring vi triple bond rings vii triple bonds viii triple bond double bond
