kim contributors and attributions learning objective classify hydrocarbons as saturated or unsaturated classify hydrocarbons as alkanes alkenes alkynes cycloalkanes or aromatics arenes apply the homologous series to organic molecules with carbons hydrocarbon classifications hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen the inherent ability of hydrocarbons to bond to themselves is known as catenation and allows hydrocarbon to form more complex molecules such as cyclohexane and benzene catenation comes from the fact that the bond character between carbon atoms is entirely nonpolar the four general classes of hydrocarbons are alkanes alkenes alkynes and arenes aromatic compounds derive their
