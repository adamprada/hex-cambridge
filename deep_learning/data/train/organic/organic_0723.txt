formulas for hydrocarbons containing six carbon atoms the saturated alkane has the highest ratio of hydrogen to carbon the unsaturated alkene and the six membered alkane ring share the same chemical formula it is important to remember this relationship the unsaturated alkyne has a lower ratio of hydrogen to carbon than alkenes with a second pi bond benzene rings have the lowest hydrogen ratio to carbon at exercise classify the following compounds are saturated or unsaturated for unsaturated hydrocarbons refine the classification by indicating whether the compound is an alkene alkyne or arene answer the number of carbons continuously bonded
