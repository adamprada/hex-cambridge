possible following is a qualitative description of the nature of some of the hydrogen atomic orbitals the most stable or ground state of a hydrogen atom is designated in the state the electron is on the average closest to the nucleus ie it is the state with the smallest atomic orbital the orbital is spherically symmetrical this means that the probability of finding the electron at a given distance from the nucleus is independent of the direction from the nucleus we shall represent the orbital as a sphere centered on the nucleus with a radius such that the probability of
