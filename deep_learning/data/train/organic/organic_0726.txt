it has a higher energy for principal quantum number there are also three orbitals of equal energies called orbitals which have different geometry than the orbitals these are shown in figure figure representation of the hydrogen orbital in which we see that the respective axes passing through the tangent spheres of the three orbitals lie at right angles to one another the orbitals are not spherically symmetrical the and states are similar to the and states but are of higher energy the orbitals have still higher energies and quite different geometries they are not important for bonding in most organic
