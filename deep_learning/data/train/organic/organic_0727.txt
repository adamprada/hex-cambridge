electron can have only one of two possible orientations of electron spin as may be symbolized by and two electrons with paired spins often are represented as such a pair of electrons can occupy a single orbital the symbols or represent two unpaired electrons which may not go into a single orbital if we assume that all atomic nuclei have orbitals like those of the hydrogen atom we can see how atoms more complex than hydrogen can be built up by adding electrons to the orbitals in accord with the pauli exclusion principle the lowestenergy states will be those in
