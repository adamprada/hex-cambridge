that electrons come closer together now suppose there are two electrons that can go into two different orbitals of the same energy socalled degenerate orbitals hunds rule tells us that the repulsion energy between these electrons will be less if they have unpaired spins why is this so because if they have unpaired figure diagram showing the most stable electronic configuration of a carbon atom addition of more electrons in accord with hunds rule gives the electronic configuration of the other atoms indicated by the atomic symbols spins they cannot be in the same orbital at the same time therefore
