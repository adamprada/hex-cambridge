in which the electrons must be paired according to the exclusion principle continuing in this way we can derive the electronic configurations for the elements in the first three rows of the periodic table as shown in table these configurations conform to the principle that an orbital can accommodate a maximum ot two paired electrons and a set of three orbitals a maximum of six paired electrons the first electronic configuration should conform to hunds rule as shown by the example of carbon in figure the index number refers to the principal quantum number and corresponds to the shell designation
