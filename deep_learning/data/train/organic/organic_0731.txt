polypropylene molded articles eg kitchenware fibres for indooroutdoor carpeting catalytic cracking to form ethylene cracking is the name given to breaking up large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller and more useful bits this is achieved by using high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst the source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum these fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking the hydrocarbons are mixed with a
