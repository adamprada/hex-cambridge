are broken up in a fairly random way to produce mixtures of smaller hydrocarbons some of which have carboncarbon double bonds one possible reaction involving the hydrocarbon ch might be or showing more clearly what happens to the various atoms and bonds this is only one way in which this particular molecule might break up the ethene and propene are important materials for making plastics or producing other organic chemicals you will remember that during the polymeriation of ethene thousands of ethene molecules join together to make polyethene commonly called polythene the reaction is done at high pressures in the
