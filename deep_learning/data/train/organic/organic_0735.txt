molecule with atoms will have modes of vibration of which are stretching vibrations and are bending vibrations there are circumstances however where fewer vibrational modes are possible if the molecule is linear like then there are possible vibrations and some of these vibrations may be equivalent degenerate vibrations in the language of spectroscopists for example should have or vibrational modes two of which are stretching and two of which are bending modes however the two bending modes are equivalent because the direction in which the molecule bends is immaterial inplane or outofplane bending are the same diatomic molecules such as
