spectra are shown in figure for propanone acetone and butanone methyl ethyl ketone in accord with current practice the position of absorption horizontal scale is recorded in units of wave numbers see section the vertical scale measures the intensity of radiation transmitted through the sample zero transmission means complete absorption of radiation by the sample as at in figure the other absorption bands in figure that correspond to excitation of stretching or bending vibrations are not as intense as the absorption at figure infrared absorption spectra of a propanone and b butanone in the vapor phase b characteristic stretching vibrations
