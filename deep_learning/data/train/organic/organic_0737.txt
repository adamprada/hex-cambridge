state or lowest vibrational energy level of a bond and the first excited vibrational energy level for stretching of that bond the band at corresponds to the infrared absorption that causes transitions between vibrational energy levels of the bond the reason that these are transitions from the vibrational ground state is because at room temperature by far the largest portion of the molecules are in this state cf exercise stretching frequencies characteristic of the most important types of bonds found in organic molecules are given in table you will notice that the absorption band for each bond type is described
