that the heavier the bonded atoms the smaller will be the vibrational frequency of the bond provided remains essentially constant thus if we increase while holding and constant we expect the frequency to decrease this is just what occurs when we change the bond to a bond we also see that the frequency decreases in the order which also is in the order of increasing but here matters are more complicated because also changes other things being equal it requires more energy to stretch a bond than to bend it therefore the infrared bands arising from changes in the stretching
