is particularly important thus the absorption frequency of a bond depends on whether it is an alkyl alkenyl alkynyl or aryl bond see table the intensity of an infrared absorption band arising from changes in the vibrational energy is related to the electrical symmetry of the bond more symmetrical less polarized bonds give weaker absorptions in fact if the bond is completely symmetrical there is no infrared absorption in contrast unsymmetrical molecules in which the bonds are quite polarized such as bonds show strong infrared absorptions notice in figure that infrared spectra of organic molecules do not show very sharp
