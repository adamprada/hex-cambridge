vibrationalrotational transitions of different energies table some characteristic infrared absorption frequencies absorption of infrared radiation over the range from to corresponds to energylevel differences as in figure of to c the fingerprint region infrared absorption bands between and generally are associated with complex vibrational and rotational energy changes of the molecule as a whole and are quite characteristic of particular molecules this part of the spectrum is often called the fingerprint region and is extremely useful for determining whether the samples are chemically identical the spectra of propanone and butanone are seen to be very similar in the region to
