the alkanes show clearly absorptions corresponding to the stretching frequencies at to the stretching absorptions have variable frequencies and are usually weak methyl and methylene groups normally have characteristic bending vibrations at to methyl groups also show a weaker band near two sample infrared spectra that illustrate these features are given in figure the infrared spectra of the cycloalkanes are similar to those of the alkanes except that when there are no alkyl substituents the characteristic figure infrared spectra of a octane and b trimethylpentane as pure liquids notice the stretching around and bending frequency around the bands near for
