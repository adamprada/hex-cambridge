shows the infrared spectrum of a substance for which we wish to determine the compound type and if possible the specific structure the most informative infrared absorptions for determining the compound type are between and two groups of bands in this region can be seen at about and where means strong if we used it would mean medium and would mean weak from table we can see that these bands are indicative of and hydrogenbonded of carboxylic acids the presumption is that there is a group in the molecule and we can derive some reassurance from the fact that the
