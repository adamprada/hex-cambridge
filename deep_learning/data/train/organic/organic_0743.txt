be and has two hydrogens less which indicates the presence of a double bond or a ring however table shows that a double bond should have an absorption of variable intensity at to and there is no clear sign of such an absorption in figure the alternative to a double bond would be a ring which for has to be a cyclopropyl ring the structure that is most compatible with the spectrum is final identification may be possible by comparison with an authentic spectrum of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid if it is available in one of the several standard compendia of infrared
