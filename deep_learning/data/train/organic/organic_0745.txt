and shape as tie breakers since the london dispersion forces increase as the surface area increases since all compounds exhibit some level of london dispersion forces and compounds capable of hbonding also exhibit dipoledipole we will use the phrase dominant imf to communicate the imf most responsible for the physical properties of the compound in the table below we see examples of these relationships when comparing the structural isomers of pentane pentane isopentane and neopentane they all have the same molecular formula ch however as the carbon chain is shortened to create the carbon branches found in isopentane and neopentane
