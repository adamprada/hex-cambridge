to illustrate the relative strength imfs to boiling points boiling points and melting points the observable melting and boiling points of different organic molecules provides an additional illustration of the effects of noncovalent interactions the overarching principle involved is simple the stronger the noncovalent interactions between molecules the more energy that is required in the form of heat to break them apart higher melting and boiling points signify stronger noncovalent intermolecular forces consider the boiling points of increasingly larger hydrocarbons more carbons means a greater surface area possible for hydrophobic interaction and thus higher boiling points as you would expect
