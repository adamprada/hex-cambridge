exercise based on their structures rank phenol benzene benzaldehyde and benzoic acid in terms of lowest to highest boiling point solution by thinking about noncovalent intermolecular interactions we can also predict relative melting points all of the same principles apply stronger intermolecular interactions result in a higher melting point ionic compounds as expected usually have very high melting points due to the strength of ionion interactions there are some ionic compounds however that are liquids at room temperature the presence of polar and especially hydrogenbonding groups on organic compounds generally leads to higher melting points molecular shape and the ability
