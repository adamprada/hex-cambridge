boiling point of benzene oc the key factor for the boiling point trend in this case is size toluene has one more carbon whereas for the melting point trend shape plays a much more important role this makes sense when you consider that melting involves unpacking the molecules from their ordered array whereas boiling involves simply separating them from their already loose liquid association with each other if you are taking an organic lab course you may have already learned that impurities in a crystalline substance will cause the observed melting point to be lower compared to a pure sample
