this structure to that of the membrane lipids discussed in section b interactive d image of a saturated triacylglycerol biotopics saturated vs monounsaturated fatty acid biotopics in vegetable oils the hydrophobic chains are unsaturated meaning that they contain one or more double bonds solid animal fat in contrast contains saturated hydrocarbon chains with no double bonds the double bonds in vegetable oils cause those hydrocarbon chains to be more rigid and bent at an angle remember that rotation is restricted around double bonds with the result that they dont pack together as closely and thus can be broken apart ie
