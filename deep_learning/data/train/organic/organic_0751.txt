but are more similar to solids intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the boiling points of liquids liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid similarly solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature that is they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species like covalent and ionic bonds intermolecular interactions
