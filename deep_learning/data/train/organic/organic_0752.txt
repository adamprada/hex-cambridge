already familiar with the ionion interactions that are responsible for ionic bonding and the iondipole interactions that occur when ionic substances dissolve in a polar substance such as water the first two are often described collectively as van der waals forces dipoledipole interactions polar covalent bonds behave as if the bonded atoms have localized fractional charges that are equal but opposite ie the two bonded atoms generate a dipole if the structure of a molecule is such that the individual bond dipoles do not cancel one another then the molecule has a net dipole moment molecules with net dipole moments
