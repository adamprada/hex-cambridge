dipoledipole interactions such as those in figure are attractive intermolecular interactions whereas those in figure are repulsive intermolecular interactions because molecules in a liquid move freely and continuously molecules always experience both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions simultaneously as shown in figure on average however the attractive interactions dominate figure both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions occur in a liquid sample with many molecules because each end of a dipole possesses only a fraction of the charge of an electron dipoledipole interactions are substantially weaker than the interactions between two ions each of which has a charge of at least
