by or fold thus a substance such as which is partially held together by dipoledipole interactions is a gas at room temperature and atm pressure whereas which is held together by interionic interactions is a highmeltingpoint solid within a series of compounds of similar molar mass the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases as shown in table table relationships between the dipole moment and the boiling point for organic compounds of similar molar mass compound molar mass gmol dipole moment d boiling point k ch cyclopropane choch dimethyl ether chcn acetonitrile the
