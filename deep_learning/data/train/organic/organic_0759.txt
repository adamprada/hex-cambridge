heavy species than in small light species we say that heavier substances tend to be much more polarizable than lighter ones for similar substances london dispersion forces get stronger with increasing molecular size the polarizability of a substance also determines how it interacts with ions and species that possess permanent dipoles thus london dispersion forces are responsible for the general trend toward higher boiling points with increased molecular mass and greater surface area in a homologous series of compounds such as the alkanes part a in figure the strengths of london dispersion forces also depend significantly on molecular shape because
