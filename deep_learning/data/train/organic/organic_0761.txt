the two butane isomers falling in between of the two butane isomers methylpropane is more compact and nbutane has the more extended shape consequently we expect intermolecular interactions for nbutane to be stronger due to its larger surface area resulting in a higher boiling point the overall order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses propane c methylpropane c nbutane c npentane c exercise arrange geh sicl sih ch and gecl in order of decreasing boiling points answer gecl c sicl c geh c sih c ch c hydrogen bonds molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative
