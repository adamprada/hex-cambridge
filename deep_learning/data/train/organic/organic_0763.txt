consequently ho hn and hf bonds have very large bond dipoles that can interact strongly with one another because a hydrogen atom is so small these dipoles can also approach one another more closely than most other dipoles the combination of large bond dipoles and short dipoledipole distances results in very strong dipoledipole interactions called hydrogen bonds as shown for ice in figure a hydrogen bond is usually indicated by a dotted line between the hydrogen atom attached to o n or f the hydrogen bond donor and the atom that has the lone pair of electrons the hydrogen bond
