at the longer distance corresponding to two oh covalent bonds and two oh hydrogen bonds from adjacent water molecules respectively the resulting open cagelike structure of ice means that the solid is actually slightly less dense than the liquid which explains why ice floats on water rather than sinks figure the hydrogenbonded structure of ice each water molecule accepts two hydrogen bonds from two other water molecules and donates two hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bonds with two more water molecules producing an open cagelike structure the structure of liquid water is very similar but in the liquid the hydrogen
