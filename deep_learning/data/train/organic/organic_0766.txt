to o making it a hydrogen bond donor and two lone pairs of electrons on o making it a hydrogen bond acceptor methanol can thus form hydrogen bonds by acting as either a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor the hydrogenbonded structure of methanol is as follows exercise considering chcoh chn nh and chf which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves draw the hydrogenbonded structures answer chcoh and nh although hydrogen bonds are significantly weaker than covalent bonds with typical dissociation energies of only kjmol they have a significant influence on the physical properties of a compound compounds
