forces the substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point solution electrostatic interactions are strongest for an ionic compound so we expect nacl to have the highest boiling point to predict the relative boiling points of the other compounds we must consider their polarity for dipoledipole interactions their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their molar mass for london dispersion forces helium is nonpolar and by far the lightest so it should have the lowest boiling point argon and no have very similar molar masses and gmol respectively but no is polar while ar is not consequently
