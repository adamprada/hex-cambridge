the most significant intermolecular force in each substance ch choh hs solution a although ch bonds are polar they are only minimally polar the most significant intermolecular force for this substance would be dispersion forces b this molecule has an h atom bonded to an o atom so it will experience hydrogen bonding c although this molecule does not experience hydrogen bonding the lewis electron dot diagram and vsepr indicate that it is bent so it has a permanent dipole the most significant force in this substance is dipoledipole interaction exercise identify the most significant intermolecular force in each substance
