ion are at the level and would not normally be active enough to form hydrogen bonds in this case they are made more attractive by the full negative charge on the chlorine figure hydrogen bonding between chloride ions and water however complicated the negative ion there will always be lone pairs that the hydrogen atoms from the water molecules can hydrogen bond to hydrogen bonding in alcohols an alcohol is an organic molecule containing an oh group any molecule which has a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen or a nitrogen is capable of hydrogen bonding such molecules will
