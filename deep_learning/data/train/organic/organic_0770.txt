pairs as in a water molecule hydrogen bonding can occur between ethanol molecules although not as effectively as in water the hydrogen bonding is limited by the fact that there is only one hydrogen in each ethanol molecule with sufficient charge in methoxymethane lone pairs on the oxygen are still there but the hydrogens are not sufficiently for hydrogen bonds to form except in some rather unusual cases the hydrogen atom has to be attached directly to the very electronegative element for hydrogen bonding to occur the boiling points of ethanol and methoxymethane show the dramatic effect that the hydrogen
