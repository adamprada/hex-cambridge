bonding due to the hydrogen attached directly to the oxygen but they are not the same the boiling point of the methylpropanol isnt as high as the butanol because the branching in the molecule makes the van der waals attractions less effective than in the longer butanol hydrogen bonding in organic molecules containing nitrogen hydrogen bonding also occurs in organic molecules containing nh groups in the same sort of way that it occurs in ammonia examples range from simple molecules like chnh methylamine to large molecules like proteins and dna the two strands of the famous double helix in dna
