pair in order to form a hydrogen bond why does a hydrogen bond occur since the hydrogen donor is strongly electronegative it pulls the covalently bonded electron pair closer to its nucleus and away from the hydrogen atom the hydrogen atom is then left with a partial positive charge creating a dipoledipole attraction between the hydrogen atom bonded to the donor and the lone electron pair on the accepton this results in a hydrogen bondsee interactions between molecules with permanent dipoles types of hydrogen bonds hydrogen bonds can occur within one single molecule between two like molecules or between two
