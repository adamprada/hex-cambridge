any number of like or unlike molecules as long as hydrogen donors and acceptors are present an in positions in which they can interactfor example intermolecular hydrogen bonds can occur between nh molecules alone between ho molecules alone or between nh and ho molecules properties and effects of hydrogen bonds on boiling point when we consider the boiling points of molecules we usually expect molecules with larger molar masses to have higher normal boiling points than molecules with smaller molar masses this without taking hydrogen bonds into account is due to greater dispersion forces see interactions between nonpolar molecules larger
