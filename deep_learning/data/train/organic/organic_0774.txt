do not furthermore has a smaller molar mass than hf but partakes in more hydrogen bonds per molecule so its boiling point is consequently higher on viscosity the same effect that is seen on boiling point as a result of hydrogen bonding can also be observed in the viscosity of certain substances those substances which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds tend to have a higher viscosity than those that do not substances which have the possibility for multiple hydrogen bonds exhibit even higher viscosities factors preventing hydrogen bonding electronegativity hydrogen bonding cannot occur without significant electronegativity differences between hydrogen
