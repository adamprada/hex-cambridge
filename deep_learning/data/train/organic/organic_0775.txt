the ability to hydrogen bond this can account for the relatively low ability of cl to form hydrogen bonds when the radii of two atoms differ greatly or are large their nuclei cannot achieve close proximity when they interact resulting in a weak interaction hydrogen bonding in nature hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in many biological processes and can account for many natural phenomena such as the unusual properties of water in addition to being present in water hydrogen bonding is also important in the water transport system of plants secondary and tertiary protein structure and dna base pairing
