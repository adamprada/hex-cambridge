and travel up to the high altitudes of leaves proteins hydrogen bonding is present abundantly in the secondary structure of proteins and also sparingly in tertiary conformation the secondary structure of a protein involves interactions mainly hydrogen bonds between neighboring polypeptide backbones which contain nitrogenhydrogen bonded pairs and oxygen atoms since both n and o are strongly electronegative the hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen in one polypeptide backbone can hydrogen bond to the oxygen atoms in another chain and visaversa though they are relatively weakthese bonds offer great stability to secondary protein structure because they repeat a great number of
