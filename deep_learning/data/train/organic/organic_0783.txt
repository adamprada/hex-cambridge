carbon atoms there are two possible structures for the carbon backbone the carbon atoms can be bonded to make a four carbon chain butane or there can be a one carbon branch from a three carbon chain methylpropane butane and methylpropane are structural isomers because they both have the chemical formula ch identical vs conformer the rotation about single bonds creates dynamic molecules when drawing and discussing molecules it is important to be aware that our drawing are static while the molecule themselves are rotating although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen
