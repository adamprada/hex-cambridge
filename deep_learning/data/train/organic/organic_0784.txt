create geometric isomerism without rotation there are two different orientations possible across the carboncarbon double bond cc the rigidity of the double bond creates a line of reference for spatial orientation the prefixes cis and trans are used to distinguish between geometric isomers the cisstereoisomer has both nonhydrogen atoms on the same side of the double bond whereas the transstereoisomer has the nonhydrogen atoms across the double bond in the same way we cross the ocean an a transatlantic journey this small difference may seem insignificant but geometric isomers are different chemical compounds with different physical properties as shown in
