we identify the difference between to the compounds to determine their relatioship if there are structural differences in the bonding patterns then the compounds are constitutional structural isomers if the compounds have the same structural connections but the spatial orientations are different then the compounds are stereoisomers for now the possible stereoisomers are conformers showing the same compound with different carboncarbon single bond rotations or geometric isomers of compounds with different orientations at the carboncarbon double bonds applying the logic above to our example we determine the following exercise what is the relationship between the following pairs of compounds identical
