rotation of cc single bonds both carbon chains creates conformers the same compound shown in different rotations consequently many different arrangements of the atoms are possible each corresponding to different degrees of rotation differences in threedimensional structure resulting from rotation about a Ïƒ bond are called differences in conformation and each different arrangement is called a conformational isomer or conformer while complete rotation of cc single bonds is not possible in rings the freedom of bond movement does allow the rings to assume different conformations such as the chair and boat for membered rings structural constitutional isomers unlike conformational isomers
