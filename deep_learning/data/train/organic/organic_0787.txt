to be broken and reformed to convert between a and d or between b and c the molecules are simply rotated about a vertical axis structure e is named dimethylpropane there are only three structural isomers possible with the chemical formula ch npentane methylbutane and dimethylpropane structural isomers have distinct physical and chemical properties stereoisomers enantiomers are pairs of compounds that are nonsuperimposable images when there are two or more chiral centers in a compounds the diatereomers can exist diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers enatiomers share all physical properties except for their interaction with plane polarized light diastereomers
