examples are butane and methylpropane isobutane each of which has the molecular formula similarly methoxymethane dimethyl ether and ethanol have the same formula compounds having the same number and kinds of atoms are called isomers whereas only one stable substance is known corresponding to the formula thirtyfive stable isomers have been prepared of the formula from this one may begin to sense the rich variety of organic chemistry which leads to many problems in telling one compound from another in determining structures and also in finding suitable names for compounds in the rest of this chapter we will describe one
