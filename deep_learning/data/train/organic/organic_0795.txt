is to understand how reactions take place and to recognize the various factors that influence their course first we identify four broad classes of reactions based solely on the structural change occurring in the reactant molecules this classification does not require knowledge or speculation concerning reaction paths or mechanisms the four main reaction classes are additions eliminations substitutions and rearrangements addition reaction elimination reaction substitution reaction rearrangement reaction in an addition reaction the number of σbonds in the substrate molecule increases usually at the expense of one or more πbonds the reverse is true of elimination reactions iethe number of
