a coordinate covalent bond is just a type of covalent bond in which one reactant gives it electron pair to another reactant in this case the lewis base donates its electrons to the lewis acid when they do react this way the resulting product is called an addition compound or more commonly an adduct lewis acid a species that accepts an electron pair ie an electrophile and will have vacant orbitals lewis base a species that donates an electron pair ie a nucleophile and will have lonepair electrons lewis acids lewis acids accept an electron pair lewis acids are electrophilic
