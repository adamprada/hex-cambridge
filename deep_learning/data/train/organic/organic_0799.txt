different electronegativities eg co so lewis bases lewis bases donate an electron pair lewis bases are nucleophilic meaning that they attack a positive charge with their lone pair they utilize the highest occupied molecular orbital or homo figure an atom ion or molecule with a lonepair of electrons can thus be a lewis base each of the following anions can give up their electrons to an acid eg lewis bases homo highest occupied molecular orbital interacts with the lewis acids lumo lowest unoccupied molecular orbital to create bonded molecular orbitals both lewis acids and bases contain homo and lumos but
