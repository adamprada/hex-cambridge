lewis acid see oxidation states of transition metals the aluminum ion is the metal and is a cation with an unfilled valence shell and it is a lewis acid water has lonepair electrons and is an anion thus it is a lewis base figure aluminum ion acts as a lewis acid and accepts the electrons from water which is acting as a lewis base this helps explain the resulting hexaaquaaluminumiii ion the lewis acid accepts the electrons from the lewis base which donates the electrons another case where lewis acidbase theory can explain the resulting compound is the reaction of
