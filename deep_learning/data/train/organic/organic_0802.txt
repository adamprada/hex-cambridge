a base in a basic medium thus the medium which a molecule is placed in has an effect on the properties of that molecule other molecules can also act as either an acid or a base for example where aloh is acting as a lewis base where aloh is acting as an lewis acid note how the amphoteric properties of the aloh depends on what type of environment that molecule has been placed in lewis bases acids as nucleophiles electrophiles the emphasis on electron flow in the lewis theory of acids and bases is an important foundation for learning and
