one electron from each of the two covalent bonds because covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms therefore the oxygen atom in methanol owns Â½ x valence electrons the formal charge on an atom is calculated as the number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom minus the number of valence electrons owned by the bound atom in the molecule determining formal charge on an atom formal charge number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom number of valence electrons owned by the bound atom or formal charge number of valence electrons owned by the isolated
