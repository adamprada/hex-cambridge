electrons so the formal charge on carbon is zero for each of the hydrogens in methanol we also get a formal charge of zero formal charge on hydrogen valence electron on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons now lets look at the cationic form of methanol choh the bonding picture has not changed for carbon or for any of the hydrogen atoms so we will focus on the oxygen atom the oxygen owns nonbonding electrons and bonding elections so the formal charge calculations becomes formal charge on oxygen valence electrons in isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding
