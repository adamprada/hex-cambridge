about where the charges are located a structure that is missing nonzero formal charges is not correctly drawn and will probably be marked as such on an exam at this point thinking back to what you learned in general chemistry you are probably asking what about dipoles doesnt an oxygen atom in an oh bond own more of the electron density than the hydrogen because of its greater electronegativity this is absolutely correct and we will be reviewing the concept of bond dipoles later on for the purpose of calculating formal charges however bond dipoles dont matter we always consider
