and another a negative formal charge and the net charge would still be zero zwitterions such as amino acids have both positive and negative formal charges on different atoms even though the net charge on glycine is zero it is still neccessary to show the location of the positive and negative formal charges exercise fill in all missing lone pair electrons and formal charges in the structures below assume that all atoms have a complete valence shell of electrons net charges are shown outside the brackets solutions to exercises orbitals of lone pair electrons learning objective identify the orbitals occupied
