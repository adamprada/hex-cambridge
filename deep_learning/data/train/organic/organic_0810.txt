hybrid orbitals sp sp sp combines atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals σ σ π π forms σ or π bonds creates bonding and antibonding interactions based on which orbitals are filled predicts molecular shape based on the number of regions of electron density predicts the arrangement of electrons in molecules needs multiple structures to describe resonance orbitals of lone pair electrons there are situations in which we will want to integrate molecular orbital and valence bond theories identifying the orbitals of lone pair electrons is one situation hybridized orbitals create sigma bonds and hold lone pairs the sigma bonds
