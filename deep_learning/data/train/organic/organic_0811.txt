hydrogen step determine the hybridization of any atoms with lone pairs heteroatoms lone pairs occupy the hybridized orbitals example to identify the orbitals of the lone pair electrons in the compound below we will follow the approach above step add lone pairs step determine the hybridization of any atom with lone pairs the lone pairs on each heteroatom occupy the indicated hybridized orbital note these guidelines only apply for nonaromatic compounds there can be exceptions to these guidelines for some heterocyclic aromatic compounds these exceptions are fully explained in a later chapter of this text exercise for the compound below
