ions produced by electron impact are accelerated by the negatively charged accelerating plates and sweep down to the curve of the analyzer tube where they are sorted as to their masstocharge ratio by the analyzing magnet with good resolution only the ions of a single mass number will pass through the slit and impinge on the collector even when the mass numbers are in the neighborhood of several thousand the populations of the whole range of mass numbers of interest can be determined by plotting the rate of ion collection as a function of the magnetic field of the analyzing
