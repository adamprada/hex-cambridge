courtesy of dr d p stevenson of the shell development company the peak that is highest in mass number is of considerable importance because it corresponds to the parent molecule minus one electron designated as and provides a highly accurate method for measuring molecular weights incorrect molecular weights will be obtained if the positive ion becomes fragmented before it reaches the collector or if two fragments combine to give a fragment heavier than the peak of is especially weak with alcohols and branchedchain hydrocarbons which readily undergo fragmentation by loss of water or sidechain groups with such compounds the peak
