weight available from the peak with reasonable certainty the next step is to determine the molecular formula if the resolution of the instrument is sufficiently high quite exact masses can be measured which means that ions with values differing by one part in can be distinguished at this resolution it is possible to determine the elemental composition of each ion from its exact value many mass spectrometers in routine use are incapable of resolving ions with values that differ by less than one mass unit in this event the determination of elemental composition can be determined by the method of
