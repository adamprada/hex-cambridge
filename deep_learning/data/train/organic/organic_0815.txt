the combination with that makes the most chemical sense is and the formula of the molecule therefore is chloroethane this example illustrates how values of ions that differ only in isotopic composition can be used to determine elemental compositions the important isotopes for this purpose in addition to those of chlorine are the stable isotopes of natural abundance and as a further example suppose that we have isolated a hydrocarbon and have determine from its mass spectrum that mass units in the absence of any combination reactions there will be an ion corresponding to the same molecular ion but with
