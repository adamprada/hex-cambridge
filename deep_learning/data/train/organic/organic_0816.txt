well as molecular ions but the intensity data from fragment ions very often is complicated by overlapping peaks table isotopic contributions for carbon and other elements to intensities of and relative to the next step in the analysis of a mass spectrum is to see what clues as to structure can be obtained from the fragment ions it would be a serious error to imagine that in mass spectra nothing is observed but simple nonspecific fragmentation of organic molecules on electron impact actually even though electron impact produces highly unstable molecular ions there is a strong tendency for breakdown to
