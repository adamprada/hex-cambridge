to the most abundant fragment ion this ion is presumably the tertbutyl cation and the alternate cleavage to the less stable ethyl cation with is much less significant an excellent example of a rearrangement with fragmentation is provided by the ion of ethyl butanoate which breaks down to give ethene and the ion of an isomer of ethyl ethanoate called its enol form an interesting and complex rearrangement occurs on electron impact with methylbenzene toluene an intense peak is observed having for but the ion involved appears to be a symmetrical ion rather than a phenylmethyl cation the evidence for
