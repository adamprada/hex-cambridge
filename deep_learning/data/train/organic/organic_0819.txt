the displacement reactions of alkyl compounds although chloromethane appears to react only by mechanism now we will discuss the criteria for distinguishing between the concerted and stepwise mechanisms a kinetics of substitution mechanisms of the two mechanisms requires that the reaction rate be determined solely by the rate of the first step cf earlier discussion in section c this means that the rate at which methanol is formed measured in moles per unit volume per unit time will depend on the chloromethane concentration but not on the hydroxide ion concentration because hydroxide ion is not utilized except in a fast
