recognize the difference between the order of a reaction with respect to a specific reactant and the overall order of a reaction the order of a reaction with respect to a particular reactant is the power to which the concentration of that reactant must be raised to have direct proportionality between concentration and reaction rate according to equation the rate of the chloromethanehydroxide ion reaction is first order with respect to chloromethane and first order with respect to hydroxide ion in equation the rate is first order with respect to chloromethane and zero order with respect to hydroxide ion because
