often designated for substitution for nucleophilic and for bimolecular because there are two reactant molecules in the transition state to summarize for an reaction rate mechanism the stepwise mechanism is a unimolecular nucleophilic substitution and accordingly is designated the numeral or used in these designations does not refer to the kinetic order of the reaction but refers to the number of molecules not including solvent molecules that make up the transition state thus for rate mechanism or b solvolysis many reactions are carried out using the solvent as the nucleophilic agent they are called solvolysis reactions and involve solvents such
