other criteria notably stereochemistry sections and and the effect of added nucleophiles on the rate and nature of the reaction products for example it often is possible to distinguish between and solvolysis by adding to the reaction mixture a relatively small concentration of a substance that is expected to be a more powerful nucleophile than the solvent if the reaction is strictly the rate at which disappears should remain essentially unchanged because it reacts only as fast as forms and the rate of this step is not changed by addition of the nucleophile even if the nucleophile reacts with however
