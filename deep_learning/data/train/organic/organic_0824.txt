same molecule looked at from two different perspectives in the first case there is a rotation around the single carboncarbon bond in the second the whole molecule is rotated top to bottom meso compounds a meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers it is superimposed on its mirror image and is optically inactive although it contains two or more stereocenters introduction in general a meso compound should contain two or more identical substituted stereocenters also it has an internal symmetry plane that divides the compound in half these two halves reflect each other by the internal mirror
