crucial in determining whether it is a meso compound or not as mentioned above a meso compound is optically inactive so their stereochemistry should cancel out for instance r cancels s out in a meso compound with two stereocenters transdichloroethanediol mesodibromobutane tips an interesting thing about single bonds or sporbitals is that we can rotate the substituted groups that attached to a stereocenter around to recognize the internal plane as the molecule is rotated its stereochemistry does not change for example another case is when we rotate the whole molecule by degree both molecules below are still meso remember the
