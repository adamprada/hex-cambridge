can exist in many different forms such as pentane butane heptane and even cyclobutane they do not necessarily have to be two stereocenters but can have more optical activity analysis when the optical activity of a meso compound is attempted to be determined with a polarimeter the indicator will not show or it simply means there is no certain direction of rotation of the polarized light neither levorotatory and dexorotatory achiral diastereomers mesocompounds the chiral centers in the preceding examples have all been different in the case of dihydroxybutanedioic acid known as tartaric acid the two chiral centers have the
