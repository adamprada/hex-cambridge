more widely and because changes between them are induced only by higherenergy radiation microwave absorptions by gaseous substances can be characterized as essentially pure rotational spectra it is possible to obtain rotational moments of inertia from microwave spectra and from these moments to obtain bond angles and bond distances for simple molecules an example of the use of microwave spectra is provided by figure which shows separate rotational absorptions observed for trans and gauche conformations of propyl iodide cf section although microwave spectroscopy being confined to gases is not a routine method in the organic laboratory it is important to
