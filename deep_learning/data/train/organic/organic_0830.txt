of oxygen we can also work backwards from molar ratios since if we know the molar amounts of each element in a compound we can determine the empirical formula example mercury chloride mercury forms a compound with chlorine that is mercury and chlorine by mass what is the empirical formula lets say we had a gram sample of this compound the sample would therefore contain grams of mercury and grams of chlorine how many moles of each atom do the individual masses represent for mercury for chlorine what is the molar ratio between the two elements thus we have twice
