general flow chart for solving empirical formulas from known mass percentages example ascorbic acid vitamin c ascorbic acid contains c h and o by mass the experimentally determined molecular mass is amu what is the empirical and chemical formula for ascorbic acid solution consider an arbitrary amount of grams of ascorbic acid so we would have grams c grams h grams o this would give us how many moles of each element carbon hydrogen oxygen determine the simplest whole number ratio by dividing by the smallest molar amount moles in this case see oxygen carbon hydrogen oxygen the relative molar
