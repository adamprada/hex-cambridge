the molecular mass of our empirical formula amu the molecular mass from our empirical formula is significantly lower than the experimentally determined value what is the ratio between the two values amu amu thus it would appear that our empirical formula is essentially one half the mass of the actual molecular mass if we multiplied our empirical formula by then the molecular mass would be correct thus the actual molecular formula is cho cho combustion analysis when a compound containing carbon and hydrogen is subject to combustion with oxygen in a special combustion apparatus all the carbon is converted to
