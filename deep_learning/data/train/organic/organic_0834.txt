have moles of ho then we have moles of hydrogen since hydrogen is about grammole we must have grams of hydrogen in our original sample when we add our carbon and hydrogen together we get grams c grams h grams but we know we combusted grams of isopropyl alcohol the missing mass must be from the oxygen atoms in the isopropyl alcohol grams grams grams oxygen this much oxygen is how many moles overall therefore we have moles carbon moles hydrogen moles oxygen divide by the smallest molar amount to normalize c atoms h atoms o atom within experimental error
