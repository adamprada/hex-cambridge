masses and the molar masses of the elements to calculate the empirical formula of naphthalene solution a upon combustion mol of is produced for each mole of carbon atoms in the original sample similarly mol of ho is produced for every mol of hydrogen atoms present in the sample the masses of carbon and hydrogen in the original sample can be calculated from these ratios the masses of co and ho and their molar masses because the units of molar mass are grams per mole we must first convert the masses from milligrams to grams b to obtain the relative
