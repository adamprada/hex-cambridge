and attributions learning objective write and interpret molecular orbital mo diagrams overview molecular orbital mo theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wavefunctions the resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule bonding molecular orbitals are formed by inphase combinations of atomic wavefunctions and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule antibonding molecular orbitals result from outofphase combinations and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the distribution of
