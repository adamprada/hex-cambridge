of two identical atoms h or cl for example such molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules in these diatomic molecules several types of molecular orbitals occur the mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear combination of atomic orbitals lcao the wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions combining waves can lead to constructive interference in which peaks line up with peaks or destructive interference in which peaks line up with troughs figure in orbitals the waves are three dimensional and they combine
