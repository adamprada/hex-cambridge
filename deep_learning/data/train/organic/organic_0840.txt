is directly between the nuclei the outofphase addition which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions produces a higher energy molecular orbital read as sigmasstar molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei the asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital electrons in a Ïƒs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable of lower energy than they would be in the isolated atoms adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals electrons
