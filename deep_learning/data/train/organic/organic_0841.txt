to how a twodimensional wave has both parts above and below the average we indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors when orbital lobes of the same phase overlap constructive wave interference increases the electron density when regions of opposite phase overlap the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes when p orbitals overlap end to end they create σ and σ orbitals figure if two atoms are located along the xaxis in a cartesian coordinate system the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx bonding and antibonding read as sigmapx and
