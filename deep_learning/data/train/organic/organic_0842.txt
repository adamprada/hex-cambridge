either side of the node in molecular orbital theory we describe the π orbital by this same shape and a π bond exists when this orbital contains electrons electrons in this orbital interact with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together making it a bonding orbital for the outofphase combination there are two nodal planes created one along the internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei figure sidebyside overlap of each two p orbitals results in the formation of two π molecular orbitals combining the outofphase orbitals results in an antibonding molecular orbital with two nodes
