orientation the πpy and πpz orbitals are identical and have the same energy they are degenerate orbitals the and antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and identical except for their orientation a total of six molecular orbitals results from the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms σpx and πpy and πpz and example molecular orbitals predict what type if any of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave functions so each pair of orbitals shown overlap the orbitals are all similar in energy solution this is an inphase combination resulting in a σp orbital this will
