molecular orbital diagram figure for a diatomic molecule the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left and those of the other atom are shown on the right each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons the molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals for each pair of atomic orbitals that combine one lowerenergy bonding molecular orbital and one higherenergy antibonding orbital result thus we can see that combining the six p atomic
