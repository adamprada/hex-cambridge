orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins figure just as we write electron configurations for atoms we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present for clarity we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy in this case each orbital is at a different energy so parentheses separate each orbital thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons such as would have the molecular electron configuration it is common to omit the core electrons from molecular orbital diagrams and configurations
