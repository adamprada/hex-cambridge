and a triple bond has a bond order of we define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons but the resulting bond order is usually the same the mo technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the lewis structure method fails but both methods describe the same phenomenon in the molecular orbital model an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital the bond order is calculated by subtracting the destabilizing antibonding electrons
