in diatomic molecules a dihydrogen molecule h forms from two hydrogen atoms when the atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine the electrons occupy the molecular orbital of lowest energy the σs bonding orbital a dihydrogen molecule h readily forms because the energy of a h molecule is lower than that of two h atoms the σs orbital that contains both electrons is lower in energy than either of the two s atomic orbitals a molecular orbital can hold two electrons so both electrons in the h molecule are in the σs bonding orbital the electron configuration is we represent
