helium atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule he with four electrons because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the lowerenergy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the two electrons in the higherenergy antibonding molecular orbital we would write the hypothetical electron configuration of he as as in figure the net energy change would be zero so there is no driving force for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule in fact helium exists as discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules the bond order in a hypothetical dihelium molecule would be
