one chiral center that exist in two mirrorimage configurations which we call enantiomers what happens when there is more than one chiral center how many stereoisomers should we expect consider the stereoisomers of the important amino acid threonine aminohydroxybutanoic acid for this substance if we write all of the possible configurations of its two chiral carbons we have four different projection formulas corresponding to four different stereoisomers you should build a ballandstick model of by the procedure shown in figure also see figure and by putting the model over verify that none of these projections have the configurations of both
