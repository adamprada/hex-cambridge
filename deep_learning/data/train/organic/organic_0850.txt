possible configurations we expect eight different stereoisomers with three chiral carbons sixteen with four and so on the simple rule the is possible different stereoisomers for chiral centers as we shall see later this rule has to be modified in some special cases what is the relationship between stereoisomers this will be clearer if we translate each of the projection formulas into a threedimensional representation as shown in figure you will be helped greatly if you work through the sequence yourself with a ballandstick model drawn as newman projections come out as shown in it should be clear and if
