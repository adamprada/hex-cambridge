and physical properties whereas enantiomers have identical physical properties apart from their optical rotations this is illustrated in table for the threonine stereoisomers the reason for the difference in physical properties between diastereomers can be seen very simply for a substance with two chiral centers by noting that a right shoe on a right foot is a mirror image or has the same physical properties as a left shoe on a left foot but is not a mirror image nor does it have the same physical properties as a left show on a right foot or a right shoe on
