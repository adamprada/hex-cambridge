to staggered conformations and can be illustrated with the tartaric acids if you make models of and you will find that they are mirror images and identical but as we have said they have no plane of symmetry in this conformation the molecules do have a center of symmetry thus a line drawn at any angle through the midpoint of the central bond of or has an identical environment on each side of the midpoint another way of putting it is that each half of the molecule is the photographic image ie reverse of the other half for a molecule
