bond do not need to number cycloalkenes because it is understood that the double bond is in the one position alkenes that have the same molecular formula but the location of the doble bonds are different means they are constitutional isomers functional groups with higher priority add substituents and their position to the alkene as prefixes of course remember to give the lowest numbers possible remember to name them in alphabetical order when writting them next is identifying stereoisomers when there are only two non hydrogen attachments to the alkene then use cis and trans to name the molecule in
