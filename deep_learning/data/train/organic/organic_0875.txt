molecule find the longest carbon chain including both the triple bonds number the longest chain starting at the end closest to the triple bond that appears first the suffix that would be used to name this molecule would be diyne for example methyloctadiyne rule substituents containing a triple bond are called alkynyl for example chloroethynylbromocyclohexane here is a table with a few of the alkynyl substituents name molecule ethynyl cch propynyl chcch butynyl chcchch rule a molecule that contains both double and triple bonds is called an alkenyne the chain can be numbered starting with the end closest to the
