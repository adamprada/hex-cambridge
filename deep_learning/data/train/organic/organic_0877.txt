series similar to the unbranched alkanes like alkanes cycloalkane molecules are often drawn as skeletal structures in which each intersection between two lines is assumed to have a carbon atom with its corresponding number of hydrogens cyclohexane one of the most common cycloalkanes is shown below as an example same as same as cyclic hydrocarbons have the prefix cyclo the iupac names molecular formulas and skeleton structures of the cycloalkanes with to carbons are given in table note that the general formula for a cycloalkane composed of n carbons is cnhn and not cnhn as for alkanes although a cycloalkane
