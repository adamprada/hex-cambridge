specific rules for naming substituted cycloalkanes with examples are given below determine the cycloalkane to use as the parent if there is an alkyl straight chain that has a greater number of carbons than the cycloalkane then the alkyl chain must be used as the primary parent chain cycloalkanes substituents have an ending yl if there are two cycloalkanes in the molecule use the cycloalkane with the higher number of carbons as the parent example the longest straight chain contains carbons compared with cyclopropane which only contains carbons the parent chain in this molecule is decane and cyclopropane is a
