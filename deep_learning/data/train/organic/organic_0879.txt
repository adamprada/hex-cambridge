multiple substituents on the ring number the carbons of the cycloalkane so that the carbons with substituents have the lowest possible number a carbon with multiple substituents should have a lower number than a carbon with only one substituent or functional group one way to make sure that the lowest number possible is assigned is to number the carbons so that when the numbers corresponding to the substituents are added their sum is the lowest possible when naming the cycloalkane the substituents must be placed in alphabetical order remember the prefixes di tri etc are not used for alphabetization example
