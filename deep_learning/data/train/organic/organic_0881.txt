rings tricyclic three rings and in general polycyclic compounds the molecular formulas of such compounds have hc ratios that decrease with the number of rings in general for a hydrocarbon composed of n carbon atoms associated with m rings the formula is cnhn m the structural relationship of rings in a polycyclic compound can vary they may be separate and independent or they may share one or two common atoms some examples of these possible arrangements are shown in the following table table examples of isomeric ch bicycloalkanes isolated rings spiro rings fused rings bridged rings no common atoms one
