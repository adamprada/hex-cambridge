at elevated temperatures using nitric acid or nitrogen tetroxide as the nitrating agent all available evidence points to a radical mechanism for nitration but many aspects of the reaction are not fully understood mixtures are obtained nitration of propane gives not only and nitropropanes but nitroethane and nitromethane in commercial practice the yield and product distribution in nitration of alkanes is controlled as far as possible by the judicious addition of catalysts eg oxygen and halogens which are believed to raise the concentration of alkyl radicals the products are separated from the mixtures by fractional distillation contributors and attributions john
