course nonetheless this section is important as it covers some of the fundamental factors that influence many physical and chemical properties introduction the properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids in contrast to intramolecular forces such as the covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules and polyatomic ions intermolecular forces hold molecules together in a liquid or solid intermolecular forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds for example it requires kj to overcome the intramolecular forces and break both oh bonds in mol of water but it takes
