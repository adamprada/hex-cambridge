boiling points of liquids liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid similarly solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature that is they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species like covalent and ionic bonds intermolecular interactions are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules
