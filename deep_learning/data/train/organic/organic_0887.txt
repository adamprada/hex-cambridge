ionic substances dissolve in a polar substance such as water these are less common with organic molecules so will not be described further in this section dipoledipole interactions polar covalent bonds behave as if the bonded atoms have localized fractional charges that are equal but opposite ie the two bonded atoms generate a dipole if the structure of a molecule is such that the individual bond dipoles do not cancel one another then the molecule has a net dipole moment molecules with net dipole moments tend to align themselves so that the positive end of one dipole is near the
