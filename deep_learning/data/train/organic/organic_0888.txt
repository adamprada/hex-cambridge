vice versa produce attractive interactions c and d molecular orientations that juxtapose the positive or negative ends of the dipoles on adjacent molecules produce repulsive interactions because molecules in a liquid move freely and continuously molecules always experience both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions simultaneously as shown in figure on average however the attractive interactions dominate figure both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions occur in a liquid sample with many molecules chloromethane is an example of a polar molecule an electrostatic potential map shows a high electron density seen in red around the electronegative chlorine giving it a partial negative
