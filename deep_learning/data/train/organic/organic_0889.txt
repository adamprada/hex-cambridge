addition the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do ionion interactions recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r where r is the distance between the ions doubling the distance r r decreases the attractive energy by onehalf in contrast the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to r so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction by or fold thus a substance such as hcl which is partially held together by dipoledipole interactions is a gas at room temperature and
