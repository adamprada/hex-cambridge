the temporary formation of a dipole called an induced dipole in the second interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another these attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance london was able to show with quantum mechanics that the attractive energy between molecules due to temporary dipoleinduced dipole interactions falls off as r doubling the distance therefore decreases the attractive energy by or fold figure instantaneous dipole moments the formation of an instantaneous dipole moment on one he atom a or an h molecule b results in the formation of an
