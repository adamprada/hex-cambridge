he the two s electrons are held close to the nucleus in a very small volume and electronelectron repulsions are strong enough to prevent significant asymmetry in their distribution in larger atoms such as xe however the outer electrons are much less strongly attracted to the nucleus because of filled intervening shells as a result it is relatively easy to temporarily deform the electron distribution to generate an instantaneous or induced dipole the ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule is called its polarizability because the electron distribution is more easily perturbed in large heavy
