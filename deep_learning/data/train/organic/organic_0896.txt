former predominate example arrange nbutane propane methylpropane isobutane and npentane in order of increasing boiling points strategy determine the intermolecular forces in the compounds and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces the substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point solution the four compounds are alkanes and nonpolar so london dispersion forces are the only important intermolecular forces these forces are generally stronger with increasing molecular mass so propane should have the lowest boiling point and npentane should have the highest with the two butane isomers falling in between of the two
