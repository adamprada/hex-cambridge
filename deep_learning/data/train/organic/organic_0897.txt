much lesser extent cl and s tend to exhibit unusually strong intermolecular interactions these result in much higher boiling points than are observed for substances in which london dispersion forces dominate as illustrated for the covalent hydrides of elements of groups in figure methane and its heavier congeners in group form a series whose boiling points increase smoothly with increasing molar mass this is the expected trend in nonpolar molecules for which london dispersion forces are the exclusive intermolecular forces in contrast the hydrides of the lightest members of groups have boiling points that are more than c greater than
