hf nh and ho are anomalously high for compounds with such low molecular masses why do strong intermolecular forces produce such anomalously high boiling points and other unusual properties such as high enthalpies of vaporization and high melting points the answer lies in the highly polar nature of the bonds between hydrogen and very electronegative elements such as o n and f the large difference in electronegativity results in a large partial positive charge on hydrogen and a correspondingly large partial negative charge on the o n or f atom consequently ho hn and hf bonds have very large bond
