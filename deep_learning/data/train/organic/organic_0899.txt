two lone pairs a tetrahedral arrangement maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed in the structure of ice each oxygen atom is surrounded by a distorted tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms that form bridges to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules the bridging hydrogen atoms are not equidistant from the two oxygen atoms they connect however instead each hydrogen atom is pm from one oxygen and pm from the other in contrast each oxygen atom is bonded to two h atoms at the shorter distance and two at the longer distance corresponding to two oh covalent bonds
