are significantly lower than the boiling point of water which forms four hydrogen bonds at a time example considering choh ch xe and chn which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves draw the hydrogenbonded structures strategy identify the compounds with a hydrogen atom attached to o n or f these are likely to be able to act as hydrogen bond donors of the compounds that can act as hydrogen bond donors identify those that also contain lone pairs of electrons which allow them to be hydrogen bond acceptors if a substance is both a hydrogen donor and a hydrogen bond
