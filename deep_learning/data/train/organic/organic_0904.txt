london dispersion forces are due to the formation of instantaneous dipole moments in polar or nonpolar molecules as a result of shortlived fluctuations of electron charge distribution which in turn cause the temporary formation of an induced dipole in adjacent molecules like dipoledipole interactions their energy falls off as r larger atoms tend to be more polarizable than smaller ones because their outer electrons are less tightly bound and are therefore more easily perturbed hydrogen bonds are especially strong dipoledipole interactions between molecules that have hydrogen bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as o n or f the resulting
