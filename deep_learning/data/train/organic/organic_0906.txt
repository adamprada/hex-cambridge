and simmering what is the difference in energy input solutions dipolediple interactions are stronger because molecules polarity is permanent molecules involved in london dispersion forces are only temporarily polar water is a liquid under standard conditions because of its unique ability to form four strong hydrogen bonds per molecule in solids and liquids the molecules are in direct contact in gases the molecules only contact during collisions intermolecules forces become inmportant when gases are cooled to the point where they form a liquid as the atomic mass of the halogens increases so does the number of electrons and the average
