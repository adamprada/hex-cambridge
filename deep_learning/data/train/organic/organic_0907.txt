bond acceptors hydrogen bonding will be most important c although the co bonds are polar this linear molecule has no net dipole moment hence london dispersion forces are most important d this is a symmetrical molecule that has no net dipole moment and the cl atoms are relatively polarizable thus london dispersion forces will dominate e this molecule has a small dipole moment as well as polarizable cl atoms in such a case dipoledipole interactions and london dispersion forces are often comparable in magnitude water has two polar oh bonds with h atoms that can act as hydrogen bond donors
