of many kinds of atoms act like tiny magnets and tend to become aligned in a magnetic field in nmr spectroscopy we measure the energy required to change the alignment of magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field to illustrate the procedure with a simple example consider the behavior of a proton in a magnetic field there are two possible alignments of this magnetic nucleus with respect to the direction of the applied field as shown in figure the nuclear magnets can be aligned either with the field direction or opposed to it the two orientations are not equivalent and energy
