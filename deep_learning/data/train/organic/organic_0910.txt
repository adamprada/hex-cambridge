gradually at certain field strengths radiofrequency energy is absorbed by the sample and the ammeter indicates an increase in the flow of current in the coil the overall result is a spectrum such as the one shown in figure this spectrum is detailed enough to serve as a useful fingerprint for ethanol and also is simple enough that we will be able to account for the origin of each line it is the purpose of this section to explain how the complexities of spectra such as that of figure can be interpreted in terms of chemical structure figure essential features
