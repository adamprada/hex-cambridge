carbon figure proton nmr spectrum of ethanol containing a trace of hydrochloric acid chemical shifts are relative to tetramethylsilane that is tms the stepped line is an integral of the areas under each of the resonance lines the kind of nmr spectroscopy we shall discuss here is limited in its applications because it can be carried out only with liquids or solutions fortunately the allowable range of solvents is large from hydrocarbons to concentrated sulfuric acid and for most compounds it is possible to find a suitable solvent nuclear magnetic resonance spectra may be so simple as to have only
