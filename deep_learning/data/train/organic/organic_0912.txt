between possible energy levels of magnetic nuclei in an applied magnetic field see figure the transition energies are related to the frequency of the absorbed radiation by the familiar equation an important difference between nmr and other forms of spectroscopy is that is influenced by the strength of the applied field this should not be surprising because if we are to measure the energy of changing the direction of alignment of a magnetic nucleus in a magnetic field then the stronger the field the more energy will be invloved nuclear spin symbolized as is a quantized property that correlates with
