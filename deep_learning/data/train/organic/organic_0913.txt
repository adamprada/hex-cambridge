to the applied magnetic field and as we will see this difference leads to important chemical information each kind of nucleus etc has its own value and consequently will undergo transitions at different frequencies at any particular value of this should become clearer by study of figure figure fieldfrequency diagram that represents the energies in frequency units of the and magnetic states of and nuclei as a function of magnetic field the vertical scale is of frequency in megahertz cycles per sec while the horizontal scale is of magnetic field in gauss for comparison the earths magnetic field is about
