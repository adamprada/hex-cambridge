is hence and this is a very small energy difference which means that only very few more of the nuclei are in the more stable state than in the less stable state the equilibrium constant for calculated from equation for textk and neglecting possible entropy effects is b the chemical shift the plot of signal against magnetic field strength for ethanol in figure shows three principal groups of lines corresponding to the three varieties of hydrogen present methyl methylene and hydroxyl differences in the field strengths at which signals are obtained for nuclei of the same kind such as protons
