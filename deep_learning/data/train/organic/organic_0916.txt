increasing from left to right the height of each step corresponds to the relative number of nuclei of a particular kind unless special precautions are taken integrals usually should not be considered accurate to better than about why do protons in different molecular environments absorb at different field strengths the field strength at a particular nucleus is less than the strength of the external magnetic field this is because the valence electrons around a particular nucleus and around neighboring nuclei respond to the applied magnetic field so as to shield the nucleus from the applied field the way this shielding
