proportionality constant it is important to recognize that is not a nuclear property but depends on the chemical environment of the atom each chemically different proton will have a different value of and hence a different chemical shift the actual field at the nucleus will be because acts to reduce the strength of the applied field at the nucleus it is called the magnetic shielding parameter the more shielding there is the stronger the applied field must be to satisfy the resonance condition common usage is upfield more shielding downfield less shielding and you should remember that fieldsweep spectra always
