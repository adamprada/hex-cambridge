reason we suggest that you inspect structures to convince yourself that the protons labeled with different letter subscripts in any one molecule are indeed chemically different one way of checking whether two protons are in equivalent environments is to imagine that each is separately replaced with a different atom or group if the product of replacing is identical with that obtained by replacing then and are chemically equivalent if the two products are nonidentical then and are nonequivalent for example replacement of or in and by an atom would give different products therefore and are nonequivalent in and matters become
