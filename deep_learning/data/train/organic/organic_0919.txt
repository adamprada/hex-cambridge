will recall that enantiomers are chemically indistinguishable unless they are in a chiral environment therefore we expect shifts of enantiotopic hydrogens to be identical unless they are in a chiral environment to summarize enantiotopic protons normally will have the same chemical shifts whereas diastereotopic protons normally will have different chemical shifts we so far have ignored the relationship of chemical shifts to conformational equilibria consider a specific example dibromoethane for which there are three staggered conformations and each of these conformations is expected to have its own nmr spectrum the two gauche forms and are enantiomers and their spectra should
