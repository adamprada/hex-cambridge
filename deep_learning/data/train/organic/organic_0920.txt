can absorb the exciting radiation the result is that we observe an average chemical shift which reflects the relative shifts and populations of the three conformers present if we can go to a sufficiently low temperature to make interconversion of the conformations slow on the order of times per second then we will expect to see the three different chemical shifts and with intensities corresponding to the actual populations of the conformations at the sample temperature this is one example of the effect of rate processes on nmr spectra other examples and a more detailed account of how to relate
