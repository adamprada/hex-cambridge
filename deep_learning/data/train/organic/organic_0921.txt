are appropriate ten years ago most nmr spectrometers operated for protons with radiofrequency rf transmitters set at cycles per second but there has been a proliferation of different protonoperating frequencies and now and machines are commercially available the cost of these machines is roughly proportional to the square of the frequency and one well may wonder why there is such an exotic variety available and what this has to do with the chemical shift high operating frequencies are desirable because chemical shifts increase with spectrometer frequency and this makes the spectra simpler to interpret a fold increase in operating frequency
