this is offscale to the left in the spectrum the large single line in the center of the spectra arises from the resonances of the six methyl hydrogens the line at is tms in each case to reiterate chemical shifts are strictly proportional to spectrometer frequency thus lines apart at will be apart at this might seem to make comparisons of nmr spectra on different spectrometers hopelessly complex but because of the proportionality of shifts to frequency or field if we divide the measured shifts in relative to the same standard for any spectrometer by the transmitter frequency in we
