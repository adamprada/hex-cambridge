is expected to depend somewhat on the nature of the particular molecule involved and also on the solvent temperature and concentration a positive value means a shift to lower field or lower frequency with respect to tms whereas a negative signifies a shift to higher field or higher frequency the convention is accepted widely but you often find in the literature proton shifts with reference to tms reported as values the scale has the tms reference at so most proton signals fall in the range of to a value can be converted to the appropriate value by subtracting it from
