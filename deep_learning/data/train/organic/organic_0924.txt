valence electrons depends on the character of the substituent atoms and groups present and particularly on their electronattracting power or electronegativity for a grouping of the type the shielding will be less as is more electron withdrawing relative to hydrogen if is electronwithdrawing the proton is deshielded for example the proton chemical shifts of the methyl halides table show decreasing shielding hence progressively lowfield chemical shifts with increasing halogen electronegativity the effect of electronegativity on a more remote proton as in is expected to be smaller as more bonds intervene in fact the resonances of different derivatives fall in a
