of derivatives as a function of the pauling electronegativity of see section a when two electronegative groups and are bonded to the same carbon as in the protons are expected to be less shielded and come into resonance downfield of the methylenes of there is an approximate relationship see below between the shifts of the protons and the effective shielding constants of and known as shoolerys rule appropriate values of for use with this equation are given in table effects of carbon bond type the shifts of the protons of alkanes and cycloalkanes fall in the range of with protons
