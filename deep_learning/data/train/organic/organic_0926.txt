difference in shift between a proton which normally comes at about and aldehyde protons which are much farter downfield at clearly the shifts of a proton depend on whether the carbon forms single double or triple bonds in a magnetic field the circulation of electrons in the orbitals of multiple bonds induced by the field figure generates diamagnetic shielding effects in some regions of the multiple bond and paramagnetic deshielding effects in other regions apparently protons attached to doublebonded carbons are in the deshielding zones and thus are downfield while protons attached to triplebonded carbons are in the shielding zones
