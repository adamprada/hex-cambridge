hydrogen bonding varies with concentration temperature and solvent and changes in the degree of hydrogen bonding can cause substantial shift changes this is very evident in the nmr spectrum of ethanol taken at different concentrations in figure the hydroxyl resonance will be seen to move upfield by hydrogen bonding through equilibria such as figure proton spectra of ethanol at showing how the resonance changes in position with percent concentration in the background noise level increases at the lower concentrations because the receiver gain has been increased to maintain constant height of the resonances the changes in appearance of the resonance
