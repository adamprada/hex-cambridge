about and an proton resonance at about autoprotolysis equilibria can exchange the protons between the molecules and also from one end to the other as shown below even if the equilibria are not very favorable such equilibria can be established very rapidly especially if traces of a strong acid or a strong base are present in such circumstances a single average proton signal is observed because the excitation of a given proton from its lowerenergy magnetic state to its higherenergy magnetic state occurs while it is partly on oxygen and partly on nitrogen this is the same kind of chemical
