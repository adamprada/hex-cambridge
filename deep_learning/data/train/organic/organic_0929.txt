out because there is no sign of an stretch the nmr spectrum shows three kinds of signals corresponding to three kinds of protons the integral shows these are in the ratio of from this we can conclude that they are two different kinds of groups and a group the chemical shifts of the presumed groups are at and because the compound contains only and the data of table suggest that these resonances arise from groups the lowfield resonance is likely to be we know from the infrared that there probably is an ester function while the higherfield resonance is possibly
