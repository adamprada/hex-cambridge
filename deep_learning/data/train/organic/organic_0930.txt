you look at the nmr spectrum of ethanol in figure you will see that the resonance is actually a group of four lines and the resonance is a group of three lines this threefour line pattern for the grouping also is evident in the spectrum of methylbutanol figure and in the spectrum of ethyl iodide figure why do certain proton resonances appear as groups of equally spaced lines rather than single resonances the facts are that nonequivalent protons on contiguous carbons such as ethyl derivatives interact magnetically to split each others resonances this multiplicity of lines produced by the mutual
