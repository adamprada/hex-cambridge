how do we know what we are dealing with from where to we measure the chemical shift in a complex group of lines figure highresolution nmr spectrum of ethyl iodide at relative to tms the firstorder splitting pattern is seen in the wellseparated threefour line pattern for the resonances the secondorder splitting is the additional fine structure superimposed on the threefour pattern first the chemical shift normally is at the center of the group of lines corresponding to firstorder splitting in ethyl iodide the chemical shift of the methyl protons is in the center of the quartet second the chemical
