the secondorder splitting tends to disappear with increasing transmitter frequency for ethyl iodide figure the secondorder splitting at is barely discernible at and disappears at this also can be seen to occur for the threefour splitting pattern of methylbutanol as a function of figure the next question is how can we understand and predict what spinspin splitting patterns will be observed and how do they give us structural information the important point is that the multiplicity of lines for protons of a given chemical shift often is seen to be in which is the number of protons on the contiguous
