on contiguous carbons for instance a twothree line pattern where the twopart has an integrated intensity twice that of the threepart suggests the grouping figure schematic proton nmr spectra and are nonmagnetic nuclei for propane derivatives as at the top the cech resonances are double because of the splitting produced by the single proton on c for the ethane derivatives the right set of lines is always a triplet when observable because of the two protons of the group we assume here that the chemical shifts of the protons are independent of the number of substituents the ratios of the
