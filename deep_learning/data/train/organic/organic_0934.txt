group of three that is the methyl protons of the groups are too far from the others to give demonstrable spinspin splitting thus they appear as a single sixproton resonance figure proton nmr spectrum of dimethoxyethane dimethyl acetal at relative to tms in general the magnitude of the spinspin splitting effect of one proton on another proton or group of equivalent protons depends on the number and kind of intervening chemical bonds and on the spatial relationships between the groups for simple systems without double bonds and with normal bond angles we usually find for nonequivalent protons ie having different
