way that they depend on the conformation at the bond typical values for several particular conformations are for protons in groups such as ethyl groups in which rotation is rapid and the favored conformations are staggered but none of the staggered conformations is preferred over the others average protonproton splittings are observed the average for splittings is about which corresponds to i protonproton splittings and chemical exchange you may have wondered why the hydroxyl proton of ethanol produces a single resonance in the spectrum of figure it is quite reasonable to expect that the hydroxyl proton would be split by
