the only way that spincoupling interactions can be averaged to zero the same effect can be achieved by a technique known as double resonance to understand how this is done consider two coupled protons and having different chemical shifts suppose that is selectively irradiated at its resonance frequency while at the same time we observe the resonance signal of the coupling between and disappears and shows a single resonance why is this so by irradiation of the nuclei are changed from the state to and back again sufficiently rapidly that the neighboring nucleus effectively sees neither one state nor the
