in the absence of spinspin splitting we now will illustrate how more complex spectra may be analyzed figure shows the proton nmr spectrum for a compound of formula there are three principal groups of lines at and look at the multiplicity of these groups before reading further figure nmr spectrum and integral for a compound of formula at relative to tms there are several ways to approach a problem such as this but probably the easiest is to start with the integral the relative heights of the stepped integral for the principal groups of lines can be obtained by a
