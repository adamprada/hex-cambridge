check it against all of the available information first from the shifts table we see that the single proton at fits almost perfectly for the twoproton resonance at is consistent with that reported for while the threeproton line at checks with for what about the couplings the threefour pattern has a spacing of slightly over which is just right for an ethyl group compare figures and the doubling up almost obscured by secondorder splitting of the resonance and the splitting of the resonance into a triplet indicate about a coupling for the group threebond couplings between and adjacent protons appear
