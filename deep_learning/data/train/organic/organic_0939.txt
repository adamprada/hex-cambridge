the molecular formula tells us the number and kind of atoms and the number of multiple bonds or rings the formulas of the corresponding hydrocarbon without the bromine would be or four hydrogens less than the saturated alkane this means there must be two double bonds or the equivalent one triple bond or one ring and one double bond because from the formula we suspect unsaturation we should check this out with the infrared spectrum there is a band at which is indicative of an unsymmetrically substituted group table the strong sharp band at further tells us that the substance
