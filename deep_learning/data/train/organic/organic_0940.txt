agrees well with the tabulated value of there is no tabulated data for but the observed shift at is at slightly lower fields than the tabulated for this is expected because of the triple bond the correlation of equation predicts a value of very often a proton will be spincoupled to two or more different protons and the couplings are not necessarily the same when this happens the resulting spectrum can be quite complex as our next example shows a compound gives the nmr spectrum of figure there are clearly four kinds of protons in the molecule at and although
