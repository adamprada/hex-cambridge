for alkenic protons the threeproton signal at is typical of a methyl group on a carboncarbon double bond there are only three ways to put together a phenyl ring and two protons such that they add up to they are we can distinguish between these three possible structures on the basis of the splitting patterns observed and expected from the coupling of the alkenic and methyl protons the observed splittings are shown in expanded form inset in figure and the three mutually coupled groups are labeled as a b and c coupling between a and b designated by the constant
