a and b resonances is sixteen for a and for b in fact only eleven are visible for a and for b which means that some of the sixteen possible lines must overlap without examining all possibilities we can see that the actual situation can be reproduced if the only structure that is consistent with is or phenylpropene the other possibilities are excluded because should be about for and for k chemicalshift effects on spinspin splitting the simple rule for predicting the multiplicity of spincoupled proton signals often breaks down whenever the chemicalshift difference between the protons in different groups
