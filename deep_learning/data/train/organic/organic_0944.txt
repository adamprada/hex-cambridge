the proton nmr spectra may have so many closely spaced resonance lines that they merge together to give a series of smooth moreorless featureless peaks the proton spectrum of octane figure a is an excellent example of this type of spectrum useful information often can be obtained from such spectra as to the ratio of by investigation of the integrals over the range of alkane proton absorptions figure illustrates how this can be done for octane and trimethylpentane figure proton nmr spectra of a octane and b trimethylpentane at relative to tms as standard the upper left curve of b
