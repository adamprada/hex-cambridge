figure as between the corresponding proton shifts and electronegativity figure it is important to notice that shifts in units are much larger than those of protons this is because carbon uses orbitals in forming bonds whereas hydrogen uses orbitals we therefore will expect to find the the nuclei of other elements that use orbitals in bonding such as and also will have larger shifts than for protons as indeed they do figure carbon chemical shift differences for c and c of derivatives as a function of pauling electronegativity the methyl carbons of derivatives are downfield from the of tms a
