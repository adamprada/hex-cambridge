spectra were taken protons were simultaneously subjected to strong irradiation at their resonance frequency which as far as spinspin splitting goes causes them to act as nonmagnetic nuclei such as and this doubleresonance technique for removing the splittings is called proton decoupling see section i figure protondecoupled nmr spectrum at of the upfield region of a the sodium salt of warfarin showing on the right side the resonances of c c and c this part of the spectrum can be compared with the more complete spectrum b of warfarin itself and the gaggle of evenly spaced sharp peaks toward the
