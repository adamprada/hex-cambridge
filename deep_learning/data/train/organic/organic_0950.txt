elements like hydrogen boron aluminum sulfur and phosphorus why are some substances chemically bonded molecules and others are an association of ions the answer to this question depends upon the electronic structures of the atoms and nature of the chemical forces within the compounds although there are no sharply defined boundaries chemical bonds are typically classified into three main types ionic bonds covalent bonds and metallic bonds in this chapter each type of bond will be discussed and the general properties found in typical substances in which the bond type occurs ionic bonds results from electrostatic forces that exist between
