in the octet rule making it a useful rule for the main group elements elements not in the transition metal or innertransition metal blocks an octet in these atoms corresponds to an electron configurations ending with sp covalent bonds covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons hydrogen is a first shell element with only one valence electron so it can only form one bond creating a duet an exception to the octet rule with its four valence electrons carbon can form four bonds to create an octet normally two electrons pairs up and forms a bond eg for most atoms
