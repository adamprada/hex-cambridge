charge while fulfilling an octet in the valence shell ionic bonds some atoms do not share electrons energetically it is more favorable to fully gain or lose electrons to form ions ionic compounds form through the eletrostatic attraction of the ions to create a crystal lattice the formula for table salt is nacl it is the result of na ions and cl ions bonding together if sodium metal and chlorine gas mix under the right conditions they will form salt the sodium loses an electron and the chlorine gains that electron in the process a great amount of light and
