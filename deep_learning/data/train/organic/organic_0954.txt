been satisfied if chlorine gave up all seven of its valence electrons and sodium took them in that case both would have the electron configurations of noble gasses with a full valence shell however their charges would be much higher it would be na and cl which is much less stable than na and cl atoms are more stable when they have no charge or a small charge ionic bonds example lewis dot symbols can also be used to represent the ions in ionic compounds the reaction of cesium with fluorine for example to produce the ionic compound csf can
