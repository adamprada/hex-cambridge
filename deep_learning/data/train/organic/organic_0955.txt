anion and its electrons are enclosed in brackets this notation emphasizes that the ions are associated electrostatically no electrons are shared between the two elements noble gases the noble gases rarely form compounds they have the most stable configuration full octet no charge so they have no reason to react and change their configuration all other elements attempt to gain lose or share electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration summary lewis dot symbols can be used to predict the number of bonds formed by most elements in their compounds one convenient way to predict the number and basic arrangement
