basic sn case first the leaving group is an alkoxide anion because there is no acid available to protonate the oxygen prior to ring opening an alkoxide is a poor leaving group and thus the ring is unlikely to open without a push from the nucleophile the nucleophile itself is potent a deprotonated negatively charged methoxide ion when a nucleophilic substitution reaction involves a poor leaving group and a powerful nucleophile it is very likely to proceed by an sn mechanism what about the electrophile there are two electrophilic carbons in the epoxide but the best target for the nucleophile
