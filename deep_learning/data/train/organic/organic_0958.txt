substituted carbon with greater carbocation stability unlike in an sn reaction the nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic carbon step before a complete carbocation intermediate has a chance to form reaction takes place preferentially from the backside like in an sn reaction because the carbonoxygen bond is still to some degree in place and the oxygen blocks reaction from the front side notice however the regiochemical outcome is different from the basecatalyzed reaction in the acidcatalyzed process the nucleophile reacts with the more substituted carbon because it is this carbon that holds a greater degree of positive charge and electrostatics carbocation
