of the epoxide carbons is tertiary the halogen anion will primarily attack the tertialy cabon in a sn like reaction example exercise given the following predict the product assuming only the epoxide is affected remember stereochemistry predict the product of the following similar to above but a different nucleophile is used and not in acidic conditions remember stereochemistry epoxides are often very useful reagents to use in synthesis when the desired product is a single stereoisomer if the following alkene were reacted with an oxyacid to form an epoxide would the result be a enantiomerically pure if not what would
