to the light source a sample cell holder is located in line with the light beam followed by a movable polarizer the analyzer and an eyepiece through which the light intensity can be observed in modern instruments an electronic light detector takes the place of the human eye in the absence of a sample the light intensity at the detector is at a maximum when the second movable polarizer is set parallel to the first polarizer ฮฑ ยบ if the analyzer is turned ยบ to the plane of initial polarization all the light will be blocked from reaching the detector
