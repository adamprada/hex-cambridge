and the analyzer has been turned this amount to permit maximum light transmission the observed rotations of enantiomers are opposite in direction one enantiomer will rotate polarized light in a clockwise direction termed dextrorotatory or and its mirrorimage partner in a counterclockwise manner termed levorotatory or the prefixes dextro and levo come from the latin dexter meaning right and laevus for left and are abbreviated d and l respectively if equal quantities of each enantiomer are examined using the same sample cell then the magnitude of the rotations will be the same with one being positive and the other negative
