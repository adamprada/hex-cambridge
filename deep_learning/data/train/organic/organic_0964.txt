to compensate for variations in sample quantity and cell length thus it is common practice to convert the observed rotation Î± to a specific rotation by the following formula where is the specific rotation is the cell length in dm is the concentration in gml designates that the light used is the line from a sodium lamp compounds that rotate the plane of polarized light are termed optically active each enantiomer of a stereoisomeric pair is optically active and has an equal but oppositeinsign specific rotation specific rotations are useful in that they are experimentally determined constants that characterize and
