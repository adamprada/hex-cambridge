or racemic modifications and are designated when chiral compounds are created from achiral compounds the products are racemic unless a single enantiomer of a chiral coreactant or catalyst is involved in the reaction the addition of hbr to either cis or transbutene is an example of racemic product formation the chiral center is colored red in the following equation chchchch hbr chchchbrch chiral organic compounds isolated from living organisms are usually optically active indicating that one of the enantiomers predominates often it is the only isomer present this is a result of the action of chiral catalysts we call enzymes
