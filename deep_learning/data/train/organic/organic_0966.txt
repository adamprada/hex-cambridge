enantiomer it is expressed as a percentage if the sample only rotates planepolarized light half as much as expected the optical purity is because r and s enantiomers have equal but opposite optical activity it naturally follows that a racemic mixture of two enantiomers will have no observable optical activity if we know the specific rotation for a chiral molecule however we can easily calculate the ratio of enantiomers present in a mixture of two enantiomers based on its measured optical activity when a mixture contains more of one enantiomer than the other chemists often use the concept of enantiomeric
