pure s enantiomer is given as dextrorotary positive clockwise meaning that the pure r enantiomer must be levorotary and the mixture must contain more of the r enantiomer than of the s enantiomer rotation rs mix fractions rotation s fractionr rotation r let fraction s x therefore fraction r x rotation rs mix xrotation s xrotation r x x solve for x x and x therefore the percentages of r and scarvone in the sample are and respectively ee more abundant enantiomer chiral molecules are often labeled according to the sign of their specific rotation as in scarvone and rcarvone
