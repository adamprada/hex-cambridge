is extremely difficult diastereomers on the other hand have different physical properties and this fact is used to achieve resolution of racemates reaction of a racemate with an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent gives a mixture of diastereomers which can be separated for example if a racemic mixture of a chiral alcohol is reacted with a enantiomerically pure carboxylic acid the result is a mixture of diastereomers in this case because the pure r entantiomer of the acid was used the product is a mixture of rr and rs diastereomeric esters which can in theory be separated by their different physical
