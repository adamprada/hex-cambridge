of a light beam having electrical and magnetic field vectors oscillating in a single plane the plane of polarization can be determined by an instrument called a polarimeter shown in the diagram below monochromatic single wavelength light is polarized by a fixed polarizer next to the light source a sample cell holder is located in line with the light beam followed by a movable polarizer the analyzer and an eyepiece through which the light intensity can be observed in modern instruments an electronic light detector takes the place of the human eye in the absence of a sample the light
