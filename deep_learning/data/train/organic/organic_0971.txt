rotated in either a clockwise positive or counterclockwise negative direction and the analyzer must be turned an appropriate matching angle ฮฑ if full light intensity is to reach the detector in the above illustration the sample has rotated the polarization plane clockwise by ยบ and the analyzer has been turned this amount to permit maximum light transmission the observed rotations of enantiomers are opposite in direction one enantiomer will rotate polarized light in a clockwise direction termed dextrorotatory or and its mirrorimage partner in a counterclockwise manner termed levorotatory or the prefixes dextro and levo come from the latin dexter
