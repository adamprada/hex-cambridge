would change to º or º while the negative rotation would change to º and the correct α would be identified unambiguously since it is not always possible to obtain or use samples of exactly the same size the observed rotation is usually corrected to compensate for variations in sample quantity and cell length thus it is common practice to convert the observed rotation α to a specific rotation by the following formula where is the specific rotation is the cell length in dm is the concentration in gml designates that the light used is the line from a sodium
