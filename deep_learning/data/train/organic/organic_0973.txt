isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or dlactic acid lactic acid from sour milk αd º this isomer may be referred to as lactic acid or llactic acid a mixture of enantiomers has no observable optical activity such mixtures are called racemates or racemic modifications and are designated when chiral compounds are created from achiral compounds the products are racemic unless a single enantiomer of a chiral coreactant or catalyst is involved in the reaction the addition of hbr to either cis or transbutene is an example of racemic product formation the chiral center is colored red in
