called resolution a pure enantiomer may be transformed into its racemate this process is called racemization enantiomeric excess the optical purity is a comparison of the optical rotation of a pure sample of unknown stereochemistry versus the optical rotation of a sample of pure enantiomer it is expressed as a percentage if the sample only rotates planepolarized light half as much as expected the optical purity is because r and s enantiomers have equal but opposite optical activity it naturally follows that a racemic mixture of two enantiomers will have no observable optical activity if we know the specific rotation
