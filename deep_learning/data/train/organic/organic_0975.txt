s carvone is measured at which enantiomer is in excess and what is its ee what are the percentages of r and scarvone in the sample solution the observed rotation of the mixture is levorotary negative counterclockwise and the specific rotation of the pure s enantiomer is given as dextrorotary positive clockwise meaning that the pure r enantiomer must be levorotary and the mixture must contain more of the r enantiomer than of the s enantiomer rotation rs mix fractions rotation s fractionr rotation r let fraction s x therefore fraction r x rotation rs mix xrotation s xrotation r
