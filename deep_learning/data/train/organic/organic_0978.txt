solution in water an acid in solution sets up this equilibrium a hydronium ion is formed together with the anion negative ion from the acid this equilibrium is sometimes simplified by leaving out the water to emphasize the ionization of the acid if you write it like this you must include the state symbols aq writing haq implies that the hydrogen ion is attached to a water molecule as ho hydrogen ions are always attached to something during chemical reactions the organic acids are weak in the sense that this ionization is very incomplete at any one time most of
