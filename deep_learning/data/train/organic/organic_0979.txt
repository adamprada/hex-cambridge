polarized as shown by the lighter blue color around the hydrogen making it less acidic than methanol however the ch bond in ethane lack virtually any polarity as shown by the lack of a blue color making it nonacidic the following discussion will explain the difference in acidity of these and other organic molecules molecules comparing the strengths of weak acids acid strength is strongly correlated to stability of the conjugate base that will form by removing a proton in order to analyze how acidic a molecule is likely to be then you need to estimate the stability of its
