these electrons have comparable energy so this factor does not help us discern differences relative stability differences in electronegativity are now the dominant factor this trend is shown when comparing the pka values of ethane methyl amine and methanol which reflects the relative electonegativities of the c n o the key to understanding this trend is to consider the hypothetical conjugate base in each case the more stable the conjugate base the stronger the acid in general the more electronegative an atom the better it is able to bear a negative charge in the ethyl anion the negative charge is
