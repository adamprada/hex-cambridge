the electrons are occupying higher energy subshells creating a larger atomic size and volume as the volume of an element increases any negative charge present tends to become more spread out which decreases electron density and increases stability the figure below shows spheres representing the atoms of the s and p blocks from the periodic table to scale showing the two trends for the atomic radius figure atomic radii trends on the periodic table although there are some reversals in the trend eg see po in the bottom row atoms generally get smaller as you go across the periodic table
