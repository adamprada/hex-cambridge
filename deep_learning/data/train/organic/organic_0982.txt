when looking at the electrostatic potential maps for methanol left and methanethiol right the sulfur atom methanethiol is larger than the oxygen atom in methanol the larger size of sulfur will be better able to delocalize and stabelize the negative charge in its conjugate base metanethiolate resonance effects in acidity this section will focus on how the resonance structures of different organic groups contributes to their relative acidity even though the same element acts as the proton donor when evaluating conjugate bases for the presence of resonance contributors remember to look for movable electrons lone pairs and pi bonding electrons
