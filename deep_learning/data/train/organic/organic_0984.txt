a greater polarization in the oh bond in acetic acid as shown by its darker blue color why is phenol acidic compounds like alcohols and phenol which contain an oh group attached to a hydrocarbon are very weak acids alcohols are so weakly acidic that for normal lab purposes their acidity can be virtually ignored however phenol is sufficiently acidic for it to have recognizably acidic properties even if it is still a very weak acid a hydrogen ion can break away from the oh group and transfer to a base for example in aqueous solution since phenol is a
