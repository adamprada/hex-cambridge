no longer entirely localized on the oxygen but is spread out around the whole ion spreading the charge around makes the ion more stable than it would be if all the charge remained on the oxygen however oxygen is the most electronegative element in the ion and the delocalized electrons will be drawn towards it that means that there will still be a lot of charge around the oxygen which will tend to attract the hydrogen ion back again that is why phenol is only a very weak acid this explains why phenol is a much stronger acid than cyclohexanol
