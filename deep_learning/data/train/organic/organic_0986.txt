the conjugate bases of simple alcohols are not stabilized by charge delocalization so the acidity of these compounds is similar to that of water an energy diagram showing the effect of resonance on cyclohexanol and phenol acidities is shown on the right since the resonance stabilization of the phenolate conjugate base is much greater than the stabilization of phenol itself the acidity of phenol relative to cyclohexanol is increased supporting evidence that the phenolate negative charge is delocalized on the ortho and para carbons of the benzene ring comes from the influence of electronwithdrawing substituents at those sites acidity of
