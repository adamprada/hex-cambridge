effects the inductive effect is an experimentally observed effect of the transmission of charge through a chain of atoms in a molecule resulting in a permanent dipole in a bond for example in a carboxylic acid group the presence of chlorine on adjacent carbons increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid group a chlorine atom is more electronegative than hydrogen and thus is able to induce or pull electron density towards itself away from the carboxylate group this further spreads out the electron density of the conjugate base which has a stabilizing effect in this context the chlorine substituent is
