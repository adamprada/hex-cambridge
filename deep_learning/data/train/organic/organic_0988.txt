blue color this illustrates that tricholoracetic acid is a much stronger acid than acetic acid because the inductive effect depends on electronegativity fluorine substituents have a more pronounced pkalowering effect than chlorine substituents in addition the inductive takes place through covalent bonds and its influence decreases markedly with distance thus a chlorine two carbons away from a carboxylic acid group has a decreased effect compared to a chlorine just one carbon away chloropropanoic acid has a pka of while for chloropropanoic acid the pka is alkyl groups hydrocarbons are weak inductive electron donators in this case the inductive effect pushes
