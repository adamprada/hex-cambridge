are more electronegative than the lobed p orbitals the relative electronegativity of hybridized orbitals is sp sp sp since the percentage of scharacter is decreasing as more porbitals are added to the hybrids this trend indicates the sp hybridized orbitals are more stable with a negative charge than sp hybridized orbitals the table below shows how orbital hybridization influences relative acidity comparing the strengths of weak bases technically organic bases are characterized by the presence of an atom with lone pair electrons these lone pairs contain a high electron density which is shown red in the electrostatic potential maps and
