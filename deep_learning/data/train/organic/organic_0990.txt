acidity recall that ammonia nh acts as a base because the nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons that can accept a proton the conjugate acid of most simple alkyl amines have pkas in the range to and their water solutions are basic have a ph of to depending on concentration this can be illustrated by the reaction below where an amine removes a proton from water to form substituted ammonium eg nh ions and hydroxide oh ions amines are one of the only neutral functional groups which are considered basic this is a direct consequence of the presence
