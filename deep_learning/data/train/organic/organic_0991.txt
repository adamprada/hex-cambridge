hydrogen ions protons we are going to get a measure of this by looking at how easily the bases take hydrogen ions from water molecules when they are in solution in water ammonia in solution sets up this equilibrium an ammonium ion is formed together with hydroxide ions because the ammonia is only a weak base it doesnt hang on to the extra hydrogen ion very effectively and so the reaction is reversible at any one time about of the ammonia is present as unreacted molecules the position of equilibrium lies well to the left the ammonia reacts as a
