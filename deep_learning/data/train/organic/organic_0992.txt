effects of electron delocalization discussed above table pka of conjugate acids of a series of amines compound nh chcn pka inductive effects in nitrogen basicity alkylamines are more basic than ammonia since alkyl groups donate electrons to the more electronegative nitrogen this inductive effect makes the electron density on the alkylamine nitrogen greater than the nitrogen of ammonium that means that there will be a small amount of extra negative charge built up on the nitrogen atom that extra negativity around the nitrogen makes the lone pair even more attractive towards hydrogen ions correspondingly primary secondary and tertiary alkyl amines
