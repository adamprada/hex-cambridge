in methylamine than in ammonia and so it picks up a hydrogen ion more readily the ion formed from methylamine is more stable than the one formed from ammonia and so is less likely to shed the hydrogen ion again taken together these mean that methylamine is a stronger base than ammonia compound pka nh chnh chnh chn resonance effects in nitrogen basicity the resonance effect also explains why a nitrogen atom is basic when it is in an amine but not significantly basic when it is part of an amide group while the lone pair of electrons in an
