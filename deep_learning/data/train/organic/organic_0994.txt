lone pair electrons on the nitrogen in an amide aniline the amine analog of phenol is substantially less basic than an amine as evidenced by the pka of the conjugate acids we can use the same reasoning that we used when comparing the acidity of a phenol to that of an alcohol in aniline the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic pi system making it less available for bonding and thus less basic in these cases you seem to be breaking the same oxygenhydrogen bond each time and so you might expect the
