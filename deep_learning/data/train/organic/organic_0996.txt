hbond donors the strongly electronegative elements primarily nitrogen oxygen and fluorine will always form a relatively large partial negative charge when bonded with carbon these elements can accept hbonds when they are part of the organic molecule in this situation there is only one hbonding interaction the diagram below illustrates the similarities and differences between hbond donors and hbond acceptors water and alcohols may serve as both donors and acceptors whereas ethers aldehydes ketones and esters can function only as acceptors similarly primary and secondary amines are both donors and acceptors but tertiary amines function only as acceptors exercise classify
