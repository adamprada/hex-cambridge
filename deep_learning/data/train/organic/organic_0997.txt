ºc ethylene diamine hnchchnh ºc ºc alcohols boil cosiderably higher than comparably sized ethers first two entries and isomeric º º ºamines respectively show decreasing boiling points with the two hydrogen bonding isomers being substantially higher boiling than the ºamine entries to also oho hydrogen bonds are clearly stronger than nhn hydrogen bonds as we see by comparing propanol with the amines as expected the presence of two hydrogen bonding functions in a compound raises the boiling point even further acetic acid the ninth entry is an interesting case a dimeric species shown on the right held together by two
