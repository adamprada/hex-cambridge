addition to unsymmetrical alkenes in terms of reaction conditions and the factors affecting the rates of the reaction there is no difference whatsoever between these alkenes and the symmetrical ones described above the problem comes with the orientation of the addition in other words which way around the hydrogen and the halogen add across the double bond orientation of addition if hcl adds to an unsymmetrical alkene like propene there are two possible ways it could add however in practice there is only one major product this is in line with markovnikovs rule which says when a compound hx is
