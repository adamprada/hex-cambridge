amounts than the others the overall reaction is said to be regioselective say three reactions could occur between the hypothetical reactants a and b under the same conditions giving the constitutionally isomeric products c d and e there are two possibilities the three products form in equal amounts ie of the total product is c another d the remaining e these percentages are called relative yields of the products if this is what is observed the overall reaction between a and b is not regioselective one product forms in greater amounts than the others say for example the relative yields
