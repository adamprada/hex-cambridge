ozonolysis produces aldehydes and ketones while kmno can oxidize all the way to to carbon dioxide and carboxylic acid diol cleavage is another example of a redox reaction periodic acid hio is reduced to iodic acid hio ozonolysis is a method of oxidatively cleaving alkenes or alkynes using ozone a reactive allotrope of oxygen the process allows for carboncarbon double or triple bonds to be replaced by double bonds with oxygen this reaction is often used to identify the structure of unknown alkenes by breaking them down into smaller more easily identifiable pieces ozonolysis also occurs naturally and would break
