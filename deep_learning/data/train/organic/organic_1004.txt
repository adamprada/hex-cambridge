the molozonide intermediate due to the unstable molozonide molecule it continues further with the reaction and breaks apart to form a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide molecule step the carbonyl and the carbonyl oxide rearranges itself and reforms to create the stable ozonide intermediate a reductive workup could then be performed to convert convert the ozonide molecule into the desired carbonyl products references vollhardt k schore n organic chemistry structure and function th ed new york ny w h freeman and company shore n study guide and solutions manual for organic chemistry th ed new york ny wh freeman and
