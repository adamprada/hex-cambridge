the specific details of these different reaction pathways lets look at the overall patterns of functional group reactivity the are four levels of oxidation for alkenes the gentlest and least oxidative is epoxide oxacyclopropane formation in which the vinyl carbons share a single oxygen atom as a three membered ring moderate oxidation will convert the alkene into a vicinal diol in which each vinyl carbon is bonded to an independent oxygen atom the stronger oxidative reactions cleave the carbon chain at the alkene while the overall chemical process is an oxidation reaction the workup second step of the reaction can
