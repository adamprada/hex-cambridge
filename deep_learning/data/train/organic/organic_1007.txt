of having an electropositive oxygen atom on the cooh group the reaction is initiated by the electrophilic oxygen atom reacting with the nucleophilic carboncarbon double bond the mechanism involves a concerted reaction with a fourpart circular transition state the result is that the originally electropositive oxygen atom ends up in the oxacyclopropane ring and the cooh group becomes coh mechanism the mechanism is a concerted reaction between the alkene and peroxyacid as seen with other concerted reactions it is stereospecific a cisalkene will produce a cisepoxide and a trans alkene will produce a transepoxide peroxycarboxylic acids are generally unstable an
