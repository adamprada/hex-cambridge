on neighboring carbons for more explanation of how this reaction leads to vicinal diols see below however in a nonaqueous solvent the hydrolysis is prevented and the epoxide ring can be isolated as the product reaction yields from this reaction are usually about the reaction rate is affected by the nature of the alkene with more nucleophilic double bonds resulting in faster reactions example since the transfer of oxygen is to the same side of the double bond the resulting oxacyclopropane ring will have the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene a good way to think of this is that
