to prepare a given epoxide write the equation for the hydroxylation of an alkene using osmium tetroxide and draw the structure of the cyclic intermediate draw the structure of the diol formed from the reaction of a given alkene with osmium tetroxide identify the alkene the reagents or both that must be used to prepare a given diol key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below diol glycol hydroxylation oxacyclopropane rings also called epoxide rings are useful reagents that may be opened by further reaction to form anti vicinal diols one way
