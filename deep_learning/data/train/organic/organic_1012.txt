starting alkene a good way to think of this is that the alkene is rotated so that some constituents are coming forward and some are behind then the oxygen is inserted on top see the product of the above reaction one way the epoxide ring can be opened is by an acid catalyzed oxidationhydrolysis oxidationhydrolysis gives a vicinal diol a molecule with oh groups on neighboring carbons for this reaction the dihydroxylation is anti since due to steric hindrance the ring is attacked from the side opposite the existing oxygen atom thus if the starting alkene is trans the resulting
