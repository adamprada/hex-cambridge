constitutes an anti dihydroxylation of an alkene when an alkene reacts with osmium tetroxide stereocenters can form in the glycol product cis alkenes give meso products and trans alkenes give racemic mixtures is formed slowly when osmium powder reacts with gasoues at ambient temperature reaction of bulk solid requires heating to c since osmium tetroxide is expensive and highly toxic the reaction with alkenes has been modified catalytic amounts of oso and stoichiometric amounts of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide are now used to eliminate some hazards also an older reagent that was used instead of oso was
