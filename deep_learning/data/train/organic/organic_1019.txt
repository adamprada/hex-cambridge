will leave terminal carbons partially oxidized to aldehydes strong cleavage of alkenes will fully oxidize terminal carbons to carboxylic acids internal carbons become ketones by either reaction pathway why so many reactions at first glance it may seem silly to have more than more reaction pathway for the same functional group conversion as this course proceeds it will become necessary to target reactions to a single functional group of an organic compound with multiple functional groups a particular reaction pathway can be advantageous when the reactivity of the entire molecule is considered not just a single functional group gentle cleavage
