alkenes by breaking them down into smaller more easily identifiable pieces ozonolysis also occurs naturally and would break down repeated units used in rubber and other polymers on an industrial scale azelaic acid and pelargonic acids are produced from ozonolysis ozonolysis reaction mechanism the gaseous ozone is first passed through the desired alkene solution in either methanol or dichloromethane the first intermediate product is an ozonide molecule which is then further reduced to carbonyl products this results in the breaking of the carboncarbon double bond and is replaced by a carbonoxygen double bond instead step the first step in the
