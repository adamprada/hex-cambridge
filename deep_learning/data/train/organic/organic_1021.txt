with carboxylic acids on terminal carbons the two reaction workup conditions are summarized below exercises answers strong cleavage from strong oxidative reactions when the reaction conditions for potassium permanganate are warm then the oxidation reaction is stronger and cleavage occurs at the alkene with any terminal carbons fully oxidizing to carboxylic acids when the ozonolysis reaction is followed by an oxidative workup then any terminal carbons will oxidize fully to the carboxylic acid as shown in the example below the example for methylcycohexene is shown below exercise what would you expect the products to be from the reaction of cispentene
