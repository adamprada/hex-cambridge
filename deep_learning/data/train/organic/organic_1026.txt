to one or other sterics and electrostatics are primary considerations when learning the reactions of organic chemistry sterics is the spatial arrangement dimensional structure of atoms in a molecule or ion electrostatics is the the charge distribution within a molecule or ion depending on the reaction mechanism either sterics or electrostatics charge stabilization will play a dominant role in the rate determining step for concerted onestep reactions sterics will strongly influence the orientation of reactants in the transition state for twostep reactions there is typically a charged intermediate that requires stabilization for the reaction to proceed the intermediate with the
