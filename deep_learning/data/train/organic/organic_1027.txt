of covalent compounds which is important in determining the sterics of the reactions while molecular orbital mo theory is good for understanding bonding in general and the electrostatics of a reactant intermediate or product electrostatics are determined by applying the same concepts used to determine the relative acidity of compounds by evaluating the electron density of their conjugate bases the less charge the more stable an ion is the stability of ions is determined by the identity of the element being ionized charge delocalization via resonance inductive effects and orbital hybridization inductive effects can be electron withdrawing aka electronegative or
