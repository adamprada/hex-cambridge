range of to gml alkenes float on top of water solubility alkenes are virtually insoluble in water but dissolve in organic solvents the reasons for this are exactly the same as for the alkanes boiling points the boiling point of each alkene is very similar to that of the alkane with the same number of carbon atoms boiling points of alkenes depend on more molecular mass chain length the more intermolecular mass is added the higher the boiling point intermolecular forces of alkenes gets stronger with increase in the size of the molecules in each case the alkene has a
