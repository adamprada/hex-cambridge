cis isomers molecules are package in a ubending shape therefore will display a lower melting points to that of the trans isomers this effect is notable when comparing the melting points of fats and oils the differences in the melting points is strongly influenced by the long hydrocarbon tails oils have a greater number of cis double bonds and exist as liquids at room temperature whereas fats are primarily saturated and exist as solids at room temperature compound melting points c ethene propene butene pentene transpentene cispentene heptene octene nonene decene exercise draw the bondline structures for the following compounds
