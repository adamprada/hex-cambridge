explain predict the physical properties of alkanes including relative bp and solubility in a mixture overview alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity all alkanes are colorless and odorless nonpolar compounds the relative weak london dispersion forces of alkanes result in gaseous substances for short carbon chains volatile liquids with densities around gml for moderate carbon chains and solids for long carbon chains the differences in the physical states occurs because there is a direct relationship between the size and shape of molecules and the strength of the intermolecular forces imfs because alkanes have relatively predictable physical
