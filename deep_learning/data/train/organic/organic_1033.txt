that are approximately k higher than the corresponding straight chain alkane there is not a significant electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen thus there is not any significant bond polarity the molecules themselves also have very little polarity a totally symmetrical molecule like methane is completely nonpolar meaning that the only attractions between one molecule and its neighbors will be van der waals dispersion forces these forces will be very small for a molecule like methane but will increase as the molecules get bigger therefore the boiling points of the alkanes increase with molecular size where you have isomers the
