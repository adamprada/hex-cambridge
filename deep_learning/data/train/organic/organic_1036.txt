closer gas densities and fire hazards table indicates that the first four members of the alkane series are gases at ordinary temperatures natural gas is composed chiefly of methane which has a density of about gl the density of air is about gl because natural gas is less dense than air it rises when a naturalgas leak is detected and shut off in a room the gas can be removed by opening an upper window on the other hand bottled gas can be either propane density gl or butanes a mixture of butane and isobutane density about gl both are
