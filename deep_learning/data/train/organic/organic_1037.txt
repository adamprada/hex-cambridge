points of alkanes are relatively low because these nonpolar molecules have only weak dispersion forces to hold them together in the liquid state looking closer an alkane basis for properties of other compounds an understanding of the physical properties of the alkanes is important in that petroleum and natural gas and the many products derived from themgasoline bottled gas solvents plastics and moreare composed primarily of alkanes this understanding is also vital because it is the basis for describing the properties of other organic and biological compound families for example large portions of the structures of lipids consist of nonpolar
