series from those of its neighbors for example the boiling points of hexane and heptane are and respectively thus a difference in structure of one group for these compounds makes a difference in boiling point of we would predict the boiling point of the next higher member octane to be which is close to the actual boiling point of figure dependence on of melting points boiling points and densities of continuouschain alkanes members of a group of compounds such as the alkanes that have similar chemical structures and graded physical properties and which differ from one another by the number
