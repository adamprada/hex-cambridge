series of continuouschain alkanes changes with the number of carbons branchedchain alkanes do not exhibit the same smooth gradation of physical properties as do the continuouschain alkanes usually there is too great a variation in molecular structure for regularities to be apparent nevertheless in any one set of isomeric hydrocarbons volatility increases with increased branching this can be seen from the data in table which lists the physical properties of the five hexane isomers the most striking feature of the data is the difference between the boiling points of hexane and dimethylbutane homology hardly can be overestimated as a practical
