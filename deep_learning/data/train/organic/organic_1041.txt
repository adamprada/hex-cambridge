volatility raises melting points increases solubility in polar liquids and decreases solubility in nonpolar liquids this explains why methanol is much less volatile and much more watersoluble than methane but we find that the watersolubility of alcohols falls off rapidly with the length of the carbon chain certainly faster than expected for a simple homologous series effect whereas methanol and ethanol are completely soluble in water butanol is only slightly soluble this illustrates the conflicting properties conferred on molecules by polar groups compare to nonpolar hydrocarbon groups and points up that large changes in physical properties can be expected in
