you should be able to explain how dipole moments depend on both molecular shape and bond polarity predict whether a molecule will possess a dipole moment from the molecular formula or structure use the presence or absence of a dipole moment as an aid to deducing the structure of a given compound key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below dipole moment study notes you must be able to combine your knowledge of molecular shapes and bond polarities to determine whether or not a given compound will have a dipole moment conversely
