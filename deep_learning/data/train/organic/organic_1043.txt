are vectors they possess both a magnitude and a direction the dipole moment of a molecule is therefore the vector sum of the dipole moments of the individual bonds in the molecule if the individual bond dipole moments cancel one another there is no net dipole moment such is the case for co a linear molecule figure each co bond in co is polar yet experiments show that the co molecule has no dipole moment because the two co bond dipoles in co are equal in magnitude and oriented at to each other they cancel as a result the co
