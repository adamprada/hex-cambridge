give an overall molecular dipole moment for two triatomic molecules with different structures a in co the co bond dipoles are equal in magnitude but oriented in opposite directions at their vector sum is zero so co therefore has no net dipole b in ho the oh bond dipoles are also equal in magnitude but they are oriented at to each other hence the vector sum is not zero and ho has a net dipole moment the following is a simplified equation for a simple separated twocharge system that is present in diatomic molecules or when considering a bond dipole
