length of a typical covalent bond the dipole moment is calculated as is a key reference value and represents a pure charge of and separated by pm however if the charge separation were increased then the dipole moment increases linearly if the proton and electron were separated by pm if the proton and electron were separated by pm if the proton and electron were separated by pm example water the water molecule in figure can be used to determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment from the electronegativities of oxygen and hydrogen the difference is e for each
