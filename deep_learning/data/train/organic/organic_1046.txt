molecule is the bond moment of oh bond d so the net dipole moment is dipoles with differing atoms in more complex molecules with more than one polar covalent bonds the threedimensional geometry and the compounds symmetry determine whether the molecule has a net dipole moment the manner in which the individual bonds contribute to the dipole moment of the molecule is nicely illustrated by the series of chloromethanes shown below the electronegative chlorine draws electrons towards itself consider left panel in figure below which as a molecule is not polar in the sense that it doesnt have an end
