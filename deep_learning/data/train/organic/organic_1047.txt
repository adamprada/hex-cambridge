less electronegative than carbon and so is slightly positive this means that the molecule now has a slightly positive top and a slightly negative bottom and so is overall a polar molecule figure bond polarities for ccl left and chclright electron densities in a molecule and the dipole moments that unbalanced electron distributions can produce are easily visualized with electrostatic potential maps in this example the blue area centered on carbon represents a electrondeficient positive area of the molecule the red area centered on the chlorine represents a electronabundant negative area this charge separation creates a net dipole moment of
