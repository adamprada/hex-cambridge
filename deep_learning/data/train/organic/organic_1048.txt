bond dipole moments completely cancel and there is no net dipole moment however although a molecule like chcl has a tetrahedral geometry the atoms bonded to carbon are not identical consequently the bond dipole moments do not cancel one another and the result is a molecule which has a dipole moment figure molecules with polar bonds individual bond dipole moments are indicated in red due to their different threedimensional structures some molecules with polar bonds have a net dipole moment hcl cho nh and chcl indicated in purple whereas others do not because the bond dipole moments cancel bcl ccl
