moment despite the fact that they are made up of polar covalent bonds in structures with highly symmetrical molecular geometries the polar bonds and the lone pair electrons can can exactly cancel leaving no overall charge separation exercise which of the molecules below have molecular dipole moments answer only molecule b does not have a molecular dipole due to its symmetry bond dipoles are equal and in opposite directions add texts here exercise draw out the line structure of the molecule with a molecular formula of ccl indicate all of the individual bond polarities and predict if the molecule is
