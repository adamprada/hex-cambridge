is more electronegative than the carbon and therefore creates a dipole along the bond this leads to having a partial positive charge on the carbon and the reduction can take place exercise which molecules has a net dipole moment hs nhf bf answer strategy for each threedimensional molecular geometry predict whether the bond dipoles cancel if they do not then the molecule has a net dipole moment solution the total number of electrons around the central atom s is eight which gives four electron pairs two of these electron pairs are bonding pairs and two are lone pairs so the
