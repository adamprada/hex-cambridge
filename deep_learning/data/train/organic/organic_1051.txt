lone pair of electrons on nitrogen the molecular geometry of bf is trigonal planar because all the bf bonds are equal and the molecule is highly symmetrical the dipoles cancel one another in threedimensional space thus bf has a net dipole moment of zero additional exercises determine whether each of the compounds listed below possesses a dipole moment for the polar compounds indicate the direction of the dipole moment answers questions q the following molecule has no dipole moment in the molecule itself explain q which of the following molecules has a net dipole q within reactions with carbonyls such
