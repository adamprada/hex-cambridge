which atoms carry a partial positive charge and which a partial negative charge consider the chloromethane chcl molecule the carbon atom is shown as carrying a partial positive charge now recall that opposite charges attract thus it seems reasonable that the slightly positive carbon atom in chloromethane should be susceptible to attack by a negatively charged species such as the hydroxide ion oh this theory is borne out in practice hydroxide ions react with chloromethane by attacking the slightly positive carbon atom in the latter it is often possible to rationalize chemical reactions in this manner and you will find
