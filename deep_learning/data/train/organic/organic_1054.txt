a chemical compound elements with high electronegativities tend to acquire electrons in chemical reactions and are found in the upper right corner of the periodic table elements with low electronegativities tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions and are found in the lower left corner of the periodic table electronegativity of an atom is not a simple fixed property that can be directly measured in a single experiment in fact an atoms electronegativity should depend to some extent on its chemical environment because the properties of an atom are influenced by the neighboring atoms in a chemical compound nevertheless when
