tend to have the highest electronegativities with fluorine the most electronegative element of all en as previously noted it is important to notice that the elements most important to organic chemistry carbon nitrogen and oxygen have some of the highest electronegativites in the periodic table en respectively metals on the left tend to be less electronegative elements with cesium having the lowest en note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom in
