are distributed between the two atoms in a polar covalent bond the more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds the larger its electronegativity electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom thus the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge the greater the difference in electronegativity the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms recall that a lowercase greek delta δ is used to indicate that a bonded atom possesses a partial positive charge indicated by δ or a partial negative
