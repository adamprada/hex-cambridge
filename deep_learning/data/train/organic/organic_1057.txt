is large the bond is polar covalent or ionic the absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds hh hcl and nacl are nonpolar polar covalent and ionic respectively the degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies from completely equal pure covalent bonding to not at all ionic bonding figure shows the relationship between electronegativity difference and bond type this table is just a general guide however with many exceptions the best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the types of atoms involved and their relative positions
