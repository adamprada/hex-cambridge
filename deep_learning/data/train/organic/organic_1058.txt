attraction between the ions k and no as well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in no example electronegativity and bond polarity bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of proteins using the electronegativity values in table a arrange the following covalent bondsall commonly found in amino acidsin order of increasing polarity then designate the positive and negative atoms using the symbols δ and δ ch cn co nh oh sh solution the polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the electronegativity difference increases the atom with the δ designation is the
