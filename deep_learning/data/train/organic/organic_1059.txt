the electronpoor an example is shown in the molecule fluoromethane the cf bond is polarized drawing the bonding electrons toward the more electronegative fluorine giving it a partial negative charge consequently the bonding electrons are drawn away from the less electronegative carbon giving it a partial positive charge the the electronrich fluorine is shown as red in the electrostatic potential map and while the electronpoor carbon is shown as blue the crossed arrow points in the direction of the electronrich fluorine chemists often use the term inductive effect to describe the shifting of electrons in a sigma by the electronegativity
