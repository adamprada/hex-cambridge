in methyl lithium and the potassium oxygen bond in potassium tertbutoxide methyl lithium potassium tertbutoxide summary covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of both atoms in pure covalent bonds the electrons are shared equally in polar covalent bonds the electrons are shared unequally as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other the ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity the difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be
