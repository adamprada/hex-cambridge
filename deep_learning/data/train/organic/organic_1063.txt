section you should be able to identify the positive and negative ends of the bonds present in the common functional groups explain how bond polarity can be enhanced by the interaction of a functional group with a solvent metal cation or acid explain how the polarizability of an atom can be an important factor in determining the reactivity of a bond describe the heterolytic bondbreaking process use curved curly arrows to indicate the movement of electron pairs during bond breakage and bond formation predict whether a given species compound or ion is likely to behave as a nucleophile or as
