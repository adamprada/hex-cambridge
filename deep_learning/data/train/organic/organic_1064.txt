that they will soon become second nature to you halogens and the character of the carbonhalogen bond with respect to electronegativity most halogens are more electronegative than carbon this results in a carbonhalogen bond that is polarized as shown in the image below the carbon atom has a partial positive charge while the halogen has a partial negative charge the following image shows the relationship between the halogens and electronegativity notice as we move up the periodic table from iodine to fluorine electronegativity increases the following image shows the relationships between bond length bond strength and molecular size as we
