on the bond one of the important set of reactions of alkyl halides involves replacing the halogen by something else substitution reactions these reactions can involve the carbonhalogen bond breaking to give positive and negative ions the ion with the positively charged carbon atom then reacts with something either fully or slightly negatively charged alternatively something either fully or negatively charged is attracted to the slightly positive carbon atom and pushes off the halogen atom you might have thought that either of these would be more effective in the case of the carbonfluorine bond with the quite large amounts of
