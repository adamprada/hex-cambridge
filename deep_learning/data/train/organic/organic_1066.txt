proton hydrogen attacks the oxygen just a reminder the nucleophile is a good acid therefore likes protons so it will attack the side with a positive charge before we consider in detail the reactivity of aldehydes and ketones we need to look back and remind ourselves of what the bonding picture looks like in a carbonyl carbonyl carbons are sp hybridized with the three sp orbitals forming overlaps with orbitals on the oxygen and on the two carbon or hydrogen atoms these three bonds adopt trigonal planar geometry the remaining unhybridized p orbital on the central carbonyl carbon is perpendicular
