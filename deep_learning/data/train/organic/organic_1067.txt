is what you typically see drawn in lewis structures and a minor but very important contributor in which both electrons in the pbond are localized on the oxygen giving it a full negative charge the latter depiction shows the carbon with an empty p orbital and a full positive charge some carbonyl compounds nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and ketones the result of carbonyl bond polarization however it is depicted is straightforward to predict the carbon because it is electronpoor is an electrophile it is a great target for attack by an electronrich nucleophilic group because the oxygen end of the
