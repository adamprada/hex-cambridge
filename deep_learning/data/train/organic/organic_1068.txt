electrons in the pi bond up to the oxygen alternatively if you start with the minor resonance contributor you can picture this as an attack by a nucleophile on a carbocation after the carbonyl is attacked by the nucleophile the negatively charged oxygen has the capacity to act as a nucleophile however most commonly the oxygen acts instead as a base abstracting a proton from a nearby acid group in the solvent or enzyme active site this very common type of reaction is called a nucleophilic addition in many biologically relevant examples of nucleophilic addition to carbonyls the nucleophile is
