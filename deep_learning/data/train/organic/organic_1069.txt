organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates more specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide n anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles of course carbons can also be nucleophiles otherwise how could new carboncarbon bonds be formed in the synthesis of large organic molecules like dna or fatty acids enolate ions section are the most common carbon nucleophiles in biochemical reactions while the cyanide ion cn is just one example of a carbon nucleophile commonly used in the
