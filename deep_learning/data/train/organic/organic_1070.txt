and other organic chemistry texts the electrophilic atom is a carbon which is bonded to an electronegative atom usually oxygen nitrogen sulfur or a halogen the concept of electrophilicity is relatively simple an electronpoor atom is an attractive target for something that is electronrich ie a nucleophile however we must also consider the effect of steric hindrance on electrophilicity in addition we must discuss how the nature of the electrophilic carbon and more specifically the stability of a potential carbocationic intermediate influences the sn vs sn character of a nucleophilic substitution reaction consider two hypothetical sn reactions one in which
