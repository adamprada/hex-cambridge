it less likely to be attacked in a concerted sn reaction nucleophilic substitution reactions in which the electrophilic carbon is sterically hindered are more likely to occur by a twostep dissociative sn mechanism this makes perfect sense from a geometric point of view the limitations imposed by sterics are significant mainly in an sn displacement when the electrophile being attacked is a sphybridized tetrahedral carbon with its relatively tight angles of o remember that in an sn mechanism the nucleophile attacks an sphybridized carbocation intermediate which has trigonal planar geometry with open angles with this open geometry the empty p
