may be difficult to control and products from cleavage of carboncarbon as well as of carbonhydrogen bonds may be obtained the only successful direct fluorination procedure for hydrocarbons involves diffusion of minute amounts of fluorine mixed with helium into liquid or solid hydrocarbons at low temperatures typically dry ice temperature as fluorination proceeds the concentration of fluorine can be increased the process is best suited for preparation of completely fluorinated compounds and it has been possible to obtain in this way amounts of and from dimethylpropane and tetramethylbutane corresponding to yields based on the fluorine used bromine generally is much
