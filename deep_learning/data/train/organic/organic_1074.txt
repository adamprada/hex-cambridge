to a considerable extent by controlling the methanechlorine ratio for example for monochlorination to predominate a high methanechlorine ratio is necessary such that the chlorine atoms react with and not with a selectivity in alkane halogenation for propane and higher hydrocarbons for which more than one monosubstitution product is generally possible difficult separation problems bay arise when a particular product is desired for example the chlorination of methylbutane at gives all four possible monosubstitution products and on a purely statistical basis we may expect the ratio of products from to correlate with the number of available hydrogens at the various
