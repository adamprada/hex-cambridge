at which the various bonds of methylbutane are broken by attack of chlorine atoms approach as the temperature is raised above at higher temperatures both chlorine atoms and hydrocarbons become more reactive because of increases in their thermal energies ultimately temperatures are attained where a chlorine atom essentially removes the first hydrogen with which it collides regardless of position on the hydrocarbon chain in such circumstances the composition of monochlorination products will correspond to that expected from simple statistics bromine atoms are far more selective than chlorine atoms this is not unexpected because is endothermic whereas corresponding reactions with a
