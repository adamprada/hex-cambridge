alkanes using sulfuryl chloride bp in place of chlorine the reaction has a radicalchain mechanism and the chains can be initiated by light or by chemicals usually peroxides chemical initiation requires an initiator with a weak bond that dissociates at temperatures between peroxides are good examples the bond is very weak and on heating dissociates to alkoxyl radicals which are reactive enough to generate the chainpropagating radicals from the reactants the exact sequence of chemical initiation is not always known but a plausible route in the present case would have abstract hydrogen from the alkane the propagation steps that would
