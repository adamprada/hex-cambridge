of course acetic acid while on the right side the acid is methyl ammonium the specific pka values for these acids are not on our very generalized pka table but are given in the figure above without performing any calculations you should be able to see that this equilibrium lies far to the righthand side acetic acid has a lower pka is a stronger acid and thus it wants to give up its proton more than methyl ammonium does doing the math we see that so is a very large number much greater than and the equilibrium lies far to
