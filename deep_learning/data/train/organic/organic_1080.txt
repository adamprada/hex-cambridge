strengths of acids and bases from their structure bonding and resonance since compounds are neutral it can be difficult to evaluate and compare their overall stability without going through the tedious process of performing bond energy calculations when acidic compounds donate hydrogen ions or accepts electrons they become ionized it is much easier to compare ions because we can evaluate the charge density the lower the charge density the more stable the ion conversely the higher the charge density the less stable the ion charge density is analogous to density of matter we place charge in the numerator instead of
