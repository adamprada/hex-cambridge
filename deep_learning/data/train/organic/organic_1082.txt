acid than methanol with a pka value of it is important to remember that neither compound is considered an acid these relationships become useful when trying to deprotonate compounds to increase their chemical reactivity in nonaqueous reaction conditions across a period aka across a row as we move across a period of the main group elements the valence electrons all occupy orbitals in the same shell these electrons have comparable energy so this factor does not help us discern differences relative stability differences in electronegativity are now the dominant factor this trend is shown when comparing the pka values of
