to oxygen the key to understanding this trend is to consider the hypothetical conjugate base in each case the more stable weaker the conjugate base the stronger the acid look at where the negative charge ends up in each conjugate base in the ethyl anion the negative charge is borne by carbon while in the methylamine anion and methoxide anion the charges are located on a nitrogen and an oxygen respectively remember the periodic trend in electronegativity section a it also increases as we move from left to right along a row meaning that oxygen is the most electronegative of
