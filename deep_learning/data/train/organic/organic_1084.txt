than the nitrogen the nitrogen lone pair therefore is more likely to break away and form a new bond to a proton it is in other words more basic once again a more reactive stronger conjugate base means a less reactive weaker conjugate acid when moving vertically within a given column of the periodic table we again observe a clear periodic trend in acidity this is best illustrated with the halides basicity like electronegativity increases as we move up the column conversely acidity in the haloacids increases as we move down the column in order to make sense of this
