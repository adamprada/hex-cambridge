organic chemistry that is important enough to put in red electrostatic charges whether positive or negative are more stable when they are spread out than when they are confined to one atom we will see this idea expressed again and again throughout our study of organic reactivity in many different contexts for now the concept is applied only to the influence of atomic radius on anion stability because fluoride is the least stable most basic of the halide conjugate bases hf is the least acidic of the haloacids only slightly stronger than acetic acid hi with a pka of about
