with molar equivalent of sodium hydroxide solution is resonance possible to localize the charge in the previous section we focused our attention on periodic trends the differences in acidity and basicity between groups where the exchangeable proton was bound to different elements now it is time to think about how the structure of different organic groups contributes to their relative acidity or basicity even when we are talking about the same element acting as the proton donoracceptor when evaluating conjugate bases for the presence of the resonance contributors remember to look for movable electrons as described in section of this
