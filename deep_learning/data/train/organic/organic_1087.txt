be invoked for acetic acid however there is a key difference a resonance contributor can be drawn in which the negative charge is localized on the second oxygen of the group the two resonance forms for the conjugate base are equal in energy according to our rules of resonance section c what this means you may recall is that the negative charge on the acetate ion is not located on one oxygen or the other rather it is shared between the two chemists use the term delocalization of charge to describe this situation in the ethoxide ion by contrast the
