than simply by the size of the atom involved the delocalization of charge by resonance has a very powerful effect on the reactivity of organic molecules enough to account for the difference of over pka units between ethanol and acetic acid and remember pka is a log expression so we are talking about a difference of over between the acidity constants for the two molecules the acetate ion is that much more stable than the ethoxide ion all due to the effects of resonance delocalization the resonance effect also nicely explains why a nitrogen atom is basic when it is
