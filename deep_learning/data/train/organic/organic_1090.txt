electron donating which helps stabilize positive charge alkyl groups hydrocarbons are inductive electron donators the inductive effect can also be electron withdrawing electronegativity indicates the strength of electron withdrawing induction halogens are inductive electron withdrawing groups the effects of induction on relative acidity can also be seen when comparing acetic acid with trifluoroacetic acid the difference in acidity does not have to do with resonance delocalization because no additional resonance structures can be drawn for the fluorinated molecule the fluorine atoms inductively pull some of the electron density away from the carboxylate ion to further delocalize the negative charge of
