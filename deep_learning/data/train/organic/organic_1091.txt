is not as dramatic as the delocalizing resonance effect illustrated by the difference in pka values between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid in general resonance effects are more powerful than inductive effects the inductive electronwithdrawing effect of the chlorines takes place through covalent bonds and its influence decreases markedly with distance thus a chlorine two carbons away from a carboxylic acid group has a decreased effect compared to a chlorine just one carbon away exercise rank the compounds below from most acidic to least acidic and explain your reasoning solution orbital hybridization the hybridization of an orbital affects its
