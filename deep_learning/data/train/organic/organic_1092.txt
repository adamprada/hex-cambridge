to answer this question we draw all the relevant resonance contributors for each conjugate base phenoxide and acetate respectively phenoxide has four resonance contributors but three of the contributors have a negative charge on a carbon atom while both resonance contributors for acetate have a negative charge on the more electronegative element oxygen there are no inductive effects or orbital hybridization differences to consider in this example so we would predict acetic acid to be the stronger acid the acetate ion is more stable than the phenoxide ion so we would expect acetic acid to be the stronger acid the
