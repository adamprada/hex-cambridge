the occurrence and uses of hydrocarbons with special reference to the petroleum industry chemical reactions of alkanes then will be discussed with special emphasis on combustion and substitution reactions these reactions are employed to illustrate how we can predict and use energy changes particularly the heat evolved or absorbed by a reacting system which often can be estimated from bond energies then we consider some of the problems involved in predicting reaction rates in the context of a specific reaction the chlorination of methane the example is complex but it has the virtue that we are able to break the
