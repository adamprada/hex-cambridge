here the most widely used and currently popular approach this approach involves setting up appropriate atomic orbitals for the atoms and considering that each bond arises from the attractive electrical forces of two or more nuclei for a pair of electrons in overlapping atomic orbitals with each orbital on a different atom the geometry of the bonds is assumed to be determined by the geometry of the orbitals and by the repulsive forces between the electrons in the course of showing how this approach can be applied we shall discuss ways of formulating bonding and geometries for several important kinds
