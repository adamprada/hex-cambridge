one very important type of substitution reaction the halogenation of alkanes section in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen atom halogen the chlorination of dimethylpropane is an example reactions of this type proceed by radicalchain mechanisms in which the bonds are broken and formed by atoms or radicals as reactive intermediates this mode of bondbreaking in which one electron goes with and the other with is called homolytic bond cleavage there are a large number of reactions usually occurring in solution that do not involve atoms or radicals but rather involve ions they occur by heterolytic cleavage
