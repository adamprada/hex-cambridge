mechanisms in which the bonds cleave heterolytically we also will discuss the mechanistically related elimination reactions that result in the formation of carboncarbon multiple bonds these reactions often are influenced profoundly by seemingly minor variations in the structure of the reactants in the solvent or in the temperature it is our purpose to show how these reactions can be understood and how they can be used to prepare other useful organic compounds but first it will be helpful to introduce the concepts of nucleophilic and electrophilic reagents and to consider the values for heterolytic bond breaking contributors and attributions john
