products and it is necessary for you to have a reasonably clear idea of how mixtures of compounds can be separated almost all compounds of biochemical interest occur naturally as components of very complex mixtures from which they can be separated only with considerable difficulty separations can be achieved by differences in physical properties such as differences in boiling point or by chemical means wherein differences in physical properties are enhanced by chemical reactions in this chapter we will consider some separations of compounds based on differences in physical properties chemical procedures will be discussed elsewhere in connection with the
