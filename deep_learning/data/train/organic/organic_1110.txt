compounds we must understand the ways in which the bonds to carbon atoms are arranged in space as shown in section a this depends on whether the carbon atoms form single double or triple bonds to another atom thus four single bonds to a carbon form a tetrahedral arrangement two single bonds and one double bond to a carbon give a planar array with bond angles near while one single bond and one triple bond or two double bonds to a carbon are arranged linearly finally if you have not studied the material already you may wish to return to
