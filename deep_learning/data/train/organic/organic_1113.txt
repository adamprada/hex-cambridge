of a proton at positions that are next to a potential leaving group this type of elimination can be described by two model mechanisms it can occur in a single concerted step proton abstraction at cα occurring at the same time as cβx bond cleavage or in two steps cβx bond cleavage occurring first to form a carbocation intermediate which is then quenched by proton abstraction at the alphacarbon these mechanisms termed e and e respectively are important in laboratory organic chemistry but are less common in biological chemistry as explained below which mechanism actually occurs in a laboratory reaction
