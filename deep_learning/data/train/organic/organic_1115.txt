later chapter to avoid halogen reactions at the alkene the halogen concentration is kept low enough that a substitution reaction occurs at the allylic position rather than addition at the double bond the product is an allylic halide halogen on carbon next to double bond carbons which is acquired through a radical chain mechanism why substitution of allylic hydrogens as the table below shows the dissociation energy for the allylic ch bond is lower than the dissociation energies for the ch bonds at the vinylic and alkylic positions this is because the radical formed when the allylic hydrogen is removed
