initiation once the preinitiation step involving nbs produces small quantities of br the bromine molecules are homolytically cleaved by light to produce bromine radicals step propagation one bromine radical produced by homolytic cleavage in the initiation step removes an allylic hydrogen of the alkene molecule a radical intermediate is generated which is stabilized by resonance the stability provided by delocalization of the radical in the alkene intermediate is the reason that substitution at the allylic position is favored over competing reactions such as addition at the double bond the intermediate radical then reacts with a br molecule to generate the
