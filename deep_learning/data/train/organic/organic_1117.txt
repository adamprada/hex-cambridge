used in the industrial production of valuable products for example chloropropene which is necessary for the synthesis of products such as epoxy resin is acquired through radical allylic chlorination shown below exercises exercises predict the two products of the allylic chlorination reaction of heptene what conditions are required for allylic halogenation to occur why does this reaction outcompete other possible reactions such as addition when these conditions are met predict the product of the allylic bromination reaction of phenylheptane hint how are benzylic hydrogens similar to allylic hydrogens the reactant methylhexene generates the products bromomethylhexene and bromomethylhexene what reagents were
