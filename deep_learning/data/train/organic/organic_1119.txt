put in contact with a nucleophile the table below is used to determine which situations will result in elimination and the formation of a Ï€ bond table elimination haloalkanenucleophile reaction type of haloalkane weak base poor nucleophile weak base good nucleophile strong unhindered base strong hindered base primary unhindered e branched e e secondary e e e tertiary e e e e empty box means no elimination or pi bond forms to synthesize alkynes from dihaloalkanes we use dehydrohalogenation the majority of these reactions take place using alkoxide bases other strong bases can also be used with high temperatures this
