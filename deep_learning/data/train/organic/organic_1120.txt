twice resulting in the formation of bonds and thus an alkyne dihaloalkane elimination this is a general picture of the reaction taking place without any of the mechanisms shown or with a terminal haloalkane the equation above is modified in that equivalents of base will be used instead of lets look at the mechanism of a reaction between dibromopentane with sodium amide in liquid ammonia liquid ammonia is not part of the reaction but is used as a solvent notice the intermediate of the alkyne synthesis it is stereospecifically in its anti form because the second proton and halogen are
