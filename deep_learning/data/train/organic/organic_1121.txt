an inert halogenated solvent like chloromethane to create a vicinal dihalide from an alkene the vicinal dihalide formed is the reactant needed to produce the alkyene using double elimination as covered previously on this page terminal alkynes the acidity of terminal alkynes also plays a role in product determination when vicinal or geminal dihalides undergo base induced biselimination reactions the following example illustrates eliminations of this kind starting from dibromopentane prepared from pentene by addition of bromine the initial elimination presumably forms bromopentene since base attack at the more acidic and less hindered Âºcarbon should be favored the second elimination
