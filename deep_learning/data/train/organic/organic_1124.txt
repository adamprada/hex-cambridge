specified the best we can do is describe its behavior in terms of the probability of its manifesting itself at any point in space it is common but somewhat misleading to describe the volume of space in which the electrons of an atom have a significant probability of being found as the electron cloud the latter has no definite outer boundary so neither does the atom the radius of an atom must be defined arbitrarily such as the boundary in which the electron can be found with probability atomic radii are typically pm figure the structure of the nuclear atom
