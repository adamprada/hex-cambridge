that of the proton most nuclei contain roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons so we can say that these two particles together account for almost all the mass of the atom because the electrons of an atom are in contact with the outside world it is possible for one or more electrons to be lost or some new ones to be added the resulting electricallycharged atom is called an ion elements to date about different elements have been discovered by definition each is chemically unique to understand why they are unique you need to understand the structure of the
