example in the following reaction which is a key step in the oxidation of fatty acids it is specifically ha and hd that are lost while hb and hc remain in the resulting conjugated alkene the prochiral hydrogens on cand c of the fatty acid can be designated according to a variation on the rs system for the sake of clarity well look at a much simpler molecule ethanol to explain this system to name the two prochiral hydrogens on ethanol we again need to engage in a thought experiment if we in our imagination were to arbitrarily change hb
