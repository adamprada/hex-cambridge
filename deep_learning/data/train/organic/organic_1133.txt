in the reaction prochiral hydrogens can be designated either enantiotopic or diastereotopic if either hr or hs on ethanol were replaced by a deuterium the two resulting molecules would be enantiomers because there are no other stereocenters thus these two hydrogens are referred to as enantiotopic in glyceraldehydephosphate gap however we see something different if either hr or hs is replaced by a deuterium the two resulting molecules will be diastereomers thus in this molecule hr and hs are referred to as diastereotopic hydrogens the importance of the distinction between enantiotopic and diastereotopic groups will become apparent when we learn
