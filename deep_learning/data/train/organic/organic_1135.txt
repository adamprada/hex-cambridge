leucine hint there are two pairs of prochiral groups are these prochiral groups diastereotopic or enantiotopic answer although an alkene carbon bonded to two identical groups is not considered a prochiral center these two groups can be diastereotopic ha and hb on the alkene below for example are diastereotopic if we change one and then the other of these hydrogens to deuterium the resulting compounds are e and z diastereomers carbonyl and imine carbons as prochiral centers trigonal planar sphybridized carbons are not as we well know chiral centers but they are referred to as prochiral centers if they are
