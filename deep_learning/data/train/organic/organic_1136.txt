pyruvate if we flipped the molecule over we would be looking at the si face of the ketone group note that the carboxylate group does not have re and si faces because two of the three substituents on that carbon are identical when the two resonance forms of carboxylate are taken into account as we will see beginning in chapter enzymes which catalyze reactions at carbonyl carbons act specifically from one side or the other notice that the hydrogenation reaction above is specific not only in terms of which face of the carbonyl group is affected but also in terms
