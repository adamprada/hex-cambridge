imf b octane since it is not branched the molecules can pack closer together increasing imf solubility alkanes are virtually insoluble in water but dissolve in organic solvents however liquid alkanes are good solvents for many other nonionic organic compounds solubility in water when a molecular substance dissolves in water the following must occur break the intermolecular forces within the substance in the case of the alkanes these are the van der waals dispersion forces break the intermolecular forces in the water so that the substance can fit between the water molecules in water the primary intermolecular attractions are hydrogen
