energy to compensate for the energy required to break the hydrogen bonds in water the alkane does not dissolve note this is a simplification because entropic effects are important when things dissolve solubility in organic solvents in most organic solvents the primary forces of attraction between the solvent molecules are van der waals therefore when an alkane dissolves in an organic solvent the van der waals forces are broken and are replaced by new van der waals forces the two processes more or less cancel each other out energetically thus there is no barrier to solubility exercise for each of
