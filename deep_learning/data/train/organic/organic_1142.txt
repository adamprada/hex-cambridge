halogenation the halogenation reaction is very important in organic chemistry because it opens a gateway to further chemical reactions combustion complete combustion given sufficient oxygen of any hydrocarbon produces carbon dioxide water and a significant amount of heat due to the exothermic nature of these combustion reactions alkanes are commonly used as a fuel source for example propane for outdoor grills butane for lighters the hydrocarbons become harder to ignite as the molecules get bigger this is because the larger molecules dont vaporize as easily if the liquid is not very volatile only those molecules on the surface can react
