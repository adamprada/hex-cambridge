broken ch clcl and two covalent bonds are formed ccl hcl this reaction seems to be an ideal case for mechanistic investigation and speculation however one complication is that all the hydrogen atoms of an alkane may undergo substitution resulting in a mixture of products as shown in the following unbalanced equation the relative amounts of the various products depend on the proportion of the two reactants used in the case of methane a large excess of the hydrocarbon favors formation of methyl chloride as the chief product whereas an excess of chlorine favors formation of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride
