case because the pure r entantiomer of the acid was used the product is a mixture of rr and rs diastereomeric esters which can in theory be separated by their different physical properties subsequent hydrolysis of each separated ester will yield the resolved enantiomerically pure alcohols the used in this technique are known as moschers esters after harry stone moscher a chemist who pioneered the method at stanford university as noted earlier chiral compounds synthesized from achiral starting materials and reagents are generally racemic ie a mixture of enantiomers separation of racemates into their component enantiomers is a process called
