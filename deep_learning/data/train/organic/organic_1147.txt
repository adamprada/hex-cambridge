nut having a righthanded thread r could serve as a reagent to discriminate and separate a mixture of right and lefthanded bolts of identical size and weight only the two righthanded partners can interact to give a fullythreaded intermediate so separation is fairly simple the resolving moiety ie the nut is then removed leaving the bolts separated into their right and lefthanded forms chemical reactions of enantiomers are normally not so dramatically different but a practical distinction is nevertheless possible because the physical properties of enantiomers are identical they seldom can be separated by simple physical methods such as fractional
