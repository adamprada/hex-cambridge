this to a salt with a chiral base having the d configuration the salt will be a mixture of two diastereomers d acid d base and l acid d base these diastereomeric salts are not identical and they are not mirror images therefore they will differ to some degree in their physical properties and a separation by physical methods such as crystallization may be possible if the diastereomeric salts can be completely separated the acid regenerated from each salt will be either exclusively the d or the l enantiomer resolution of chiral acids through the formation of diastereomeric salts requires
