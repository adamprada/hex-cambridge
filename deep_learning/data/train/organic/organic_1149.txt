on the ease of separation of the diastereomeric salts and of course on the availability of the acid for the scale of the resolution involved resolution methods of this kind can be tedious because numerous recrystallizations in different solvents may be necessary to progressively enrich the crystals in the lesssoluble diastereomer to determine when the resolution is complete the mixture of diastereomers is recrystallized until there is no further change in the measured optical rotation of the crystals at this stage it is hoped that the crystalline salt is a pure diastereomer from which one pure enantiomer can be recovered
