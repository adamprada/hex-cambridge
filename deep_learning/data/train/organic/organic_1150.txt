chromatography methods section two chiral acids that are useful resolving agents for alcohols are the most common method of resolving an alcohol is to convert it to a halfester of a dicarboxylic acid such as butanedioic succinic or benzenedicarboxylic phthalic acid with the corresponding anhydride the resulting halfester has a free carboxyl function and may then be resolvable with a chiral base usually brucine other methods of resolution qne of the major goals in the field of organic chemistry is the development of reagents with the property of chiral recognition such that they can effect a clean separation of enantiomers
