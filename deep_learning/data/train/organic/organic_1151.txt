the other enantiomer behind for example racemic tartaric acid can be resolved with the aid of certain penicillin molds that consume the dextrorotatory enantiomer faster than the levorotatory enantiomer as a result almost pure tartaric acid can be recovered from the mixture tartaric acid mold tartaric acid more mold a disadvantage of resolutions of this type is that the more reactive enantiomer usually is not recoverable from the reaction mixture the crystallization procedure employed by pasteur for his classical resolution of tartaric acid section c has been successful only in a very few cases this procedure depends on the formation
