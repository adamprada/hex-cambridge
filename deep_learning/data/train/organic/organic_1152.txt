hope of causing crystallization of just that one enantiomer thereby leaving the other in solution unfortunately very few practical resolutions have been achieved in this way even when a successful resolution is achieved some significant problems remain for instance the resolution itself does not provide information on the actual configuration of the or enantiomer this must be determined by other means see section also it is not possible to tell the enantiomeric purity optical purity of the resolved enantiomers without additional information this point is discussed further in the next section exercise indicate the reagents you would use to resolve
