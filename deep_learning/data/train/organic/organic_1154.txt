vinyl group is cesfchch although benzoyl peroxide is commonly used as an initiator in freeradical polymerization reactions an alternative reagent is azobisisobutyronitrile shown below all the monomers from which addition polymers are made are alkenes or functionally substituted alkenes the most common and thermodynamically favored chemical transformations of alkenes are addition reactions many of these addition reactions are known to proceed in a stepwise fashion by way of reactive intermediates and this is the mechanism followed by most polymerizations a general diagram illustrating this assembly of linear macromolecules which supports the name chain growth polymers is presented here since a
