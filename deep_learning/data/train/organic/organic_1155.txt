complex and the propagating site of reactivity is a terminal catalytic complex radical chaingrowth polymerization virtually all of the monomers described above are subject to radical polymerization since this can be initiated by traces of oxygen or other minor impurities pure samples of these compounds are often stabilized by small amounts of radical inhibitors to avoid unwanted reaction when radical polymerization is desired it must be started by using a radical initiator such as a peroxide or certain azo compounds the formulas of some common initiators and equations showing the formation of radical species from these initiators are presented below
