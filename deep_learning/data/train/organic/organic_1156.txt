radical polymerizations are widely used in the chemical industry in principle once started a radical polymerization might be expected to continue unchecked producing a few extremely long chain polymers in practice larger numbers of moderately sized chains are formed indicating that chainterminating reactions must be taking place the most common termination processes are radical combination and disproportionation these reactions are illustrated by the following equations the growing polymer chains are colored blue and red and the hydrogen atom transferred in disproportionation is colored green note that in both types of termination two reactive radical sites are removed by simultaneous conversion
