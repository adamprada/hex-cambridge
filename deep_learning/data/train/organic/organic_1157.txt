this reaction moves a carbon radical from one location to another by an intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer colored green these possibilities are demonstrated by the following equations chain transfer reactions are especially prevalent in the high pressure radical polymerization of ethylene which is the method used to make ldpe low density polyethylene the ºradical at the end of a growing chain is converted to a more stable ºradical by hydrogen atom transfer further polymerization at the new radical site generates a side chain radical and this may in turn lead to creation of other side chains by chain
