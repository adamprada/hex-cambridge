favored chemical transformations of alkenes are addition reactions many of these addition reactions are known to proceed in a stepwise fashion by way of reactive intermediates and this is the mechanism followed by most polymerizations a general diagram illustrating this assembly of linear macromolecules which supports the name chain growth polymers is presented here since a pibond in the monomer is converted to a sigmabond in the polymer the polymerization reaction is usually exothermic by to kcalmol indeed cases of explosively uncontrolled polymerizations have been reported it is useful to distinguish four polymerization procedures fitting this general description radical polymerization
