compounds are often stabilized by small amounts of radical inhibitors to avoid unwanted reaction when radical polymerization is desired it must be started by using a radical initiator such as a peroxide or certain azo compounds the formulas of some common initiators and equations showing the formation of radical species from these initiators are presented below by using small amounts of initiators a wide variety of monomers can be polymerized one example of this radical polymerization is the conversion of styrene to polystyrene shown in the following diagram the first two equations illustrate the initiation process and the last two
