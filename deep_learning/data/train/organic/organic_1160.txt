be taking place the most common termination processes are radical combination and disproportionation these reactions are illustrated by the following equations the growing polymer chains are colored blue and red and the hydrogen atom transferred in disproportionation is colored green note that in both types of termination two reactive radical sites are removed by simultaneous conversion to stable products since the concentration of radical species in a polymerization reaction is small relative to other reactants eg monomers solvents and terminated chains the rate at which these radicalradical termination reactions occurs is very small and most growing chains achieve moderate length
