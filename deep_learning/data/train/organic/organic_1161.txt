is the method used to make ldpe low density polyethylene the ºradical at the end of a growing chain is converted to a more stable ºradical by hydrogen atom transfer further polymerization at the new radical site generates a side chain radical and this may in turn lead to creation of other side chains by chain transfer reactions as a result the morphology of ldpe is an amorphous network of highly branched macromolecules exercise propose the monomer units in the following polymers answer contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state
