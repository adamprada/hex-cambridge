three distinct phases initiation propagation and termination the initiation phase describes the step that initially creates a radical species in most cases this is a homolytic cleavage event and takes place very rarely due to the high energy barriers involved often the influence of heat uv radiation or a metalcontaining catalyst is necessary to overcome the energy barrier molecular chlorine and bromine will both undergo homolytic cleavage to form radicals when subjected to heat or light other functional groups which also tend to form radicals when exposed to heat or light are chlorofluorocarbons peroxides and the halogenated amide nbromosuccinimide nbs
