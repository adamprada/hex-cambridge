of two radicals colliding with one another in other words the gibbs free energy barrier is very high for this reaction mostly due to entropic rather than enthalpic considerations the active sites of enzymes of course can evolve to overcome this entropic barrier by positioning two radical intermediates adjacent to one another exercises questions q radical chlorination of alkanes are not useful due to uncontrolled substitution draw the monosubstituted products of cl reacting with methylbutane q propose a radical mechanism for the following reaction solutions s s contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof
