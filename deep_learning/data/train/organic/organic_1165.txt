the molecular vibrational and rotational energies before being emitted as scattered light the changes in the vibrational and rotational energies result in changes in wavelength of the incident light these changes are detected as lines falling both above and below the wavelength of the incident light the line positions in raman spectra always are reported in wave numbers highly efficient laser raman spectrometers are commercially available although changes in wavelength in raman scattering correspond to absorption or emission of infrared radiation infrared and raman spectra are not always identical indeed valuable information about molecular symmetry may be obtained by comparison
