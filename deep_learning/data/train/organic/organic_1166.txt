the raman spectrum of ethene and provides evidence for a symmetrical structure for ethene as a general conclusion a molecule has no important symmetry if all its infrared bands have counterparts in raman scattering to illustrate these effects the raman and infrared spectra of tetrachloroethene and cyclohexene are shown in figures and figure infrared top and raman spectra bottom of tetrachloroethene notice that the spacings and alignment of the horizontal scales are not the same the raman spectrum was supplied courtesy of the applied physics corporation absorption due to the stretching vibration of the double bond in tetrachloroethene is strong
