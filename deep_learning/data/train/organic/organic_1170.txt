process of breaking and forming the transition state is an activated complex a transient and dynamic state that unlike more stable species does not have any definable lifetime it may help to imagine a transition state as being analogous to the exact moment that a baseball is struck by a bat transition states are drawn with dotted lines representing bonds that are in the process of breaking or forming and the drawing is often enclosed by brackets here is a picture of a likely transition state for a substitution reaction between hydroxide and chloromethane this reaction involves a collision between
