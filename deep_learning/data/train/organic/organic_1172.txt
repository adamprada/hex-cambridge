complete combustion given sufficient oxygen of any hydrocarbon produces carbon dioxide and water it is quite important that you can write properly balanced equations for these reactions because they often come up as a part of thermochemistry calculations some are easier than others for example with alkanes the ones with an even number of carbon atoms are marginally harder than those with an odd number example propane combustion for example with propane ch you can balance the carbons and hydrogens as you write the equation down your first draft would be counting the oxygens leads directly to the final version
