molecules on the surface can react with the oxygen bigger molecules have greater van der waals attractions which makes it more difficult for them to break away from their neighbors and turn to a gas provided the combustion is complete all the hydrocarbons will burn with a blue flame however combustion tends to be less complete as the number of carbon atoms in the molecules rises that means that the bigger the hydrocarbon the more likely you are to get a yellow smoky flame incomplete combustion where there is not enough oxygen present can lead to the formation of carbon
