favors formation of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride ch cl energy chcl chcl chcl ccl hcl in the presence of a flame the reactions are rather like the fluorine one producing a mixture of carbon and the hydrogen halide the violence of the reaction drops considerably as you go from fluorine to chlorine to bromine the interesting reactions happen in the presence of ultraviolet light sunlight will do these are photochemical reactions that happen at room temperature well look at the reactions with chlorine although the reactions with bromine are similar but evolve more slowly substitution reactions happen in which hydrogen
