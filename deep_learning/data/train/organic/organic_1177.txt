exception of the very small ones particularly cyclopropane in the presence of uv light cyclopropane will undergo substitution reactions with chlorine or bromine just like a noncyclic alkane however it also has the ability to react in the dark in the absence of uv light cyclopropane can undergo addition reactions in which the ring is broken for example with bromine cyclopropane gives dibromopropane this can still happen in the presence of light but you will get substitution reactions as well the ring is broken because cyclopropane suffers badly from ring strain the bond angles in the ring are rather than
