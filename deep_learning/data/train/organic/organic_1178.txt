attributions learning objective apply the alpha and beta labels to alkyl halides for substitution and elimination reactions refer to section alkyl halide structure and reaction language the carbon bonded to a halide is called the alphacarbon the carbons bonded to the alphacarbon are called betacarbons carbon atoms further removed from the alpha carbon are named by continuing the greek alphabet alpha beta gamma delta etc in discussing the reactions of alkyl halides it can be effective to use the alpha and beta labels the structure for bromopropane is used below to illustrate the application of these terms the reactions nucleophilic
