halides can also undergo elimination reactions in the presence of strong bases the elimination of a betahydrogen hydrogen on a carbon vicinal to the alkyl halide carbon and the halide produces a carboncarbon double bond to form an alkene in the example below bromopropane has undergone an elimination reaction to give an alkene propene what decides whether you get substitution or elimination in the examples above the reagents were the same for both substitution and elimination the halogenoalkane and either sodium or potassium hydroxide solution in all cases you will get a mixture of both reactions happening some substitution and
