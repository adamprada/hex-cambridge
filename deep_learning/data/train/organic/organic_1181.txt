reaction study notes you might find it useful to review section before you begin work on this chapter if necessary construct a molecular model of a simple alkyne notice the similarity between the behaviour of alkenes and that of alkynes in the laboratory you will observe that alkynes readily decolourize a solution of bromine in dichloromethane section describes a test that allows you to distinguish between a terminal alkyne ie one in which the triple bond occurs between the last two carbons in the chain and nonterminal alkynes and alkenes addition by electrophilic reagents a carboncarbon triple bond may be
