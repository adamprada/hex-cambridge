reactions of electrophilic reagents such as strong br√∏nsted acids and halogens to alkynes are studied we find a curious paradox the reactions are even more exothermic than the additions to alkenes and yet the rate of addition to alkynes is slower by a factor of to than addition to equivalently substituted alkenes the reaction of one equivalent of bromine with pentenyne for example gave dibromopentyne as the chief product hccchchch br hccchchbrchbr although these electrophilic additions to alkynes are sluggish they do take place and generally display markovnikov rule regioselectivity and antistereoselectivity one problem of course is that the products
