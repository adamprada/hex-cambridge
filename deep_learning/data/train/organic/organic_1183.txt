the last example diodoethene does not suffer further addition inasmuch as vicinaldiiodoalkanes are relatively unstable as a rule electrophilic addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes proceed by initial formation of a picomplex in which the electrophile accepts electrons from and becomes weakly bonded to the multiple bond such complexes are formed reversibly and may then reorganize to a reactive intermediate in a slower ratedetermining step reactions with alkynes are more sensitive to solvent changes and catalytic influences than are equivalent alkenes for examples and a discussion of mechanisms click here why are the reactions of alkynes with electrophilic reagents more
