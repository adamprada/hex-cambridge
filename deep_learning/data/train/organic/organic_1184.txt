energy hcch e δh kcalmole ethylene hcch energy hcch e δh kcalmole ethane hcch energy hcch e δh kcalmole as defined by the preceding equations an ionization potential is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a molecule of a compound since pielectrons are less tightly held than sigmaelectrons we expect the ionization potentials of ethylene and acetylene to be lower than that of ethane as is the case gasphase proton affinities show the same order with ethylene being more basic than acetylene and ethane being less basic than either since the initial interaction between an electrophile and
