in the manner shown below it is possible that vinyl cations stabilized by conjugation with an aryl substituent are intermediates in hx addition to alkynes of the type arccr but such intermediates are not formed in all alkyne addition reactions carbocation stability ch rchch rch rchcr rch chchch chch rc methyl vinyl vinyl allyl benzyl application of the hammond postulate indicates that the activation energy for the generation of a vinyl cation intermediate would be higher than that for a lower energy intermediate this is illustrated for alkenes versus alkynes by the following energy diagrams despite these differences electrophilic additions
