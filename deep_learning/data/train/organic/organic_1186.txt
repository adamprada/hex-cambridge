because this is a symmetric molecule it does not matter which carbon it adds to but in an asymmetric molecule the hydrogen will covalently bond to the carbon with the most hydrogens once the hydrogen is covalently bonded to one of the carbons you will get a carbocation intermediate not shown but will look the same as depicted in figure on the other carbon again this is a symmetric molecule and if it were asymmetric which carbon would have the positive charge the final step is the addition of the bromine which is a good nucleophile because it has electrons
