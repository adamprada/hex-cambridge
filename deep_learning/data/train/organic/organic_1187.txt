bonded to the bromine now you will have your carbocation intermediate which is followed by the attack of the bromine to the carbon on the right resulting in a haloalkane product addition of hx to terminal alkyne here is an addition of hbr to an asymmetric molecule first try to make sense of how the reactant went to product and then take a look at the mechanism the electrons are attacking the hydrogen depicted by the electron pushing arrows and the bromine gains a negative charge the carbocation intermediate forms a positive charge on the left carbon after the hydrogen
