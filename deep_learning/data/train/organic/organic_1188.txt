radical addition of hbr and hydroboration oxidation reactions for alkynes an antimarkovnikov addition takes place on a terminal alkyne an alkyne on the end of a chain hbr addition with radical yields bromoalkene the br of the hydrogen bromide hbr attaches to the less substituted carbon of the terminal alkyne shown below in an antimarkovnikov manner while the hydrogen proton attaches to the second carbon as mentioned above the first carbon is the less substituted carbon since it has fewer bonds attached to carbons and other substituents the hbr reagent must also be reacted with heat or some other radicial
