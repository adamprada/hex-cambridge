they attach on opposite sides of the bond trans reaction halogenation of alkynes summary stereoslectivity anti addition reaction proceeds via cyclic halonium ion addition of br the addition of br to an alkyne is analogous to adding br to an alkene once br approaches the nucleophilic alkyne it becomes polarized the electrons from the triple bond can now attack the polarized bromine forming a cbr bond and displacing the bromine ion now you will get an intermediate electrophilic carbocation which will immediately react with the bromine ion giving you the dibromo product first you see the polarized br being attacked
