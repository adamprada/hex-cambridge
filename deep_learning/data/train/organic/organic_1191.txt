presented the lithium crown ether salt of the triphenylmethyl carbanion from triphenylmethane nbutyllithium and crown at low temperatures adding nbutyllithium to triphenylmethane in thf at low temperatures followed by crown results in a red solution and the salt complex precipitates at c the central cc bond lengths are pm with the phenyl ring propelled at an average angle of this propeller shape is less pronounced with a tetramethylammonium counterion one tool for the detection of carbanions in solution is proton nmr a spectrum of cyclopentadiene in dmso shows four vinylic protons at ppm and two methylene bridge protons at ppm
