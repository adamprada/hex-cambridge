charge as in malononitrile when the carbanion is immediately next to a carbonyl group the Î±protons of carbonyl groups are acidic because the negative charge in the enolate can be partially distributed in the oxygen atom meldrums acid and barbituric acid historically named acids are in fact a lactone and a lactam respectively but their acidic carbon protons make them acidic the acidity of carbonyl compounds is an important driving force in many organic reactions such as the aldol reaction chiral carbanions with the molecular geometry for a carbanion described as a trigonal pyramid the question is whether or not
