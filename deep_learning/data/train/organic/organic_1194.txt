from likewise optical active methylheptyllithium with the carbon atom linked to lithium the carbanion on heating the reaction to c the optical activity is lost more evidence followed in the s a reaction of the cis isomer of methylcyclopropyl bromide with secbutyllithium again followed by carboxylation with dry ice yielded cismethylcyclopropylcarboxylic acid the formation of the trans isomer would have indicated that the intermediate carbanion was unstable in the same manner the reaction of slbromolmethyldiphenylcyclopropane with nbutyllithium followed by quench with methanol resulted in product with retention of configuration of recent date are chiral methyllithium compounds the phosphate contains a
