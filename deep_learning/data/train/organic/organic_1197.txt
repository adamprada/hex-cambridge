costs of materials apparatus and labor we shall consider these problems in connection with the important synthetic reactions discussed in this book the chlorination of saturated hydrocarbons can be induced by light but also can be carried out at temperatures of about in the dark under such circumstances the mechanism is similar to that of lightinduced chlorination except that the chlorine atoms are formed by thermal dissociation of chlorine molecules solid carbon surfaces catalyze thermal chlorination possibly by aiding in the cleavage of the chlorine molecules direct monohalogenation of saturated hydrocarbons works satisfactorily only with chlorine and bromine for the
