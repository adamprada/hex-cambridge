of methylbutane at gives all four possible monosubstitution products on a purely statistical basis we may expect the ratio of products from methylbutane to correlate with the number of available hydrogens at the various positions of substitution in the ratio however as can be seen from the strengths of bonds between hydrogen and primary secondary and tertiary carbons are not the same and we would expect the weaker bonds to preferentially react with as such the proportion of the tertiary halide is about three times that expected on a statistical basis which is in accord with our expectation that the
