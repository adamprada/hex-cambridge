that includes various intermediates and transition states exercise draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction answer alkyl shift not all carbocations have suitable hydrogen atoms either secondary or tertiary that are on adjacent carbon atoms available for rearrangement in this case the reaction can undergo a different mode of rearrangement known as alkyl shift or alkyl group migration alkyl shift acts very similarily to that of hydride shift instead of the proton h that shifts with the nucleophile we see an alkyl group that shifts with the nucleophile instead the shifting group carries its electron
