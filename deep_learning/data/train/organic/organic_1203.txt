mechanisms in reaction we see that we have a secondary substrate this undergoes alkyl shift because it does not have a suitable hydrogen on the adjacent carbon once again the reaction is similar to hydride shift the only difference is that we shift an alkyl group rather than shift a proton while still undergoing various intermediate steps to furnish its final product with reaction on the other hand we can say that it undergoes a concerted mechanism in short this means that everything happens in one step this is because primary carbocations cannot be an intermediate and they are relatively
