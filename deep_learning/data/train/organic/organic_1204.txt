to propose a hydride shift interchanging the functionality of two different kinds of methyls another possibility is hydride shift in which you could yield a secondary carbocation intermediate then a further hydride shift would give the more stable rearranged tertiary cation more distant hydride shifts have been observed such as and hydride shifts but these arrangements are too fast to undergo secondary cation intermediates analogy carbocation rearrangements happen very readily and often occur in many organic chemistry reactions yet we typically neglect this step dr sarah lievens a chemistry professor at the university of california davis once said carbocation rearrangements
