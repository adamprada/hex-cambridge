in any discernible reaction although the overall hydrogenation reaction is exothermic a high activation energy prevents it from taking place under normal conditions this restriction may be circumvented by the use of a catalyst as shown in the reactions below the ochem view of oxidation and reduction for inorganic chemistry the flow of electrons is easily counted with the change in oxidation numbers of the metals and nonmetals the expressions leo says ger for loss of electrons is oxidation and gain of electrons is reduction or oil rig for oxidation is loss and reduction is gain can be useful guides
