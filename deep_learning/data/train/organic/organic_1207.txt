that do not involve a change in the bonding of carbon with oxygen and hydrogen then we need to look at the differences in electronegativity the shared electrons are assigned to the more electronegative element to determine the oxidation numbers the catalyst the reaction between hydrogen h gas and an alkene a carboncarbon double bond requires an active metal catalyst a catalyst increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy of the reaction although the catalyst is not consumed in the reaction it is required to accelerate the reaction sufficiently to be observed in a reasonable amount of time
