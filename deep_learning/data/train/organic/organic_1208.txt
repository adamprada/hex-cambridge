atoms can easily add one at a time to the previously doublebonded carbons as shown in steps and above the position of both of the reactants bound to the catalyst makes it so the hydrogen atoms are only exposed to one side of the alkene this explains why the hydrogen atoms add to same side of the molecule called synaddition alkene stability and catalytic hydrogenation as shown in the reaction energy diagram below the hydrogenation of alkenes is exothermic and heat is released corresponding to the Î´e colored green this heat of reaction can be used to evaluate the thermodynamic
