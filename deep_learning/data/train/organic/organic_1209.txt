from the mechanism shown below we expect the addition of hydrogen to occur with synstereoselectivity since both reactants approach the same side of the catalysts surface for example dimethylcyclopentene is reduced to dimethylcyclopentane during catalytic hydrogenation exercises use the catalytic hydrogenation of ethene with platinum oxide to answer the following questions mol of ethene reacts with mol of hydrogen ethene is being while is being oxidized the oxidation number of carbon in ethene is in ethane it is when g of a certain triglyceride fat is treated with hydrogen gas in the presence of adams catalyst it is found that
