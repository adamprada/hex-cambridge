the difference between a heterogeneous reaction and a homogeneous reaction recognize that other types of compounds containing multiple bonds such as ketones esters nitriles and aromatic compounds do not react with hydrogen under the conditions used to hydrogenate alkenes key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below adams catalyst hydrogenation study notes chemical reactions that are heterogeneous have reactants that are in at least two different phases eg gas with a solid whereas homogeneous reactions occur in a single phase eg gas with another gas some confusion may arise from the description
