the catalyst platinum is used as pto adams catalyst although it is actually platinum metal that is the catalyst the hydrogen used to add to the carboncarbon double bond also reduces the platinumiv oxide to finely divided platinum metal ethanol or acetic acid is used as the solvent for the alkene other types of compounds containing multiple bonds such as ketones esters and nitriles do not react with hydrogen under the conditions used to hydrogenate alkenes the examples below show reduction of an alkene but the ketone and nitrile groups present remain intact and are not reduced aromatic rings are
