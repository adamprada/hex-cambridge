cyclohexene reacts with one mole of hydrogen to produce one mole of cyclohexane but one mole of cyclohexadiene reacts with two moles of hydrogen to form one mole of cyclohexane a chemist would say that cyclohexene reacts with one equivalent of hydrogen and cyclohexadiene reacts with two equivalents of hydrogen if you take a known amount of an unknown unsaturated hydrocarbon and determine how much hydrogen it will absorb you can readily determine the number of double bonds present in the hydrocarbon see question below addition of hydrogen to a carboncarbon double bond is called hydrogenation the overall effect of
