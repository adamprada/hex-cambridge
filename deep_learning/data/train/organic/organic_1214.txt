addition reaction is a process called hydrogenation in a hydrogenation reaction two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond of an alkene resulting in a saturated alkane hydrogenation of a double bond is a thermodynamically favorable reaction because it forms a more stable lower energy product in other words the energy of the product is lower than the energy of the reactant thus it is exothermic heat is released the heat released is called the heat of hydrogenation which is an indicator of a molecules stability catalysts are substances that changes the rate velocity of a chemical reaction without
