hydrocarbon which is more weakly adsorbed leaves the catalyst surface the exact nature and timing of the last events is not well understood as shown in the energy diagram the hydrogenation of alkenes is exothermic and heat is released corresponding to the Î´h in the diagram this heat of reaction can be used to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of alkenes having different numbers of alkyl substituents on the double bond for example the following table lists the heats of hydrogenation for three ch alkenes which give the same alkane product methylbutane since a larger heat of reaction indicates a higher
