use in context the key terms below anion radical lindlar catalyst study notes the lindlar catalyst allows a chemist to reduce a triple bond in the presence of a double bond thus but reactions between alkynes and catalysts are a common source of alkene formation because alkynes differ from alkenes on account of their two procurable Ï€ bonds alkynes are more susceptible to additions aside from turning them into alkenes these catalysts affect the arrangement of substituents on the newly formed alkene molecule depending on which catalyst is used the catalysts cause anti or synaddition of hydrogens alkynes can readily
