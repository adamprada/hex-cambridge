the quinoline serves to prevent complete hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane lindlars catalyst transforms an alkyne to a cisalkene lindlars catalyst like alkenes alkynes readily undergo catalytic hydrogenation either to cis or trans alkenes or to alkanes depending on the reaction employed the catalytic addition of hydrogen to butyne provides heat of reaction data that reflect the relative thermodynamic stabilities of these hydrocarbons as shown above from the heats of hydrogenation shown in blue in units of kcalmole it would appear that alkynes are thermodynamically less stable than alkenes to a greater degree than alkenes are less stable
