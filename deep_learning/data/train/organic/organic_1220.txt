more exothermic and relatively faster than equivalent reactions of the latter in the case of catalytic hydrogenation the usual pt and pd hydrogenation catalysts are so effective in promoting addition of hydrogen to both double and triple carboncarbon bonds that the alkene intermediate formed by hydrogen addition to an alkyne cannot be isolated a less efficient catalyst lindlars catalyst prepared by deactivating or poisoning a conventional palladium catalyst by treating it with lead acetate and quinoline permits alkynes to be converted to alkenes without further reduction to an alkane hydrogenation of an alkyne to a ealkene transalkene alkynes can be
