is perpendicular to the plane of the paper with the newman convention we view the molecule directly down the bond axis so the carbon in front hides the carbon behind the circle is only a visual aid to help distinguish the bonds of the back carbon from those of the front carbon the rear atoms in the eclipsed conformation are drawn slightly offset from a truly eclipsed view so the bonds to them can be seen figure conventions for showing the staggered and eclipsed conformations of ethane the staggered conformations of butane are shown in figure in both the sawhorse
