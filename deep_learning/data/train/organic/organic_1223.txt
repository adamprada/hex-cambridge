conventions for showing the staggered conformations of butane only one gauche form is shown cyclohexane is shown to emphasize the resemblance of its stable conformation to the gauche conformation of butane despite the usefulness of the sawhorsetype drawing cyclic molecules often are drawn with planar rings and distorted bond angles even though the rings actually may not be planar the reason for this is partly that planar rings are easier to draw and partly to emphasize the configuration of attached groups irrespective of the conformation typical examples follow generally we shall avoid such drawings and suggest that it is much
