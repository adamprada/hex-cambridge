can be cumbersome particularly for more complex molecules and we shortly shall describe other means of representing the configurations of chiral molecules b planar structures planar molecules such as benzene ethene and methanal are best drawn in the plane of the paper with bond angles of about when it is desired to draw them as viewed on edge out of plane care must be taken to provide proper perspective the forward bonds can be drawn with slightly heavier lines a tapered bond indicates direction the wide end pointing toward the viewer and the narrow end away from the viewer figure
