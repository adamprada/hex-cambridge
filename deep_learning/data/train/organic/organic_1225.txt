excellent for showing the arrangements of the atoms in conformations but are needlessly complex for representing the stereochemical configuration fischer projection formulas are widely used to show configurations and are quite straightforward once one gets the idea of what they represent figure front and side views of planar molecules showing some conventions used to indicate perspective the projection formulas of butanol are and as shown by the formulas next to and we are to understand that the horizontal bonds to the chiral center extend out of the plane of the paper toward you while the vertical bonds extend behind the
