or of lonepair electrons that are adjacent to pi bonds note sigma bonds cannot be broken during resonance if you show a sigma bond forming or breaking you are showing a chemical reaction taking place likewise the positions of atoms in the molecule cannot change between resonance contributors when looking at the structure of the molecule formate we see that there are two equivalent structures possible which one is correct there are two simple answers to this question both and neither one both ways of drawing the molecule are equally acceptable approximations of the bonding picture for the molecule but
