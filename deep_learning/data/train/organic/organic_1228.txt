than any single structure by convention resonance contributors are linked by a doubleheaded arrow and are sometimes enclosed by brackets the depiction of formate using the two resonance contributors a and b in the figure above does not imply that the molecule at one moment looks like structure a then at the next moment shifts to look like structure b rather at all moments the molecule is a combination or resonance hybrid of both a and b each individual resonance contributor of the formate ion is drawn with one carbonoxygen double bond pm and one carbonoxygen single bond pm with
