is an equal amount of electron density shown in red around each oxygen valence bond theory can be used to develop a picture of the bonding in a carboxylate group we know that the carbon must be sphybridized the bond angles are close to and the molecule is planar and we will treat both oxygens as being sphybridized as well both carbonoxygen sigma bonds then are formed from the overlap of carbon sp orbitals and oxygen sp orbitals in addition the carbon and both oxygens each have an unhybridized pz orbital situated perpendicular to the plane of the sigma bonds
