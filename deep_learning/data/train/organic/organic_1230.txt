an important exception to the general rules for determining the hybridization of an atom the oxygen with the negative charge appears to be sp hybridized because it is surrounded by four electron groups however this representation of the oxygen atom is not correct because it is actually part of a resonance hybrid a pair of lone pair of electrons on the negatively charged oxygen are not localized in an sp orbital rather they are delocalized as part of a conjugated pi system the stability gained though resonance is enough to cause the expected sp to become sp the sp hybridization
