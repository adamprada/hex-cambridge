electrons six electrons are used to form three bonding pairs between the oxygen atoms and the carbon we divide the remaining electrons equally among the three oxygen atoms by placing three lone pairs on each and indicating the charge there are no electrons left for the central atom at this point the carbon atom has only valence electrons so we must take one lone pair from an oxygen and use it to form a carbonoxygen double bond in this case however there are three possible choices as with formate none of these structures describes the bonding exactly each predicts one
