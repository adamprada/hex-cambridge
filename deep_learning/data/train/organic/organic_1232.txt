of a regular hexagon of carbon atoms each of which is also bonded to a hydrogen atom use resonance structures to describe the bonding in benzene given molecular formula and molecular geometry asked for resonance structures strategy a draw a structure for benzene illustrating the bonded atoms then calculate the number of valence electrons used in this drawing b subtract this number from the total number of valence electrons in benzene and then locate the remaining electrons such that each atom in the structure reaches an octet c draw the resonance structures for benzene solution a each hydrogen atom contributes
