only electrons and a formal charge of we can convert each lone pair to a bonding electron pair which gives each atom an octet of electrons and a formal charge of by making three cc double bonds c there are however two ways to do this each structure has alternating double and single bonds but experimentation shows that each carboncarbon bond in benzene is identical with bond lengths pm intermediate between those typically found for a cc single bond pm and a cc double bond pm we can describe the bonding in benzene using the two resonance structures but the
