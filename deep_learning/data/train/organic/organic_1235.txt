which one we choose we obtain either which is correct in fact neither is correct both predict one oo single bond and one oo double bond if the bonds were of different types one single and one double for example they would have different lengths it turns out however that both oo bond distances are identical pm which is shorter than a typical oo single bond pm and longer than the oo double bond in o pm equivalent lewis dot structures such as those of ozone are called resonance structures the position of the atoms is the same in the
