of the formate resonance hybrid the resonance hybrid is more stable than any individual resonance structures often resonance structures represent the movement of a charge between two or more atoms the charge is spread out amongst these atoms and therefore more stabilized when looking at the picture above the resonance contributors represent the negative charge as being on one oxygen or the other the resonance hybrid shows the negative charge being shared equally between two oxygens in the resonance hybrid the negative charge is spread out over a larger part of the molecule and is therefore more stable resonance contributors
