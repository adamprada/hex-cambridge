be shown with correct formal charges a carbocation carbon with only valence electrons is the only allowed exception to the valence shell rules the structure below is an invalid resonance structure even though it only shows the movement of a pi bond the resulting structure contains a carbon with ten electrons which violates the octet rule making it invalid all resonance contributors must have the same molecular formula the same number of electrons and same net charge the molecules in the figure below are not resonance structures of the same molecule because then have different molecular formulas chno vs chno
