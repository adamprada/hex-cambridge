is the combination of all the possible resonance structures if the resonance structures are equal in stability they the contribute equally to the structure of the hybrid however if the resonance structures have different stabilities they contribute to the hybrids structure in proportions related to their relative stabilities it can be said the the resonance hybrids structure resembles the most stable resonance structure because of this it is important to be able to compare the stabilities of resonance structures in the example below structure ii is much less important in terms of its contribution to the hybrid because it contains
