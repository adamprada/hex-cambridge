a positive charge and therefore an incomplete octet based on this criterionstructure i is less stable and is a more minor contributor to the resonance hybrid than structure ii the structures with the least number of formal charges is more stable based on this structure ii is less stable because is has two atoms with formal charges while structure i has none structure i would be the major resonance contributor the structures with a negative charge on the more electronegative atom will be more stable the difference between the two resonance structures is the placement of a negative charge structure
