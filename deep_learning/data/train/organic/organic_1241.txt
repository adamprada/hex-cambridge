made using the rules listed above this means the two structures are equivalent in stability and would make equal structural contributions to the resonance hybrid examples of major and minor contributors carboxylate example in the case of carboxylates contributors a and b below are equivalent in terms of their relative contribution to the hybrid structure however there is also a third resonance contributor c in which the carbon bears a positive formal charge a carbocation and both oxygens are singlebonded and bear negative charges structure c makes a less important contribution to the overall bonding picture of the group relative
