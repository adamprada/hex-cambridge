there is moregreater separation of charge are relatively less important rule structures a and b are equivalent and will be equal contributors to the resonance hybrid rule the resonance contributor in which a negative formal charge is located on a more electronegative atom usually oxygen or nitrogen is more stable than one in which the negative charge is located on a less electronegative atom such as carbon an example is in the upper left expression in the next figure rule example with resonance structures molecules with more than resonance structures can also be considered using the rules listed above of
