hybrid structure ii is considered a minor resonance contributor and would have very little effect on the structure of the resonance hybrid example draw the major resonance contributor of the structure below include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how you got from the given structure to your structure explain why your contributor is the major one in what kind of orbitals are the two lone pairs on the oxygen solution in the structure above the carbon with the positive formal charge does not have a complete octet of valence electrons using the curved arrow convention a lone
