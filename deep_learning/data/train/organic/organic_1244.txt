pi electrons one lone pair on the oxygen is in an unhybridized p orbital and is part of the conjugated pi system and the other is located in an sp orbital also note that one additional contributor can be drawn but it is also minor because it has a carbon with an incomplete octet exercises for the following resonance structures please rank them in order of stability indicate which would be the major contributor to the resonance hybrid draw four additional resonance contributors for the molecule below label each one as major or minor the structure below is of a
