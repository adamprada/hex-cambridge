atoms have a full octet and the negative charge is on the more electronegative nitrogen structure iii would be the next in stability because all of the nonhydrogen atoms have full octets structrure ii would be the least stable because it has the violated octet of a carbocation the contributor on the left is the most stable there are no formal charges the contributor on the right is least stable there are formal charges and a carbon has an incomplete octet the contributor in the middle is intermediate stability there are formal charges but all atoms have a complete octet
