additional resonance topics recognizing resonance resonance contributors involve the imaginary movement of pibonded electrons or of lonepair electrons that are adjacent to ie conjugated to pi bonds you can never shift the location of electrons in sigma bonds if you show a sigma bond forming or breaking you are showing a chemical reaction taking place likewise the positions of atoms in the molecule cannot change between two resonance contributors because benzene will appear throughout this course it is important to recognize the stability gained through the resonance delocalization of the six pi electrons throughout the six carbon atoms benzene also
