molecular orbital interactions but most importantly due to its resonance structures the delocalized electrons in the benzene ring make the molecule very stable and with its characteristics of a nucleophile it will react with a strong electrophile only and after the first reactivity the substituted benzene will depend on its resonance to direct the next position for the reaction to add a second substituent example multiple resonance of other molecules molecules and ions with more than one resonance form some structural resonance conformations are the major contributor or the dominant forms that the molecule exists for example if we look
