the reactivity of chlorobenzene because in the presence of an electrophile it will react and the formation of another bond will be directed and determine by resonance the lone pair of electrons delocalized in the aromatic substituted ring is where it can potentially form a new bond with an electrophile as it is shown there are three possible places that reactivity can take place the first to react will take place at the para position with respect to the chloro substituent and then to either ortho position introductionstereocenters are labeled r or ssequence rules to assign priorities to substituentsrule rule
