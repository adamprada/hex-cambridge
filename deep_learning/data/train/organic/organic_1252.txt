although different for the two enantiomers of a chiral moleculeat the same temperature cannot be used to establish the absolute configuration of an enantiomer this is because the sign of optical rotation for a particular enantiomer may change when the temperature changes stereocenters are labeled r or s the right hand and left hand nomenclature is used to name the enantiomers of a chiral compound the stereocenters are labeled as r or s consider the first picture a curved arrow is drawn from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent if the arrow points in a counterclockwise direction
