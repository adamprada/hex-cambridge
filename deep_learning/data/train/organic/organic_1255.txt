the atoms that the competing chain is connected to if none of the atoms connected to the competing chains at the same point has a greater atomic number the chain bonded to the same atom multiple times has the greater priority if however one of the atoms connected to the competing chain has a higher atomic number that chain has the higher priority example a methylethyl substituent takes precedence over an ethyl substituent connected to the first carbon atom ethyl only has one other carbon whereas the methylethyl has two carbon atoms attached to the first this is the first
