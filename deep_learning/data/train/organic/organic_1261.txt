c the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are c and h by the cip priority rules c is higher priority than h higher atomic number now look at c the right end of the double bond similarly the atoms are c and h with c being higher priority we see that the higher priority group is down at c and down at c since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together therefore this is zbutene now
