is bromobutene ignoring the geometric isomerism for now cis or trans this molecule is clearly cis the two methyl groups are on the same side more rigorously the parent chain is cis e or z there is a methyl at each end of the double bond on the left the methyl is the high priority group because the other group is h on the right the methyl is the low priority group because the other group is br that is the high priority groups are ch left and br right thus the two priority groups are on opposite sides entgegen
