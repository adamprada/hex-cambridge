nonane has the higher boiling point because it has the higher molecular weight recall that higher molecular weight compounds have more surface area and therefore they have stronger london dispersion forces as a result higher molecular weight compounds have the higher boiling temperatures b pentane has the higher boiling point pentane has a straight chain while methylbutane is branched compared to a straightchain isomer a branched hydrocarbon has a lower boiling temperature because of its smaller surface area c octane has the higher boiling point because trimethylpentane is highly branched while octane is a straightchain hydrocarbon a b c the
