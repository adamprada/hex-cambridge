contributors and attributions symmetrical reagents do not differentiate between the members of a pair of enantiomers for the same reason that an ordinary sock fits equally well on a right foot as on a left foot however asymmetric or chiral reagents can differentiate between enantiomers especially by having at least some difference in reactivity toward them a good analogy is the comparison between the ease of putting a left shoe on a left foot and a left shoe on a right foot the difference may not be very pronounced for simple compounds with only one or two chiral centers but
