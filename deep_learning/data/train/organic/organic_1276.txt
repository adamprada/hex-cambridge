have an infinitely variable rate of rotation and consequently infinitely variable rotation angular momentum however molecules in the gas phase have only specific rotation rates and corresponding specific rotational momentum values no measurement technique can detect inbetween values of these quantities molecules are quantized rotators about all you can do is try to accept this fact and if you try long enough you may be able to substitute familiarity for understanding and be happy with that all of us have some concepts we use continually even perhaps unconsciously about energy and work thermodynamics makes these concepts quantitative and provides very
