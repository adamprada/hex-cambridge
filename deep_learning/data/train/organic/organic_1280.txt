hybridization describe a carboncarbon double bond as consisting of one σ bond and one π bond explain the difference between a σ bond and a π bond in terms of the way in which p orbitals overlap key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below pi π bond sp hybrid bonding in ethylene thus far valence bond theory has been able to describe the bonding in molecules containing only single bonds however when molecules contain double or triple bonds the model requires more details ethylene commonly knows as ethene chch is the
