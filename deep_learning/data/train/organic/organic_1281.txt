three atomic orbitals on each carbon the s px and py combine to form three sp hybrids leaving the pz orbital unhybridized three of the four valence electrons on each carbon are distributed to the three sp hybrid orbitals while the remaining electron goes into the unhybridized pz orbital each carbon in ethene is said to be a sphybridized carbon the electron configuration of the sp hybridized carbon shows that there are four unpaired electrons to form bonds however the unpaired electrons are contained in two different types of orbitals so it is to be expected that two different types
