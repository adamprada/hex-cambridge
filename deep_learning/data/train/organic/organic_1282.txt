sp hybrid orbtals in the ethylene molecule each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms thus overlap two sphybridized orbitals with the s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms for the ch sigma bonds in ethylene spcsh consequently consistent with the observations the four carbonhydrogen bonds in ethylene are identical the cc sigma bond in ethylene is formed by the overlap of an sp hybrid orbital from each carbon the overlap of hybrid orbitals or a hybrid orbital and a s orbtial from hydrogen creates the sigma bond framework of the ethylene molecule however the unhybridized pz orbital on each
