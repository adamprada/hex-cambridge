compared to the endtoend orbital overlap of a sigma bond this makes the pi much easier to break which is one of the most important ideas in organic chemistry reactions as we will see in chapter and subsequent chapters an ethylene molecule is said to be made up of five sigma bonds and one pi bond the three sp hybrid orbitals on each carbon orient to create the basic trigonal planer geometry the hcc bond angle in ethylene is o which is very close to the o predicted by vsepr the four ch sigma bonds in ethylene the carboncarbon double
