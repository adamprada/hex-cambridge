have to go through a phase where they are from each other which would break the pi bond because there would be no overlap since the pi bond is essential to the structure of ethene it must not break so there can be not free rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond the presence of the pi bond thus locks the six atoms of ethene into the same plane exercise consider the following molecule at each atom what is the hybridization and the bond angle and the bond angle predicted by vsper please identify the types of orbitals shown in the
