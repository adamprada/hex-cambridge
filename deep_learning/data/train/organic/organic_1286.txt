often described using the notation spcspc each of the remaining sp hybrid orbitals overlaps with the s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen σ bonds the σ carboncarbon bond has a bond length of pm and a bond strength of kjmol the carbonhydrogen σ bonds are slightly weaker kjmol than those of methane the cch bond angles in ethane are o which is close to the what is expected for tetrahedral molecules the orientation of the two ch groups is not fixed relative to each other because they are formed from the endonend overlap of two orbitals sigma
