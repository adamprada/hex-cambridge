the same bond length also vsepr theory suggests that the geometry at the carbon atom in the methane molecule is tetrahedral and there exists a large body of both theoretical and experimental evidence supporting this prediction according to valence bond theory to form a covalent bond forms when an unpaired electron in one atom overlaps with an unpaired electron in a different atom now consider the the electron configuration of the four valence electrons in carbon there is a serious mismatch between the electron configuration of carbon ssp and the predicted structure of methane the modern structure shows that there
