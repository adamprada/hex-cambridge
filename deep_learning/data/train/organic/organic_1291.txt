p orbitals on an atom can combine to form four equivalent hybrid atomic orbitals the following ideas are important in understanding hybridization hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms they are formed only in covalently bonded atoms hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated atoms a set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals the number of hybrid orbitals in a set is equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set all orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are
