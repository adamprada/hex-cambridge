from mixing one s and three p orbitals in the new electron configuration each of the four valence electrons on the carbon occupies a single sp orbital creating four unpaired electrons the shape of an sp hybridized orbital is a combination of s and p atomic orbitals each sphybridized orbital bears an electron and electrons repel each other to minimize the repulsion between electrons the four sphybridized orbitals arrange themselves around the carbon nucleus so that they are as far away as possible from each other resulting in the tetrahedral arrangement predicted by vsper the carbon atom in methane is
