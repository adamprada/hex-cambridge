equivalency of the the four ch bonds what remains is an explanation of why the sp hybrid orbitals form when the s and p orbitals in carbon hybridize the resulting sp hybrid orbital is unsymmetrical with one lobe larger than the other this means the larger lobe can overlap more effectively with orbitals from other bonds making them stronger hybridizing allows for the carbon to form stronger bonds than it would with unhybridized s or p orbitals the four carbonhydrogen bonds in methane are equivalent and all have a bond length of pm x m bond strength of of kjmol
