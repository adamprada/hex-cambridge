ethyne another common name is acetylene the simplest alkyne this molecule is linear all four atoms lie in a straight line the carboncarbon triple bond is only Ã¥ long in the hybrid orbital picture of acetylene both carbons are sphybridized in an sphybridized carbon the s orbital combines with the px orbital to form two sp hybrid orbitals that are oriented at an angle of with respect to each other eg along the x axis the py and pz orbitals remain nonhybridized and are oriented perpendicularly along the y and z axes respectively the cc sigma bond is formed by
