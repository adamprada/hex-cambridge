b which is in turn shorter and stronger than the one in a the explanation here is relatively straightforward an sp orbital is composed of one s orbital and one p orbital and thus it has s character and p character sp orbitals by comparison have s character and p character while sp orbitals have s character and p character because of their spherical shape s orbitals are smaller and hold electrons closer and tighter to the nucleus compared to p orbitals consequently bonds involving sp sp overlap as in alkyne c are shorter and stronger than bonds involving sp
