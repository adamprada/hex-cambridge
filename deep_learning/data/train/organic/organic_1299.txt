p orbitals lone pair electrons are usually contained in hybrid orbitals the hybrid orbitals used and hence the hybridization depends on how many electron groups are around the atom in question an electron group can mean either a bonded atom or a lone pair molecular geometry is also decided by the number of electron groups so it is directly linked to hybridization of electron groups hybrid orbital used example basic geometry basic bond angle sp linear o sp trigonal planar o sp tetrahedral o exercises for the molecule acetonitrile a how many sigma and pi bonds does it have b
