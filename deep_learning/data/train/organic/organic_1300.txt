e an py and pz orbital from carbon and an py and pz orbital from nitrogen f an sp hybrid orbital questions q cyclohexyne is a very strained molecule by looking at the molecule explain why there is such a intermolecular strain using the knowledge of hybridization and bond angles solutions s the alkyne is a sp hybridized orbital by looking at a sp orbital we can see that the bond angle is but in cyclohexane the regular angles would be therefore the molecule would be strained to force the to be a contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic
