alkenes are less stable than their trans isomers and discuss briefly the limitations of this approach arrange a series of alkenes in order of increasing or decreasing stability describe briefly two of the hypotheses proposed to explain why alkene stability increases with increased substitution note this problem is a typical example of those instances in science where there is probably no single correct explanation for an observed phenomenon key terms make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below catalytic hydrogenation heat of hydrogenation Î´hhydrog hyperconjugation study notes the two alkenes cis cesfchchchch and cesfchcch
