s character can overlap more effectively than an sp orbital with only s character alkene hydrogenation is the synaddition of hydrogen to an alkene saturating the bond the alkene reacts with hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst which allows the reaction to occur quickly the energy released in this process called the heat of hydrogenation indicates the relative stability of the double bond in the molecule introduction the reaction begins with h gas and an alkene a carboncarbon double bond the pi bond in the alkene acts as a nucleophile the two electrons in it form a
