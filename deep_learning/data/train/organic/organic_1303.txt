rate by lowering the activation energy of the reaction although the catalyst is not consumed in the reaction it is required to accelerate the reaction sufficiently to be observed in a reasonable amount of time catalysts commonly used in alkene hydrogenation are platinum palladium and nickel the metal catalyst acts as a surface on which the reaction takes place this increases the rate by putting the reactants in close proximity to each other facilitating interactions between them with this catalyst present the sigma bond of h breaks and the two hydrogen atoms instead bind to the metal see in the
