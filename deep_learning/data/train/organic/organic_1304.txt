remains intact and unchanged throughout the reaction heats of hydrogenation the stability of alkene can be determined by measuring the amount of energy associated with the hydrogenation of the molecule since the double bond is breaking in this reaction the energy released in hydrogenation is proportional to the energy in the double bond of the molecule this is a useful tool because heats of hydrogenation can be measured very accurately the is usually around kcalmol for alkenes stability is simply a measure of energy lower energy molecules are more stable than higher energy molecules more substituted alkenes are more stable
