formed in the products no other common reaction involves such a profound and pervasive change and the mechanism of combustion is so complex that chemists are just beginning to explore and understand some of its elementary features since all the covalent bonds in the reactant molecules are broken the quantity of heat evolved in this reaction and any other combustion reaction is related to the strength of these bonds and of course the strength of the bonds formed in the products precise heat of combustion measurements can provide useful information about the structure of molecules and their relative stability for
