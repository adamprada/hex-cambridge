have significantly higher heats of combustion per ch while cyclohexane has the lowest heat of combustion this indicates that cyclohexane is more stable than cyclopropane and cyclobutane and in fact that cyclohexane has a same relative stability as long chain alkanes that are not cyclic this difference in stability is seen in nature where six membered rings are by far the most common what causes the difference in stability or the strain in small cycloalkanes table heats of combustion of select hydrocarbons cycloalkane chn ch units n δhº kcalmol δhº per ch unit ring strain kcalmol cyclopropane n cyclobutane n
