not have the expected ideal bond angle of o causing an increase in the potential energy an example of angle strain can be seen in the diagram of cyclopropane below in which the bond angle is o between the carbons the compressed bond angles causes poor overlap of the hybrid orbitals forming the carboncarbon sigma bonds which in turn creates destabilization the ccc bond angles in cyclopropane diagram above o and cyclobutane o are much different than the ideal bond angle of o this bond angle causes cyclopropane and cyclobutane to be less stable than molecules such as cyclohexane and
