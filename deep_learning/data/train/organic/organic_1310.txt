prevalent in small cycloalkanes such as cyclopropane whose structures are nearly planar the eclipsed ch bonds in cyclopropane larger rings like cyclohexane deal with torsional strain by forming conformers in which the rings are not planar a conformer is a stereoisomer in which molecules of the same connectivity and formula exist as different isomers in this case to reduce ring strain the ring strain is reduced in conformers due to the rotations around the sigma bonds which decreases the angle and torsional strain in the ring the nonplanar structures of cyclohexane are very stable compared to cyclopropane and cyclobutane and
