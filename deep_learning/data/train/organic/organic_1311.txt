high in energy as methylmethyl interactions exercise cyclobutane has more torsional stain than cyclopropane explain this observation answer cyclobutane has ch groups while cyclopropane only has more ch groups means cyclobutane has more eclipsing hh interactions and therefore has more torsional strain questions q transdimethylcyclobutane is more stable than cisdimethylcyclobutane explain this observation solutions s the trans form does not have eclipsing methyl groups therefore lowering the energy within the molecule it does however have hydrogenmethyl interactions but are not as high in energy than methylmethyl interactions contributors william reusch professor emeritus michigan state u virtual textbook of organic chemistry
