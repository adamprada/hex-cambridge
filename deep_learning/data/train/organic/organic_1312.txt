two enantiomers of glucose called dglucose and lglucose the denantiomer is the common sugar that our bodies use for energy it has n stereocenters so therefore there are n possible stereoisomers including dglucose itself in lglucose all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to dglucose that leaves diastereomers of dglucose these are molecules in which at least one but not all of the stereocenters are inverted relative to dglucose one of these diastereomers a sugar called dgalactose is shown above in dgalactose one of four stereocenters is inverted relative to dglucose diastereomers which differ in only one stereocenter out of
