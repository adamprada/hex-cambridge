rrr configurations we get now using the above drawing as our model drawing any other stereoisomer is easy if we want to draw the enantiomer of rrr we dont need to try to visualize the mirror image we just start with the rrr structure and invert the configuration at every chiral center to get sss try making models of rrr and sss and confirm that they are in fact nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other there are six diastereomers of rrr to draw one of them we just invert the configuration of at least one but not all three of
