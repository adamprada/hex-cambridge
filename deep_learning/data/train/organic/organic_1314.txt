epimers of srs list all of the stereoisomers that are diastereomers but not epimers of srs solutions to exercises solution add text here example the sugar below is one of the stereoisomers that we have been discussing the only problem is it is drawn with the carbon backbone in a different orientation from what we have seen determine the configuration at each chiral center to determine which stereoisomer it is exercise draw the enantiomer of the xylulosephosphate structure in the previous figure exercise the structure of the amino acid dthreonine drawn without stereochemistry is shown below dthreonine has the s
