with water acid catalyzed markovnikov regiochemistry occurs and the oh adds to the second carbon however both r and s products occur giving a racemic mixture of butanol how does this occur the proton addition to pentene results in a planar carbocation intermediate a molecule of water is then equally likely to react from the top or the bottom of this cation to produce either spentanol or rpentanol respectively as shown in the mechanism below contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state university stereochemistry the subtle detailscontributors and attributions learning
