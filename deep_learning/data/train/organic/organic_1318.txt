the top and bottom this ultimately produces r and s products in a non ratio as shown in the mechanism below exercise predict the products of the following reaction showing stereochemistry answer the products are diastereomers of one another contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state university contributors and attributions when an reaction is carried out starting with a single pure enantiomer such as chlorobutane the product usually is a mixture of the enantiomeric substitution products with a slight predominance of that isomer which corresponds to inversion theoretically a carbocation
