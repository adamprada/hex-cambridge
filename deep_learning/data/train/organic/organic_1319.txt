carbon which results in a predominance of the product of inverted configuration figure representation of a planar carbocation with no leaving group closeby with a ballandstick model having and as different alkyl groups to show why the cation should react equally probably with or to give the right and lefthanded substitution products other things being equal the amount of inversion decreases as the stability of the carbocation intermediate increases because the more stable the ion the longer is its lifetime and the more chance it has of getting away from the leaving anion and becoming a relatively free ion the
