sn reactions proceed with inversion of configuration that is the nucleophile will always penetrate from the backside in sn reactions to think about why this might be true remember that the nucleophile has a lone pair of electrons to be shared with the electrophilic carbon center and the leaving group is going to take a lone pair of electrons with it upon leaving because like charges repel each other the nucleophile will always proceed by a backside displacement mechanism frontside orientation in a frontside orientation the nucleophile approaches the electrophilic center on the same side as the leaving group with
