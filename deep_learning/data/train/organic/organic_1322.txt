the substrate is an s enantiomer a frontside nucleophilic orientation results in retention of configuration and the formation of the s enantiomer a backside nucleophilic orientation results in inversion of configuration and the formation of the r enantiomer empirically sn reactions that begin with the r enantiomer as the substrate will form the s enantiomer as the product those that begin with the s enantiomer as the substrate will form the r enantiomer as the product this concept of retention and inversion of configuration can also be applied to substrates that can exist as geometric isomers cis and trans if
