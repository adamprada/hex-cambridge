toward a given nucleophile this will be followed by a discussion of the relative reactivities of various nucleophiles toward a given alkyl derivative finally we shall comment in more detail on the role of the solvent in reactions a structure of the alkyl group in reactions the rates of displacement reactions of simple alkyl derivatives follow the order primary secondary tertiary in practical syntheses involving reactions the primary compounds generally work very well secondary isomers are fair and the tertiary isomers are almost completely impractical steric hindrance appears to be particularly important in determining reaction rates and the slowness of
