be the result of steric hindrance by the methyl groups located on the adjacent carbon to the approaching nucleophile in addition to steric effects other structural effects of influence the reactivity of a double bond to the halogen as in propenyl phenylmethyl benzyl and oxopropyl chlorides enhances the reactivity of the compounds toward nucleophiles thus the relative reactivities toward in propanone are possible reasons for these high reactivities will be discussed later section b b structure of the alkyl group in reactions the rates of reactions of simple alkyl derivatives follow the order tertiary secondary primary which is exactly opposite
