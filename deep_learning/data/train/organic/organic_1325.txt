energy changes for hydrolysis of an alkyl compound by the mechanism the rate of figure profile of energy changes for hydrolysis of by the mechanism in accord with the steps the last step is not part of the process itself but is included for completeness the water molecule shown in parentheses is necessary to balance the equations but it should not be considered to be different from the other water molecules in the solvent until it is specifically involved in the second transition state reaction is determined by the ionization step or by the energy of the transition state relative
