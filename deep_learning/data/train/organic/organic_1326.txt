the sequence of carbocation stabilities is tertiary secondary primary just why this sequence is observed is a more difficult question to answer notice in the following stability sequence that alkyl cations are more stable the more alkyl groups there are on the positive carbon the simplest explanation for why this is so is that alkyl groups are more polarizable than hydrogens in this case more polarizable means the electrons of the alkyl groups tend to move more readily toward the positive carbon than do those of the hydrogens such movements of electrons transfer part of the charge on the cationic
