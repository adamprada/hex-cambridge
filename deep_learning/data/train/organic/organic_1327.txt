delocalized electrons see section in general the more stabilized the carbon cation from an alkyl halide the more reactive the compound will be in type reactions this is especially apparent in the reactivities of compounds with phenyl groups on the reacting carbon as the number of phenyl groups increases from zero to three the reactivity of the chlorides increases by more than because of increasing stabilization of the carbon cation by the phenyl groups in contrast compounds such as chlorobenzene and chloroethene in which the halogen is attached directly to a multiply bonded carbon atom do not exhibit type reactions
