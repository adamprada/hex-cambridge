of the products obtained the intermediate alkyl cations may react in various ways to give products of substitution elimination and rearrangement elimination pathways are discussed more fully starting in section and rearrangement of carbon cations in section b c the leaving group the reactivity of a given alkyl derivative in either or reactions is influenced strongly by the leaving group the choice of leaving group is therefore an important consideration in any synthesis involving reactions from the foregoing discussion of structural effects in the group on reactivity particularly in reactions we might expect the stability of as an ion or
