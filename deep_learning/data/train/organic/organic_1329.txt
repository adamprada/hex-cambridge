ether ethylamine and ethyl ethanoate the respective groups and all can be classified as very poor leaving groups the more reactive ethyl derivatives see table include the halides particularly ethyl iodide and sulfonic acid derivatives the corresponding anions and therefore are moderate to good leaving groups table includes pertinent data for the rates of ether formation from various alkyl compounds and illustrates that the relative abilities of groups to leave are about the same in reactions as they are in reactions why are groups such as and good leaving groups whereas others such as and are poor the simplest correlation
