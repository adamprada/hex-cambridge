the acid strengths of the halogen acids similarly is a much better leaving group than and we find that trifluoroethanoic acid is a several thousand times stronger acid than ethanoic acid for the same reason is a better leaving group than this correlation can be extended easily to groups that leave as neutral for example occurs far more readily than and we know that is a stronger acid or better proton donor than the relationship between as a leaving group and as an acid is very useful because much information is available on acid strengths however it is not a
