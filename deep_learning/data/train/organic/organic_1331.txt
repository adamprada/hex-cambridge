pauling has shown for the halogen acids that the bond dissociation energy which is highest for and lowest for can be regarded as the most important factor in determining the energy of dissociation in solution the above energy equations can be written in the same way with in place of and we would expect to reach the same conclusion about the ease of leaving carbon because bond energies are reasonably closely proportional to bond energies see figure and table figure plot of bond energies against bond energies using the data of table d enhancement of leaving group abilities by electrophilic
