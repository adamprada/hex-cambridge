mercury and copper catalyze reactions of alkyl halides in much the same way that acids catalyze the reactions of alcohols a heavymetal ion functions by complexing with the unshared electrons of the halide thereby making the leaving group a metal halide rather than a halide ion this acceleration of the rates of halide reactions is the basis for a qualitative test for alkyl halides with silver nitrate in ethanol solution silver halide precipitates at a rate that depends upon the structure of the alkyl group tertiary secondary primary tertiary halides usually react immediately at room temperature whereas primary halides require
