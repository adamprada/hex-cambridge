table together with their basicities as measured by important generalizations can be made from these data provided that one recognizes that they may apply only to hydroxylic solvents for the atoms representing any one group column of the periodic table nucleophilicty increases with increasing atomic number thus other things being equal larger atoms are better nucleophiles for nucleophiles having the same atomic number of the entering atom eg oxygen nucleophiles there is usually a good correlation between the basicity of the reagent and its nucleophilicity thus a weak base such as is a poorer nucleophile than a strong base such
