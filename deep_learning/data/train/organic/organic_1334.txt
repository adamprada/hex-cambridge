between basicity and nucleophilcity so poor for atoms of different atomic number it is now clear from much research that the dominant effect is associated with differences in the solvation energies of the ions as defined for halide ions by the following equations the solvation energies of small ions with concentrated charge always are greater than those of large ions with diffuse charge when an ion participates in a nucleophilic attack on carbon it must slough off some of the solvent molecules that stabilize it in solution otherwise the ion cannot get close enough to the carbon to which it
