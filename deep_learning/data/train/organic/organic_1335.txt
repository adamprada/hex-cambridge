and the entering group are good entering and leaving groups respectively in such circumstances the position of the equilibrium often can be changed by suitably adjusting the reaction conditions thus aqueous hydrogen bromide can convert alcohols to alkyl bromides equation forward direction whereas the reverse reaction hydrolysis is achieved by high water concentration f the nature of the solvent the rates of reactions are sensitive to the nature and composition of the solvent this is easy to understand for reactions because the ionizing power of a solvent is crucial to the ease of formation of ions and from actually two
