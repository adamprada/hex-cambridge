examples are ammonia water alcohols carboxylic acids sulfur dioxide and methylsulfinylmethane dimethyl sulfoxide anoins are solvated most efficiently by solvents having hydrogen attached to a strongly elecronegative element so the bond is strongly polarized as such solvents usually are called protic solvents protic solvents form hydrogen bonds to the leaving group which assist ionization in much the same way that silver ion catalyzes ionization of alkyl halides section d we can represent solvation by the following structural formulas but it must be recognized that the number of solvent molecules involved in close interacitons can be as large as four or
