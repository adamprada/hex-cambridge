dielectric constant of the solvent is high solvation by hydrogen bonding is especially helpful in assisting ionization solvents that cannot provide such hydrogen bonding eg generally are poor for reactions these solvents are called aprotic solvents an important exception is liquid sulfur dioxide which promotes ionization by having a high dielectric constant and being able to solvate both anions and cations a list of protic and aprotic solvents their dielectric constants boiling points and melting points is given in table this table will be useful in selecting solvents for nucleophilic substitution reactions with regard to reactions the solvent can affect
