shorthand ways of drawing molecules give us insight into the bond angles and relative positions of atoms in the molecule while some notations eliminate the carbon and hydrogen atoms and only indicate the heteroatoms the atoms that are not carbon or hydrogen there are three primary methods to communicate chemical structure of organic molecules kekule lewis structures using lines to represent covalent bonds and showing all atoms and lone pair electrons bondline skeletlline shows bonds between carbon atoms and heteroatoms with lone pair electrons when requested condensed all atoms are written to communicate structure without drawing any chemical bonds based
