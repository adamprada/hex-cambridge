on the same side and chlorines on the same side whereas the first molecule is different read about dashedwedged line structures bottom of page to understand what has been introduced above you will learn more about the importance of atomic connectivity in molecules as you continue on to learn about stereochemistry drawing the structure of organic molecules although larger molecules may look complicated they can be easily understood by breaking them down and looking at their smaller components all atoms want to have their valence shell full a closed shell hydrogen wants to have e whereas carbon oxygen and nitrogen
