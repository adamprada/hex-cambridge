the three lone pairs of electrons were not draw in around chlorine in example b condensed formulas a condensed formula is made up of the elemental symbols the order of the atoms suggests the connectivity condensed formulas can be read from either direction and hc is the same as ch although the latter is more common because look at the examples below and match them with their identical molecule under kekul√© structures and bondline formulas a chchoh b clchchchochch c hcnhchcooh lets look closely at example b as you go through a condensed formula you want to focus on the
