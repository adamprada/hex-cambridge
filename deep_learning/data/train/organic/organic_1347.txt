chcooh because carbon does not have a complete octet and oxygens bondline aka zigzag formulas the name gives away how this formula works this formula is full of bonds and lines and because of the typical more stable bonds that atoms tend to make in molecules they often end up looking like zigzag lines if you work with a molecular model kit you will find it difficult to make stick straight molecules unless they contain sp triple bonds whereas zigzag molecules and bonds are much more feasible a b c these molecules correspond to the exact same molecules depicted for
