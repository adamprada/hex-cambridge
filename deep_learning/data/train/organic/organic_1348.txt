example a notice how the oh is drawn with a bond to the second carbon but it does not mean that there is a third carbon at the end of that bond line dashedwedged line structure as you may have guessed the dashedwedged line structure is all about lines dashes and wedges at first it may seem confusing but with practice understanding dashwedged line structures will become like second nature the following are examples of each and how they can be used together above are carbon chains with attached oh groups or cl and br atoms remember that each line
