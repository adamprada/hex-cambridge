convention a single straight line connecting the atomic symbols is used to represent a single twoelectron bond two such lines to represent a double fourelectron bond and three lines a triple sixelectron bond representations of compounds by these symbols are called structural formulas some examples are a point worth noting is that structural formulas usually do not indicate the nonbonding electron pairs this is perhaps unfortunate because they play as much a part in the chemistry of organic molecules as do the bonding electrons and their omission may lead the unwary reader to overlook them however when it is important
