do not exist in ethane learning objective interpret and draw the rotation about a carboncarbon single bond using newman projections and sawhorse structures correlate energies of conformations with rotational energy diagrams single bond rotation and conformational isomerism conformational isomerism involves rotation about sigma bonds and does not involve any differences in the connectivity or geometry of bonding two or more structures that are categorized as conformational isomers or conformers are really just two of the exact same molecule that differ only in terms of the angle about one or more sigma bonds the carboncarbon single bonds of alkanes rotate freely
