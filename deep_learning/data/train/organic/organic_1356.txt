bond of interest in this case the carboncarbon bond in ethane when there are multiple carbonsthen we specify the bond of interest using the carbon numbers from the iupac name we depict the front atom as a dot and the back atom as a larger circle the six carbonhydrogen bonds are shown as solid lines protruding from the two carbons at angles which is what the actual tetrahedral geometry looks like when viewed from this perspective and flattened into two dimensions the lowest energy conformation of ethane shown in the figure above is called the staggered or anti conformation in
