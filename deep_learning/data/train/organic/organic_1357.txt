the eclipsed conformation is approximately kcalmol higher than that of the staggered conformation another rotation returns the molecule to a second eclipsed conformation this process can be continued all around the circle with three possible eclipsed conformations and three staggered conformations in addition to an infinite number of variations in between the carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate there is indeed a small kcalmol barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another this rotational barrier is not high enough to prevent constant rotation except at extremely cold temperatures
