of the rotational energy valleys than in any other state the potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds as shown below the potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds although the conformers of ethane are in rapid equilibrium with each other the kcalmol energy difference leads to a substantial preponderance of staggered conformers at any given time the animation below illustrates the relationship between ethanes potential energy and its dihedral angle figure x animation of potential energy vs dihedral angle
