undergo different patterns of reactivity electronic structure the sp hybridization of the carboncarbon triple bond results in the perpendicular orientation of the sigma bond and two pi bonds the close proximity of the electrons in this geometry orientation creates molecules with less stability the structure of the carboncarbon triple bond strongly influences the chemical reactivity of alkynes and the acidity of terminal alkynes because of its linear configuration the bond angle of a sphybridized carbon is ยบ a tenmembered carbon ring is the smallest that can accommodate this function without excessive strain physical properties alkynes are nonpolar unsaturated hydrocarbons with
