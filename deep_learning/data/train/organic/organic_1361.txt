reaction follows the sn mechanism and is most efficient with methyl or primary halides without substitution near the reaction center secondary tertiary or even bulky primary substrates will give elimination by the e mechanism nucleophilic addition of acetylides to carbonyls acetylide anions will add to aldehydes and ketones to form alkoxides that are subsequently protonated to form propargyl alcohols with aldehydes and nonsymmetric ketones in the absence of chiral catalyst the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers exercise the pka of ammonia is estimate the equilibrium constant for the deprotonation of pentyne by amide as shown
