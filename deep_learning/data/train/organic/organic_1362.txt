have different physical propertiesreferencesoutside linkscontributors and attributions learning objective recognize and classify the stereochemistry of alkenes using the cistrans system steroisomerism in alkenes there is free rotation about the carbontocarbon single bonds cc in alkanes for example in dichloroethane there is free rotation about the cc bond the two models shown represent exactly the same molecule they are not isomers you can draw structural formulas that look different but if you bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bonds you should recognize that these two structures represent the same molecule in contrast the structure of alkenes
