lie on the same side of the molecule is called the cis isomer latin cis meaning on this side and is named cisdichloroethene the isomer with the two cl atoms on opposite sides of the molecule is the trans isomer latin trans meaning across and is named transdichloroethene these two compounds are cistrans isomers or geometric isomers compounds that have different configurations groups permanently in different places in space because of the presence of a rigid structure in their molecule the diagram below summarizes the differences between alkanes and alkenes with respect to rotation where the carbons are red hydrogens
