side of the molecule transbutene has the methyl groups on opposite sides of the molecule as shown in the diagram below cisbutene and transbutene are unique compounds with slightly different physical properties as shown below for stereospecific reactions these compounds produce different stereoisomeric products under the same reaction conditions this phenonenom of reactivity will be explored more closely in the next chapter on alkene reactivity example which compounds can exist as cistrans geometric isomers draw them chclchbr chcbrch chcchchch chchchchch solutions explained all four structures have a double bond and thus meet rule for cistrans isomerism this compound meets rule
