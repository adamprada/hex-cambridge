and trans isomers exercise exercise if the compound below can exist as cistrans isomers then draw both bondline structures chchchchch chchchchch chchchchchch chcchchch chcchchch write out the condensed structure for ethene draw the kekul√© lewis structure for ethene draw the bondline structure for ethene why is it that the carbons in ethene cannot freely rotate around the carboncarbon double bond answer chch the carboncarbon double bond is not shown but can be recognized by knowing the neutral bonding patterns of carbon note how easy it would be to misinterpret this small dash therefore the structure for ethene is typically shown
