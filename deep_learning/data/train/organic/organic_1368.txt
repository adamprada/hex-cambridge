and attributions learning objective identify nucleophiles and electrophiles in polar reactions relate bond polarity to chemical reactivity nucleophiles and electrophiles the reactants of polar reactions are often called the nucleophile and electrophile these terms are related to lewis acidbase notation so it can be helpful to apply and transfer the knowledge and wisdom gained from this definiation of acidbase chemistry electrophile lewis acid an electron deficient atom ion or molecule that has an affinity for an electron pair and will bond to a base or nucleophile nucleophile lewis base an atom ion or molecule that has an electron pair that
