of a carbon nucleophile commonly used in the laboratory hydrocarbons carbons with pi bonds can also be nucleophiles reactions with carbon nucleophiles will be dealt with in later chapters in this chapter we will concentrate on noncarbon nucleophiles when thinking about nucleophiles the first thing to recognize is that for the most part the same quality of electronrichness that makes a something nucleophilic also makes it basic nucleophiles can be bases and bases can be nucleophiles it should not be surprising then that most of the trends in basicity that we have already discussed also apply to nucleophilicity electrophiles in
