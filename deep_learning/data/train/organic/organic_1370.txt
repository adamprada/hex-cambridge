shown in the image below carbon atom has a partial positive charge while the halogen has a partial negative charge allkyl halides are useful electrophiles for synthetic organic chemistry of the four halogens fluorine is the most electronegative and iodine the least that means that the electron pair in the carbonfluorine bond will be dragged most towards the halogen end looking at the methyl halides as simple examples the following image shows the relative electronegativity of the halogens notice as we move up the periodic table from iodine to fluorine electronegativity increases the following image shows the relationships between bond
