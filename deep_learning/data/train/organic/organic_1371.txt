have to be broken if is difficult to break a carbonfluorine bond but easy to break a carboniodine one the relative electrophilicity of alkyl halides is summarized below electrophilicity of the carbonyl group the carbon atom of the carbonyl group co is electrophilic because the carbonoxygen double bond is polar and one of the resonance contributors is ionized with a full positiv echarge on the carbonyl carbon oxygen is more electronegative than carbon so electron density is higher on the oxygen side of the bond and lower on the carbon side both of these factors combine to increase the electrophilicity
