extend away from you this arrangement will be seen to be precisely the same as the convention of projection formulas such as and section c now the relative positions of the substituents on the horizontal bonds at the chiral centers are examined if the main substituent is the left of the main chain the configuration is assigned if this substituent is on the right the configuration is assigned for example the two configurations of the amino acid alanine would be represented in perspective or projection as and the carboxyl carbon is and is placed at the top the substituents at
