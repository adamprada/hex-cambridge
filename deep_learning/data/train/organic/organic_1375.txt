conditions used for substitution reactions by the mechanism very often lead to elimination the reaction of bromopropane with sodium ethoxide in ethanol provides a good example elimination to give propene competes with substitution to give ethyl isopropyl ether furthermore the rate of elimination like the rate of substitution is proportional to the concentrations of bromopropane and ethoxide ion thus elimination here is a secondorder reaction it may be helpful to review section at this point rate of substitution rate of elimination as to the mechanism of this kind of elimination the attacking base removes a proton from the carbon more
