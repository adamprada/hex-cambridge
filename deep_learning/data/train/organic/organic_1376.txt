of bases generally parallels their base strengths and the order is observed for reactions this fact is important in planning practical syntheses because the reaction tends to predominate with strongly basic slightly polarizable reagents such as amide ion or ethoxide ion in contrast reactions tend to be favored with weakly basic nucleophiles such as iodide ion or ethanoate ion unless dipolar aprotic solvents are used which may markedly change the reactivity of anionic nucleophiles as for the alkyl group there are two important structural effects to notice first at least one bond adjacent to the leaving group is required second
