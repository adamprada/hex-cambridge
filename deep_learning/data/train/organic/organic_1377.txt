table in fact elimination of from haloalkenes or haloarenes with relatively strong bonds such as chloroethene or chlorobenzene is much less facile than for haloalkanes nonetheless elimination does occur under the right conditions and constitutes one of the most useful general methods for the synthesis of alkynes for example the conditions and reagents used for and reactions are similar enough that it is difficult to have one occur without the other however elimination is favored over substitution by a strongly basic nucleophiles b bulky nucleophiles and c increasing alkyl substitution at the carbon it also is observed that increasing the
