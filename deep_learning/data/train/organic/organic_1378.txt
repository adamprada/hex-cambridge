bases such as and tend to give mixtures of alkenes with a preference for the most stable alkene which usually is the one with the fewest hydrogens or most alkyl groups attached to the carbons of the double bond thus however the precise distribution of alkenes formed is found to vary enough with the nature of the leaving group or the base used so either product will predominated with some combination of reagents or conditions for example a change in the base alone can be decisive d stereochemistry of reactions the reaction occurs most easily if the molecule undergoing reaction
