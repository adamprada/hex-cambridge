the reactants and the products and therefore gives the best overlap of the reacting orbitals necessary for the formation of the bond this is shown more explicitly below as an illustration of the stereospecificity of eliminations the meso compound gives the cisalkene whereas the isomers give the transalkene with ethoxide both reactions clearly proceed by antarafacial elimination when antarafacial elimination is rendered difficult by the inability of the reacting groups to acquire the desired trans arrangement then suprafacial elimination can occur although less readily an example is chlorocyclopentane in which and cannot assume a trans configuration without very considerable strain
