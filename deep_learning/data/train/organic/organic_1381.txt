learning objective explain how the kinetic isotope effect kie can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms kinetic isotope effects kinetic isotope effects kies are used to determine reaction mechanisms by determining rate limiting steps and transition states and are commonly measured using nmr to detect isotope location or gcms to detect mass changes in a kie experiment an atom is replaced by its isotope and the change in rate of the reaction is observed a very common isotope substitution is when hydrogen is replaced by deuterium this is known as a deuterium effect and is expressed by the ratio khkd
