sulfur is replaced with its isotope increased by two mass units primary kies primary kinetic isotope effects are rate changes due to isotopic substitution at a site of bond breaking in the rate determining step of a reaction example consider the bromination of acetone kinetic studies have been performed that show the rate of this reaction is independent of the concentration of bromine to determine the rate determining step and mechanism of this reaction the substitution of a deuterium for a hydrogen can be made when hydrogen was replaced with deuterium in this reaction a of was found therefore the
