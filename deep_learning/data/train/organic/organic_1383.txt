difference ruleexercisescontributors and attributions learning objective recognize and classify the stereochemistry of alkenes using the cistrans and ez systems give the iupac names for alkenes given their structure vice versa including ez isomers ez nomenclature the traditional system for naming the geometric isomers of an alkene in which the same groups are arranged differently is to name them as cis or trans however it is easy to find examples where the cistrans system is not easily applied iupac has a more complete system for naming alkene isomers the rs system for chirality is based on a set of priority rules
