priority we see that the higher priority group is down at c and down at c since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together therefore this is the z isomer similarly the right hand structure is e ez will work but may not agree with cistrans there are also molecules for which the ez system will not agree with the cistrans system lets use bromobutene to explore this option is this compound cis or trans this molecule is clearly cis the two methyl groups are
