by distinct criteria there may seem to be a simple correspondence but it is not a rule be sure to determine cistrans or ez separately as needed multiple double bonds if the compound contains more than one double bond then each one is analyzed and declared to be e or z example the configuration at the left hand double bond is e at the right hand double bond it is z thus this compound is ezdichlorohexadiene the doublebond rule in determining priorities example consider the compound below this is chloroethylbutadiene ignoring for the moment the geometric isomerism there is no
