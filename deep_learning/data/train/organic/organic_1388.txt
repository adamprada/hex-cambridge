for the ethenyl group the first c is attached to a c twice so we count it twice therefore that c is attached to c c h cch is higher than chh therefore the ethenyl group is higher priority since the priority groups cl and ethenyl are on the same side of the double bond this is the zisomer the compound is zchloroethylbutadiene the first point of difference rule which is higher priority by the cip rules a c with an o and h attached to it or a c with three c the first c has one atom of
