which is based on the sequence rules already described for the rs system works as follows an order of precedence is established for the two atoms or groups attached to each end of the double bond according to the sequence rules of section when these rules are applied to fluoro chlorobromo iodoethene the priority sequence is at carbon atom c f at carbon atom i br examination of the two configurations shows that the two priority groups one on each end are either on the same side of the double bond or on opposite sides the z isomer is designated
