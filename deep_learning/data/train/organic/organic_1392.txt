if the conditions are changed so that either the reaction is taking place at high temperatures denoted by δ or there is ultra violet irradiation a product is formed chloromethane chcl energetics why does this reaction occur is the reaction favorable a way to answer these questions is to look at the change in enthalpy that occurs when the reaction takes place δh energy put into reaction energy given off from reaction if more energy is put into a reaction than is given off the δh is positive the reaction is endothermic and not energetically favorable if more energy is
