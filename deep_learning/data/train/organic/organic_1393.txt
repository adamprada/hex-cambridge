by step look at the reaction showing how it occurs by which the reaction occurs radical chain mechanism the reaction proceeds through the radical chain mechanism the radical chain mechanism is characterized by three steps initiation propagation and termination initiation requires an input of energy but after that the reaction is selfsustaining the first propagation step uses up one of the products from initiation and the second propagation step makes another one thus the cycle can continue until indefinitely step initiation initiation breaks the bond between the chlorine molecule cl for this step to occur energy must be put in
