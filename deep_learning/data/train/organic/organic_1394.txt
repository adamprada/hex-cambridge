cl is used one of the chlorine atoms becomes a radical and the other combines with the methyl radical the first propagation step is endothermic meaning it takes in heat requires kcalmol and is not energetically favorable in contrast the second propagation step is exothermic releasing kcalmol once the reaction is initiated the exothermic energy released from the second propagation step provides the activation energy for the first propagation step creating a cyclic chain reaction following le chateliers principle until termination step termination in the termination steps all the remaining radicals combine in all possible manners to form more product
