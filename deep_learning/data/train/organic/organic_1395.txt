a dichloromethane through this method of controlling product ratios one is able to have a relative amount of control over the product exercises compounds other than chlorine and methane can react via freeradical halogenation write out the complete mechanism for the monobromination of ethane explain how the energetically unfavorable first propagation step can continue to occur without the input of energy from an external source which step of the radical chain mechanism requires outside energy what can be used as this energy use the table provided below to calculate the change in enthalpy for the monobromination of ethane compound bond
