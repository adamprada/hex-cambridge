ab the distance between a and b would be relatively large at the transition state resembling the starting state where a and b are two isolated species in the hypothetical endergonic reaction between c and d to form cd however the bond formation process would be much further along at the ts point resembling the product the hammond postulate is a very simplistic idea which relies on an assumption that potential energy surfaces are parabolic although such an assumption is not rigorously true it is fairly reliable and allows chemists to make energetic arguments about transition states by employing arguments
