and Âºcounterparts in reactions that follow an sn mechanism this is opposite to the reactivity order observed for the sn mechanism allylic and benzylic halides are exceptionally reactive by either mechanism exercises questions q consider the second step in the electrophilic addition of hbr to an alkene is this step exergonic or endergonic and does the transition state represent the product or the reactant cation draw out an energy diagram of this step reaction solutions s exergonic and the transition state second step represents the reactant cation as shown to go from intermediate cation to final product the step is
