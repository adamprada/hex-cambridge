be observed in order to gain some insight into what a particular transition state looks like chemists often invoke the hammond postulate which states that a transition state resembles the structure of the nearest stable species for an exergonic reaction therefore the transition state resembles the reactants more than it does the products if we consider a hypothetical exergonic reaction between compounds a and b to form ab the distance between a and b would be relatively large at the transition state resembling the starting state where a and b are two isolated species in the hypothetical endergonic reaction between
