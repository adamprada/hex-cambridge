stability the hammond postulate and the sn reaction the hammond postulate suggests that the activation energy of the ratedetermining first step will be inversely proportional to the stability of the carbocation intermediate the stability of carbocations is shown qualitatively below carbocation stability consequently we expect that ºalkyl halides will be more reactive than their º and ºcounterparts in reactions that follow an sn mechanism this is opposite to the reactivity order observed for the sn mechanism allylic and benzylic halides are exceptionally reactive by either mechanism contributors prof steven farmer sonoma state university organic chemistry with a biological emphasis by
