key terms below achiral chiral chiral stereogenic centre plane of symmetry a consideration of the chirality of molecular configurations explains the curious stereoisomerism observed for lactic acid carvone and a multitude of other organic compounds tetravalent carbons have a tetrahedral configuration if all four substituent groups are the same as in methane or tetrachloromethane the configuration is that of a highly symmetric regular tetrahedron a regular tetrahedron several planes of symmetry and is achiral a carbon atom that is bonded to four different atoms or groups loses all symmetry and is often referred to as an asymmetric carbon the configuration
