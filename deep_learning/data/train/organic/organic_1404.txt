the presence of a single asymmetrically substituted carbon atom in a molecule is sufficient to render the whole configuration chiral and modern terminology refers to such groupings as chiral centers most of the chiral centers we shall discuss are asymmetric carbon atoms but it should be recognized that other tetrahedral or pyramidal atoms may become chiral centers if appropriately substituted when more than one chiral center is present in a molecular structure care must be taken to analyze their relationship before concluding that a specific molecular configuration is chiral or achiral this aspect of stereoisomerism will be treated later a
