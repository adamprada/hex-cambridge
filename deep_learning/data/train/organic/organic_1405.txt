changes the cistrans configuration of the double bond some of the structures in the figure above are chiral and some are achiral first try to identify all chiral stereogenic centers formulas having no chiral centers are necessarily achiral formulas having one chiral center are always chiral and if two or more chiral centers are present in a given structure it is likely to be chiral but in special cases to be discussed later may be achiral structures f and g are achiral the former has a plane of symmetry passing through the chlorine atom and bisecting the opposite carboncarbon bond
