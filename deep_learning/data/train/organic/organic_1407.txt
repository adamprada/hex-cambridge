below answer looking at the structures of what we are referring to as the two isomers of thalidomide you may not be entirely convinced that they are actually two different molecules in order to convince ourselves that they are indeed different lets create a generalized picture of a tetrahedral carbon stereocenter with the four substituents designated rr the two stereoisomers of our simplified model look like this if you look carefully at the figure above you will notice that molecule a and molecule b are mirror images of each other the line labeled s represents a mirror plane furthermore they
