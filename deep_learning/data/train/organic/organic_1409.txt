is at least one plane of symmetry where one side of the plane is the mirror image of the other chirality is tied conceptually to the idea of asymmetry and any molecule that has a plane of symmetry cannot be chiral when looking for a plane of symmetry however we must consider all possible conformations that a molecule could adopt even a very simple molecule like ethane for example is asymmetric in many of its countless potential conformations but it has obvious symmetry in both the eclipsed and staggered conformations and for this reason it is achiral looking for planes
