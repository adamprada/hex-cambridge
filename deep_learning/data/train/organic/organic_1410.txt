irrelevant chiral molecules are sometimes drawn without using wedges although obviously this means that stereochemical information is being omitted conversely wedges may be used on carbons that are not stereocenters look for example at the drawings of glycine and citrate in the figure above just because you see dashed and solid wedges in a structure do not automatically assume that you are looking at a stereocenter other elements in addition to carbon can be stereocenters the phosphorus center of phosphate ion and organic phosphate esters for example is tetrahedral and thus is potentially a stereocenter we will see in chapter
