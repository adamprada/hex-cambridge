chloride in water is small about we can use these data to calculate the heat of ionic dissociation of chloromethane in water thermochemical data for the solvation of ions as used in the preceding calculations are difficult to measure and even to estimate therefore this kind of calculation of for ionic reactions involving organic molecules in solution usually cannot be made as a result we have considerably fewer possibilities to assess the thermodynamic feasibility of the individual steps of polar reactions in solution than we do of vaporphase radical processes bond energies are not of much use in predicting or
