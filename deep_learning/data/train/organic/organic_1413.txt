as much a part of molecular structure as is the order in which the component atoms are bonded contrary to the impression you may get from structural formulas complex molecules are not flat and formless but have welldefined spatial arrangements that are determined by the lengths and directional character of their chemical bonds it is not easy to visualize the possible arrangements of the bonds in space and it is very helpful to have some kind of mechanical model that reflects the molecular geometry including at least an approximation to the relative lengths of the bonds ballandstick models such as
