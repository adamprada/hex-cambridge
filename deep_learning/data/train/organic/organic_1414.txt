their valence angles from normal values therefore ballandstick models correspond better to the behavior of actual molecules if the connectors representing single bonds are made to be rather stiff figure ballandstick model of figure ballandstick models of some simple organic molecules whereas methane is tetrahedral ethene is not according to the best available physical measurements all six atoms of ethene lie in a single plane and the bond angles are methanal formaldehyde also is a planar molecule with an bond angle of models of ethene and methanal can be built with ballandstick models by using flexible couplings or bent sticks
