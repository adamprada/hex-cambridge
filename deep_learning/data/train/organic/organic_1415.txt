less stable and more reactive than otherwise similar molecules for which models can be constructed with straight sticks at tetrahedral angles b bond lengths and spacefilling models the length of a chemical bond is the average distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms regardless of where the bonding electrons happen to be the customary unit of length is the angstrom and measurements often can be made with an accuracy of by using the techniques of molecular spectroscopy xray diffraction for crystalline solids and electron diffraction for volatile compounds bond lengths vary considerably with structure and depend on the identity
