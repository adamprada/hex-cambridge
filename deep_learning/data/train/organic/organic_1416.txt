thus table shows that single bonds become progressively shorter as the number of multiple bonds or electronegative atoms attached to the carbons increases although molecular models cannot represent the subtle variations in bond lengths and bond angles that actual molecules exhibit most kinds of commercially available molecular models do attempt to reproduce relative bond lengths with some degree of reality in the ballandstick type the sticks usually come in various lengths to simulate different kinds of bonds bonds typically are scaled to represent bonds to be and and to be correspondingly shorter in some model sets the bonds can be
