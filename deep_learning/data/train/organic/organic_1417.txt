determine the possible closeness of approach of groups to each other and the degree of crowding of atoms in various arrangements see figure especially excellent but expensive models used for this purpose are the coreypaulingkolton cpk models figure shows how the cpk models can indicate intense molecular crowding as between the bromines in dibromonaphthalene a close relative of dibromobenzene mentioned in section g as we shall see such crowding has many chemical consequences ideally a model should reflect not only the size and shape of the molecule it represents but also the flexibility of the molecule by this we mean
