it will simplify things greatly if we can use some abbreviations and generalizations before we dive into real examples what is a nucleophile nu instead of showing a specific nucleophile like hydroxide we will simply refer to the nucleophilic reactant as nu nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond nucleophiles can be negatively charged and some that are neutral with lone pair electrons in both laboratory and biological organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic
