since basicity is a less troublesome concept it is convenient to start with it basicity refers to the ability of a base to accept a proton basicity may be related to the pka of the corresponding conjugate acid as shown below the strongest bases have the weakest conjugate acids and vice versa the range of basicities included in the following table is remarkable covering over fifty powers of ten in an acidbase equilibrium the weakest acid and the weakest base will predominate they will necessarily be on the same side of the equilibrium learning the pka values for common compounds
