or lg in a similar fashion we will call the leaving group x for halogens as is customary for other reactions it will be more accurate to abbreviate the leaving group as lg the context of the reaction will dictate the abbreviation leaving groups are sometimes negatively charged sometimes neutral and sometimes positively charged therefore in this general picture we will not include a charge designation on the x or lg species in referring to the comparison between acidbase chemistry and substitution reactions the stability of the leaving group is evaluated the same way we evaluate the stability of conjugate
