electrons analogous to a lewis acid electrophiles e are sometimes protonated and sometimes neutral electrophiles can also be called substrates since nucleophiles leaving groups and electrons may be charged or neutral we will not include charges on nu or x or lg or e we will generalize the three other groups bonded on the electrophilic alphacarbon as r r and r these symbols could represent hydrogens as well as alkyl groups finally in order to keep figures from becoming too crowded we will use in most cases the line structure convention in which the central electrophilic carbon is not drawn
