characteristics other than electronegativity also have an important influence on the chemical behavior of these compounds the first of these is covalent bond strength the strongest of the carbonhalogen covalent bonds is that to fluorine remarkably this is the strongest common single bond to carbon being roughly kcalmole stronger than a carboncarbon bond and about kcalmole stronger than a carbonhydrogen bond because of this alkyl fluorides and fluorocarbons in general are chemically and thermodynamically quite stable and do not share any of the reactivity patterns shown by the other alkyl halides the carbonchlorine covalent bond is slightly weaker than a
