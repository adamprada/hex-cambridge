in chemistry one reactions nucleophile can be another reactions leaving group some functional groups can only react as a nuclephile or electrophile while other functional groups can react as either a nuclephile or electrophile depending on the reaction conditions classify the following compounds as nucleophiles electrophiles or leaving groups more than one answer may be possible a bromoethane b hydroxide c water d chlorocyclohexane e ethanol f bromide answer a electrophile alkyl halides are always electrophiles one reason they are an ochem students best friend b strong nucleophile c weak nucleophile and good leaving group d electrophile alkyl halides are
