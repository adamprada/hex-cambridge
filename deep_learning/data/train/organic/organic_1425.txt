for nucleophilic and the number refers to the fact that it is a bimolecular reaction the overall rate depends on a step in which two separate molecules the nucleophile and the electrophile collide a potential energy diagram for this reaction shows the transition state ts as the highest point on the pathway from reactants to products if you look carefully at the progress of the sn reaction you will realize something very important about the outcome the nucleophile being an electronrich species must react with the electrophilic carbon from the back side relative to the location of the leaving group
