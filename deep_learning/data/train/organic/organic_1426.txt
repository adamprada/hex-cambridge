the product below is an animation illustrating the principles we have just learned showing the sn reaction between hydroxide ion and methyl iodide notice how backside attack by the hydroxide nucleophile results in inversion at the tetrahedral carbon electrophile exercise predict the structure of the product in this sn reaction be sure to specify stereochemistry solution sn reactions occur at sp carbons with a leaving group one more important point must be made before continuing nucleophilic substitutions as a rule occur at sphybridized carbons bonded to a leaving group sn reactions cannot occur where the leaving group is attached to
