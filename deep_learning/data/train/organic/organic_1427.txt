structure of the electrophile can eliminate possible products if the electrophilic carbon has no betahydrogens then only substitution reactions can occur and elimination reactions are not possible of course carbocation rearrangements may need to be considered the first four halides shown on the left below do not give elimination reactions on treatment with base because they have no Î²hydrogens the two halides on the right do not normally undergo such reactions because the potential elimination products have highly strained double or triple bonds it is also worth noting that sp hybridized cx compounds such as the three on the right
