the haloalkane and the nucleophile to understand how the rate depends on the concentrations of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile let us look at the following example the hydroxide ion is the nucleophile and methyl iodide is the haloalkane if we were to double the concentration of either the haloalkane or the nucleophile we can see that the rate of the reaction would proceed twice as fast as the initial rate if we were to double the concentration of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile we can see that the rate of the reaction would proceed four times as
