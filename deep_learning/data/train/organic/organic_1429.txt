the initial reaction rate is x ms c calculate the initial reaction rate if the initial reactant concentrations are changed to m chcl and m naoh solutions a rate k chcl oh b substitute the data into the rate expression above and apply algebra to solve for k k x lmols c using the rate law above substitute the value for k from the previous question along with the new concentrations to determine the new initial rate rate x ms contributors and attributions dr dietmar kennepohl fcic professor of chemistry athabasca university prof steven farmer sonoma state university william reusch
