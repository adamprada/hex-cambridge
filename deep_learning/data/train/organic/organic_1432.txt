of reaction types example substitution reaction the reaction of an ester with ammonia to give an amide as shown below appears to be a substitution reaction y cho z nh however it is actually two reactions an addition followed by an elimination example addition reaction the addition of water to a nitrile does not seem to fit any of the above reaction types but it is simply a slow addition reaction followed by a rapid rearrangement as shown in the following equation rapid rearrangements of this kind are called tautomerizations exercise classify each reaction as addition elimination substitution or rearrangement
