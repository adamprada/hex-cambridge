silicon dioxide the whole mixture is then blown rather like a liquid through a reaction chamber at a temperature of about c because the mixture behaves like a liquid this is known as fluid catalytic cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking although the mixture of gas and fine solid behaves as a liquid this is nevertheless an example of heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants the catalyst is recovered afterwards and the cracked mixture is separated by cooling and further fractional distillation there isnot any single unique reaction happening in the cracker the hydrocarbon molecules
