is achieved by using high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst the source of the large hydrocarbon molecules is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum these fractions are obtained from the distillation process as liquids but are revaporized before cracking there is not any single unique reaction happening in the cracker the hydrocarbon molecules are broken up in a fairly random way to produce mixtures of smaller hydrocarbons some of which have carboncarbon double bonds one possible reaction
