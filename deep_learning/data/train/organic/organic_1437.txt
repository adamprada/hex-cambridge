which has been designed to liquefy million tons natural gas per year crude oil is separated into its components by fractional distillation at oil refineries the different fractions of crude oil have different boiling points and consist mostly of alkanes of similar chain lengths the higher the boiling point the more carbon atoms the components of a particular fraction contain see the list of alkanes for details about the boiling points the following table provides a short survey of the different fractions of crude oil cc propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are used for
