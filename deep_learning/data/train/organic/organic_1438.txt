atoms form the major components of lubricating oil they also act as anticorrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature protects the metal surface from contact with water solid alkanes also find use as paraffin wax in candles c alkanes with a chain length above carbon atoms are found in bitumen as it is used in road surfacing these higher alkanes have little chemical and commercial value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking notes methane can cocrystallize with water at high pressures and low temperatures forming a solid methane hydrate the energy content of the known submarine methane hydrate
