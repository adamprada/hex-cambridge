electron microscopy is a valuable technique for the study of large molecules such as dna which can be stained with heavymetal atoms before viewing or are themselves reasonably stable to an electron beam figures and figure electron micrograph x of two linked catenated cyclic mitochondrial dna molecules from a culture of human cells the dna was stained with uranyl acetate then shadowed with platinum and palladium atoms in high vacuum to make the molecules easily visible in the electron microscope photograph supplied by dr b s hudson and the late dr j vinograd figure electron micrograph x of a thin
