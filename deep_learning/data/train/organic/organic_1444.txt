not available yet to very many organic laboratories other diffraction methods include electron diffraction which may be used todetermine the structures of gases or of volatile liquid substances that cannot be obtained as crystals suitable for xray diffraction and neutron diffraction which has special application for crystals in which the exact location of hydrogens is desired hydrogen does not have sufficient scattering power for x rays to be located precisely by xray diffraction figure bond lengths angles and arrangement of carbons and bromines in a crystal of bisbromomethylnaphthalene as determined by xray diffraction notice that the preferred conformation in the
