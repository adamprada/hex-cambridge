have said virtually all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have utility in this regard the commonly used span of the electromagnetic spectrum is shown in figure along with a comparison of the various units that are employed to express energy or wavelength the major kinds of spectroscopy used for structural analysis of organic compounds are listed in table the range of frequencies of the absorbed radiation are shown as well as the effect produced by the radiation and specific kind of information that is utilized in structural analysis after a brief account of the principles of spectroscopy we will describe
