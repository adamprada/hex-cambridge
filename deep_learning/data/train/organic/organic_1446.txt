distance between the crests which is the wavelength the wave crests will pass by at a certain number per minute which is the frequency the velocity at which the crests move by you is related to and by the relationship this is not really very complicated and it applies equally well to water waves or electromagnetic radiation what is almost needlessly complicated is the variety of units commonly used to express and for electromagnetic radiation one problem is tradition the other is the desire to avoid very large or very small numbers thus as figure shows we may be interested
