hertz which are equivalent radians per second are used widely by physicists table principal spectroscopic techniques currently in use for analysis of molecular structure frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum can be seen from figure generally to be large as a result it is common to use wave numbers instead of or megahertz the frequency in wave number is simply the frequency in divided by the velocity of light in wavenumber units are and we can think of the wave number as being the number of wave crests per centimeter a useful description of how molecular structures can be determined by
