feature is that carboncarbon bonds are strong so long chains or rings of carbon atoms bonded to one another are possible diamond and graphite are two familiar examples the diamond lattice being a threedimensional network of carbon atoms whereas graphite actually more closely resembles a planar network the lubricating properties of graphite actually are related to its structure which permits the planes to slide one past the other but carbon is not unique in forming bonds to itself because other elements such as boron silicon and phosphorus form strong bonds in the elementary state the uniqueness of carbon stems more
