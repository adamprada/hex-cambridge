strongly electropositive metals such as lithium why is carbon so versatile in its ability to bond to very different kinds of elements the special properties of carbon can be attributed to its being a relatively small atom with four valence electrons to form simple saltlike compounds such as sodium chloride carbon would have to either lose the four valence electrons to an element such as fluorine and be converted to a quadripositive ion or acquire four electrons from an element such as lithium and form a quadrinegative ion gain of four electrons would be energetically very unfavorable because of mutual
