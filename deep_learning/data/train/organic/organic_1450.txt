the bonded atoms especially when the affinities of the atoms for electrons are very different thus carbonfluorine and carbonlithium bonds although they are not ionic are polarized such that the electrons are associated more with the atom of higher electron affinity this is usually the atom with the higher effective nuclear charge we see then a gradation from purely ionic to purely covalent bonding in different molecules and this is manifest in their chemical and physical properties consider for instance the hydrides of the elements in the second horizontal row of the periodic table their melting and boiling points where
