molecules and this allows them to escape more easily from each other as gaseous molecules hence the low boiling point hydrogen fluoride has a boiling point some higher than that of methane the bonding electron pair of is drawn more toward fluorine than to hydrogen so the bond may be formulated as in liquid hydrogen fluoride the molecules tend to aggregate through what is called hydrogen bonding in chains and rings arranged so the positive hydrogen on one molecule attracts a negative fluorine on the next when liquid hydrogen fluoride is vaporized the temperature must be raised sufficiently to overcome
