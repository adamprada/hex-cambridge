the sense for lithium hydride and for hydrogen fluoride so that the electron pair goes with the atom of highest electron affinity this is indeed the case as the following reaction indicates methane with its relatively nonpolar bonds is inert to almost all reagents that could remove hydrogen as or except under anything but extreme conditions as would be expected methyl cations and methyl anions are very difficult to generate and are extremely reactive for this reason the following reactions are not observed from the foregoing you may anticipate that the chemistry of carbon compounds will be largely the chemistry
