more stable alkene with the more highly substituted double bond as shown in the example below if two or more structurally distinct groups of betahydrogens are present in a given reactant then several constitutionally isomeric alkenes may be formed by an e elimination this situation is illustrated by the bromobutane and bromodimethylbutane elimination examples given below by using the strongly basic hydroxide nucleophile we direct these reactions toward elimination in both cases there are two different sets of betahydrogens available to the elimination reaction these are colored red and magenta and the alpha carbon is blue if the rate of
