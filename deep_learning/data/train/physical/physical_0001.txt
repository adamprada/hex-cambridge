as substituting the values that are known this produces a quadratic equation and thus two values of which satisfy the relationship the negative root is not physically meaningful since the concentrations of and cannot be negative using the value of as the ph is then calculated via equation refeq to be the autoionization of water water is a very important solvent as water molecules have large dipole moments which create favorable interactions with ionic compounds water also has a large dielectric constant which damps the electric field generated by ions in solutions making the comparative interactions with water more favorable
