dissociation is endothermic so increases in temperature will lead to a greater degree of dissociation example neutral water what is the ph of neutral water at c normal human body temperature neutral water no excess of over or vice versa solution from the bestfit line in the vant hoff plot of figure the value of can be calculated since gives the product of and which must be equal in a neutral solution and the ph is given by equation refeq note this is slightly less than a ph of which is normally considered to be neutral but a ph of
