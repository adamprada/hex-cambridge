because being a pure compound in its standard state it has unit activity throughout the process of establishing equilibrium further it should be noted that when kb is combined with the expression for ka for the weak acid ha equation refeq as a consequence if one knows for a weak acid one also knows for its conjugate base since the product results in example what is the ph of a m solution of kf for hf pka at c solution the problem involves the hydrolysis of the conjugate base of hf f the hydrolysis reaction is an ice table is
