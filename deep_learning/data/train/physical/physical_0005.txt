make this conversion the relationship between pressure and concentration from the ideal gas law can be used and noting that the concentration is given by the expression for the equilibrium constant equation refeq becomes and since for a given temperature is a constant and can be factored out of the expression leaving beginalign kp left prodirtnui right left prodi xinuiright pt rtsum nui prod xinui pt rtsum nui kc endalign this conversion works for reactions in which all reactants and products are in the gas phase care must be used when applying this relationship to heterogeneous equilibria contributors and attributions
