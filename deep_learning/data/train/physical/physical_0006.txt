calculated the speed of sound through air assuming that sound was carried by isothermal compression waves his calculated value of ms was about smaller than experimental determinations he accounted for the difference by pointing to nonideal effects but it turns out that his error albeit an understandable one since sound waves do not appear to change bulk air temperatures was that the compression waves are adiabatic rather than isothermal as such there are small temperature oscillations that occur due to the adiabatic compression followed by expansion of the gas carrying the sound waves the oversight was correct by pierresimon laplace
