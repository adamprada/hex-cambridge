a simple chain rule the partial derivatives can be expanded to get something a little easier to evaluate the utility here is that this means that equation refeq simplifies to simplifying what is in the parenthesis yields as will be shown in the next chapter is always bigger than so is always smaller than but there is more we can use this methodology to revisit how pressure affects volume along an adiabat in order to do this we would like to evaluate the partial derivative this can be expanded in the same way as above and further expand and as
