these relationships yield the values of the various thermodynamic quantities in terms of the temperature difference we have yet to find the final temperature to find we return to the first law substituting for and and making use of the ideal gas equation we have from which by separation of variables we have one mole ideal gas reversible adiabatic expansion if we know as a function of temperature we can integrate to find a relationship among and given any three of these quantities we can use this relationship to find the fourth if is independent of temperature as it is
