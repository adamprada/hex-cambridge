the contrapositive is the reason that is called a necessary condition if it is necessary that be true for to be true if figure a is to be a square it must be a rectangle it is also intimately related to proof by contradiction suppose that we know to be true if by assuming that is false is true we can validly demonstrate that must also be false so that is true we have the contradiction that is both true and false and since cannot be both true and false it must be false that q is false otherwise stated
