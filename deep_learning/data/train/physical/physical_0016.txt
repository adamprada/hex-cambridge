all experimental observations the theory must be about the properties of some set of things by operational definitions we mean that the subjects of the theory must measurable and the theory must specify a set of operations for making each of these measurements by logical structure we mean that a satisfactory theory must include welldefined rules to specify how the subjects of the theory relate to one another by predictive capability we mean that a satisfactory theory must be capable of predicting the results of experiments that have not been performed by internal consistency we mean that a satisfactory theory
