the present example we can predict from the theory of evolution that selection of a particular trait through any process will cause increased expression of that trait in succeeding generations evolution is based on natural selection but it postulates a mechanism that must be valid for any consistent selection process it predicts that a farmer who selects for cows that produce more milk will eventually get cows that produce more milk thus attempts to apply selective breeding are tests of the central element of the theory of evolution and the success of selective breeding in every aspect of agriculture verifies
