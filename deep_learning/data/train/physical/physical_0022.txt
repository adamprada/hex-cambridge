a light bulbsuch that the bulb is on if the corresponding sentence is true and off if the sentence is false moreover there is a mathematical structure called boolean algebra which is homomorphic to propositional logic and exhibits the same parallelism to circuits digital computers carry this parallelism to structures of great complexity if we stretch our definition of a homomorphism to include comparisons of logical constructs with physical things we can view a scientific theory as a logical construct that we are trying to make homomorphic with physical reality we want our theory to map onto reality in such
