in continually more refined ways if we know the temperature to six significant figures this represents a very good approximation but we believe that the true temperature can only be expressed using indeterminably many significant figures to say that the temperature of the system has some value expressed to six significant figures is an approximation albeit a very good one second it is unlikely that all parts of any real system are actually at the same temperature when we say that a physical system has a particular temperature we mean that any differences in temperature between different parts of the
