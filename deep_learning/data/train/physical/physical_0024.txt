to point within it if we expand our theory to encompass variations over say distances of millimeters then the expanded theory will be inadequate to describe variations over some smaller distance any perfect theory must exactly describe the motions of all of the systems constituent particles this is impossible not only because it conflicts with the basis premises of quantum mechanics but also because it requires the theory to contain information at a level of detail equal to that in the physical system itself one way to express all of the same information at exactly the same level of detail
