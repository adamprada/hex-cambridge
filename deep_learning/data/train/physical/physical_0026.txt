the probability of observing a value less than is about in other words we expect the cumulative probability distribution function for to be such that the smallest observation corresponds to the quantity is often called the rank probability of the data point figure an approximate cumulative probability distribution function figure is a sketch of the sigmoid shape that we usually expect to find when we plot versus the value of this plot approximates the cumulative probability distribution function we expect the sigmoid shape because we expect the observed values of to bunch up around their average value if within some
