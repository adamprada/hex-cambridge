can test the validity of the relationship by plotting versus if describes the data well this plot will be approximately linear with a slope of one in section we introduce the normal distribution which is a mathematical model that describes a great many sources of experimental observations the normal distribution is a distribution function that involves two parameters the mean and the standard deviation the ideas we have discussed can be used to develop a particular graph paperusually called normal probability paper if the data are normally distributed plotting them on this paper produces an approximately straight line we can
