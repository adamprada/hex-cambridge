of drawing a large number of samples it is clear that this arrangement must have a value in each of the four mutuallyexclusive probability zones we can extend this conclusion to any number of representative points if we ask what arrangement of n points would best represent the arrangement of a large number of points drawn from the distribution the answer is clearly that one of the representative points should lie within each of mutuallyexclusive equalarea segments that span the domain of figure a sample of four that approximates its distribution we can turn this idea around in the absence
