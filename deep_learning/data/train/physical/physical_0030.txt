that of the area lies above each of them this view tells us to associate a probability of with an interval around each data point but it does not tell us where to begin or end the interval if we could decide where the interval about each data point began and ended we could estimate the shape of the probability density function for a small number of points we could not expect this estimate to be very accurate but it would be the best possible estimate based on the given data figure the sample of four that best approximates its
