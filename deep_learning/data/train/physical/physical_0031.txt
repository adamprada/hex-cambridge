the absence of information to the contrary the best assumption we can make is that data points divide their domain into segments each of which is associated with equal probability the fraction of the area above each of these segments is also the probability associated with each segment is if as in the example above there are four data points the best assumption we can make about the probability density function is that of its area lies between the left boundary and the leftmost data point and lies between the rightmost data point and the right boundary the three intervals
