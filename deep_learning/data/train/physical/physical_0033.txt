xfpartial xrightihbar f it can be shown that the above angular momentum operators obey the following set of commutation relations although the components of do not commute with one another they can be shown to commute with the operator defined by this new operator is referred to as the square of the total angular momentum operator the commutation properties of the components of allow us to conclude that complete sets of functions can be found that are eigenfunctions of and of one but not more than one component of it is convention to select this one component as and to
