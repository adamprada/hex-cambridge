that one encounters in chemistry orbital angular momenta such as that introduced above arise in electronic motion in atoms in atomatom and electronatom collisions and in rotational motion in molecules intrinsic spin angular momentum is present in electrons and many other nuclei in this section we will deal with the behavior of any and all angular momenta and their corresponding eigenfunctions at times an atom or molecule contains more than one type of angular momentum the hamiltonians interaction potentials present in a particular species may or may not cause these individual angular momenta to be coupled to an appreciable extent
