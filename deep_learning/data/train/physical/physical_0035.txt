of individual angular momenta is defined componentbycomponent as follows where labels and and labels the constituents whose angular momenta couple to produce j for the remainder of this section we will study eigenfunctioneigenvalue relationships that are characteristic of all angular momenta and which are consequences of the commutation relations among the angular momentum vectors three components we will also study how one combines eigenfunctions of two or more angular momenta to produce eigenfunctions of the total a consequences of the commutation relations any set of three operators that obey will be taken to define an angular momentum whose square commutes
