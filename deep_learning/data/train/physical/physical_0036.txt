the eigenvalues belonging to these functions in terms of the quantities and although we certainly hint that these quantities must be related to certain and quantum numbers we have not yet proven this although we will soon do so for now we view and simply as symbols that represent the respective eigenvalues because both and are hermitian eigenfunctions belonging to different or quantum numbers must be orthogonal we now prove several identities that are needed to discover the information about the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of general angular momenta that we are after later in this section the essential results are
