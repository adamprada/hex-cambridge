to the total angular momentum squared eigenvalue ii the raising and lowering operators change the eigenvalue but not the eigenvalue when acting on applying the commutation relations obeyed by to yields another useful result now using the fact that is an eigenstate of and of these identities give textbfjz textbfjpm jmrangle mhbar pm hbar textbfjpm jmrangle h m jmrangle these equations prove that the functions must either themselves be eigenfunctions of and with eigenvalues and respectively or must equal zero in the former case we see that acting on generates a new eigenstate with the same eigenvalue as but with
