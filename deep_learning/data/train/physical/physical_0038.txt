are related to the maximum and minimum eigenvalues which are related to one another earlier we showed that there exists a maximum and a minimum value for m for any given total angular momentum it is when one reaches these limiting cases that applies in particular applying the following identities respectively to and gives which immediately gives the eigenvalue and in terms of or so we now know the eigenvalues for and however we earlier showed that and have the same eigenvalue when we treated the effect of on and that the eigenvalue is independent of m if we therefore
