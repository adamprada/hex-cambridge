with halfinteger spin are called fermions v more on using the above results for the effect of acting on and the fact that and are adjoints of one another two operators and are adjoints if for all and all allows us to write where is the proportionality constant between and the normalized function likewise the effect of can be expressed as where is the proportionality constant between and the normalized thus we can solve for after which the effect of on is given by summary the above results apply to any angular momentum operators the essential findings can be summarized
