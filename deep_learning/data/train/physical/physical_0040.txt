letters however it should be kept in mind that no matter what letters are used there are operators corresponding to and that obey relations as specified above and there are eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that have all of the properties obtained above for electronic or collisional orbital angular momenta it is common to use and for electron spin s and sz are used for nuclear spin i and iz are most common and for molecular rotational angular momentum n and nz are most common although sometimes and may be used whenever two or more angular momenta are combined or coupled to
