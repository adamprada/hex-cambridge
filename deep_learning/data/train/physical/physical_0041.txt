are given as simple products of the eigenfunctions of the individual angular momenta to form eigenfunctions of and a eigenfunctions of because the individual elements of are formed additively but is not it is straightforward to form eigenstates of simple products of the form are eigenfunctions of and have eigenvalues equal to the sum of the individual eigenvalues hence to form an eigenfunction with specified and eigenvalues one must combine only those product states whose sum is equal to the specified value b eigenfunctions of the clebschgordon series the task is then reduced to forming eigenfunctions given particular values for
