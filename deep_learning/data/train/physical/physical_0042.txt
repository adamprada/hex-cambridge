by the quantum numbers characterizing the uncoupled product basis it turns out that this matrix can be shown to be unitary so that the cg coefficients obey summm langle jmjmjmrangle langle jmjmjmrangle deltajjprime deltammprime and sumjm langle jnjnjmrangle langle jmjmjmrangle deltanm deltanm this unitarity of the cg coefficient matrix allows the inverse of the relation giving coupled functions in terms of the product functions to be written as this result expresses the product functions in terms of the coupled angular momentum functions c generation of the clebschgordon coefficients the clebschgordon coefficients can be generated in a systematic manner however they
