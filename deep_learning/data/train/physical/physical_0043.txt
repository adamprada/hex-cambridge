states in terms of which is expressed because both and have the same value which is orthogonal to because and are eigenfunctions of the hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues they must be orthogonal this same process is then used to generate and by orthogonality construction and so on i the states with maximum and minimum mvalues we begin with the state having the highest value this state must be formed by taking the highest and the highest values ie and and is given by only this one product is needed because only the one term with mj and mj
