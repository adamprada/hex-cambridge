states with one lower value to find the state that has the same value as the one found above but one lower value we must construct another combination of the two product states with ie and that is orthogonal to the combination representing after doing so we must scale the resulting function so it is properly normalized in this case the desired function is it is straightforward to show that this function is indeed orthogonal to iv states with even one lower value having expressed and in terms of and we are now prepared to carry on with this stepwise
