once is obtained it is then possible to move on to form and by applying to the three states obtained in the preceding application of the process and to then form as the combination of that is orthogonal to the combinations obtained for and again notice that there are precisely the correct number of product states four here as there are total angular momentum states to be formed in fact the product states and the total angular momentum states are equal in number and are both members of orthonormal function sets because and as well as and are hermitian operators
