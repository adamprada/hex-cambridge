determine the state with highest value is the state which can be represented by the product of an spin function representing and a spatial function representing where the first function corresponds to the first openshell orbital and the second function to the second openshell orbital thus the maximum value is and corresponds to a state with clearly the state would be given as the states and with one lower value are obtained by applying to as follows to apply or to one must realize that each of these operators is in turn a sum of lowering operators for each of
