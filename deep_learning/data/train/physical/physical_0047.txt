not be allowed to contribute to the final si wave functions we are trying to form the full resolution of how to deal with this paradox is given in the following subsection but for now let me say the following i once you have learned that all of the spinorbital product functions shown for eg and represent slater determinants we deal with this in the next subsection that are antisymmetric with respect to permutation of any pair of electrons you will understand that the slater determinant corresponding to vanishes ii if instead of considering the configuration of si we wanted
