that the requisite function is in the spinorbital notation used above this state is thus far we have found the states with and to find the states with and we must once again apply the tool in particular we apply to to obtain and we apply to to obtain each of which will be expressed in terms of and the state is then constructed to be a combination of these same product states which is orthogonal to and to the results are as follows jmrangle fracsqrt rangle rangle rangle rangle rangle rangle where in all cases a short hand notation
