the highest within the states is not hence knowing an combination one knows the first term symbol that arises from this configuration in the example this is because the level with this and quantum numbers contains states with and quantum numbers running from to and from to respectively one must remove from the original box this number of product states to do so one simply erases from the box one entry with each such and value actually since the box need only show those entries with nonnegative and values only these entries need be explicitly deleted in the example this
