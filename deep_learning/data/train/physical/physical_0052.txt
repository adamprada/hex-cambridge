equivalent and nonequivalent angular momenta one can determine all possible couplings of the equivalent angular momenta using this method and then use the simpler vector coupling method to add the nonequivalent angular momenta to each of these coupled angular momenta for example the configuration can be handled by vector coupling using the straightforward nonequivalent procedure the d orbital and the third electrons spin to each of and arising from the configuration the result is and contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and professor of chemistry u utah telluride schools on theoretical chemistry integrated by tomoyuki hayashi uc davis
