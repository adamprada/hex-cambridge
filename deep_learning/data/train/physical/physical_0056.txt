probability of that a will come up when the second die is thrown suppose the first die is red and the second die is green the probability that the red die comes up and the green die comes up is above we looked at the number of outcomes associated with a score of to find that the probability of this event is we can use another argument to get this result the probability that two dice roll a score of three is equal to the probability that the first die shows or times the probability that the second die shows
