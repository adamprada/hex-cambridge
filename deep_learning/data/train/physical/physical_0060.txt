prove to do so we prove that is we assume that spontaneous transfer of heat from a colder to a warmer body is possible and show that this leads to a contradiction of the entropybased statement of the second law let the quantity of heat received by the warmer body be and let the temperatures of the warmer and colder bodies be and respectively we have the colder body receives heat we make the heat increment so small that there is no significant change in the temperature of either body no other changes occur the two bodies are the only
