shown that a violation of the temperaturebased statement implies a violation of the entropybased statement of the second law so that it is equally easy to show that the temperaturebased statement implies the entropybased statement of the second law to do so we assume that the entropybased statement is false and show that this implies that the temperaturebased statement must be false by the arguments above the entropy change that the universe experiences during the exchange of the heat increment is if the entropybased statement of the second law is false then it follows that that is the spontaneous process
