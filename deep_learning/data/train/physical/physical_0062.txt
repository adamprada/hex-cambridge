sample is equal to avogadros number avogadros number is the number of molecules in a mole in the modern definition one mole is the number of atoms of in exactly g of that is the number of atoms of in exactly g of is avogadros number the currently accepted value is molecules per mole we can find the gram atomic mass of any other element by finding the mass of that element that combines with exactly g of in a compound whose molecular formula is known the validity of avogadros hypothesis follows immediately either from the fact that the boyles
