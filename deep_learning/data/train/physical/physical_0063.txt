gaseous substances and to create the atomic mass scale bands of orbitals in solids last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack simonsprofessor emeritus and henry eyring scientist chemistry at university of utah contributors and attributions not only does the particleinabox model offer a useful conceptual representation of electrons moving in polyenes but it also is the zerothorder model of band structures in solids let us consider a simple onedimensional crystal consisting of a large number of atoms or molecules each with a single orbital the blue spheres shown below that it contributes to the bonding let us
