happens for an infinitely long chain the key point is that the discrete number of molecular orbitals appearing in the orbital cases evolves into a continuum of orbitals called a band as the number of building blocks becomes large this band of orbital energies ranges from its bottom whose orbital consists of a fully inphase bonding combination of the building block orbitals to its top whose orbital is a fully outofphase antibonding combination in figure we illustrate these fully bonding and fully antibonding band orbitals for two cases the bottom involving stype building block orbitals and the top involving type
