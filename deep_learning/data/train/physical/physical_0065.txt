dispersion in energies that a given band of orbitals is split into as these atomic orbitals combine to form a band is determined by how strongly the orbitals on neighboring atoms overlap small overlap produces small dispersion and large overlap yields a broad band so the band structure of any particular system can vary from one in which narrow bands weak overlap do not span the energy gap between the energies of their constituent atomic orbitals to bands that overlap strongly large overlap figure the bonding through antibonding energies and band orbitals arising from and from atomic orbitals depending on
