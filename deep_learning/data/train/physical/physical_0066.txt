other hand for alkaline earth systems with two electrons per atom the sband will be completely filled in such cases conduction requires excitation to the lowest members of the nearby porbital band finally if each building block were an al s p atom the sband would be full and the pband would be half filled in figure a we show a qualitative depiction of the bands arising from sodium atoms and orbitals notice that the band is very narrow because there is little coupling between neighboring orbitals so they are only slightly stabilized or destabilized relative to their energies in
