coefficients that describe each orbital as a linear combination of the constituent atomic orbitals using the onedimensional array of and orbitals shown in figure as an example the lowest member of the band deriving from the orbitals is a totally bonding combination of all of the constituent orbitals on the sites of the lattice the highestenergy orbital in this band is a totally antibonding combination of the constituent orbitals each of the intervening orbitals in this band has expansion coefficients that allow the orbital to be written as clearly for small values of the series of expansion coefficients has few
