onedimensional particleinabox wave function which also is used to model electronic states delocalized along a linear chain as we saw in chapter the energies for this model system varied as with being the quantum number ranging from to the lowestenergy state with has no nodes the state with has one node and that with has nodes so if we replace by and replace the box length by where is the interatom spacing and is the number of atoms in the chain we obtain from which on can see why the energy can be expected to vary as in contrast for
