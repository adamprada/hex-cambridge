we would obtain a plot that decreases from to for bands comprised of orbitals the energies vary with the quantum number in a manner analogous to how the band varies because the orbital with no interatom sign changes is fully bonding for two and threedimensional lattices comprised of s p and d orbitals on the constituent atoms the behavior of the bands derived from these orbitals follows analogous trends it is common to describe the sign alternations arising from site to site in terms of a socalled vector in the onedimensional case discussed above this vector has only one component
