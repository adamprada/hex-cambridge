be written in terms of its two or three index ratios respectively as here and would describe the number of unit cells along the three principal axes of the threedimensional crystal and do likewise in the twodimensional lattice case in such two and three dimensional crystal cases the energies of orbitals within bands derived from s p d etc atomic orbitals display variations that also reflect the number of interatom sign changes however now there are variations as functions of the and indices and these variations can display rather complicated shapes depending on the symmetry of the atoms within the
