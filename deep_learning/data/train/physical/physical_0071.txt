various bands in the neighborhood of the point because this is where there are the fewest interatom nodes and thus the wave function is easiest to visualize lets consider a few examples to help clarify these issues in figure b where we see the band structure of graphene you can see the quadratic variations of the energies with as one moves away from the point labeled with some bands increasing with and others decreasing with figure b band structure plot for graphene the band having an energy of ca ev at the point originates from bonding interactions involving orbitals on
