ev at the point because there are two atoms per unit cell in this case there are a total of eight valence electrons four from each carbon atom to be accommodated in these bands the eight carbon valence electrons fill the bonding and two bands fully as well as the bonding band only along the direction labeled p in figure b do the bonding and antibonding bands become degenerate near ev the approach of these two bands is what allows graphene to be semimetallic ie to conduct at modest temperatures high enough to promote excitations from the bonding to the
