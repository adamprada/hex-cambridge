bands notice that along no direction in space do these filled bonding bands become degenerate with or are crossed by any of the other bands the other bands remain at higher energy along all directions and thus there is a gap between the bonding bands and the others is large ca ev or more along any direction in space this is why diamond is an insulator the band gap is very large finally lets compare the graphene and diamond cases with a metallic case such as shown in figure d for al and for ag figure d band structures of
