negative curvature respectively along several directions eg there are crossings among the bands these crossings allow electrons to be promoted from occupied to previously unoccupied bands the partial occupancy of the bands and the multiple crossings of bands are what allow al to show metallic behavior for ag there are six bands between ev and ev five of these bands change little with and one shows somewhat parabolic dependence on the former five derive from atomic orbitals that are contracted enough to not allow them to overlap much and the latter is based on bonding orbital interaction ten of the
