bands in tin along various directions in space left and densities of states right as functions of energy for this same crystal the density of states at energy is computed by summing all those orbitals having an energy between and clearly as seen in figure e for bands in which the orbital energies vary strongly with ie socalled broad bands the density of states is low in contrast for narrow bands the density of states is high the densities of states are important because their energies and energy spreads relate to electronic spectral features moreover just as gaps between the
