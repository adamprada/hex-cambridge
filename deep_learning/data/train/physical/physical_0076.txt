way to easily ie with little energy requirement promote some of their higherenergy electrons from orbital to orbital and thus effect conduction the case of diamond discussed above is an example of an insulator if the band gap between a filled band and an unfilled band is small it may be possible for thermal excitation ie collisions with neighboring atoms or molecules to cause excitation of electrons from the former to the latter thereby inducing conductive behavior the band structures of al and ag discussed above offer examples of this case a simple depiction of how thermal excitations can induce
