figure the filled and empty bands the band gap and empty acceptor or filled donor bands if this insulator material is synthesized with a small amount of dopant whose valence orbitals have energies between the filled and empty bands of the insulator one can generate a semiconductor if the dopant species has no valence electrons ie has an empty valence orbital it gives rise to an empty band lying between the filled and empty bands of the insulator as shown below in case a of figure in this case the dopant band can act as an electron acceptor for electrons
