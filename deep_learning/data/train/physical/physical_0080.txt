we will be curious about the extent to which our two samples agree with one another since the total number of vehicles will be different the appropriate way to go about this is obviously to compare the fraction of cars in each speed range in fact using fractions enables us to compare any number of such studies to the extent that these studies measure the same thingtypical speeds under the specified conditionsthe fraction of automobiles in any particular speed interval should be approximately constant dividing the number of automobiles in each speed interval by the total number of automobiles gives
