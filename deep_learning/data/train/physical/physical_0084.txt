us that we can be more specific about the dependence on the quantity of gas suppose that we have a volume of gas at a fixed pressure and temperature and imagine that we introduce a very thin barrier that divides the volume into exactly equal halves without changing anything else in this case the pressure and temperature of the gas in each of the new containers will be the same as they were originally but the volume is half as great and the number of moles in each of the halfsize containers must also be half of the original number
