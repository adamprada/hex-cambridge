law using simplifying assumptions we are now able to do this derivation much more rigorously we consider the collisions of gas molecules with a small portion of the wall of their container we suppose that the wall is smooth so that we can select a small and compact segment of it that is arbitrarily close to being planar we denote both the segment of the wall and its area as can have any shape so long as it is a smooth flat surface enclosed by a smooth curve let the volume of the container be and the number of gas
