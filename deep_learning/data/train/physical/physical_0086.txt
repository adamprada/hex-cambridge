then the unit vector along the axis and a vector perpendicular to are parallel to one another it is convenient to express the velocity of the selected molecule in spherical coordinates we suppose that referred to the cartesian coordinate system we have erected the velocity vector of the selected molecule is the vector drawn from the origin of our cartesian system to the point of impact on the wall follows the trajectory of the molecule from time zero to time the component of the molecular velocity vector is normal to the plane of at the point of impact the magnitude
