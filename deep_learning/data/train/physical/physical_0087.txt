collisionby one molecule traveling at velocity makes to the pressure on the wall is we want to find the pressure on segment of the wall that results from all possible impacts to do so we recognize that any other molecule whose velocity components are and and whose location at time enables it to reach within time makes the same contribution to the pressure as the selected molecule does let us begin by assuming that the velocities of all n of the molecules in the volume are the same as that of the selected molecule in this case we can find
