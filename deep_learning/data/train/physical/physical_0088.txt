the plane of and the plane of is the volume of this tube is therefore since there are molecules per unit volume the total number of molecules in the tube is when we assume that every molecule has velocity components and all of the molecules in the tube reach within time because each of them travels parallel to the selected molecule and each of them is initially at least as close to as is the selected molecule therefore each molecule in the tube contributes to the pressure at the total pressure is the pressure per molecule multiplied by the number
