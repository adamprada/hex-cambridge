the impacting molecules must have a velocity component in the positive zdirection the possible values of lie in the interval we designate the velocity of the original molecule as and retain this notation to be as specific as possible in describing the tube bounded by and however the velocity components of an arbitrary molecule can have any of the allowed values to integrate see appendix d over the allowed values we drop the superscripts the pressurepressureon wall at becomes intinfty vexpleftfraclambda vrightdv intpi mathrmcos theta mathrmsin theta dtheta intpi dvarphi and the pressurevolume product becomes since and are constants this
