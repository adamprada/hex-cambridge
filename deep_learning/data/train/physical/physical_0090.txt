to hit the wall within time at time the molecule must be within the tubular segment of volume is the probability that the molecule is within this tubular segment is equal to the fraction of the total volume that this segment occupies therefore the product is the pressure contribution of a molecule with velocity when is in the interval the total pressure per molecule is the expected value of this pressure contribution the expected value is the integral over the entire volume of velocity space of the pressure contribution times the probability density function for velocities it is useful to
