the number of molecules with large values of is constrained by the conservation of energy since the total energy of a collection of molecules is limited only a small proportion of the molecules can have very large velocities the boltzmann factor introduces this constraint a molecule whose mass is m and whose scalar velocity is has kinetic energy the boltzmann factor is often written as buffers last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry at california state university east bay contributors and attributions buffer solutions which are of enormous importance in controlling ph
