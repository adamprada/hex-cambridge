x this expression results in a quadratic relationship leading to two values of that will make it true rejecting the negative root the remaining root of the equation indicates so the ph is given by for buffers made from acids with sufficiently large values of pka the buffer problem can be simplified since the concentration of the acid and its conjugate base will be determined by their preequilibrium values in these cases the ph can be calculated using the hendersonhasselbalch approximation if one considers the expression for taking the log of both sides and multiplying by yields an rearrangement produces
