as one knows initial and final state for example if the initial and final volume are the same the entropy can be calculated by assuming a reversible isochoric pathway and determining an expression for that term can then be integrated from the initial condition to the final conditions to determine the entropy change isothermal changes if the initial and final temperatures are the same the most convenient reversible path to use to calculate the entropy is an isothermal pathway as an example consider the isothermal expansion of an ideal gas from to as was derived in chapter so is given
