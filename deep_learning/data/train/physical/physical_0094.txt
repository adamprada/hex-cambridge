is constant over the temperature range if the temperature dependence of the heat capacity is known it can be incorporated into the integral for example if can be expressed as takes the form which simplifies to or isochoric changes similarly to the cast of constant pressure it is fairly simple to calculate since is given by and so for changes over which is independent of the temperature is given by adiabatic changes the easiest pathway for which to calculate entropy changes is an adiabatic pathway since for an adiabatic change then as well phase changes the entropy change for a
