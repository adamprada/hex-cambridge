and reactions the thermodynamics of chemical reactions can be very important in terms of controlling the production of desired products and preventing safety hazards such as explosions as such measuring and understanding the thermochemistry of chemical reactions is not only useful but essential calorimetry the techniques of calorimetry can be used to measure q for a chemical reaction directly the enthalpy change for a chemical reaction is of significant interest to chemists an exothermic reaction will release heat causing the temperature of the surrounding to increase conversely an endothermic reaction will draw heat from the surroundings causing the temperature of
