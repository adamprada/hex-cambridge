is then submerged in a reproducible quantity of water the temperature of which is monitored with a highprecision thermometer for combustion reactions the bomb will be loaded with a small sample of the compound to be combusted and then the bomb is filled with a high pressure typically about atm of o the reaction is initiated by supplying heat using a short piece of resistive wire carrying an electrical current figure a bomb calorimeter after the temperature of the water in the insulated container has reached a constant value the combustion reaction is initiated by passing an electric current through
