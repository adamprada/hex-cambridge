be calculated from the temperature change using the following relationship where n is the number of moles of benzoic acid used is the internal energy of combustion for benzoic acid kj mol at oc accounts for the energy released in the combustion of the fuse wire eother account for any other corrections such as heat released due to the combustion of residual nitrogen in the bomb and dt is the measured temperature change in the surrounding water bath once the water equivalent is determined for a calorimeter the temperature change can be used to find for an unknown compound from
