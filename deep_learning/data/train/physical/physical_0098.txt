of combustion can be calculated from the internal energy change if the balanced chemical reaction is known recall from the definition of enthalpy and if the gasphase reactants and products can be treated as ideal gases at constant temperature for the combustion of benzoic acid at oc it can be seen that is mol of gas for every mole of benzoic acid reacted example combustion of naphthalene a student burned a g sample of benzoic acid in a bomb calorimeter initially at oc and saw a temperature increase of oc she then burned a g sample of naphthalene again from
