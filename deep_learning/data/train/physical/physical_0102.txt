and temperature of a gas when measurements are made at constant pressure we can imagine rediscovering charles law by trapping a sample of gas in a tube and measuring its volume as we change the temperature while keeping the pressure constant this presumes that we have a way to measure temperature perhaps by defining it in terms of the volume of a fixed quantity of some other fluidlike liquid mercury at a fixed pressure we observe a linear relationship between the volume of a sample of gas and its temperature like that in figure if we repeat this experiment with
