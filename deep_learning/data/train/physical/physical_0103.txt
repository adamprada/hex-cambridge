reflection shows that here too the slope and intercept must be directly proportional to the number of moles of gas so that we can rewrite our equation as when we repeat these experiments with different gaseous substances we discover an additional important fact and are the same for any gas this means that the temperature at which the volume extrapolates to zero is the same for any gas and is independent of the constant pressure we maintain as we vary the temperature figure chemical change last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack simonsprofessor emeritus and henry eyring
