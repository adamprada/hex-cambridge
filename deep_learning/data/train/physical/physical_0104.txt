to the concentrations and of these molecules and the ability to monitor these signals as functions of time so that these concentrations can be followed as time evolves the third requirement is what allows one to determine the rates at which the and molecules are reacting many of the experimental tools used to identify molecules eg nmr allows one to identify functional groups and nearneighbor functional groups ir also allows functional groups to be seen and to determine their concentrations have restricted time scales over which they can be used for example nmr spectra require that the sample be studied
