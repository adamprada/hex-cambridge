the reaction of radicals eg as formed in the decomposition of chloroflurocarbons cfcs by ultraviolet light with ozone to generate and one can not simply deposit a known amount of radicals from a vessel into a container in which gaseous of a known concentration has been prepared the radicals will recombine and react with other species making their concentrations difficult to determine so alternatively one places known concentrations of some radical precursor eg a cfc or some other xcl species and ozone into a reaction vessel one then uses for example a very short light pulse whose photons frequencies are
