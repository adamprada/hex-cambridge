xcl molecules that dissociate to produce must be known such information is available albeit from rather tedious earlier studies for a variety of xcl precursors so knowing the time at which the radicals are formed and their initial concentrations one then allows the reaction to proceed for some time duration one then at uses a second light source to probe either the concentration of the the or the to determine the extent of progress of the reaction which species is so monitored depends on the availability of light sources whose frequencies these species absorb such probe experiments are carried out
