of that is formed in the pump event can be taken as constant and known if the initial concentration of is denoted and the concentration of is called this kinetic equation reduces to the solution of which is so knowing the concentration as a function of time delay and knowing the initial ozone concentration as well as the initial radical concentration one can find the rate constant such pumpprobe experiments are necessary when one wants to study species that must be generated and allowed to react immediately this is essentially always the case when one or more of the reactants
