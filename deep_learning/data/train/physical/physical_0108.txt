reaction that is in such an equilibrium condition and to then use some external means to slightly perturb the equilibrium because both the forward and reverse rates are assumed to be very fast it is essential to use a perturbation that can alter the concentrations very quickly this usually precludes simply adding a small amount of one or more of the reacting species to the reaction vessel instead one might employ for example a fast light source or electric field pulse to perturb the equilibrium to one side or the other for example if the reaction thermochemistry is known the
