delta tag once the perturbation has been applied and then turned off subsequently the following rate law will govern the time evolution of the concentration change d assuming that is very small so that the term involving cam be neglected and using the fact that the forward and reverse rates balance at equilibrium this equation for the time evolution of can be reduced to so the concentration deviations from equilibrium will return to equilibrium ie will decay to zero exponentially with an effective rate coefficient that is equal to a sum of terms involving both the forward and reverse rate
