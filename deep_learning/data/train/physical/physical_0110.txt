the concentrations of at least some of the species as time evolves clearly for very fast reactions this means that one must use experimental tools that can respond on a very short time scale modern laser technology and molecular beam methods have provided some of the most widely used of such tools these experimental approaches are discussed in some detail in chapter theoretical simulation of chemical change the most common theoretical approach to simulating a chemical reaction is to use newtonian dynamics to follow the motion of the nuclei on a bornoppenheimer electronic energy surface if the molecule of interest
