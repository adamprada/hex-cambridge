trajectory with initial coordinates characteristic of the reactant species ie within one of the valleys on the reactant side of the potential surface and one follows the trajectory long enough to determine whether the collision results in a nonreactive outcome characterized by final coordinates describing reactant not product molecules or a reactive outcome that is recognized by the final coordinates describing product molecules rather than reactants one must do so for a large number of trajectories whose initial coordinates and moment are representative of the experimental conditions one is attempting to simulate then one has to average the outcomes of
