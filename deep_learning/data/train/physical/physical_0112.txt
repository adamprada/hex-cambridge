gradient of the bo energy computed at the values of the coordinates the above propagation procedure is then used again but with the values of and appropriate to time as new initial coordinates and momenta to generate yet another set of and values in such direct dynamics approaches the energy gradients which produce the forces are computed only at geometries that the classical trajectory encounters along its time propagation in the earlier procedure in which the bo energy is fit to an analytical form one often computes at geometries that the trajectory never accesses in carrying out such a classical
