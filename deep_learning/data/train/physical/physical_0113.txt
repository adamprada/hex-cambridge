as shown in figure figure crossed beam experiment in which and molecules collide in a reaction vessel even though the and molecules all collide at right angles and with specified kinetic energies and thus specified initial momenta not all of these collisions occur head on figure illustrates this point figure two a b collisions in the first the and have a small distance of closest approach in the second this distance is larger here we show two collisions between an and a molecule both of which have identical and velocities and respectively what differs in the two events is their
