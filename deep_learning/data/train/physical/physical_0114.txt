the molecule relative to at a series of times showing moving from right to left in the figure on the left the molecule clearly undergoes a closer collision than is the case on the right the distance of closest approach in each case is called the impact parameter and it represents the distance of closest approach if the colliding partners did not experience any attractive or repulsive interactions as the above figures would be consistent with of course when and have forces acting between them the trajectories shown above would be modified to look more like those shown in figure
