beyond which the and molecules no longer interact and thus can no longer undergo reaction each trajectory is followed long enough to determine whether it leads to geometries characteristic of the product molecules the fraction of such trajectories weighted by the volume element for trajectories with impact parameters in the range between and then gives the averaged fraction of trajectories that react in most simulations of chemical reactions there are more initial conditions that also must sampled ie trajectories with a variety of initial variables must be followed and properly weighted for example if there is a range of velocities
