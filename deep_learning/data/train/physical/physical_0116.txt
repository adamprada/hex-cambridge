large number of classical trajectories fortunately such a task is well suited to distributed parallel computing so it is currently feasible to do so even for rather complex reactions there is a situation in which the above classical trajectory approach can be foolish to pursue even if there is reason to believe that a classical newton description of the nuclear motions is adequate this occurs when one has a rather high barrier to surmount to evolve from reactants to products and when the fraction of trajectories whose initial conditions permit this barrier to be accessed is very small in such
