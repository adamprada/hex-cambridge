achieve better accuracy in the reaction probability when faced with such rareevent situations one is usually better off using an approach that breaks the problem of determining what fraction of the properly weighted initial conditions produce reaction into two parts among all of the properly weighted initial conditions what fraction can access the highenergy barrier and of those that do access the high barrier how may react this way of formulating the reaction probability question leads to the transition state theory tst method that is treated in detail in chapter along with some of its more common variants briefly the
