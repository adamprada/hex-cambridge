produced for any given set of reactants we can accomplish this predictive program in two steps first we find all of the sets of products that can be obtained from the given reactants each such set represents a possible reaction we suppose that for each set of possible products we are able to predict the equilibrium composition predicting which reaction will occur is equivalent to finding the reaction whose position of equilibrium lies farthest in the direction of its products from this perspective being able to predict the position of equilibrium for the reactants and any stoichiometrically consistent set of
