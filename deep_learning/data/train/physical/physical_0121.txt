twostep mechanism involving an intermediate the sum of these elementary processes yields the same overall reaction as before this mechanism implies the following differential equations at equilibrium both and must be constant so both differential equations must be equal to zero hence at equilibrium multiplying these we have the concentration dependence of the equilibrium constant for the twostep mechanism equation refeqb is the same as for case that the reaction is an elementary process equation refeqb as far as the description of the equilibrium system is concerned the only difference is that the equilibrium constant is interpreted as a function
