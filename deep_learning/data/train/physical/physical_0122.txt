form the ratio of forward to reverse rate constants for each of the elementary reactions and multiply them the concentration of reactant must appear in the product to the power the concentration of product must appear to the power and the concentrations of the intermediates must all cancel out we conclude that the condition for equilibrium in the general case is where we drop the subscripts trusting ourselves to remember that the equation is valid only when the concentration terms apply to the equilibrated system pure phases when the reaction involves a pure phase as a reactant or product we
