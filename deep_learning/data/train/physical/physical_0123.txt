experimental observation within our kinetic model for equilibrium we postulate that the rate at which molecules leave the pure phase is proportional to the area of the phase that is in contact with the reaction solution that is we postulate that the rate at which molecules return to the pure phase from the reaction solution is proportional to both the area and the concentration of the substance in the reaction solution if the pure phase consists of substance we have at equilibrium we have so that and chemical kinetics last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired
