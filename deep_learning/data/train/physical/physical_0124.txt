briefly at all of these but the thrust of our development will be to understand how the rate of a reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactions reactants and products many reactions that we observe actually occur as a sequence of more simple reactions such a sequence of simple reaction steps is called a reaction mechanism our principal goal is to understand the relationships among concentrations reaction rates reaction mechanisms and the conditions that must be satisfied when a particular reaction reaches equilibrium we will find that two related ideas characterize equilibrium from a reactionrate perspective one is that
