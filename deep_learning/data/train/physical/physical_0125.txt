equilibrium will be if the gases behave ideally the chemical potentials can be described in terms of the mole fractions of and where daltons law has been used to express the mole fractions equation refeq can be simplified by collecting all chemical potentials terms on the left muao mubo rt ln left dfracpbptot right rt lnleft dfracpaptot right labeleq combining the logarithms terms and recognizing that muao mubo delta go for the reaction one obtains and since for this reaction assuming perfectly ideal behavior one can write another way to achieve this result is to consider the gibbs function change
