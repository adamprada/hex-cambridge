increasing if the stoichiometric coefficients are expressed in this way the expression for the reaction quotient becomes using this expression the gibbs function change for the system can be calculated from and since at equilibrium and it is evident that it is in this simple way that and are related it is also of value to note that the criterion for a spontaneous chemical process is that rather than as is stated in many texts recall that is a function of all of the reactants and products being in their standard states of unit fugacity or activity however the direction
