argument is a physical system that is a state function maps a real system onto a real number when we insert a thermometer into a mixture the measurement that we make maps the state of the mixture onto the real number that we call temperature the word thermodynamics joins roots that convey the ideas of heat and motion in general motion involves kinetic energy and mechanical work the interconversion of heat and mechanical work is the core concern of the science of thermodynamics we are familiar with the idea that kinetic energy can be converted into work given a suitable
