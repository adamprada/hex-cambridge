to use the term microscopic process to refer to an event that occurs at the atomic or molecular level we call a process that occurs on a larger scale a macroscopic process although the usual connotation is that a macroscopic process is observable in a quantity of bulk matter when friction causes the degradation of macroscopic motion to heat we can say that macroscopic motion is converted to microscopic motion while this terminology is convenient it is not very precise changes visible under an optical microscope are macroscopic processes of course all macroscopic changes are ultimately attributable to an accumulation
