momentum is transferred to the particle in the direction of the jiggle than in any other we are also familiar with the idea that heat can be converted into mechanical motion in an earlier era steam engines were the dominant means by which heat was converted to work steam turbines remain important in large stationary facilities like power plants for applications we encounter in daily life the steam engine has been replaced by the internalcombustion engine when we want to create mechanical motion do work with a heat engine it is important to know how much heat we need in
