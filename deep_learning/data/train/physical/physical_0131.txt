hearing that it cannot be done and that the reason has something to do with the second law of thermodynamics if we have heard more of the story we may remember that it is slightly more complicated under idealized circumstances heat can be converted into work completely if we confine an ideal gas in a frictionless piston and arrange to add heat to the gas while increasing the volume of the piston in a coordinated way such that the temperature of the gas remains constant the expanding piston will do work on some external entity and the amount of this
