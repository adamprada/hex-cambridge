a concentration of molar but doing so becomes impractical once the number of atoms in the system reaches a few thousand or if the molecules have significant intermolecular interactions as they do in condensedphase systems also as noted in chapter following the time evolution of such a large number of molecules can be confusing if one focuses on the shorttime behavior of any single molecule eg one sees jerky changes in its energy momentum and angular momentum by examining instead the longtime average behavior of each molecule or alternatively the average properties of a significantly large number of molecules one
