shared among a collection of molecules and within the internal rotational vibrational electronic and intermolecular translational degrees of freedom of these molecules when the molecules have a means for sharing or redistributing this energy eg by collisions the primary outcome of asking what is the most probable distribution of energy among a large number of molecules within a container of volume that is maintained in equilibrium by such energysharing at a specified temperature is the most important equation in statistical mechanics the boltzmann population formula this equation expresses the probability of finding the system which in the case introduced above
