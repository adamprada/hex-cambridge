contains the factor of because as we saw in chapter when we learned about classical action the integral of a coordinatemomentum product has units of plancks constant notice that the boltzmann formula does not say that only those states of one particular energy can be populated it gives nonzero probabilities for populating all states from the lowest to the highest however it does say that states of higher energy are disfavored by the factor but if states of higher energy have larger degeneracies which they usually do the overall population of such states may not be low that is there
