this function with respect to e and finding the energy at which this derivative vanishes one can show that this probability function has a peak at and that at this energy value by then asking at what energy the function drops to of this maximum value one finds so the width of the graph measured as the change in energy needed to cause to drop to of its maximum value divided by the value of the energy at which assumes this maximum value is this width gets smaller and smaller as increases the primary conclusion is that as the number
