hence is extremely large eg to only the most probable distribution of the total energy among the molecules need be considered this is the situation in which the equations of statistical mechanics are so useful certainly there are fluctuations as evidenced by the finite width of the above graph in the energy content of the molecule system about its most probable value however these fluctuations become less and less important as the system size ie becomes larger and larger basis of the boltzmann population formula to understand how this narrow boltzmann distribution of energies arises when the number of molecules
