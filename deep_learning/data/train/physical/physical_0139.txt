material that assures that the total energy of all molecules can not change so this collection of identical containers each containing molecules constitutes a closed ie with no molecules coming or going and isolated ie so total energy is constant system figure collection of identical cells having energyconducting walls that do not allow molecules to pass between cells equal a priori probability assumption one of the fundamental assumptions of statistical mechanics is that for a closed isolated system at equilibrium all quantum states of the system having energy equal to the energy with which the system is prepared are equally
