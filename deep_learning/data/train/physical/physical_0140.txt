quantum states of the large system containing molecules given what i said earlier about the futility in trying to find such states however what i am doing at this stage is to carry out a derivation that is based upon such quantum states but whose final form and final working equations will not actually require one to know or even be able to have these states in hand lets pretend that we know the quantum states that pertain to molecules in a container of volume as shown in figure and lets label these states by an index that is labels
