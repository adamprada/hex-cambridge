collisional ie thermal energy transfer among the containers an energylabeling for states of the entire collection of containers can be realized by giving the number of containers that exist in each singlecontainer jstate this is possible because under the assumption about the role of the walls just stated the energy of each container state is a sum of the energies of the singlecontainer states that comprise that container state for example if the label specifies the energy of this container state in terms of the energies of the states of the containers notice that this container state has the same
