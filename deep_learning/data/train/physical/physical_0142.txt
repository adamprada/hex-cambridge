are containers appearing in singlecontainer state with a total of containers is here denote the number of containers existing in singlecontainer states this combinatorial formula reflects the permutational degeneracy arising from placing containers into state containers into state etc if we imagine an extremely large number of containers and we view as well as the as being large numbers nb we will soon see that this is the case at least for the most probable distribution that we will eventually focus on we can ask for what choices of the variables is this degeneracy function a maximum moreover we can
