add up to the total number of containers so we have a constraint that the variables must obey the variables are also constrained to give the total energy of the container system when summed as we have two problems i how to maximize and ii how to impose these constraints because takes on values greater than unity for any choice of the will experience its maximum where has its maximum so we can maximize if doing so helps because the variables are assumed to take on large numbers when is large we can use sterlings approximation for the natural logarithm
