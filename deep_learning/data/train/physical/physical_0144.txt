the two lagrange multipliers and are introduced to allow the values of that maximize to ultimately obey the two constraints that is we first find values of the variables that make maximum these values will depend on and and will not necessarily obey the constraints however we will then choose and to assure that the two constraints are obeyed this is how the lagrange multiplier method works lagrange multiplier method taking the derivative of with respect to each independent variable and setting this derivative equal to zero gives this equation can be solved to give substituting this result into the
