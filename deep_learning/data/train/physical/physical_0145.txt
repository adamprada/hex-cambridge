the energy of that quantum state this shows that the average energy of a container computed as the total energy divided by the number of such containers can be computed as a derivative of the logarithm of the partition function as we show in the following section of this chapter all thermodynamic properties of the molecules in the container of volume can be obtained as derivatives of the natural logarithm of this function this is why the partition function plays such a central role in statistical mechanics to examine the range of energies over which each of the singlecontainer system
