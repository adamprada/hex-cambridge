this result we can expand in the neighborhood of in powers of as follows or equivalently this result clearly shows that the degeneracy and hence by the equal a priori probability hypothesis the probability of the container system occupying a state having falls off exponentially as the variables move away from their mostprobable values the thermodynamic limit as we noted earlier the are proportional to ie so when considering deviations away from the optimal we should consider deviations that are also proportional to in this way we are treating deviations of specified percentage or fractional amount which we denote thus
