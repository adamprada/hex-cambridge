containers in a given state can be written as alternatively we can say that the probability of a container occupying the state is using this probability we can compute the average energy as to compute the fluctuation in energy we first note that the fluctuation is defined as the average of the square of the deviation in energy from the average the following identity is now useful for further reexpressing the fluctuations recognizing the first factor immediately above as and the second factor as and noting that allows the fluctuation formula to be rewritten as because the parameter can be
