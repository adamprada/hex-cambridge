proportional to the number of molecules in the container as long as is reasonably large however because the righthand side involves it is proportional to and thus will be very small for large as long as does not become large as a result except near socalled critical points where the heat capacity does indeed become extremely large the fractional fluctuation in the energy of a given container of molecules will be very small ie proportional to this finding is related to the narrow distribution in energies that we discussed earlier in this section lets look at the expression in a
