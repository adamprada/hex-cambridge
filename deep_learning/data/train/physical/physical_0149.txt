in the energy of the system is only a fraction of a percent assuming is not large as near a critical point this example shows why it is often possible to use thermodynamic concepts and equations even for very small systems albeit realizing that fluctuations away from the most probable state are more important than in much larger systems partition functions and thermodynamic properties let us now examine how this idea of the most probable energy distribution being dominant gives rise to equations that offer molecularlevel expressions for other thermodynamic properties the first equation is the fundamental boltzmann population formula
