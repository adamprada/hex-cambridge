can be recast as to review how this proof is carried out we substitute the expressions for and for into the expression for i will use the notation labeling energy levels rather than energy states to allow the student to become used to this by noting that we can then rewrite as and then recalling that we finally obtain all other equilibrium properties can also be expressed in terms of the partition function for example if the average pressure is defined as the pressure of each quantum state defined as how the energy of that state changes if we change
