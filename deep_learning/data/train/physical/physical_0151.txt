volume of course there are additional sources of the vdependence of the energy levels for example as one shrinks the molecules become more crowded so their intermolecular energies also change without belaboring the point further it is possible to express all of the usual thermodynamic quantities in terms of the partition function the average energy and average pressure are given above as is the heat capacity the average entropy is given as the helmholtz free energy a is and the chemical potential is expressed as follows as we saw earlier it is also possible to express fluctuations in thermodynamic properties
