one could then use the above formulas to evaluate any thermodynamic properties and their fluctuations as derivatives of the averages discussed above derived using the probabilities associated with the most probable distribution are called ensemble averages with the set of states associated with the specified values of and constituting what is called a canonical ensemble averages derived using the probabilities constant for all states associated with specified values of and are called ensemble averages for a microcanonical ensemble there is another kind of ensemble that is often used in statistical mechanics it is called the grand canonical ensemble and relates
