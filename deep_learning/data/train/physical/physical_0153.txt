required to obey which means that the sum adds up to the total number of particles in the isolated systems large container that was divided into m smaller container in this case the walls separating each small container are assumed to allow for energy transfer as in the canonical ensemble and for molecules to move from one container to another unlike the canonical ensemble using lagrange multipliers as before to maximize subject to the above three constraints involves maximizing and gives or imposing the first constraint gives or where the partition function is defined by the sum in the denominator
