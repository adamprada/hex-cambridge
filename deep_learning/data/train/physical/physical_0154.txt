much like those of the canonical ensemble except for the result expressing the average number of molecules in the container nave in terms of the derivative of the partition function with respect to the chemical potential in addition to the equal a priori probability postulate stated earlier ie that in the thermodynamic limit ie large every quantum state of an isolated system in equilibrium having fixed and is equally probable statistical mechanics makes another assumption it assumes that in the thermodynamic limit the ensemble average eg using equal probabilities for all states of an isolated system having specified and or
