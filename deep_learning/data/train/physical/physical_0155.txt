the thermalaveraged number of quantum states that are accessible to the system at specified values of and this can be seen best by again noting that in the quantum expression the partition function is equal to a sum of the number of quantum states in the jth energy level multiplied by the boltzmann population factor of that level so is dimensionless and is a measure of how many states the system can access at temperature another way to think of is suggested by rewriting the helmholtz free energy definition given above as this identity shows that can be viewed as
