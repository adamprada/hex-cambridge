among the molecules can be neglected ie in the dilute idealgas limit at least as far as expressing the state energies each of the energies can be written as a sum of the energies of each individual molecule in such a case the above partition function reduces to a product of individualmolecule partition functions where the n factor arises as a degeneracy factor having to do with the permutational indistinguishability of the molecules eg one must not count both with molecule in state and molecule in state and with molecule in state and molecule in state they are the same
