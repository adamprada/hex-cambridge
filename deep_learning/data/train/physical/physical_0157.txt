where is the mass of the molecule and is the volume to which its motion is constrained for molecules constrained to a surface of area the corresponding result is and for molecules constrained to move along a single axis over a length the result is the magnitudes these partition functions can be computed using in amu in kelvin and or in cm cm or cm as clearly the magnitude of depends strongly on the number of dimensions the molecule and move around in this is a result of the vast differences in translational state densities in and dimensions recall that
