there are if one wants to treat the vibrations at a level higher than harmonic this expression can be modified by replacing the harmonic energies by higherlevel expressions electronic where and are the energies and degeneracies of the electronic state the sum is carried out for those states for which the product is numerically significant ie levels that any significant thermal population it is conventional to define the energy of a molecule or ion with respect to that of its atoms so the first term in the electronic partition function is usually written as we where we is the degeneracy
