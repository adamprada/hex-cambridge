relates to the energy spacings and degeneracies of these states the above partition function and thermodynamic equations form the essence of how statistical mechanics provides the tools for connecting moleculelevel properties such as energy levels and degeneracies which ultimately determine the and the to the macroscopic properties such as etc if one has a system for which the quantum energy levels are not known it may be possible to express all of the thermodynamic properties in terms of the classical partition function if the system could be adequately described by classical dynamics this partition function is computed by evaluating the
