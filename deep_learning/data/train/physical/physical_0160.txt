and thus where knowing the quantum energy levels of the molecule system is highly unlikely in such cases the classical hamiltonian is often written in terms of which contains all of the kinetic energy factors as well as all of the potential energies other than the intermolecular potentials and the intermolecular potential which depends only on a subset of the coordinates for example let us assume that depends only on the relative distances between molecules ie on the translational degrees of freedom which we denote denoting all of the remaining coordinates as the classical partition function integral can be reexpressed
