equations that relate thermodynamic properties to partition functions contain all such properties will decompose into a sum of two parts one coming from and one coming from the latter contains all the effects of the intermolecular interactions this means that in this classical mechanics case all the thermodynamic equations can be written as an ideal component plus a part that arises from the intermolecular forces again the statistical mechanics text by mcquarrie is a good source for reading more details on these topics equilibrium constants in terms of partition functions one of the most important and useful applications of statistical
