hypothetical chemical equilibrium the equilibrium constant can be written if the species can be treated as having negligibly weak intermolecular potentials as here is the partition function for molecules of type confined to volume at temperature as another example consider the isomerization reaction involving the normal n and zwitterionic z forms of arginine that were discussed in chapter here the pertinent equilibrium constant would be so if one can evaluate the partition functions for reactant and product molecules in terms of the translational electronic vibrational and rotational energy levels of these species one can express the equilibrium constant in terms
