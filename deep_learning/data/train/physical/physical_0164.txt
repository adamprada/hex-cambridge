out the chemical potential of the solvent is reduced by the presence of a solute in a mixture the chemical potential of component can be calculated by and because is always less than or equal to the chemical potential is always reduced by the addition of another component the condition under which the solvent will freeze is where the chemical potential of the liquid is given by equation refchemp which rearrangement to to evaluate the temperature dependence of the chemical potential it is useful to consider the temperature derivative at constant pressure recalling that and equation refbigeq becomes and noting
