where is the difference between the freezing temperature of the pure solvent and that of the solvent in the solution also for small deviations from the pure freezing point can be replaced by the approximate value so the equation refint becomes dfracdelta hfusrto delta t ln chia labelint further for dilute solutions for which the mole fraction of the solvent is very nearly then where is the mole fraction of the solute after a small bit of rearrangement this results in an expression for freezing point depression of the first factor can be replaced by which is the cryoscopic constant
