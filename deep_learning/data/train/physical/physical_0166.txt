as such the magnitude of will change as the freezing process continually removes solvent from the liquid phase of the solution boiling point elevation the derivation of an expression describing boiling point elevation is similar to that for freezing point depression in short the introduction of a solute into a liquid solvent lowers the chemical potential of the solvent cause it to favor the liquid phase over the vapor phase as sch the temperature must be increased to increase the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid solution until it is equal to that of the vaporphase solvent the
