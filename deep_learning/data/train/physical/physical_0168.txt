phase above the solution the chemical potentials of the two phases must be equal if the solute is not volatile the vapor will be pure so assuming ideal behavior where is the vapor pressure of the solvent over the solution similarly for the pure solvent in equilibrium with its vapor where is the standard pressure of atm and is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent substituting equation refeq into equation refeq yields the terms for cancel leaving subtracting from both side produces which rearranges to dividing both sides by and then exponentiating yields or this last result is raoults
