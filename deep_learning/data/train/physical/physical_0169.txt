pure b is torr at the same temperature what is the total vapor pressure above a mixture of these compounds with the mole fraction of b of what is the mole fraction of b in the vapor that is in equilibrium with the liquid mixture solution using raoults law equation refrl to get the mole fractions in the gas phase one can use daltons law of partial pressures and of course it is also useful to note that the sum of the mole fractions is as it must be osmotic pressure osmosis is a process by which solvent can pass
