since xa the chemical potential is of the solvent in a solution is always lower than that of the pure solvent so to prevent osmosis from occurring something needs to be done to raise the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution this can be accomplished by applying pressure to the solution specifically the process of osmosis will stop when the chemical potential solvent in the solution is increased to the point of being equal to that of the pure solvent the criterion therefore for osmosis to cease is to solve the problem to determine the magnitude of p
