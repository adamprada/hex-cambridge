excess pressure is given by the integrals on the right can be evaluated by recognizing where is the molar volume of the substance combining these expressions results in if the molar volume of the solvent is independent of pressure has a very small value of which is the case for most liquids the term on the right becomes also for values of very close to so for dilute solutions or after rearrangement pi dfracchib rtv again where is the molar volume of the solvent and finally since is the concentration of the solute for cases where this allows one to
