the center of mass of this twoparticle system be specified by the vector from particle to particle is the vector difference when the particles are moving these vectors and their components are functions of time using the notation we can specify the velocity of particle for example as our goal is to find the relative velocity vector we call the components of the relative velocity coordinates figure the center of mass frame the essential idea underlying relative velocity coordinates is that the vectors and contain the same information as the vectors and this is equivalent to saying that we can
