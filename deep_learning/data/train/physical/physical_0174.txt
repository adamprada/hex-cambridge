transformation is readily found to be now we can create two new cartesian coordinate frames which of these is more useful depends on the objective of the particular analysis we have at hand we call the first one the center of mass frame it is sketched in figure the and axes of are parallel to the corresponding axes of but their origin is always at the point occupied by the center of mass of the twoparticle system in this reference frame the coordinates of particles and are their displacements from the center of mass the center of mass frame is
