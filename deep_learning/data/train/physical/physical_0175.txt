frame particle is stationary at the origin with its tail at the origin the vector specifies the position of particle we are interested in the relative velocity of particles and the velocity components for particles and and for their relative velocity are obtained by finding the timederivatives of the corresponding displacement components since the transformations of the displacement coordinates are linear the velocity components transform from one reference frame to another in exactly the same way that the displacement components do we have and the vector specifies the velocity of particle relative to a stationary particle just as and contain
