being stationary they are independent of whether the particles are approaching or receding from one another collisions between like gas molecules last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers when we consider collisions between different gas molecules of the same substance we can denote the relative velocity and the expected value of the relative velocity as and respectively by the argument we make above we can find the number of collisions between any one of these molecules and all of the others letting this collision frequency be
