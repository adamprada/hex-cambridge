collisions with other molecules last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry at california state university east bay contributors and attributions a major concern in the design of many experiments is collisions of gas molecules with other molecules in the gas phase for example molecular beam experiments are often dependent on a lack of molecular collisions in the beam that could degrade the nature of the molecules in the beam through chemical reactions or simply being knocked out of the beam in order to predict the frequency of molecular collisions it is useful
