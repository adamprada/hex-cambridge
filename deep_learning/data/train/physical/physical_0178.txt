we must use the relative speed of the moving molecule which will be given by the volume of the collision cylinder is given by the collisional cross section which determined by the size of the molecule is given by some values of are given in the table below table collisional crosssection of select species molecule nm he ne n co ch since the number of molecules within the collision cylinder is given by and since the number density is given by the number of collisions is given by the frequency of collisions number of collisions per unit time is then
