for can be used to simplify the differentials for and but even more useful are the constraints it places on the variables t s p and v due to the mathematics of exact differentials maxwell relations the above result suggests that the natural variables of internal energy are and or the function can be considered as so the total differential can be expressed also by inspection comparing the two expressions for it is apparent that and but the value doesnt stop there since is an exact differential the euler relation must hold that by substituting equations refeqa and refeqb we
