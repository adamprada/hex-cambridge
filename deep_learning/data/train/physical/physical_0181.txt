natural variables of are and or comparing equations refeqa and refeqb show that and it is worth noting at this point that both equation refeqa and equation refeqa are equation to so they are equation to each other morevoer the euler relation must also hold so this is the maxwell relation on maxwell relations can also be developed based on and the results of those derivations are summarized in table table maxwell relations function differential natural variables maxwell relation the maxwell relations are extraordinarily useful in deriving the dependence of thermodynamic variables on the state variables of p t and
