oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers in section we derive the probability density function for one cartesian component of the velocity of a gas molecule the probability density functions for the other two cartesian components are the same function for we have and we now want to derive the threedimensional probability density function from these relationships given these probability density functions for the cartesian components of we can find the probability density function in spherical coordinates since the differential volume element in spherical coordinates is the probability that a molecule has a a velocity vector whose magnitude lies between
