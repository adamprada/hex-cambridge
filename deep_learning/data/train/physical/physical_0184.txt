g piece of metal c jg c initially at c is placed in g of water initially at c in an insulated container calculate the final temperature of the metal and water once the system has reached thermal equilibrium also calculate the entropy change for the metal the water and the entire system solution heat will be transferred from the hot metal to the cold water since it has nowhere else to go the final temperature can be calculated from the expression where is the heat absorbed by the water and is the heat lost by the metal and since
