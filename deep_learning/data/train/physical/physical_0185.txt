of the entropy change is positive for the part of the system that is absorbing the heat and negative for the part losing the heat in summary can be calculated for a number of pathways fairly conveniently table summary of different ways to calculate depending on the pathway pathway adiabatic isothermal isobaric isochoric phase change for an ideal gas and this calculation is important as provides the criterion for spontaneity for which we were searching from the outset this also suggests a new way to state the second law the entropy of the universe increases in any spontaneous change if
