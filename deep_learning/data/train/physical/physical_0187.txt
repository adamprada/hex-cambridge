only slight and of course different substances are more compressible than others to quantify just how compressible substances are it is necessary to define the property the isothermal compressibility is defined by the fractional differential change in volume due to a change in pressure the negative sign is important in order to keep the value of positive since an increase in pressure will lead to a decrease in volume the term is needed to make the property intensive so that it can be tabulated in a useful manner isobaric thermal expansivity another very important property of a substance is how
