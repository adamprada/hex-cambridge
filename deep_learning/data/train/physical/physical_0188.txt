of expansion volume tends to increase with increasing temperature so the partial derivative is positive deriving an expression for a partial derivative type i the reciprocal rule consider a system that is described by three variables and for which one can write a mathematical constraint on the variables under these circumstances one can specify the state of the system varying only two parameters independently because the third parameter will have a fixed value as such one could define two functions and this allows one to write the total differentials for and as follows and substituting the equation refeq expression into
