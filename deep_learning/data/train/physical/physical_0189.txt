partial derivatives encountered in thermodynamics because the variables are state variables and the differentials are exact deriving an expression for a partial derivative type ii the cyclic permutation rule this alternative derivation follow the initial steps in the derivation above to equation refeq if the system undergoes a change following a pathway where is held constant this expression simplifies to and so for and changes in which this cyclic permutation rule is very convenient in the manipulation of partial derivatives but it can also be derived in a straightforward albeit less rigorous manner as with the derivation above we wegin
