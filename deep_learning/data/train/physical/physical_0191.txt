increases from to if we let the envelope function be we have or that is the envelope function is the derivative of the area with respect to the random variable the area is so the envelope function is calling the envelope curve the probability density function emphasizes that it is analogous to a function that expresses the density of matter that is for an incremental change in the incremental change in probability is analogous to the incremental change in mass accompanying an incremental change in volume where in this analogy we suppose that mass is distributed in space with a
