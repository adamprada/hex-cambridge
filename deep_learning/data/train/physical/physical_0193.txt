temperature reaches that at point b some solid compound b will begin to form this will lead to a slowing of the cooling due to the exothermic nature of solid formation but also the composition of the liquid will change becoming richer in compound a as b is removed from the liquid phase in the form of a solid this will continue until the liquid attains the composition at the eutectic point point c in the diagram when the temperature reaches that at point c both compounds a and b will solidify and the composition of the liquid phase will
