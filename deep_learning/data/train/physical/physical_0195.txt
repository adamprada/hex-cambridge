number of components in the mixture similarly all but one of the chemical potentials of each phase present must be equal leaving only one that can be varied independently leading to thermodynamic constraints placed on each component finally there are two state variables that can be varied such as pressure and temperature adding two additional degrees of freedom to the system the net number of degrees of freedom is determined by adding all of the degrees of freedom and subtracting the number of thermodynamic constraints beginalign f pc cp nonumber pt pc p pc c nonumber pt cp labelphase endalign
