uses the triple points of hydrogen neon oxygen argon mercury and water to define several low temperatures the calibration of a platinum resistance thermometer at the triple point of argon for example is described by strouse strouse the advantage to using a triple point is that the compound sets both the temperature and pressure rather than forcing the researcher to set a pressure and then measure the temperature of a phase change introducing an extra parameter than can introduce uncertainty into the measurement contributors and attributions patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay deficiencies
