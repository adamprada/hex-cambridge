the electrons mutual coulomb repulsion causes them to avoid one another this mutual avoidance is what we call electron correlation because the electrons motions as reflected in their spatial probability densities are correlated ie interrelated let us consider a simple example to illustrate this problem with single determinant functions the determinant when written as can be multiplied by itself to produce the electron spin and spatial probability density if we now integrate over the spins of the two electrons and make use of and we obtain the following spatial ie with spin absent probability density this probability being a product
