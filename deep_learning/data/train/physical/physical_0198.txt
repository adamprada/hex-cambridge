one can account for electron avoidance by taking to be a combination of two or more determinants that differ by the promotion of two electrons from one orbital to another orbital for example in describing the bonding electron pair of an olefin or the electron pair in alkaline earth atoms one mixes in doubly excited determinants of the form or respectively briefly the physical importance of such doublyexcited determinants can be made clear by using the following identity involving determinants where this identity is important to understand so please make sure you can work through the algebra needed to prove
