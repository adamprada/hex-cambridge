needed to express the proper spin eigenfunction for a given orbital occupation in the olefin example mentioned above the two nonorthogonal polarized orbital pairs involve mixing the p and p orbitals to produce two leftright polarized orbitals as depicted in figure figure left and right polarized orbitals of an olefin in this case one says that the electron pair undergoes leftright correlation when the determinant is mixed into the ci wavefunction in the alkaline earth atom case the polarized orbital pairs are formed by mixing the and orbitals actually one must mix in equal amounts of and orbitals to preserve
