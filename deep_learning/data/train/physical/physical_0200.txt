and spins and are thus not being treated in a correlated manner while the other pair resides in polarized orbitals in a manner that instantaneously correlates their motions these polarized orbital pairs are formed by combining the orbital with the orbital in a ratio determined by this ratio can be shown using perturbation theory to be proportional to the magnitude of the coupling matrix element between the two configurations involved and inversely proportional to the energy difference between these configurations in general configurations that have similar hamiltonian expectation values and that are coupled strongly give rise to strongly mixed ie
