electron occupies the orbital the electrons thus reduce their coulomb repulsion by occupying different regions of space in the scf picture both electrons reside in the same region of space in this particular example the electrons undergo angular correlation to avoid one another the use of doubly excited determinants is thus seen as a mechanism by which can place electron pairs which in the singleconfiguration picture occupy the same orbital into different regions of space ie each one into a different member of the polarized orbital pair thereby lowering their mutual coulomb repulsion such electron correlation effects are extremely important
