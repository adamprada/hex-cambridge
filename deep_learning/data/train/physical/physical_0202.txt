and spatial symmetry adapted electron determinants ie csfs can be formed by placing two electrons into the and orbitals for example to describe the singlet determinant corresponding to the closedshell orbital occupancy a single slater determinant suffices an analogous expression for the determinant is given by also the component of the triplet state having orbital occupancy can be written as a single slater determinant as can the component of the triplet state however to describe the singlet and triplet states belonging to the occupancy two determinants are needed is the singlet and is the triplet note you can obtain this
