still combine to form a bonding and an antibonding orbital the energies of these orbitals for r values ranging from near to are depicted in figure for the case in which x is more electronegative than y figure orbital correlation diagram for type orbitals in the heteronuclear case the energy variation in these orbital energies gives rise to variations in the energies of the six determinants listed above as the determinants energies are difficult to intuit because the and orbitals become degenerate in the homonuclear case or nearly so in the case to pursue this point and arrive at an
