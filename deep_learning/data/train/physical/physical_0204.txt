into the slater determinants that define the singlet and triplet functions can be illustrated as follows for the case the first two of these atomicorbitalbased slater determinants and are called ionic because they describe atomic orbital occupancies which are appropriate to the region that correspond to and valence bond structures while and are called covalent because they correspond to structures in similar fashion the remaining five determinant functions may be expressed in terms of fragmentorbitalbased slater determinants in so doing use is made of the antisymmetry of the slater determinants eg which implies that any determinant in which two or
