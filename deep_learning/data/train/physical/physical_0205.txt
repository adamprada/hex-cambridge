varies are depicted in figure for situations in which the homolytic bond cleavage is energetically favored ie for which figure configuration correlation diagram showing how the determinants energies vary with it is essential to realize that the energies of the determinants do not represent the energies of the true electronic states for values at which the determinant energies are separated widely the true state energies are rather well approximated by individual determinant energies such is the case near re for the state however at large the situation is very different and it is in such cases that what we term
