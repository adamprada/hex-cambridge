offdiagonal coupling matrix elements can be expressed in terms of an exchange integral between the and orbitals later in this chapter you will learn how to evaluate hamiltonian matrix elements between pairs of antisymmetric wavefunctions and to express them in terms of one and twoelectron integrals if you are anxious to learn this now go to the subsection entitled the slatercondon rules and read that before returning here at where the and determinants are degenerate the two solutions to the above ci matrix eigenvalue problem are with respective amplitudes for the and csfs given by the first solution thus has
