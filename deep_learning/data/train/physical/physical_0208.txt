expectation that the system pressure and the applied pressure will equilibrate rapidly in most circumstances for an ideal gas the molar energy depends only on temperature since for an ideal gas depends only on temperature hence the molar enthalpy of an ideal gas also depends only on temperature for an ideal gas we have the parallel relationships and earlier we asserted that while energy is a state function heat and work are not hesss law as originally formulated in says that the heat changes for a series of chemical reactions can be summed to get the heat change for the
