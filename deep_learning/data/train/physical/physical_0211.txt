equilibrium the mole fractions of and can then be expressed by based on these mole fractions and so which can be expressed as is given by example based on the values given below find the equilibrium constant at oc and degree of dissociation for a system that is at a total pressure of atm for the reaction kjmol solution first the value of can be determined from via an application of hess law beginalign delta grxno left kjmol right kjmol kjmol endalign so using the relationship between thermodynamics and equilibria the degree of dissociation can then be calculated from the
