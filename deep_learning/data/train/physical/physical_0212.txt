find values for and solution lets build an ice table a b c initial mol mol change x x x equilibrium mol x mol x x mol from the equilibrium measurement of the number of moles of c x mol so at equilibrium a b c equilibrium mol mol mol the total number of moles at equilibrium is mol from these data the mole fractions can be determined beginalign chia dfracmolmol pt chib dfracmolmol pt chic dfracmolmol endalign so is given by and is given by equation refoddeq so the thermodynamic equilibrium constant is unitless of course since the pressures
