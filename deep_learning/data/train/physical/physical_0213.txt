discussion of bands of orbitals and orbital energies in solids i want to address a bit more the issue of the density of electronic states and what determines the energy range into which orbitals of a given band will split first lets recall the energy expression for the and dimensional electron in a box case and lets generalize it to three dimensions the general result is e sumj dfracnj pihbarmljtag where the sum over runs over the number of dimensions or and is the length of the box along the jth direction for one dimension one observes a pattern of
