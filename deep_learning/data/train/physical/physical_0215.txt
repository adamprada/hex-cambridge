also occur and cause the density of states to possess an dependence that differs from the or dimensional case in this situation we think of states having energy but with the total number of states having energy between zero and is so the density of states between and is that is in this dimensional case the number of states per unit energy is constant for high values where the analysis above applies best this kind of analysis for the dimensional case gives nrm total r sqrtfracmelhbarpi tag so the state density between and is which clearly shows the widening spacing
