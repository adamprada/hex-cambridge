and this fact is what i want the students reading this text to keep in mind before closing this section it is useful to overview how the various particleinbox models can be used as qualitative descriptions for various chemical systems a the onedimensional box model is most commonly used to model electronic orbitals in delocalized linear polyenes b the electrononacircle model is used to describe orbitals in a conjugated cyclic ring such as in benzene a the rectangular box model can be used to model electrons moving within thin layers of metal deposited on a substrate or to model electrons
