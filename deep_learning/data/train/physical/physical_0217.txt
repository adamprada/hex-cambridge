quasispherical nanoclusters composed of metallic atoms b the particleinacube model is often used to describe the bands of electronic orbitals that arise in threedimensional crystals constructed from metallic atoms in all of these models the potential which is constant in the region where the electron is confined controls the energies of all the quantum states relative to that of a free electron ie an electron in vacuum with no kinetic energy for some dimensionalities and geometries it may be necessary to invoke more than one of these models to qualitatively describe the quantum states of systems for which the valence
