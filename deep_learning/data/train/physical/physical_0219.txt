the wall to find the pressure from this model it is necessary to average over all possible molecular speeds and all possible collision angles in chapter we derive boyles law in this way we can do a simplified derivation by making a number of assumptions we assume that all of the molecules in a sample of gas have the same speed let us call it as sketched in figure we assume that the container is a cubic box whose edge length is if we consider all of the collisions between molecules and walls it is clear that each wall will
