artificial model that we achieve by averaging over the real distribution of angles and speeds in fact this turns out to be the case the derivation below gets the same result as the rigorous treatment we develop in chapter figure simplified model for velocities of gas molecules in a cubic box since each molecule goes back and forth between opposite walls it collides with each wall once during each round trip at each collision the molecules speed remains constant but its direction changes by that is the molecules velocity changes from to letting be the time required for a round
