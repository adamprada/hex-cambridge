written as we see that so that and thus we have found a relationship between the molecular speed and the temperature of the gas the actual speed of a molecule can have any value between zero andfor present purposesinfinity when we average the values of for many molecules we find the average value of the squared speeds in chapter we find that that is the average speed we use in our derivation turns out to be a quantity called the rootmeansquare speed this result also gives us the average kinetic energy of a single gas molecule from this derivation we
