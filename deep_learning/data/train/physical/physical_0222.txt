nor repel one another no work is required to change the distance between them the work associated with changing the volume of a confined sample of an ideal gas arises because of the pressure the molecules exert on the walls of the container the pressure arises because of the molecules kinetic energy the energy of one mole of monatomic ideal gas molecules is when we expand our concept of ideal gases to include molecules that have rotational or vibrational energy but which neither attract nor repel one another it remains true that the energy of a macroscopic sample depends only
