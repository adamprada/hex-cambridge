specify its state the laws of thermodynamics imply that the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature while the energy of an ideal gas is independent of pressure the energy of a real gas is a function of pressure at a given temperature at ordinary pressures and temperatures this dependence is weak and can often be neglected the first experimental investigation of this issue was made by james prescott joule for whom the si unit of energy is named beginning in joule did a long series of careful measurements of the mechanical equivalent of heat these measurements formed
