effects of intermolecular forces of attraction and repulsion on the energy of a gas during its expansion since our definition of an ideal gas includes the stipulation that there are no intermolecular forces the joulethomson experiment is consistent with the conclusion that the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature however since intermolecular forces are not zero for any real gas our analysis reaches this conclusion in a somewhat indirect way the complication arises because the joulethomson results are not entirely consistent with the idea that all properties of a real gas approach those of an ideal gas
