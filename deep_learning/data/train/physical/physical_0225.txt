this can be true only if each side is in fact constant if we let this constant be we have and since the values of and are independent of the gas being studied the value of is also the same for any gas is called the gas constant the ideal gas constant or the universal gas constant substituting the appropriate relationship into either boyles law or charles law gives the ideal gas equation the product of pressure and volume has the units of work or energy so the gas constant has units of energy per mole per degree remember that
