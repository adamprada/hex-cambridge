is a simple test for exactness test for exactness the differential in the form of equation refeq is exact if and only if that is this condition is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a function for which and in we demonstrate that the condition is necessary now we want to show that it is sufficient that is we want to demonstrate if equation refeq hold then there exists a such that and to do this we show how to find a function that satisfies the given differential relationship if we integrate with respect to we have where is
