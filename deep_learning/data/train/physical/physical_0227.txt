so that is simply an arbitrary constant distribution equilibria last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers a system can contain more than one phase and more than one chemical substance can be present in each phase if one of the substances is present in two phases we say that the substance is distributed between the two phases we can describe the equilibrium distribution quantitatively by specifying the concentration of the substance in each phase at constant temperature we find experimentally that the ratio of these concentrations
