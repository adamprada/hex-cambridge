the three substances are mixed we begin our development of physical chemistry by reasoning about the effects of concentrations on the properties of chemical systems in chapter we find that rate laws expressed using concentration variables are adequate for the analysis of reaction mechanisms consideration of these rate laws leads us to the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction expressed as a function of concentrations eventually however we discover that an adequately accurate theory of chemical equilibrium must be expressed using new quantities which we call chemical activities we can think of a chemical activity as an effective concentration or
