to conclude that this speed depends only on temperature we now recognize that the individual molecules in a gas sample have a wide range of speeds the velocities of gas molecules must be described by a distribution function it is true however that the average speed depends only on temperature james clerk maxwell was the first to derive the distribution function for gas velocities he did it about we follow maxwells argument for a molecule moving in three dimensions there are three velocity components maxwells argument uses only one assumption the speed of a gas molecule is independent of the
