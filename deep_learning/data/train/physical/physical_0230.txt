how this can be done let us consider how we might find probability distribution functions for velocity components we need to consider both spherical and cartesian coordinate systems let us suppose that we are able to measure the cartesiancoordinate components and of the velocities of a large number of randomly selected gas molecules in a particular constanttemperature sample then we can transform each set of cartesian components to sphericalcoordinate velocity covelocity componentsmponents and we imagine accumulating the results of these measurements in a table like table as a practical matter of course we cannot make the measurements to complete such
