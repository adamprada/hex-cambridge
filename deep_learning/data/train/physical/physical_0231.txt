random variable in chapter we find that we can use such data to find mathematical models for such distributions here we can find mathematical models for the cumulative distribution functions and we can approximate the graph of by plotting the rank probability of versus we expect this plot to be sigmoid at any the slope of this plot is the probabilitydensity function the probability density function for depends only on because the value measured for is independent of the values measured for and however by maxwells assumption the functions describing the distribution of and are the same as those describing
