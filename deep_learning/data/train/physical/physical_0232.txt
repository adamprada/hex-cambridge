them to have to clarify this let us consider another cumulative probability distribution function which is just the fraction of all molecules whose respective cartesian velocity components are less than since and are the fractions whose components are less than and respectively their product is equal to we have for the velocity of a randomly selected molecule to be included in the fraction represented by the velocity must be in the particular range and however for a velocity to be included in we must have and that is the components and can have any values since the probability that and
