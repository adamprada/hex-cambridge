in which components lie between and components lie between and and components lie between and denotes the probability that the velocity of a randomly chosen molecule satisfies the conditions and is an increment of probability the dependence of on and can be made explicit by introducing a new function defined by since is the volume available in velocity space for velocities whose components are between and whose components are between and and whose components are between and we see that is a probability density function in three dimensions the value of is the probability per unit volume in velocity space
