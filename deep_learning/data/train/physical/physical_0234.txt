when we interpret maxwells assumption to mean that these are independent probabilities the probability that all three conditions are realized simultaneously is evidently the product of these three onedimensional probability densities is the threedimensional probability density we have from maxwells assumption we have derived the conclusion that can be expressed as a product of the onedimensional probability densities and since these are probability densities we have and moreover because the cartesian coordinates differ from one another only in orientation and must all be the same function figure transformation from cartesian to spherical coordinates to summarize the development above we define
