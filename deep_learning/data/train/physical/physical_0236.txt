amount of a single phase of a pure substance we know from experience that any cyclic change in pressure or temperature restores the initial volume that is for a pure phase there is an equation of state that we can rearrange as meaning that specifying and is sufficient to specify uniquely for other reversible systems the function may not exist for example consider a system that consists of a known amount of water at liquidvapor equilibrium and whose pressure and temperature are known for this system the volume can have any value between that of the pure liquid and that
