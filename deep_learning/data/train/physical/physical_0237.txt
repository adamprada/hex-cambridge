as a surface in a three dimensional space the two independent variables define a plane projecting the systems location in this independentvariable plane onto the surface establishes the value of the dependent variable the two independentvariable values determine the point on the surface that specifies the state of the system in the liquidvapor equilibrium system the pressure is a surface above the volumetemperature plane a complete description of the state of the system must also include the number of moles of liquid and the number of mole of vapor present each of these quantities can also be described as a
