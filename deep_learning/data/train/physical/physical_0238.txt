pair of variables say and is sufficient to determine the change in the remaining variables so that the systems thermodynamic variables in the final state are where etc the theorem does not specify which pair of variables is sufficient in fact from the discussion above of the variables that can be used to specify the state of a system containing only water it is evident that a particular pair may not remain sufficient if there is a change in the number of phases present in chapter we see that duhems theorem follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics
