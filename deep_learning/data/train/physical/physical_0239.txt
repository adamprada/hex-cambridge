system remains at equilibrium this is similar to the question we answered when we developed gibbs phase rule however there are important differences the phase rule is independent of the size of the system it specifies the number of intensive variables required to prescribe an equilibrium state in which specified phases are present the size of the system is not fixed we can add or remove matter to change the size of any phase without changing the number of degrees of freedom in the present problem the system cannot exchange matter with its surroundings moreover the number of phases present
