a given chemical species cannot we can find the number of independent variables for this system by an argument similar to the one we used to find the phase rule to completely specify this system we must specify the pressure temperature and volume of each phase we must also specify the number of moles of each of chemical species in each phase this means that variables must be specified every relationship that exists among these variables decreases by one the number that are independent the following relationships exist the pressure is the same in each phase there are pressure constraints
