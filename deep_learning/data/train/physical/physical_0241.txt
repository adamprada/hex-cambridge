must be specified in each phase this condition creates constraints we can also reach this conclusion by a slightly different argument to specify the concentrations of species in some one phase requires constraints a distribution equilibrium relates the concentrations of each species in every pair of phases there are independent pairs of phases for chemical species there are such constraints this is equivalent to the requirement in our phase rule analysis that there are equilibrium relationships among components in p phases in the present problem the total number of concentration constraints is p subtracting the number of constraints from the
