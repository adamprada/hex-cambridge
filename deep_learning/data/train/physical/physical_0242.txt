reversible change we are describing a system that is continuously at equilibrium as it goes from a first equilibrium state to a second one because it is closed and continuously in an equilibrium state the range of variation available to the system is circumscribed in such a way that specifying two variables is sufficient to specify its state on the other hand when we say that degrees of freedom are required to specify an equilibrium state of a system containing specified phases we mean that we must know the values of intensive variables in order to establish that the state
