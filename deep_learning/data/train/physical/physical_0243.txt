system is closed we mean that the total number of moles of the elements nitrogen and hydrogen are known and constant let these be and respectively letting the moles of ammonia present be the number of moles of dihydrogen and dinitrogen are and respectively if we know that this system is at equilibrium we know that the equilibrium constant relationship is satisfied we have where is the volume of the system the idealgas equilibrium constant is a function only of temperature we assume that we know this function therefore if we know the temperature we know the value of the
