its other properties if we do not know that this system is at equilibrium but instead want to collect sufficient experimental data to prove that it is the phase rule asserts that we must find the values of some set of three intensive variables two are not sufficient from the perspective provided by the equations developed above we can no longer use the equilibrium constant relationship to find and instead our problem is to find the composition of the system by other means so that we can test for equilibrium by comparing the value of the quantity to the value
