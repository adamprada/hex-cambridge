to this could represent the repulsive interactions between the electrons and a layer of molecules of thickness d lying on the surface of the solid at constant and equal to from to infinity this could represent the electron being removed from the solid but with a work function energy cost of and moving freely in the vacuum above the surface and the adlayer such a potential is shown in figure figure onedimensional potential showing a well a barrier and the asymptotic region the piecewise nature of this potential allows the onedimensional schr√∂dinger equation to be solved analytically for energies lying
