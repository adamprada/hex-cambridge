that vanish at because the function must vanish within the region where is infinite and because it must be continuous it must vanish at is psi asinkr hspacecm textfor le r le rrm max between and there are two solutions that obey the schr√∂diger equation so the most general solution is a combination of these two psi b expkappar b expkappar hspacecm textfor rrm max le r le rrm max delta finally in the region beyond we can use a combination of either and or and to express the solution unlike the region near where it was most convenient to
