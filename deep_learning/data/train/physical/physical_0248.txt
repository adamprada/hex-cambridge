terms of the specified amplitude of the incoming flux eg pretend that we know the flux of electrons that our experimental apparatus shoots at the surface four equations that can be used to achieve this goal result when and are matched at and at one of the essential properties of solutions to the schr√∂dinger equation is that they and their first derivative are continuous these properties relate to y being a probability and the momentum being continuous these four equations are c expikrrm max delta d expikrrm max delta ikc expikrrm max delta ik d expikrrm max delta it is
