barrier in such a case the factor will be very small compared to its counterpart and so the factor in causes the magnitude of the wave function inside the barrier to be small in most circumstances we say that incident flux must tunnel through the barrier to reach the inner region and that governs the probability of this tunneling keep in mind that in the energy range we are considering a classical particle could not even enter the region this is why we call this the classically forbidden or tunneling region a classical particle starting in the large region can
