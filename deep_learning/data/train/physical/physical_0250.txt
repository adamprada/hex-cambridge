and games which depend on currents induced by tunneling through various junctions would not be available but or course tunneling does occur and it can have remarkable effects let us examine an especially important in chemistry phenomenon that takes place because of tunneling and that occurs when the energy e assumes very special values the magnitude of the factor in the above solutions of the schr√∂dinger equation can become large if the energy e is such that the denominator in the above expression for approaches zero this happens when or if it can be shown that the above condition is
