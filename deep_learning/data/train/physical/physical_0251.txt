very high barrier so that is much larger than in this case the denominator that appears in can become small at energies satisfying this condition is nothing but the energy quantization condition that occurs for the particleinabox potential shown in figure figure onedimensional potential similar to the tunneling potential but without the barrier and asymptotic region this potential is identical to the potential that we were examining for but extends to infinity beyond the barrier and the dissociation asymptote displayed by our potential are absent lets consider what this tunneling problemhbaras taught us first it showed us that quantum particles
