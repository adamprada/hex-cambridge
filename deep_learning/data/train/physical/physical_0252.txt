the case just mentioned it would make sense to solve the four equations for the amplitude c of the outgoing wave in the region in terms of the a amplitude if we were to solve for and then examine under what conditions the amplitude of this ratio would become small so the electron cannot escape we would find the same resonance condition as we found from the other point of view this means that the resonance energies tell us for what collision energies the electron will tunnel inward and produce a trapped electron and at these same energies an electron
