chemical significance of resonances is great highly rotationally excited molecules may have more than enough total energy to dissociate but this energy may be stored in the rotational motion and the vibrational energy may be less than in terms of the above model high rotational angular momentum may produce a significant centrifugal barrier in the effective potential that characterizes the molecules vibration but the systems vibrational energy may lie significantly below in such a case and when viewed in terms of motion on an angularmomentummodified effective potential such as i show in figure the lifetime of the molecule with respect
