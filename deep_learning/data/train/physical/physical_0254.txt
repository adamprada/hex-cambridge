max minimum we note that the probability of tunneling falls of exponentially with a factor depending on the width d of the barrier through which the particle must tunnel multiplied by which depends on the height of the barrier above the energy available this exponential dependence on thickness and height of the barriers is something you should keep in mind because it appears in all tunneling rate expressions another important case in which tunneling occurs is in electronically metastable states of anions in socalled shape resonance states the anions extra electron experiences an attractive potential due to its interaction with
