occupying the orbital which has a dominant component although the examples treated above analytically involved piecewise constant potentials so the schr√∂dinger equation and the boundary matching conditions could be solved exactly many of the characteristics observed carry over to more chemically realistic situations in fact one can often model chemical reaction processes in terms of motion along a reaction coordinate s from a region characteristic of reactant materials where the potential surface is positively curved in all direction and all forces ie gradients of the potential along all internal coordinates vanish to a transition state at which the potential surfaces
