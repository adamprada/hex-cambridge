the bond breaking and forming in this region of the energy surface tunneling must usually be considered in treating the dynamics within the above reaction path point of view motion transverse to the reaction coordinate is often modeled in terms of local harmonic motion although more sophisticated treatments of the dynamics is possible this picture leads one to consider motion along a single degree of freedom with respect to which much of the above treatment can be carried over coupled to transverse motion along all other internal degrees of freedom taking place under an entirely positively curved potential which therefore
