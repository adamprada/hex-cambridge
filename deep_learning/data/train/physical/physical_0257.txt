we define as when the only form of work possible is pressurevolume work and a system change occurs at constant pressure the enthalpy change is synonymous with the heat added to the system only pv work since we define it follows that recalling our earlier discovery that we have the important parallel relationships and we can find the enthalpy change for heating a substance at constant pressure by integrating its constantpressure heat capacity over the change in temperature that is implies that similarly we have for a process in which a substance is heated at constant volume one reason that
