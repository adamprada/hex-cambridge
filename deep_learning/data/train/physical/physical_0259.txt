however consider what happens when the sum of is considered this is the behavior expected for a state function it leads to the definition of entropy in differential form in general will be larger than since the reversible pathway defines the maximum heat flow so it is easy to calculate entropy changes as one needs only to define a reversible pathway that connects the initial and final states and then integrate over that pathway and since is defined using for a reversible pathway is independent of the actual path a system follows to undergo a change contributors and attributions patrick
