oconnor robertson understood this concept well and used it to derive a statistical approach to calculating entropy boltzmann proposed a method for calculating the entropy of a system based on the number of energetically equivalent ways a system can be constructed boltzmann proposed an expression which in its modern form is this rather famous equation is etched on boltzmanns grave marker in commemoration of his profound contributions to the science of thermodynamics figure figure ludwig boltzmann example calculate the entropy of a carbon monoxide crystal containing mol of and assuming that the molecules are randomly oriented in one of two
