the process can occur spontaneously the reverse of a spontaneous process cannot occur it is an impossible process and the change in the entropy of the universe for such a process must be less than zero since an equilibrium process is a reversible process the entropy of the universe must remain unchanged when a system goes from an initial state to a final state along a path whose every point is an equilibrium state using another figure of speech we often say that a change that occurs along a reversible path is a change that occurs at equilibrium these conclusions
