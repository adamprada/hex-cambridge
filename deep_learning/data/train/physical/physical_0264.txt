to see these points from a slightly different perspective let us consider a closed reversible system in which only pressurevolume work is possible duhems theorem asserts that a change in the state of this system can be specified by specifying the changes in some pair of state functions say and if the imposed values of and are constant at their eventual equilibrium values but the system is changing the system cannot be on a gibbsian equilibrium manifold we say that the system is undergoing a spontaneous change at constant and this description is a figure of speech in that the
