determined by these values the same equilibrium state is reached for any choice of surroundings that imposes the same values of and on the system at the time that the system reaches equilibrium for every additional form of nonpressurevolume work that affects the system we must specify the value of one additional variable in order to specify a unique equilibrium state the entropy changes that occur in the system and its surroundings during a spontaneous process have predictive value however our definitions do not enable us to find the entropy change for a spontaneous process and the temperature of the
