that describes this path as we can divide this path into short intervals let denote a short segment of this path along which the temperature of the surroundings is approximately constant for our present purposes the temperature of the system is irrelevant since the process is spontaneous the temperature of the system may have no meaningful value within the interval as the system traverses segment it accepts a quantity of heat from the surroundings which are at temperature the heat exchanged by the surroundings within is below we show that it is always possible to carry out the process in
