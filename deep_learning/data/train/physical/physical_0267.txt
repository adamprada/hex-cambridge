we suppose that the carnot engine delivers a very small heat increment to the high temperature reservoir in every cycle while the system is within we maintain the carnot engines high temperature reservoir at and allow heat to pass from the high temperature reservoir to the system the high temperature reservoir is the only part of the surroundings that is in thermal contact with the system is the only heat exchanged by the system while it is within figure using a reversible carnot engine to exchange heat with a spontaneously changing system to maintain the high temperature reservoir at we
