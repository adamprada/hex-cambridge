to the carnot engine within be let the heat delivered to the lowtemperature reservoir within be we have since the carnot engine is reversible we have and so that while the system is within it receives an increment of heat from the high temperature reservoir simultaneously three components in the surroundings also exchange heat let the entropy changes in the hightemperature reservoir the carnot engine and the lowtemperature reservoir be and respectively the high temperature reservoir receives heat from the carnot engine and delivers the same quantity of heat to the system the net heat accepted by the high temperature
