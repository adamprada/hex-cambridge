temperature of the surroundings is constant between any two points a and b on curve c we can integrate over this interval to obtain and for an adiabatic process for any arbitrarily small increment of an adiabatic process it follows that and for any spontaneous adiabatic process entropy changes for a reversible process last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers let us consider a closed system that undergoes a reversible change while in contact with its surroundings since the change is reversible the portion of the
