of the process to find the entropy change for the system we can calculate the entropy change for a process from the defining equation only if the process is reversible however entropy is a state function using the figure of speech that we introduce in section we can find the entropy change for the spontaneous process by evaluating along a second and reversible path that connects the same initial and final states figure a cycle that includes a spontaneous process in an isolated system in figure these paths are diagrammed in temperatureentropy space the transition from state a to state
