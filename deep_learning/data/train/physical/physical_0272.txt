state at point a for the transfer of heat to be reversible we must have for this step hence the final and original temperature of the system at point a is equal to the temperature of the surroundings the reversible path must exist because the tiling theorem asserts that adiabats vertical lines and isotherms horizontal lines tile the plane arbitrarily densely taken literally this description of state a is inconsistent we suppose that the initial state a is capable of spontaneous change therefore it cannot be an equilibrium state we suppose that the final state a is reached by a
