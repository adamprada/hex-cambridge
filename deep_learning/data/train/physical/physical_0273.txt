a real system that undergoes spontaneous change we must find approximate values for the real systems state functions by finding an equilibriumor quasiequilibriumsystem that adequately models the initial state of the spontaneously changing system in the development below we place no constraints on the nature of the system or the spontaneous process we assume that the state functions of any hypothetical initial state a can be adequately approximated by some equilibriumstate model however before we consider the general argument let us show how these conditions can be met for another specific system consider a vessel whose interior is divided by
