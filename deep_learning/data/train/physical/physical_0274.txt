instant the partition is punctured the system becomes able to undergo spontaneous change in this hypothetical initial state before any significant quantity of gas passes through the opening neither the actual condition of the gas nor the values of its state functions have changed after the expansion to the new equilibrium state the original state can be restored by reversible processes of adiabatic compression and isothermal volume adjustment problems and in chapter deal with the energy and entropy changes for ideal and real gases around a cycle in which spontaneous expansion in an isolated system is followed by reversible restoration
