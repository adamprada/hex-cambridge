equation and the energy and entropy changes around this cycle must be zero whether the individual steps occur reversibly or irreversibly we have and we want to analyze this cycle using the machinebased statement of the second law we have and let us assume that the system does net work on the surroundings as this cycle is traversed so that then and it follows that the system exchanges heat with the surroundings in only one step of this process in this step the system extracts a quantity of heat from a reservoir in the surroundings the temperature of this reservoir
