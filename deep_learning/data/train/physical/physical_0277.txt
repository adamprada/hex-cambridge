sufficient to specify the state of such a system it follows that states a and b must in fact be the same state in and in greater detail in chapter we see that the first law and our entropybased statement of the second law do indeed imply that specifying the energy and entropy specifies the state of a closed reversible system in which only pressurevolume work is possible if state a and state b are the same state that is if the state functions of state a are the same as those of state b it is meaningless to say
