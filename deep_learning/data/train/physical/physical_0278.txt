process in which an isolated system goes from state a to state b the process must be spontaneous since any process that occurs in an isolated system must be a spontaneous process it is only necessary to show that implies that state b is different from state a this is trivial because entropy is a state function requires that state b be different from state a none of our arguments depends on the magnitude of the change that occurs evidently the same inequality must describe every incremental portion of any spontaneous process otherwise we could define an incremental spontaneous change
