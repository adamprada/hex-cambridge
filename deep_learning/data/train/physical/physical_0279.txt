volume must be constant hence isolation implies constant and if only pressurevolume work is possible the converse must be true that is if only pressurevolume work is possible constant energy and volume imply that there are no interactions between the system and its surroundings therefore constant and imply that the system is isolated and it must be true that in this case a spontaneous process in which and are constant must be accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the system if is constant and only pressurevolume work is possible the process involves no work we have a criterion
