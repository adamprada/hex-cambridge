for a system at equilibrium the forces are fixed for a system undergoing reversible change some of the forces originate in the surroundings and those that do are potentially variable to raise a bowling ball reversibly we apply an upward force exactly equal and opposite to the downward force due to gravity at any point in this reversible motion the ball is stationary which is the reason we say that a reversible process is a hypothetical change if we were to change the system slightly by adding a shelf to support the ball at exactly the same height the forces
