sum of the partial pressures if we now do a series of experiments in which we hold the volume constant while allowing the temperature to change we find a continuous series of pressuretemperature combinations at which the system is at equilibrium this curve is sketched in figure it is much like the curve describing the dependence of the waterwatervapor equilibrium on pressure and temperature figure system pressure versus temperature for dissociation if we hold the temperature constant and allow the volume to vary we can change the force on the piston to keep the total pressure constant at a new
