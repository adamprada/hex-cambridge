activities equilibrium and classical thermodynamics last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers we develop classical thermodynamics by reasoning about reversible processesprocesses in which a system passes through a series of equilibrium states any such process corresponds to a path on one or more of the gibbsian manifolds that are available to the system the resulting theory consists of equations that relate the changes in the values of the systems state functions as the system undergoes a reversible change for this reason the body of theory that
