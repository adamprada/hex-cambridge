real observations can be made only for spontaneous processes we bridge this gap by careful selection of realworld systems to serve as models for the reversible systems that inhabit our theory that is we find that we can make measurements on nonequilibrium systems and irreversible processes from which we can estimate the properties of equilibrium systems and reversible processes saying almost the same thing from another perspective we find that the classical thermodynamic equations that apply to equilibrium states can also be approximately valid for nonequilibrium states for many nonequilibrium states notably those whose individual phases are homogenous the approximations
