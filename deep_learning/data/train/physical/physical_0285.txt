water at any value we choose by applying an appropriate force to the piston suppose that we hold the temperature constant and force the volume to increase by withdrawing the piston in very small increments because pure water is not compressed easily we find initially that the pressure of the water decreases and does so in very large increments however after some small increase in the volume we find that imposing a further volume increase changes the systems behavior abruptly the system undergoes a profound change what was formerly pure liquid becomes a mixture of liquid and gas as we
