surroundings for any given temperature these conversions are precisely balanced at some particular pressure and these conditions characterize a state of liquidvapor equilibrium at any given pressure the equilibrium temperature is called the boiling point of the liquid the equilibrium pressure and temperature completely specify the state of the system except for the exact amounts of liquid and gaseous water present if we begin with this system in a state of liquidvapor equilibrium we can increase the amount of vapor by imposing a small volume increase conversely we can decrease the amount of vapor by imposing a very small volume
