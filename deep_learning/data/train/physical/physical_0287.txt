the system responds to these imposed volume changes so as to maintain a constant equilibrium vapor pressure at the specified temperature we say that the reversible process takes place at constant pressure and temperature we can also describe this process as being driven by arbitrarily small changes in the applied pressure if the applied pressure exceeds the equilibrium vapor pressure by an arbitrarily small increment condensation occurs if the applied pressure is less than the equilibrium vapor pressure by an arbitrarily small increment vaporization occurs to describe this tersely we introduce a figure of speech and say that the reversible
