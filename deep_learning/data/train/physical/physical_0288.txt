denoted it varies with temperature and pressure tables usually give experimental values of the equilibrium boiling temperature at a pressure of bar or atm then they give the enthalpy of vaporization at this temperature and pressure we discuss the enthalpy function in chapter four conditions are sufficient to exactly specify either the initial or the final state the number of moles of liquid the number of moles of gas the pressure and the temperature the change is a conversion of some liquid to gas or vice versa we can represent this change as a transition from an initial state to
