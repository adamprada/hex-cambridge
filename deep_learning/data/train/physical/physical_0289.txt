difference between the system and its surroundings must be arbitrarily small because we can describe exactly the same process as being driven by contacting the system at temperature with surroundings at temperature if we keep the applied pressure constant at the temperature equilibrium vapor pressure the system volume increases we can reverse the direction of change by changing the temperature of the surroundings from to if the process is to satisfy our criterion for reversibility the difference between these two temperatures must be arbitrarily small to describe this requirement tersely we again introduce a figure of speech and say that
