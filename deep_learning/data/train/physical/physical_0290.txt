supply a quantity of heat to the system a quantity of liquid is again converted to gaseous water the quantity of heat required to convert one mole of liquid to gaseous water phase equilibria is slightly different from the quantity required in the previous experiment this is what we mean when we say that the enthalpy of vaporization varies with temperature this experiment can be repeated for many temperatures so long as the temperature is in the range mathrm we find a pressure at which liquid and gaseous water are in equilibrium if we plot the results they lie on
