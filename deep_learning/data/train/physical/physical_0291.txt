keep the pressure constant and remove heat from a quantity of liquid water the temperature decreases until we eventually reach a temperature at which the water begins to freeze to ice at this point water and ice are in equilibrium further removal of heat does not decrease the temperature of the waterice system rather the temperature remains constant and additional water freezes into ice only when all of the liquid has frozen does further removal of heat cause a further decrease in the temperature of the system when we repeat this experiment at a series of temperatures we find a
