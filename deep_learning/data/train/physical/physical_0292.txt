presence of air the water contains dissolved air the triple point occurs in a purewater system it is the temperature and pressure at which gaseous liquid and solid water are in equilibrium by definition the triple point temperature is k experimentally the pressure at the triple point is pa experimentally the melting point is k to freeze a liquid we must remove heat to fuse melt the same amount of the solid at the same temperature and pressure we must add the same amount of heat this heat is called the latent heat of fusion or the enthalpy of fusion
