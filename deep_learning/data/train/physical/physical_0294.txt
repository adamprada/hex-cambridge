is the portion of the line as goes from to along the second segment along path a we have along path b in the limit as and become arbitrarily small we must have so that rearranging this equation so that terms in are on one side and terms in are on the other side dividing both sides by and taking the limit as and we have these limits are the partial derivative of with respect to and of with respect to that is and this shows that if is a continuous function of and whose partial derivatives exist then the
