measurement of reaction rate can also be accomplished using a flow reactor we discuss the method of initial rates a particular kind of flow reactor known as a cstr and enzyme catalysis in sections and respectively the most common reactionrate experiment is a batch reaction in which we mix the reactants as rapidly as possible and then monitor the concentration vs time of one or more of the reactants or products as the reaction proceeds we do the mixing so that the initially mixed reactants are at a known temperature which can be maintained constant for the remainder of the
