a satisfactory representation of the experimental data for a reaction in a closed constantvolume system we would want to test a firstorder rate law rate law which we can express in several alternative ways using the changing concentration of a to express the rate separating variables and integrating between the initial concentration at and concentration at time gives so that or frequently it is convenient to introduce the extent of reaction or the concentration of a product as a parameter in the present instance if the initial concentration of is zero then at any time t we have and the
