of versus time is a straight line for a reaction we would want to test a rate law of the form if the initial concentration of is again zero and at any time the rate law can be written as if this can be integrated by partial fractions to give if experimental data conform to this equation a plot of versus time is linear in practice this often has disadvantages and experiments to study reactions like this typically exploit the technique of flooding flooding is a widely used experimental technique that enables us to simplify a complex rate law in
