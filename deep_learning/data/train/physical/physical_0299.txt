equation is approximately first order the observed rate constant is the slope of a plot of versus is called a pseudofirstorder rate constant of course one such experiment tests only whether the true rate law is first order in it tells nothing about the dependence on if we do several such experiments at different initial concentrations of the resulting set of values must be directly proportional to the corresponding values this can be tested graphically by plotting versus if the rate law is first order in the resulting plot is linear with an intercept of zero the slope of this
