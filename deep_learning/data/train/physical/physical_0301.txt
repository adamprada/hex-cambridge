nuclei can be treated using perturbation theory as we discussed in chapter the result is a standard expression that we derived in chapter rif fracpihbar fomegafi textbfe langle phif boldsymbolmu phiirangle for the rate of photon absorption between initial and final states in this equation is the intensity of the photon source at the frequency is the frequency corresponding to the transition under study and is the electric field vector of the photon field the vector is the electric dipole moment of the electrons and nuclei in the molecule because each of these wave functions is a product of an
