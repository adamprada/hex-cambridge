the initial and final electronic states and do not match the symmetry of the electric dipole operator which has the symmetry of its and components these symmetries can be read off the right most column of the character tables the matrix element will vanish for example the formaldehyde molecule has a ground electronic state that has symmetry in the point group its singlet excited state also has symmetry because both the and orbitals are of symmetry in contrast the lowest these orbitals are shown in figure singlet excited state is of symmetry because the highest energy oxygen centered nonbonding orbital
