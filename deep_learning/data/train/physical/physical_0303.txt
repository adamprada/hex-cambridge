the symmetry axis the molecules axis the transition is predicted to be allowed light polarized along either of the molecules other two axes cannot induce this transition in contrast the transition has a groundexcited state direct product of symmetry the s point group character table shows that the electric dipole operator ie its and components in the moleculefixed frame has no component of symmetry thus light of no electric field orientation can induce this transition we thus say that the transition is forbidden the above examples illustrate one of the most important applications of visibleuv spectroscopy the information gained in
