place quickly the nuclei dont have time to move far from there the first term in this expansion when substituted into the integral over the vibrational coordinates gives which has the form of the electronic transition dipole multiplied by the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wave functions the factor was discussed above it is the electronic transition integral evaluated at the equilibrium geometry of the absorbing state symmetry can often be used to determine whether this integral vanishes as a result of which the transition will be forbidden the vibrational overlap integrals do not necessarily vanish because
