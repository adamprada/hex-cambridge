the kinds of absorption and emission transitions that can occur when the two electronic states have significantly different geometries figure absorption from one initial state to one final state followed by relaxation and then emission from the lowest state of the upper surface whenever an electronic transition causes a large change in the geometry bond lengths or angles of the molecule the franckcondon factors tend to display the characteristic broad progression shown in figure when considered for one initialstate vibrational level and various finalstate vibrational levels figure broad franckcondon progression characteristic of large geometry change notice that as one moves
