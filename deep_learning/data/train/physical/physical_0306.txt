between the two states can also broaden the franckcondon profile if the initial and final states have very similar geometries and frequencies along the mode that is excited when the particular electronic excitation is realized the type of franckcondon profile shown in figure may result figure franckcondon profile characteristic of small geometry change another feature that is important to emphasize is the relation between absorption and emission when the two states energy surfaces have different equilibrium geometries or frequencies subsequent to photon absorption to form an excited electronic state but prior to photon emission the molecule can undergoe collisions with
