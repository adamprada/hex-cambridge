of the various vibrational transitions arising in such emission processes thus one again observes a set of peaks in the emission spectrum as shown in figure figure absorption and emission spectra with the latter red shifted there are two differences between the lines that occur in emission and in absorption first the emission lines are shifted to the red ie to lower energy or longer wavelength because they occur at transition energies connecting the lowest vibrational level of the upper electronic state to various levels of the lower state in contrast the absorption lines connect the lowest vibrational level of
