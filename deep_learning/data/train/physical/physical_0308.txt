upper and ground electronic states these spacings in turn reflect the strengths of the bonds existing in these states bthe change in geometry accompanying the groundtoexcited state electronic transition as reflected in the breadth of the franckcondon profiles these changes also tell us about the bonding changes that occur as the electronic transition occurs so again we see how visibleuv spectroscopy can be used to learn about the electronic structure of molecules in various electronic states time correlation function expressions for transition rates the above socalled goldenrule expression for the rates of photoninduced transitions are written in terms of the
