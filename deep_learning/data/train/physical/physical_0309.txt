exist in a distribution of initial states eg for molecules that occupy many possible rotational and perhaps several vibrational levels at room temperature as we will soon see taking this route to expressing spectroscopic transition rates also allows us to avoid having to know each vibrationalrotational wave function of the two electronic states involved as noted above this is especially useful for large molecules or molecules in condensed media where such knowledge is likely not available to begin reexpressing the spectroscopic transition rates the expression obtained earlier rif fracpihbar fomegafi textbfe langle phif boldsymbolmu phiirangle appropriate to transitions between a
