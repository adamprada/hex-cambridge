summed over all final states that can be reached from with photons of energy the equilibrium averaged rate of photon absorption by the molecular sample is obtained this expression is appropriate for an ensemble of molecules that can be in various initial states with probabilities the corresponding result for transitions that originate in a particular state but end up in any of the allowed by energy and selection rules final states reads ri frachbarsumf rhoi int fomega textbfe cdot langle phif boldsymbolmu phii rangle intinftyinfty expiomegafiomegat dt domega as we discuss in chapter for an ensemble in which the number
