the excited state from which emission will occur this probability can be related to that of the lower state by rhorm excited rhorm lower exp erm excited erm lowerkt the absorption and emission cases can be combined into a single expression for the net rate of photon absorption by recognizing that the latter process leads to photon production and thus must be entered with a negative sign the resultant expression for the net rate of decrease of photons is int int fomega langle phii textbfe boldsymbolmu textbfe boldsymbolmu t phiirangle exp hbaromegakt expiomega t domega dt it is convention to
