correlation function expression for the photon absorption rate is equivalent to the statetostate expression from which it was derived we notice that does not contain explicit reference to the finalstate wave functions instead requires us to describe how the dipole operator changes with time that is in the time correlation framework one is allowed to use models of the time evolution of the system to describe the spectra this is especially appealing for large complex molecules and molecules in condensed media because for such systems it would be hopeless to attempt to find the finalstate wave functions but it may
