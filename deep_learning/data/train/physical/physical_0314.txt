are used within the correlation function framework for the specific photon absorption case line broadening mechanisms if the rotational motion of the systems molecules is assumed to be entirely unhindered eg by any environment or by collisions with other molecules it is appropriate to express the time dependence of each of the dipole time correlation functions listed above in terms of a free rotation model for example when dealing with diatomic molecules the electronicvibrationalrotational appropriate to a specific electronicvibrational transition becomes ct qr qv qe qt sumj j expbigg frachbarjjpiiktbigg expbig frachbarnurm vibviktbig gie langle phij textbfe boldsymbolmuifre textbfe boldsymbolmuifret
