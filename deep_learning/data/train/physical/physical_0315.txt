model this function is taken to be of the form where is the rotational frequency in cycles per second for rotation of the molecule in the state labeled by this oscillatory time dependence combined with the time dependence arising from the electronic and vibrational factors produce when this function is fourier transformed to generate a series of function peaks the intensities of these peaks are governed by the quantities boltzmann population factors as well as by the franckcondon factors and the terms this same analysis can be applied to the pure rotation and vibrationrotation time dependences with analogous results in
