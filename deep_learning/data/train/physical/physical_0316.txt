expressions for the averaging over initial rotational vibrational and electronic states is explicitly shown there is also an average over the translational motion implicit in all of these expressions its role has not yet been emphasized because the molecular energy levels whose spacings yield the characteristic frequencies at which light can be absorbed or emitted do not depend on translational motion however the frequency of the electromagnetic field experienced by moving molecules does depend on the velocities of the molecules so this issue must now be addressed elementary physics classes express the socalled doppler shift of a waves frequency induced
