transformation to obtain a spectral line shape function which then provides the essential ingredient for computing the net rate of photon absorption in this fourier transform process the variable is assumed to be the frequency of the electromagnetic field experienced by the molecules the above considerations of doppler shifting then lead one to realize that the correct functional form to use in converting to is where is the nominal frequency of the light source as stated earlier within there is also an equilibrium average over translational motion of the molecules for a gasphase sample undergoing random collisions and at thermal
