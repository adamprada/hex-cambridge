need no longer be considered in each instead the earlier expressions for must each be multiplied by a factor that embodies the translationaly averaged doppler shift the spectral line shape function can then be obtained for each by simply fourier transforming when applied to the rotation vibrationrotation or electronicvibrationrotation cases within the unhindered rotation model treated earlier the fourier transform involves integrals of the form this integral would arise in the electronicvibrationrotation case the other two cases would involve integrals of the same form but with the absent in the vibrationrotation situation and with missing for pure rotation transitions all
