obtained to accuracy sufficient to determine the doppler width of the spectral lines such knowledge can be used to estimate the temperature of the system this can be useful when dealing with systems that cannot be subjected to alternative temperature measurements for example the temperatures of stars can be estimated if their velocity relative to the earth is known by determining the doppler shifts of emission lines from them alternatively the relative speed of a star from the earth may be determined if its temperature is known as another example the temperature of hot gases produced in an explosion can
