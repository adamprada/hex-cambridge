the effects of such infrequent collisioninduced kicks are treated within the socalled pressure broadening sometimes called collisional broadening model by modifying the freerotation correlation function through the introduction of an exponential damping factor this damping functions time scale parameter is assumed to characterize the average time between collisions and thus should be inversely proportional to the collision frequency its magnitude is also related to the effectiveness with which collisions cause the dipole function to deviate from its unhindered rotational motion ie related to the collision strength in effect the exponential damping causes the time correlation function to lose its memory
