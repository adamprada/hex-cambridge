been pressure or collisionally broadened when the doppler broadening can not be neglected relative to the collisional broadening the above integral is more difficult to perform nevertheless it can be carried out and again produces a series of peaks centered at but whose widths are determined both by doppler and pressure broadening effects the resultant line shapes are thus no longer purely lorentzian nor gaussian which are compared in figure for both functions having the same full width at half height and the same integrated area but have a shape that is called a voight shape figure typical forms of
