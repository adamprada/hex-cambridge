to the rotational period for their unhindered rotation as a result the time dependence of the dipolerelated correlation functions can no longer be modeled in terms of free rotation that is interrupted by infrequent collisions and doppler shifted instead a model that describes the incessant buffeting of the molecules dipole by surrounding molecules becomes appropriate for liquid samples in which these frequent collisions cause the dipole to undergo angular motions that cover all angles ie in contrast to a frozen glass or solid in which the molecules dipole would undergo strongly perturbed pendular motion about some favored orientation the socalled
