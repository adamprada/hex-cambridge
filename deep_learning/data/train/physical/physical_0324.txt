diffusion case not surprisingly when the doppler contribution is small one obtains in these lorentzian lines the parameter describes the kinetic decay lifetime of the molecule one says that the spectral lines have been lifetime or heisenberg broadened by an amount proportional to the latter terminology arises because the finite lifetime of the molecular states can be viewed as producing via the heisenberg uncertainty relation states whose energy is uncertain to within an amount e site inhomogeneous broadening among the above line broadening mechanisms the pressure rotational diffusion and lifetime broadenings are all of the homogeneous variety this means that
