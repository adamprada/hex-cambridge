a liquid solid or glass do not at the instant of their photon absorption all experience exactly the same interactions with their surroundings the distribution of instantaneous solvation environments may be rather narrow eg in a highly ordered solid matrix or quite broad eg in a liquid at high temperature or in a supercritical liquid different environments produce different energy level splittings because the initial and final states are solvated differently by the surroundings and thus different frequencies at which photon absorption can occur the distribution of energy level splittings causes the sample to absorb at a range of frequencies
