each of which contains a set of frequencies eg omegafvivdelta eifhbar omegaj delta e hbar omegadelta e hbar at which absorption or emission occurs and is a gaussian probability function describing the inhomogeneous broadening of the energy splitting a common experimental test to determine whether inhomogeneous broadening is significant involves hole burning in such experiments an intense light source often a laser is tuned to a frequency that lies within the spectral line being probed for inhomogeneous broadening then with the intense light source constantly turned on a second tunable light source is used to scan through the profile of
