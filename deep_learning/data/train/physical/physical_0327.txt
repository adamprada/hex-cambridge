the bright light source other molecules those whose environments do not produce energy level splittings that match will not absorb at this frequency those molecules that do absorb at will have their transition saturated by the intense light source thereby rendering this frequency region of the line profile transparent to further absorption when the probe light source is scanned over the line profile it will induce absorptions for those molecules whose local environments did not allow them to be saturated by the light the absorption profile recorded by this probe light sources detector thus will match that of the original
