case the transition may not be strong enough ie may not have a large enough rate of photon absorption for the intense light source to saturate the transition to the extent needed to form a hole photoelectron spectroscopy photoelectron spectroscopy pes is a special kind of electronic spectroscopy it uses visible or uv light to excite a molecule or ion to a final state in which an electron is ejected in effect it induces transitions to final states in which an electron has been promoted to an unbound socalled continuum orbital most pes experiments are carried out using a fixedfrequency
