highest kinetic energy came from the highestlying state of the parent while those with low kinetic energy came from the lowestenergy state of the parent figure photoelectron spectrum showing absorption from two states of the parent by examining the spacings between these peaks one learns about the spacings between the energy levels of the parent species that has been subjected to electron loss alternatively if the parent species exists primarily in its lowest state but the daughter species produced when an electron is removed from the parent has excited electronic vibrationrotation states that can be accessed one can observe a
