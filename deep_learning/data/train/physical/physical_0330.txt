a franckcondon vibrational progression of neutral cu the peak at a kinetic energy of ca ev corresponding to a binding energy of ev arises from in losing an electron to produce in the most intense peak corresponds to a to transition as in the visibleuv spectroscopy case franckcondon factors involving the overlap of the anion and neutral vibrational wave functions govern the relative intensities of the pes peaks another example is given in figure where the photodetachment spectrum of the anion of the carbene vinylidene appears figure photoelectron spectrum of showing detachments to two electronic states of the neutral in
