the and electronic states of the neutral because pes offers a direct way to measure energy differences between anion and neutral or neutral and cation state energies it is a powerful and widely used means of determining molecular electron affinities eas and ionization potentials ips because ips and eas relate via koopmans theorem to orbital energies pes is thus seen to be a way to measure orbital energies its vibrational envelopes also offer a good way to probe vibrational energy level spacings and hence the bonding strengths probing continuum orbitals there is another type of spectroscopy that can be used
