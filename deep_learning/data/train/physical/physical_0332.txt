such an experiment a beam of electrons having a known intensity and narrowly defined range of kinetic energies is allowed to pass through a sample usually gaseous of thickness the intensity of electrons observed to pass through the sample and arrive at a detector lying along the incident beams direction is monitored as are the kinetic energies of these electrons such an experiment is described in qualitative form in figure figure qualitative depiction of a prototypical electron transmission spectrum setup if the molecules in the sample have a resonance orbital whose energy is close to the kinetic energy of the
