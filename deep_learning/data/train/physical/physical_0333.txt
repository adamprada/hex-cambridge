motion various events can take place before the electron is reemitted isome bond lengths or angles can change this will happen if the orbital occupied by the beams electron has bonding or antibonding character so when the electron is subsequently emitted the neutral molecule is left with a change in vibrational energy iithe molecule may rotate so when the electron is ejected it is not emitted in the same direction as the incident beam in the former case one observes electrons emitted with energies that differ from that of the incident beam by amounts related to the internal vibrational energy
