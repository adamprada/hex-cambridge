more clearly identified figure ets spectrum plotted in derivative form as described in the text of in this ets spectrum of the oscillations that appear within the major spectral feature displayed whose center is near ev correspond to stretching and bending vibrational levels of the metastable anion it is the bending vibration that is primarily excited because the beam electron enters the lumo of which is an orbital of the form shown in figure figure antibonding orbital of holding the excess electron in occupancy of this antibonding orbital causes both co bonds to lengthen and the oco angle to bend
