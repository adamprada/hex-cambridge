before closing this section it is important to describe how one uses theory to simulate the metastable states that arise in such ets experiments such calculations are not at all straightforward and require the introduction of special tools designed to properly model the resonant continuum orbital for metastable anions it is difficult to approximate the potential experienced by the excess electron for example singly charged anions in which the excess electron occupies a molecular orbital that possesses nonzero angular momentum have effective potentials as shown in figure which depend on the angular momentum value of the orbital figure radial potentials
