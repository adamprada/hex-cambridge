the orbital has gerade symmetry its larger character is dominated by angular momentum as a result the excess electron has a centrifugal radial potential derived largely from its character the attractive shortrange valence potentials and the centrifugal potential combine to produce a net effective potential as illustrated in figure the energy of an electron experiencing such a potential may or may not lie below the asymptote if the attractive potential is sufficiently strong as it is for the electron in the orbital will be bound and its energy will lie below this asymptote on the other hand if the attractive
