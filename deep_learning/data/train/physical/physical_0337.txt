as above however to compute the lifetime of the shape resonance one has to know the energy of this state the most common and powerful tool for studying such metastable states theoretically is the stabilization method sm that prof howard taylor at usc pioneered this method involves embedding the system of interest eg the anion within a finite radial box in order to convert the continuum of states corresponding for example to into discrete states that can be handled using more conventional methods by then varying the size of the box one can vary the energies of the discrete states
