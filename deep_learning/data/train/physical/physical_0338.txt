as an example for how the sm would be employed especially how one usually varies the box within which the anion is constrained one would use a conventional atomic orbital basis set that would likely include s and functions on each atom perhaps some polarization d functions and some conventional diffuse s and orbitals on each atom these basis orbitals serve primarily to describe the motions of the electrons within the usual valence regions of space to this basis one would append extra sets of diffuse symmetry orbitals these orbitals could be and maybe functions centered on each nitrogen atom
