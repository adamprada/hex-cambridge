states of of course because a finite atomic orbital basis set must be used one finds a discrete spectrum of orbital energies and thus of electronic state energies there are occupied orbitals having negative energy that represent via koopmans theorem the bound states of the there are also socalled virtual orbitals ie those orbitals that are not occupied whose energies lie above zero ie do not describe bound states the latter orbitals offer a discrete approximation to the continuum within which the resonance state of interest lies one then scales the orbital exponents of the extra basis orbitals by a
