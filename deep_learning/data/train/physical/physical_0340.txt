the energy of the neutral molecule this can be probed by plotting the energy as a function of the scaling parameter h if the energy varies little with the conventional basis is adequate in contrast to plots of the neutral energy vs plots of the energies of the m states show significant hdependence as figure illustrates figure typical stabilization plot showing several levels of the metastable anion and their avoided crossings what does such a stabilization plot tell us and what do the various branches of the plot mean first one should notice that each of the plots of the
