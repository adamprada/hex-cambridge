concentrated at large r and have low kinetic energy this is because for small all of these orbitals are very diffuse and concentrate electron density at large distances as grows these functions become more radially compact and their kinetic energies grow for example note the three lowest energies shown above increasing from near zero as grows as further increases one reaches a point at which the third and fourth anionstate energies undergo an avoided crossing at this value if one examines the nature of the two wave functions whose energies avoid one another one finds that one of them contains
