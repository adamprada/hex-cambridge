so at this special value one can achieve a description of the shaperesonance state that correctly describes this state both in the valence region and in the larger region only by tuning the energy of the larger states using the scaling can one obtain this proper boundary condition matching in summary by carrying out a series of anionstate energy calculations for several states and plotting them vs one obtains a stabilization graph by examining this graph and looking for avoided crossings one can identify the energies at which metastable resonances occur it is also possible to use the shapes ie
