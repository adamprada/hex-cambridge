sample of thickness and the intensity of the light beam in the absence of the sample and with the sample present are measured figure typical beerslaw experiment in which a light beam of intensity is passed through a sample of thickness the beerlambert law then allows the concentration a of the absorbing molecules to be determined given the path length over which absorption occurs and given the extinction coefficient of the absorbing molecules these extinction coefficients which relate to the electric dipole matrix elements as discussed in chapter are usually determined empirically by preparing a known concentration of the absorbing
