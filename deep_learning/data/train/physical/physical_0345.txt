the signal relates to the concentrations of the species if one wishes to monitor chemical reaction or energy transfer rates because modern experimental techniques are capable of detecting molecules in particular electronic and vibrationrotation states it has become common to use such tools to examine chemical reaction dynamics on a statetostate level and to follow energy transfer processes which clearly require such statespecific data in such experiments one seeks to learn the rate at which reactants in a specific state react to produce products in some specific state one of the most common ways to monitor such statespecific rates is
