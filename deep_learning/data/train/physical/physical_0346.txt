such final states the concentrations of reactant and products molecules in the initial and final states and are determined by the beerlambert relation assuming that the extinction coefficients and for these species and states absorption are known in the former case the extinction coefficient relates to absorption of the pump photons to prepare reactant molecules in the specified initial state in the latter refers to absorption of the product molecules that are created in the state carrying out a series of such finalstate absorption measurements at various delay times t allows one to determine the concentration of these states as
