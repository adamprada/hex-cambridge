eg photoinduced electron transfer reactions in biological systems beam methods another approach to probing chemical reaction dynamics is to use a beam of reactant molecules a that collides with other reactants b that may also in a beam or in a bulb in equilibrium at some temperature t such crossedbeam and beambulb experiments are illustrated in figure figure typical crossedbeam and beambulb experimental setups almost always these beam and bulb samples contain molecules radicals or ions in the gas phase so these techniques are most prevalent in gasphase dynamics studies the advantages of the crossedbeam type experiments are that one
