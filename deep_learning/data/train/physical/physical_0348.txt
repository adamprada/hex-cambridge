product molecules can also give information about the nature of the reaction process for example if the a b collision forms a longlived ie on rotational time scales collision complex the product c molecules display a very isotropic angular distribution in contrast reactions that proceed more impulsively show product angular distributions that are either strongly backscattered or strongly forwardscattered rather than isotropic in beambulb experiments one is not able to gain as much detailed information because one of the reactant molecules b is not constrained to be moving with a known fixed velocity in a specified direction when the collisions
