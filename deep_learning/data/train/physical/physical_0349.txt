even though the molecules in the bulb have a distribution of kinetic energies that is if the species in the beam have much higher kinetic energies than most of the b molecules then the a b collision energy is primarily determined by the beam energy an example of this situation is provided by socalled guidedion beam experiments in which a beam of ions having wellspecified kinetic energy e impinges on molecules in a bulb having a temperature for which figure illustrates data that can be extracted from such an experiment figure collisioninduced dissociation data showing crosssection as a function of
