needed to effect dissociation of the complex this kind of data has proven to offer some of the most useful information about bond dissociation energies of a wide variety of species in addition the magnitude of the reaction crosssection as a function of collision energy is a valuable product of such experiments these kind of cid beambulb experiments offer one of the most powerful and widely used means of determining such bondrupture energies and reaction rate constants other methods of course not all chemical reactions occur so quickly that they require the use of fast lasers to follow concentrations of
