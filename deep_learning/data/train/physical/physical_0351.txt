review it here and again consider the reaction of an enzyme e and a substrate s to form the enzymesubstrate complex es in the perturbationtype experiments the equilibrium concentrations of the species are shifted by a small amount by application of the perturbation so that subsequently the following rate law will govern the time evolution of the concentration change d assuming that is very small so that the term involving cam be neglected and using the fact that the forward and reverse rates balance at equilibrium this equation for the time evolution of can be reduced to so the concentration
