the maxwellboltzmann probability density last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers there are numerous applications of the maxwellboltzmann equation these include predictions of collision frequencies meanfree paths effusion and diffusion rates the thermal conductivity of gases and gas viscosities these applications are important but none of them is a direct test of the validity of the maxwellboltzmann equation the validity of the equation has been demonstrated directly in experiments in which a gas of metal atoms is produced in an oven at a very high temperature
