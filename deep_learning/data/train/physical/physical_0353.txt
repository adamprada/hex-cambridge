a measurement of their speed figure producing a beam of metal atoms one device uses a solid cylindrical drum which rotates on its cylindrical axis as sketched in figure a spiral groove is cut into the cylindrical face of this drum this groove is cut with a constant pitch when the drum rotates at a constant rate an atom traveling at a constant velocity parallel to the cylindrical axis can traverse the length of the drum while remaining within the groove that is for a given rotation rate there is one critical velocity at which an atom can travel in
