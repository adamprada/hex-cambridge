way around the cylinder that is if we project the spiral onto one of the circular faces of the drum the projection traverses an angle of on the face in order to remain in the middle of this groove all the way from one end of the drum to the other the atom must travel the length of the cylindrical drum in exactly the same time that it takes the drum to make a halfrotation let the critical velocity be then the time required for the atom to traverse the length d of the drum is if the drum rotates
