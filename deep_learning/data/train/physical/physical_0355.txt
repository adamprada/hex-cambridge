where the drum is constructed with a slower atom that enters the groove at the earliest possible timewhen the leading edge of the groove first encounters the beam of atomscan traverse the length of the groove in a longer time a point on the circumference of the drum travels with speed the slowest atom traverses the length of the drum while a point on the circumference of the drum travels a distance to intercept the slowest atom the trailing edge of the groove must travel a distance equal to half the circumference of the drum plus the width of the
