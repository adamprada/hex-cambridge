molecules bacteria present this is equivalent to our observation in section that a firstorder process corresponds to a constant probability that a given individual item will disappear firstorder decay or reproduce firstorder growth in unit time for a firstorder decay we have keeping in the limit as which has solution firstorder growth and firstorder decay both depend exponentially on the difference is in the sign of the exponential term for exponential growth becomes arbitrarily large as for exponential decay goes to zero if the concentration of a chemical species decreases according to a firstorder rate law we have the units
