henry eyring scientist chemistry at university of utah contributors and attributions the particleinabox type problems provide important models for several relevant chemical situations the particleinabox model for motion in one or two dimensions discussed earlier can obviously be extended to three dimensions for two and three dimensions it provides a crude but useful picture for electronic states on surfaces ie when the electron can move freely on the surface but cannot escape to the vacuum or penetrate deeply into the solid or in metallic crystals respectively i say metallic crystals because it is in such systems that the outermost valence
