are with each type of nucleon forced to obey the pauli exclusion principle ie to have no more than two nucleons in each orbital because protons and neutrons are fermions for example has two protons in orbitals and neutrons in orbitals whereas has two protons and one neutron to remind you i display in figure the angular shapes that characterize and orbitals figure the angular shapes of and functions this same spherical box model has also been used to describe the valence electrons in quasispherical nanoclusters of metal atoms such as and their positive and negative ions because of the
