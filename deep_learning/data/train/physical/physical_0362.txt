chapter we showed how the particleinasphere radial functions can be expressed in terms of spherical bessel functions in addition the pattern of energy levels which was shown in chapter to be related to the values of x at which the spherical bessel functions vanish are not the same as in atoms again because the radial potentials differ however the angular shapes of the spherical box problem are the same as in atomic structure because in both cases the potential is independent of and as the orbital plots shown above indicate the angular shapes of s p and orbitals display varying
