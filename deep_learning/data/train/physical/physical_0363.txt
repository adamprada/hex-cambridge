has a closedshell electronic configuration in which for a given radial quantum number all of the orbitals associated with that are doubly occupied nanoscopic metal clusters are observed to display special stability eg lack of chemical reactivity large electron detachment energy clusters that produce such closedshell electronic configurations are sometimes said to have magicnumber sizes the energy level expression given in chapter for an electron moving inside a sphere of radius and having a potential relative to the vacuum of can be used to model the energies of electron within metallic nanoclusters each electron occupies an orbital having quantum numbers
