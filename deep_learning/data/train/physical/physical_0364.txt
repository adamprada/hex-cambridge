chain in such a model the box length is related to the carboncarbon bond length and the number of carbon centers involved in the delocalized network in figure such a conjugated network involving nine centers is depicted in this example the box length would be eight times the cc bond length figure the atomic orbitals of a conjugated chain of nine carbon atoms so the box length is eight times the cc bond length the eigenstates and their energies represent orbitals into which electrons are placed in the example case if nine electrons are present eg as in the nonatetraene
