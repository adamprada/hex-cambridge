in which each hj describes the kinetic and potential energy of an individual electron of course the full hamiltonian contains electronelectron coulomb interaction potentials that cannot be written in this additive form however as we will treat in detail in chapter it is often possible to approximate these electronelectron interactions in a form that is additive recall that when a partial differential equation has no operators that couple its different independent variables ie when it is separable one can use separation of variables methods to decompose its solutions into products thus the approximate additivity of implies that solutions of are
