color as reflected in the complementary color of the light the molecule absorbs varies as the conjugation length of the molecule varies that is longer conjugated molecules have lowerenergy orbitals because appears in the denominator of the energy expression as a result longer conjugated molecules absorb light of lower energy than do shorter molecules this simple particleinabox model does not yield orbital energies that relate to ionization energies unless the potential inside the box is specified choosing the value of this potential that exists within the box such that is equal to minus the lowest ionization energy of the nonatetraene
