like shading overlap the wave function has enhanced amplitude ie there is a bonding interaction where two spheres of different shading overlap a node occurs ie there is antibonding interaction once again we note that the number of nodes increases as one ranges from the lowestenergy orbital to higher energy orbitals the reader is once again encouraged to keep in mind this ubiquitous characteristic of quantum mechanical wave functions this simple model allows one to estimate spin densities at each carbon center and provides insight into which centers should be most amenable to electrophilic or nucleophilic attack for example radical
