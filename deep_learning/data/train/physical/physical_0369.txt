do is to find an expression for that can be determined by the changes in the system itself fortunately we have already done that recalling that at constant temperature and at constant pressure it follows that at constant temperature and pressure substitution into the above equations yields an expression for the criterion of spontaneity that depends only on variables describing the changes in the system delta suniv ge delta ssys dfracdelta hsyst so multiplying both sides by yields a similar derivation for constant volume processes results in the expression at constant volume and temperature equation refchem is of great use
