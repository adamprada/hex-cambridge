enthalpy changes this function the gibbs function or gibbs free energy is defined by a change in the gibbs function can be expressed or at constant temperature and the criterion for a process to be spontaneous is the dg as such it should be clear spontaneity is not merely a function the enthalpy change although exothermic processes tend to be spontaneous but also a function of the entropy change weighted by the temperature going back to an earlier example with and with it is easy to see why both processes are spontaneous in the first case the process is exothermic
