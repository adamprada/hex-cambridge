at all t at low t similarly to the gibbs function the helmholtz function is defined by and provides another important criterion for spontaneous processes at constant value and temperature at constant temperature the helmholtz function can be expressed by based on similar arguments used for the gibbs function the helmholtz function also can be used to predict which processes will be spontaneous at constant volume and temperature according to table table spontaneity conditions for a process under constant temperature and volume spontaneous at high t at no t at all t at low t calculating for reactions much like
