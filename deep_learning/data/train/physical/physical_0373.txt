constant temperature bath whose temperature is the same as that of the system in this case and we can say that the process is isothermal alternatively we can isolate the system so that it cannot exchange heat with the surroundings in this case and the process is said to be adiabatic in we find that the work done on a system when its volume changes by under the influence of an applied pressure is any expansion of a system in which the applied pressure is less than the system pressure can be called a free expansion in section we consider
