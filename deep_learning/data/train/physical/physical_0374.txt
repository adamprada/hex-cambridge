irreversible process in principle the temperature of a gas undergoing a free expansion is not a meaningful quantity when we talk about an isothermal free expansion of a gas we mean that the final temperature is the same as the initial temperature here we consider the behavior of ideal gases and we begin by considering the limiting case of a free expansion in which the applied pressure is zero physically this corresponds to the expansion of a system into a very large evacuated container under this condition and the energy change is for one mole of any substance if only
