one mole of any ideal gas for an isothermal free expansion against an applied pressure of zero we have and so neither the energy nor the enthalpy of the gas changes since also there can be no exchange of heat with the surroundings we have free expansion ideal gas for an adiabatic free expansion we have and and it follows again that we see that the isothermal and adiabatic expansions of an ideal gas into a vacuum are equivalent processes if the expansion is opposed by a nonzero applied pressure the two processes cease to be equivalent free particle motions
