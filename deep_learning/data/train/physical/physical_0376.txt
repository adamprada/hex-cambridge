of the hamiltonian the schr√∂dinger equation consider an electron of mass m and charge moving on a twodimensional surface that defines the plane eg perhaps an electron is constrained to the surface of a solid by a potential that binds it tightly to a narrow region in the direction but allows it to roam freely over a rectangular area in the plane and assume that the electron experiences a constant and not timevarying potential at all points in this plane for example if is negative it could reflect the binding energy of the electron relative to its energy in vacuum
