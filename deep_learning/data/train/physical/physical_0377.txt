equation is independent of both and both terms on the left must actually be constant these two constants are denoted and respectively realizing that they have units of energy this observation allows two separate schrödinger equations to be written and the total energy can then be expressed in terms of these separate energies and from solutions to the and schrödinger equations are easily seen to be two independent solutions are obtained for each equation because the and space schrödinger equations are both second order differential equations ie a second order differential equation has two independent solutions boundary conditions the boundary
