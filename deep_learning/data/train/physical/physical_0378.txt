the situation is qualitatively different constraining the electron to any such specified area gives rise to boundary conditions that impose additional requirements on the above and functions these constraints can arise for example if the potential becomes very large for values outside the region in which case the probability of finding the electron outside the region is very small such a case might represent for example a situation in which the molecular structure of the solid surface changes outside the enclosed region in a way that is highly repulsive to the electron eg as in the case of molecular corrals
