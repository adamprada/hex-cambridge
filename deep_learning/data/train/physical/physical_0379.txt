must linearly combine the above two solutions and to achieve a function that vanishes at one is allowed to linearly combine solutions of the schrödinger equation that have the same energy ie are degenerate because schrödinger equations are linear differential equations an analogous process must be applied to to achieve a function that vanishes at further requiring and to vanish respectively at and respectively gives equations that can be obeyed only if and assume particular values these equations are equivalent ie using to knowing that vanishes at for although the function vanishes for this function vanishes for all or and
