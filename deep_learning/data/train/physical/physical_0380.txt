along both axes if the electron were confined along one coordinate eg between but not along the other ie is either restricted to vanish only at or at or at neither point then the total energy lies in the continuum its component is quantized but is not analogs of such cases arise for example for a triatomic molecule containing one strong and one weak bond if the bond with the higher dissociation energy is excited to a level that is not enough to break it but that is in excess of the dissociation energy of the weaker bond one has
