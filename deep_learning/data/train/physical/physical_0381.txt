of the second function as time evolves in such a case one speaks of internal vibrational energy relaxation ivr giving rise to unimolecular decomposition of the molecule energies and wave functions for bound states for discrete energy levels the energies are specified functions that depend on quantum numbers one for each degree of freedom that is quantized returning to the situation in which motion is constrained along both axes the resultant total energies and wave functions obtained by inserting the quantum energy levels into the expressions for and are as follows and with and the two factors are included to
