again and again in quantum mechanics and is something the student should be able to use to guess the relative energies of wave functions when their plots are at hand finally you should also notice that as in the onedimensional box case any attempt to classically interpret the probabilities corresponding to the above quantum wave functions will result in failure as in the onedimensional case the classical would be constant along slices of fixed and varying or slices of fixed and varying within the box because the speed is constant there however the quantum plots at least for small quantum
