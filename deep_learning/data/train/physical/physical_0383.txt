the schr√∂dinger equation and dividing by we obtain where is the value of the potential inside the circular region the first two terms on the left and the on the right side contain no reference to so the quantity must be independent of moreover because the coordinates and describe the same point in space must obey the solutions to the above differential equation for subject to the periodicity condition are this means that the equation for the radial part of the wave function is or this differential equation is probably not familiar to you but it turns out this is
