angular momentum quantum number in the table shown below we list the first five values at which and vanish values of at which vanish for and if we call the values at which vanishes then the energies are given as from the ordering of the values shown in the table above we can see that the ordering of the energy levels will be and so forth regardless of the size of the circle or the mass of the particle the state with has the same energy as that with likewise has the same energy as so all but the states
