for there is high amplitude for the particle being in the center of the circle but for there is no amplitude in the center this is analogous to what one finds for atomic orbitals orbitals have nonzero amplitude at the nucleus but p d and higher orbitals do not lets examine a few more easy problems that can be solved analytically to some degree this will help illustrate how boundary conditions generate quantization and how the number of quantum numbers depends on the dimensionality of the problem when considering a particle of mass moving in three dimensions but constrained to
