but it can be recast in a way that makes it equivalent to the equation obeyed by socalled spherical bessel functions by taking the result is that the wave functions for this problem reduce to where is a normalization constant the energies are determined by requiring to vanish at which is analogous to insisting that the spherical bessel function vanish at in the earlier problem we studied the values of at which vanish again can be found in various tabulations including that cited earlier several of these values are tabulated below for illustration values of at which vanish for and
