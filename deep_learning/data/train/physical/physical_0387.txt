energies appear in the order and so on and this is true for any size sphere and any particle mass m if instead of being constrained to move within a spherical volume the particle is constrained to move on the surface of a sphere or radius the variable is fixed at and the schr√∂dinger equation becomes using we can see that the wave functions are the spherical harmonics and the energies are given by note that the energies depend on but not on the quantum number so each state belonging to level is fold degenerate because ranges from to finally
