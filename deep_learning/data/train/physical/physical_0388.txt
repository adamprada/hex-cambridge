momentum these model problems will be seen in chapter to be very useful representations of situations that arise when an electron is constrained within or on the surface of various nanoscopic particles for now they were discussed to illustrate how separations of variables can sometimes be used to decompose the schr√∂dinger equation into onedimensional ordinary differential equations and to show how it is the boundary conditions either constraining to vanish at certain distances or insisting that be periodic when appropriate that produce the quantization it is important to note that it is when a particle is spatially constrained eg when
