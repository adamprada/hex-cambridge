path leading from initial coordinate at initial time to a final coordinate at time is defined by here the momentum vector p contains the momenta along all coordinates of the system and the coordinate vector likewise contains the coordinates along all such degrees of freedom for example in the twodimensional particleinabox problem considered above has two components as does and the action integral is in computing such actions it is essential to keep in mind the sign of the momentum as the particle moves from its initial to its final positions the examples given below will help clarify these matters
