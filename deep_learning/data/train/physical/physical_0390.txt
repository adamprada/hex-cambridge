between these classical action integrals and the existence of quantized energy levels has been shown to involve equating the classical action for motion that is periodic between a left and right turning point as for a classical particle undergoing periodic vibrational motion to the following multiple of plancks constant where the quantization index ranges from to in steps of unity alternatively for motion in a closed angular path as for a particle moving on a circular or elliptical path the action quantization condition reads where again ranges from to in steps of unity when actionquantization as described above is applied
