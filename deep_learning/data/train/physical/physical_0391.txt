back again to form a closed path carrying out this integral and equating it to gives the following expression for the energy if the quantum number is allowed to assume integer values ranging from to infinity these energy levels agree with the full quantum treatments results that we will obtain later for an example of applying this approach to a problem involving motion along a closed loop lets consider the free ie with no potential affecting its angular motion rotation of a diatomic molecule ab having fixed bond length r the rotational energy can be written as where is the
