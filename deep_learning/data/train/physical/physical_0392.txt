first integrals appearing above because the particle is moving from to and analogously for motion and thus has positive momentum and negative in each of the second integrals because the motion is from to and analogously for motion and thus the particle has negative momentum within the region bounded by the potential is constant and can be taken as zero this just gives our reference point for total energy using this fact and reversing the upper and lower limits and thus the sign in the second integrals above one obtains solving for and one finds these are not the same
