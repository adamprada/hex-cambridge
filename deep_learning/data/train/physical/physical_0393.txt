chem phys but i will not discuss it further here because its details are beyond the level of this text suffice it to say that for periodic motion between two turning points on a smooth ie nonpiecewise potential is the correct action quantization value for angular motion on a closed loop nh is the proper value but for periodic motion between turning points on a piecewise potential the modifications discussed in the above reference must be applied to cause action quantization to reproduce the correct quantum result the use of action quantization as illustrated above has become a very important
