theory as applied to chemistry you can learn more about this subject before leaving this section it is worth discussing a bit more the energy and angular momentum quantization that occurs when treating free onedimensional rotational motion of a particle on a circle or a linear rigid molecule constrained to lie on a plane when we used action quantization to address this kind of problem we obtained quantized energies which through the energy expression given in terms of angular momentum implies that the angular momentum itself is quantized this is the same result we obtain when we seek eigenfunctions and
