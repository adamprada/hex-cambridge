angular momentum by placing the system possessing the angular momentum in a magnetic field of strength b and observing how many component energy states arise this splitting in energy levels is termed the zeeman effect for example a boron atom with one unpaired electron its orbital has one unit of orbital angular momentum so one finds three separate component values which are usually denoted and another example is offered by the scandium atom with one unpaired electron in a d orbital this atoms states split into five component states in each case one finds values of the quantum number and
