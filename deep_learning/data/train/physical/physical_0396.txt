fields action on the unpaired electrons spin because as we discuss later in this text all angular momenta have component eigenvalues that are separated from one another by unit multiples of h one is forced to conclude that these three fundamental buildingblock particles electrons protons and neutrons have component eigenvalues of and the appearance of halfintegral angular momenta is not consistent with the actionquantization result or the observation made earlier that and correspond to exactly the same physical point in coordinate space which in turn implies that only fullinteger angular momenta are possible the resolution of the above paradox ie
