of a magnetic field but which represent two distinct states of the electron analogously a proton has and states as do neutrons all such halfintegral angular momentum states cannot be accounted for using classical mechanics but are known to arise in quantum mechanics this means that when we teach introductory chemistry to young students it is not correct to say that the up and down a and b spin states of an electron can be viewed in terms of the electrons mass spinning clockwise or counterclockwise around some axis such spinningmass angular momenta can only possess integer values halfinteger angular
