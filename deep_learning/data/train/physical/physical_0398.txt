wave function as a constant real amplitude a multiplied by a complex phase which we write as substituting this expression for into the schr√∂dinger equation gives an equation for this equation contains both real and imaginary components nb itself is complex it is usually solved by assuming can be expanded in a power series in the variable this expansion is motivated by noting that if the factor in the above equation is neglected the resulting equation would make sense if were equal to the classical momentum of the particle so taking the limit of the equation for appears to reduce
