variables when there is only one spatial coordinate and are scalar quantities the first equation can be solved for and gives two independent solutions ie those corresponding to the sign each of which will be real when ie in classically allowed regions of space and imaginary when ie in classically forbidden regions notice that contains an integrand equal to the classical momentum the equation for can also be solved so through firstorder in the semiclassical wave functions are these pairs of wave functions are often expressed as in regions of space where and in the classically forbidden regions where notice
