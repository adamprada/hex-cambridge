growing and decaying functions are not needed because in the regions and the wave function can be taken to vanish within the region there are two independent wave functions and the potential is constant lets call the potential in this region so the integration appearing in these two wave functions can be carried out to give we can combine these two functions to generate a function that will vanish at as it must for this particleinabox problem we can then use the condition that must also vanish at to obtain an equation that specifies the energies that are allowed which
