the semiclassical wave function to the harmonic oscillator problem also discussed earlier in this case there are two classical turning points and at which the semiclassical wave functions appropriate to the three regions two classically forbidden and one classically allowed are the first two decay exponentially within the two classically forbidden regions the third is a combination of the two independent solutions within the classically allowed region with the amplitudes of the two solutions defined by the coefficients and the amplitudes and multiply the wave functions in the two classically forbidden regions and all four amplitudes as well as the
