which the system moves from the left turning point to the right turning point and back again to the left turning point the contribution from integrating along this closed path is nb the sign is used for the first part of the path because the particle has positive momentum and the sign applies to the return part of the path when the particle has negative momentum which is exactly the action integral we treated earlier in this chapter when we computed for the classical harmonic oscillator the contribution from integrating along this closed path can be evaluated by first writing
