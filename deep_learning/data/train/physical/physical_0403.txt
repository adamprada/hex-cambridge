so there are two such contributions the net result is that our integral reduces to so the contribution to the integral of arising from to is equal to the integral from back to gives another factor or combining the integral of and the integral of multiplied by because gives the following final result if the original bohr quantization is applied to the integral of along a closed classical path our result above then says that which is the same as this means that the factor that arises in the action quantization condition for periodic motions between two turning points can
