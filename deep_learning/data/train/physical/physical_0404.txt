the classically allowed and forbidden regions the wave functions and and their first derivatives must be matched at and the wave functions and and their first derivatives must be matched at unfortunately the details of this matching process are rather complicated and require examining in more detail the nature of the wave functions near the classical turning points where each of and contain factors of the form in their denominators it should be clear that matching functions and their derivatives that contain such singularities pose special challenges i will not go further into this matter here rather i refer the
