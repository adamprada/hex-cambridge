with one another very much even if the gas is composed of molecules of different kinds the unimportance of moleculemolecule interactions means that the properties of one kind of molecules should be nearly independent of the properties of the other kinds consider a sample of gas that contains a fixed number of moles of each of two or more compounds this sample has a pressure a volume a temperature and a specified composition evidently the challenge here is to describe the pressure volume and temperature of the mixture in terms of measurable properties of the component compounds there is no
