a component partial volume meet this need we define the partial pressure of a component of a gas mixture as the pressure exerted by the same number of moles of the pure component when present in the volume occupied by the mixture at the temperature of the mixture in a mixture of moles of component moles of component etc it is customary to designate the partial pressure of component as it is important to appreciate that the partial pressure of a real gas can only be determined by experiment we define the partial volume of a component of a gas
