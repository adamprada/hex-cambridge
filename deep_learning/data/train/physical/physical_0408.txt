of the mixture is under conditions in which the ideal gas law is a good approximation to the behavior of the individual components daltons law is usually a good approximation to the behavior of real gas mixtures for mixtures of ideal gases it is exact to see this we recognize that for an ideal gas the definition of partial pressure becomes the idealgas mixture contains so that applied to the mixture the idealgas equation yields daltons law equation refdalton when is the mole fraction of a in a mixture of ideal gases gibbs phase rule last updated save as pdf
