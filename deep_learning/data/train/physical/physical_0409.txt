the symbol the number of components is the smallest number of pure chemical compounds that we can use to prepare the equilibrium system so that it contains an arbitrary amount of each phase the number of phases is given the symbol the relationship that gibbs found between and is called gibbs phase rule or just the phase rule the phase rule applies to equilibrium systems in which any component can move freely between any two phases in which that component is present we suppose that the state of the system is a continuous function of its state functions if intensive
