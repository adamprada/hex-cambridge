system whether it is open or closed a system containing only liquid water contains one component and one phase by adjusting the temperature and pressure of this system we can arrive at a state in which both liquid and solid are present for present purposes we think of this as a second system since the second system can be prepared using only liquid water or for that matter only ice it too contains only one component however since it contains both liquid and solid phases the second system contains two phases we see that the number of components required to
