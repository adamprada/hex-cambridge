general we can prepare a system like this by mixing any three substances chosen from the set acetic acid ethanol ethyl acetate and water hence there are three components the esterification reaction or its reverse then produces an equilibrium concentration of the fourth substance however there is a special case with only two components suppose that we require that the equilibrium concentrations of ethanol and acetic acid be exactly equal in this case we can prepare the system by mixing ethyl acetate and water then the stoichiometry of the reaction assures that the concentration condition will be met indeed this
