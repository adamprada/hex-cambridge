temperature and the componentconcentrations constitute a set of variables that must be related by an equation of state if we specify all but one of these variables the remaining variable is determined and can be calculated from the equation of state there are variables but the existence of the equation of state means that only of them can be changed independently evidently the number of degrees of freedom for a onephase system is to find the number of degrees of freedom when such phases are in equilibrium with one another requires a similar but more extensive analysis we first consider
