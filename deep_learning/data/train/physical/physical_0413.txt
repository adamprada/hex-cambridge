in any other phase there are variables for each phase or variables for all phases table displays these variables pressure temperature component component component c if the system is at equilibrium there are numerous relationships among these variables we want to know how many independent relationships there are among them each such relationship decreases by one the number of independent intensive variables that are needed to specify the state of the system when all of the phases are at equilibrium let us count these relationships the pressure must be the same in each phase that is etc since and implies
