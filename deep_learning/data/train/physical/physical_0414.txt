potential of species must be the same in each phase for the phases there are again independent relationships among the component concentration values this is true for each of the components so the total number of independent relationships among the concentrations is while every component need not be present in each phase there must be a finite amount of each phase present each phase must have a nonzero volume to express this requirement using intensive variables we can say that the sum of the concentrations in each phase must be greater than zero for phase we must have and so
