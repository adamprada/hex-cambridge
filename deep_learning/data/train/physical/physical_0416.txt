gas is kept but allowed to effuse through a small orifice in the wall the gas sample can be modeled using the kinetic molecular theory model as a collection of particles traveling throughout the cell colliding with one another and also with the wall if a small orifice is present any molecules that would collide with that portion of the wall will be lost through the orifice figure effusion of gas particles through an orifice cc bysa astrang this makes a convenient arrangement to measure the vapor pressure of the material inside the cell as the total mass lost by
