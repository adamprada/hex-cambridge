which occurs with one variable held constant for example the change can be achieved by the constantpressure sequence followed by the constantvolume sequence where is some intermediate temperature note that this sequence has to be possible with held constant specifying a change in is sufficient to determine the change in with held constant specifying a change in is sufficient to determine the change in let us consider how the energy of one mole of any pure substance changes with temperature at constant volume the rate of change of with is where we use the definition of for any system and
