energy of a monatomic ideal gas since the energy of a monatomic ideal gas is independent of pressure and volume the temperature derivative must be independent of pressure and volume the ordinary derivative and the partial derivatives at constant pressure and constant volume all describe the same thing which we have just seen is one mole of a monatomic ideal gas it is useful to extend the idea of an ideal gas to molecules that are not monatomic when we do so we have in mind molecules that do not interact significantly with one another another way of saying this
