only on temperature for any ideal gas we have one mole of any ideal gas however for polyatomic molecules it will no longer be true that let us see why recall that we construct our absolute temperature scale by extrapolating the charles law graph of volume versus temperature to zero volume figure by experiment we find that this graph is the same for one mole of a polyatomic ideal gas as it is for one mole of a monatomic ideal gas evidently our definition of temperature depends only on the translational energy of ideal gas molecules and viceversa at a
