energy the total amount of energy added must be greater we find that we need a larger to achieve the same which means that the heat capacity either or of the polyatomic ideal gas is greater than that of a monatomic ideal gas now let us consider the rate of change of with at constant pressure for one mole of any substance we have this equation is as far as we can go unless we can focus on a particular situation for which we know how work varies with temperature at constant pressure for one mole of an ideal gas
