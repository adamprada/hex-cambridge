capacity functions have a pivotal role in thermodynamics we consider many of their properties further in the next section and in later chapters particularly and because we want to use these properties before we get around to justifying them all let us summarize them now for monatomic ideal gases and are independent of temperature for polyatomic gases real or ideal and are functions of temperature is always greater than but as the temperature decreases their values converge and both vanish at absolute zero at ordinary temperatures and increase only slowly as temperature increases for many purposes they can be taken
