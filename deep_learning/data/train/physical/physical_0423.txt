constant over a range of temperatures is difficult because the direct measurement of is straightforward most heatcapacity experiments on solids measure in section we derive a general relationship between and other measurable properties of a substance this relationship makes it possible to evaluate indirectly for a solid this relationship shows that and are usually about the same heat capacities of solids have been investigated over wide temperature ranges for most solids is approximately constant at room temperature and above for any of the heavier elements this constant has about the same value this observation was first made in it is
