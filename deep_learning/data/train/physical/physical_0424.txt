per mole increases by a fixed increment for each atom of say carbon in the molecule by a different fixed increment for each atom of nitrogen in the molecule etc for the lighter elements the increments are less than for the heavier elements the increment is approximately as observed by dulong and petit figure heat capacity of solid rhombohedral mercury data from d r linde editor the handbook of chemistry and physics crc press th edition p as the temperature of any solid decreases its heat capacity eventually begins to decrease at temperatures near absolute zero the heat capacity approaches
