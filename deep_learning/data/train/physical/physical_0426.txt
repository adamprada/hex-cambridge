can be converted to work defines the efficiency of the engine the carnot cycle the carnot cycle is a theoretical cyclic heat engine that can used to examine what is possible for an engine for which the job is convert heat into work for simplicity all energy provided to the engine occurs isothermally and reversibly at a temperature and all of the energy lost to the surroundings also occurs isothermally and reversibly at temperature in order to insure this the system must change between the two temperatures adiabatically thus the cycle consists of four reversible legs two of which are
