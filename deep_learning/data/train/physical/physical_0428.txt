and volumes in chapter it was shown that the initial and final temperatures and volumes of an adiabatic expansion are related by or using the adiabatic expansion and compression legs ii and iv this requires that and since the second terms are reciprocals of one another the first terms must be as well a simple rearrangement shows that this is very convenient it is what allows for the simplification of the efficiency expression equation refeff becomes canceling terms in the numerator and denominator yields this expression gives the maximum efficiency and depends only on the high and low temperatures also
