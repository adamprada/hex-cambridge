of energy needed to remove j from the freezer and dissipate it into the room solution the efficiency is given by equation refeff and converting the temperatures to an absolute scale the efficiency can be calculated as this value can be used in the following manner so or it is interesting to note that any arbitrary closed cyclical process can be described as a sum of infinitesimally small carnot cycles and so all of the conclusions reached for the carnot cycle apply to any cyclical process contributors patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay
