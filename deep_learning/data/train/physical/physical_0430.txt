gas determines the rate at which the piston moves outward and thus the rate at which work is done on the environment does it matter whether the heattransfer process is fast or slow if the heat cost nothing would we care if our engine produced work only very slowly after all if we want more work and the heat is free we need only build more engines eventually we will have enough of them to produce any required amount of work of course heat is not free more significantly for our present considerations the engines are not free either engineers
