we are developing a new engine all else being equal we can decrease the capitalcost component of the work our engine produces by decreasing the time it needs to produce a unit of work the savings occurs because we can get the same amount of work from a smaller and hence lesscostly engine since each unit of work requires that the same amount of heat be moved we can make the engine smaller only if we can move heat around more quickly in internal combustion engines we get heat into the engineinternal combustion with a combustion reaction an explosion and
