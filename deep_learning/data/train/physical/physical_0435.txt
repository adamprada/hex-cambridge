if the liquid is stirred well any localized temperature excursions away from the equilibrium temperature are small it is a good approximation to say that the temperature of the system is homogenous throughout the system and that it has a constant value nevertheless for a finite boiling rate we recognize that the idea of an isothermal process is indeed an approximation for heat transfer to occur from the surroundings to the system the surroundings must be at a higher temperature than the system the portion of the system in immediate contact with the wall of the vessel must be at
