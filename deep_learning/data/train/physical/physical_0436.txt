of the surroundings initially the surroundings must be hotter than the system to reverse the direction of heat flow we must make the temperature of the surroundings less than that of the system since a reversible process is one whose direction can be reversed by an arbitrarily small change in some state function the original temperatures must be arbitrarily close to one another for a system that exchanges heat with its surroundings a process can be reversible only if the temperatures of the system and the surroundings are arbitrarily close to one another in a reversible process net heat transfer
