with the power and speed of computers growing as fast as they are it is likely that these highend methods will be more and more widely used as time goes by quantum montecarlo in this method one first rewrites the time dependent schrödinger equation for negative imaginary values of the time variable ie one simply replaces by this gives which is analogous to the wellknown diffusion equation the rewritten schrödinger equation can be viewed as a diffusion equation in the spatial coordinates of the electrons with a diffusion coefficient that is related to the electrons mass me by the socalled
