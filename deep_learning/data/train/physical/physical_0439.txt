to be negative and imaginary causes the electronic schrödinger equation to look like a dimensional diffusion equation why is this useful and why does this trick work it is useful because as we see in chapter of this text montecarlo methods are highly efficient tools for solving certain equations it turns out that the diffusion equation is one such case so the quantum montecarlo approach can be used to solve the imaginarytime schrödinger equation even for systems containing many electrons but what does this imaginary time mean to understand the imaginary time trick let us recall that any wave function
