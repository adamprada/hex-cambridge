t be dominated by its lowestenergy component in this way the quantum montecarlo propagation method can generate a wave function in dimensions that approaches the groundstate wave function it has turned out that this approach which tackles the electron correlation problem headon has proven to yield highly accurate energies and wave functions that display the proper cusps near nuclei as well as the negative cusps ie the wave function vanishes whenever two electrons coordinates approach one another finally it turns out that by using a starting function of a given symmetry and nodal structure this method can be extended to
