this chapter to represent all of the correlations among the electrons an example of such an explicitly correlated wave function is which consists of an antisymmetrized product of spinorbitals multiplied by a factor that is symmetric under interchange of any pair of electrons and contains the electronelectron distances in addition to a single variational parameter such a trial function is said to contain linear correlation factors of course it is possible to write many other forms for such an explicitly correlated trial function for example one could use as a trial function both the linear and the exponential forms have
