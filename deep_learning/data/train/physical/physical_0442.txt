a general relationship for the pressuredependence of a systems enthalpy this evaluates to zero for an ideal gas and to a negligible quantity for many other systems for liquids and solids information on the variation of volume with temperature is collected in tables as the coefficient of thermal expansion where consequently the dependence of enthalpy on pressure is given by for ice and the molar volume near c is the enthalpy change for compressing one mole of ice from the sublimation pressure to atm is to find the enthalpy change for expanding one mole of water vapor at c from
