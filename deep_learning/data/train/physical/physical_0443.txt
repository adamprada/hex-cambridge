at these different temperatures it is just a matter of repeating the same calculation at each temperature we often need to find the enthalpy change associated with increasing the temperature of a substance at constant pressure as we observe in this enthalpy change is readily calculated by integrating the heat capacity over the temperature change we may want to know for example the enthalpy change for increasing the temperature of one mole of methane from k to k with the pressure held constant at one bar in table we find we might be tempted to think that the difference represents
