hydrogen and methane are approximated by with values of and given in table from this information we calculate the enthalpy change for increasing the temperature of one mole of each substance from k to k at bar and thus from the cycle we calculate the tabulated value is the two values differ by or about this difference arises from the limitations of the twoparameter heatcapacity equations as another example of a thermochemical cycle let us consider the selective oxidation of methane to methanol at k and k from the enthalpies of formation in table we calculate the enthalpies for the
