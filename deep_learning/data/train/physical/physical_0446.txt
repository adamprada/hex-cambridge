forming the molecular orbitals mos as linear combinations of the atomic orbitals aos ca on the constituent atoms and we express this mathematically as follows where the are called linear combination of atomic orbital to form molecular orbital lcaomo coefficients the mos are supposed to be solutions to the schr√∂dinger equation in which the hamiltonian h involves the kinetic energy of the electron as well as the potentials and detailing its attraction to the left and right atomic centers this oneelectron hamiltonian is only an approximation for describing molecular orbitals more rigorous nelectron treatments will be discussed in chapter in
