entering into the above set of linear equations as follows the diagonal integral involving the ao centered on the right atom and labeled is assumed to be equivalent to which means that net attraction of this orbital to the left atomic center is neglected moreover this integral is approximated in terms of the binding energy denoted not to be confused with the electron spin function a for an electron that occupies the orbital the physical meaning of is the kinetic energy of the electron in plus the attraction of this electron to the right atomic center while it resides in
