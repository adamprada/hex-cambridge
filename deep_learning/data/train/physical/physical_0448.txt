magnitude of is assumed to be proportional to the overlap between the two aos it turns out that is usually a negative quantity which can be seen by writing it as since is an eigenfunction of having the eigenvalue the first term is equal to a negative quantity times the overlap the second quantity is equal to the integral of the overlap density multiplied by the negative coulomb potential for attractive interaction of the electron with the left atomic center so whenever and have positive overlap b will turn out negative iii finally in the most elementary h√ºckel or tightbinding
