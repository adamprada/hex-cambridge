hand side the above set of equations reduces to the third set displayed earlier it is known from matrix algebra that such a set of linear homogeneous equations ie having zeros on the right hand sides can have nontrivial solutions ie values of that are not simply zero only if the determinant of the matrix on the left side vanishes setting this determinant equal to zero gives a quadratic equation in which the e values are the unknowns this quadratic equation can be factored into a product which has two solutions as discussed earlier it turns out that the b
