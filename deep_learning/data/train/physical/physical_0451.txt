chemical bonds that is the antibonding orbital is more antibonding than the bonding orbital i bonding this is another important thing to keep in mind because its effects pervade chemical bonding and spectroscopy having noted the effect of inclusion of ao overlap effects in the hückel model i should admit that it is far more common to utilize the simplified version of the hückel model in which the s factors are ignored in so doing one obtains patterns of mo orbital energies that do not reflect the asymmetric splitting in bonding and antibonding orbitals noted above however this simplified approach
