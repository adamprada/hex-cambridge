equation and obtain two equations for and these two equations are clearly not independent either one can be solved for one c in terms of the other c to give which means that the bonding mo is the final unknown cl is obtained by noting that f is supposed to be a normalized function within this version of the h√ºckel model in which the overlap s is neglected the normalization of f leads to the following condition with the final result depending on assuming that each c is itself also normalized so finally we know that and hence the bonding
