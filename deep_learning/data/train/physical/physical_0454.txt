then set up the x hückel matrix appropriate to the two candidate structures left beginarrayccc alpha beta beta alpha beta beta alpha endarray right for the linear structure nb the zeros arise because and do not overlap and thus have no coupling matrix element alternatively for the triangular structure we find left beginarrayccc alpha beta beta beta alpha beta beta beta alpha endarray right as the hückel matrix each of these x matrices will have three eigenvalues that we obtain by subtracting e from their diagonals and setting the determinants of the resulting matrices to zero for the linear case
