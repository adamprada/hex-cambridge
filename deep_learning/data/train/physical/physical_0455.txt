one into the second orbital doing so produces a electron state with a total energy of alternatively for the triangular species we put two electrons into the lowest mo and one into either of the degenerate mos resulting in a electron state with total energy because b is a negative quantity the total energy of the triangular structure is lower than that of the linear structure since the above example illustrates how we can use h√ºckel or tightbinding theory to make qualitative predictions eg which of two shapes is likely to be of lower energy notice that all one needs
