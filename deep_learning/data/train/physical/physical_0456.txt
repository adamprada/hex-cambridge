atomic orbitals rather than in terms of primitive atomic orbitals as we did earlier for example for linear we could use the following symmetryadapted functions both of which are even under reflection through the symmetry plane and which is odd under reflection the x hückel matrix would then have the form left beginarrayccc alpha sqrtbeta sqrtbeta alpha alpha endarray right for example and are evaluated as follows the three eigenvalues of the above hückel matrix are easily seen to be and exactly as we found earlier so it is not necessary to go through the process of forming symmetryadapted functions
