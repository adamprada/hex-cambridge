property of this molecule clearly as illustrated in figure a at its equilibrium geometry the ethylene molecule has a plane of symmetry denoted that maps nuclei and electrons from its left to its right and vice versa this is the symmetry element that could used to decompose the h√ºckel matrix describing the and orbitals into two x matrices however if any of the four ch bond lengths or hch angles is displaced from its equilibrium value in a manner that destroys the perfect symmetry of this molecule or if one of the ch units were replaced by a cch unit
