plane as it does to the right and the antibonding orbital will have the opposite sign to the left as it does to the right but the magnitudes of these two orbitals will not be leftright equal this is an example of the concept of approximate symmetry it shows that one can use symmetry even when it is not perfect to predict the nodal patterns of molecular orbitals and it is the nodal patterns that govern the relative energies of orbitals as we have seen time and again lets see if you can do some of this on your own
