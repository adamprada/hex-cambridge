figure now i want to show you how to broaden your horizons and use tightbinding theory to describe all of the bonds in a more complicated molecule such as ethylene shown in figure what is different about this kind of molecule when compared with metallic or conjugated species is that the bonding can be described in terms of several pairs of valence orbitals that couple to form twocenter bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals within the h√ºckel model described above each pair of orbitals that touch or overlap gives rise to a x matrix more correctly all n of the constituent
