is based on approximations and involves neglecting certain terms in the schr√∂dinger equation for example it predicts see above that ethylene has four energetically identical ch bonding mos and four degenerate ch antibonding mos however this is not what is seen when photoelectron spectra are used to probe the energies of these mos likewise it suggests that methane has four equivalent ch bonding and antibonding orbitals which again is not true it turns out that in each of these two cases ethylene and methane the experiments indicate a grouping of four nearly isoenergetic bonding mos and four nearly isoenergetic antibonding
