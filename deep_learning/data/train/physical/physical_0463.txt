itself the righthand side of this equation is a function of only it contains no or dependence lets call the entire right hand side to emphasize this fact to further separate the and dependence we multiply by and subtract the derivative terms from both sides to obtain now we have separated the dependence from the and r dependence we now introduce the procedure used to separate variables in differential equations and assume y can be written as a function of times a function of and dividing by we obtain now all of the dependence is isolated on the left hand
