separations of variables method in partial differential equations for the above example we therefore can set both sides equal to a socalled separation constant that we call it will become clear shortly why we have chosen to express the constant in the form of minus the square of an integer you may recall that we studied this same equation earlier and learned how the integer arises via the boundary condition that and represent identical geometries the equation the resulting equation reads the symbol is used to represent second derivative this equation should be familiar because it is the equation that
