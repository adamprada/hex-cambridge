the boundary conditions on the wave function here is restricted to certain discrete values because the wave function must be such that when you rotate through about the zaxis you must get back what you started with the equation now returning to the equation in which the dependence was isolated from the and dependence and rearranging the terms to the lefthand side we have fracsinthetafracpartial partial theta leftsinthetafracpartial qpartialtheta right fracmqsintheta frq in this equation we have separated the and terms so we can further decompose the wave function by introducing which yields fracthetasinthetafracpartial partial theta leftsinthetafracpartial thetapartialtheta right fracmsintheta
