can look for polynomial solutions for because is restricted to be less than unity in magnitude if we first let p sumkakzk and substitute into the differential equation to obtain equating like powers of gives note that for large values of since the coefficients do not decrease with for large this series will diverge for unless it truncates at finite order this truncation only happens if the separation constant obeys where is an integer you can see this from the recursion relation giving in terms of only for certain values of will the numerator vanish so once again we see
