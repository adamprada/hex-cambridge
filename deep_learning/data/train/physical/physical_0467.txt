for the series truncates after one term and results in for the same thing applies and for so one obtains and so on these polynomials are called legendre polynomials and are denoted for the more general case where one can proceed as above to generate a polynomial solution for the function doing so results in the following solutions these functions are called associated legendre polynomials and they constitute the solutions to the problem for nonzero values the above and functions when reexpressed in terms of and yield the full angular part of the wave function for any centrosymmetric potential these
