earlier give clear signatures of the angular or rotational energy content of the wave function these angular nodes originate in the oscillatory nature of the legendre and associated legendre polynomials the higher is the more sign changes occur within the polynomial the equation let us now turn our attention to the radial equation which is the only place that the explicit form of the potential appears using our earlier results for the equation obeyed by the function and specifying to be the coulomb potential appropriate for an electron in the field of a nucleus of charge yields we can simplify
