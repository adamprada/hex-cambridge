of into the above equation and keep only the terms with the largest power of ie the term and we allow the derivatives in the above differential equation to act on upon so doing we obtain the equation which leads us to conclude that the exponent in the large behavior of s is having found the small and large behaviors of we can take to have the following form to interpolate between large and small rvalues where the function is expanded in an infinite power series in as again substituting this expression for into the above equation we obtain and
