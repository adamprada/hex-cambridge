is in the continuum the argument that the series must truncate to avoid an exponentially diverging function no longer applies thus we see a key difference between bound with real and continuum with r imaginary states in the former case the boundary condition of nondivergence arises in the latter it does not because does not diverge if is imaginary to truncate at a polynomial of order we must have this implies that the quantity s introduced previously is restricted to which is certainly an integer let us call this integer if we label states in order of increasing we see
