high in three regions near peaks in p and low in two regions of course this conclusion about the form of is nonsense and again illustrates how one must not be drawn into trying to think of the classical motion of the particle especially for quantum states with small quantum number in fact the low quantum number states of such oneelectron atoms and ions have their radial plots focused in regions of rspace where the potential is most attractive ie largest in magnitude finally we note that the energy quantization does not arise for states lying in the continuum because
