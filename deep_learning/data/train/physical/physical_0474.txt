of the laguerre polynomials summary to summarize the quantum numbers and arise through boundary conditions requiring that be normalizable ie not diverge and the radial equation which is the only place the potential energy enters is found to possess both boundstates ie states whose energies lie below the asymptote at which the potential vanishes and the kinetic energy is zero and continuum states lying energetically above this asymptote the former states are spatially confined by the potential but the latter are not the resulting hydrogenic wave functions angular and radial and energies are summarized on pp in the text by
