figure radial potential for hydrogenic atoms and bound and continuum orbital energies the solutions of this oneelectron problem form the qualitative basis for much of atomic and molecular orbital theory for this reason the reader is encouraged to gain a firmer understanding of the nature of the radial and angular parts of these wave functions the orbitals that result are labeled by and quantum numbers for the bound states and by and quantum numbers and the energy for the continuum states much as the particleinabox orbitals are used to qualitatively describe p electrons in conjugated polyenes these socalled hydrogenlike orbitals
