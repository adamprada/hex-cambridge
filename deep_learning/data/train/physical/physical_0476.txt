two orbitals with two orbitals with and two orbitals with in forming the full sixelectron wave function of the lowestenergy state of carbon it should be noted that the use of screened nuclear charges as just discussed is different from the use of a quantum defect parameter d as discussed regarding rydberg orbitals in chapter the screened charge for carbons and orbitals is attempting to represent the effect of the innershell electrons on the and orbitals the modification of the principal quantum number made by replacing by represents the penetration of the orbital with nominal quantum number inside its innershells
