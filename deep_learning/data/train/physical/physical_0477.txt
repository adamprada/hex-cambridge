changes we use and to represent incremental changes to represent macroscopic changes we use and since two processes can effect different changes in the surroundings while the change that occurs in the system is the same and are not completely determined by the change in the state of the system neither the internal nor the external entropy change depends solely on the change in the state of the system nevertheless we see that or is an alternative expression of the thermodynamic criteria the external entropy change is that part of the entropy change that results from the interaction between the
