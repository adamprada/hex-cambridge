course possible for a spontaneous process to have while and in section we introduce a quantity that we can think of as a change in the chemical potential energy of a system the internal entropy change is closely related to this quantity we find as required by the properties of we find that is an expression of the thermodynamic criteria for change internal entropy is a useful concept that is applied to particular advantage in the analysis of many different kinds of spontaneous processes in nonhomogeneous systems intrinsic reaction paths last updated save as pdf page id contributed by jack
