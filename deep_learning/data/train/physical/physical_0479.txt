to either reactants or products a unit vector along is one direction a unit vector along is the second step one takes a small step ie a displacement of the cartesian coordinates of the nuclei having a total length along the direction and this direction is taken to define the first step along the intrinsic reaction coordinate irc that will eventually lead to the irp when is expressed in terms of the its components along the cartesian coordinates the displacements can be expressed as deltaqj l sjlabelb step one reevaluates the gradient and hessian at this new geometry call it
