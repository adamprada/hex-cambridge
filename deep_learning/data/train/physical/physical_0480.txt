mode this energy minimization transverse to is designed to constrain the walk downhill from the ts at or near the minimum in the streambed along which the irc is evolving after this energy minimization step the cartesian coordinates will be defined as step at one reevaluates the gradient and hessian and proceeds as in step c above this process is continued generating a series of geometries that define points on the irc at each of these geometries the gradient will have its largest component excluding at the ts where all components vanish along the direction of because the energy minimization
