downhill in energy after which the energy is minimized along the modes transverse to this process is continued until the magnitude of the gradient which always points along s becomes small enough that one can claim to have reached a minimum step the process described above will lead from the ts to either the reactants or products and will define one branch of the irp to find the other branch one returns to step b and begins the entire process again but now taking the first small step in the opposite direction ie along the negative of the eigenvector of
