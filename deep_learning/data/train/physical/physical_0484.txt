a process can be spontaneous even if it happens very slowly unfortunately thermodynamics is silent on the topic of how fast processes will occur but is provides us with a powerful toolbox for predicting which processes will be spontaneous but in order to make these predictions a new thermodynamic law and variable is needed since the first law which defined and is insufficient consider the following processes with with both reactions will occur spontaneously but one is exothermic and the other endothermic so while it is intuitive to think that an exothermic process will be spontaneous there is clearly more
