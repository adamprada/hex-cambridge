an ideal gas depends only on the temperature a constant temperature implies constant energy so that using the equation we find for in the previous section we have qrevwrevrt ln fracvv ideal gas isothermal reversible expansion where and are the initial and final volumes respectively since enthalpy is defined as we have for the spontaneous isothermal expansion of an ideal gas from to against a constant applied pressure we again have these are state functions and the amounts by which they change in this spontaneous process must be the same as those for the reversible process between the same two
