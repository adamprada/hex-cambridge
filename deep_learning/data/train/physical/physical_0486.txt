some molecules will be traveling faster and some more slowly it is also important to recognize that the most probable average and rms kinetic energy terms that can be derived from the kinetic molecular theory do not depend on the mass of the molecules table as such it can be concluded that the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a thermalized sample of gas depends only on the temperature however the average speed depends on the molecular mass so for a given temperature light molecules will travel faster on average than heavier molecules table kinetic properties of a thermalized
