distribution of velocities for a thermalized sample of gas is described by the maxwellboltzmann distribution law the next development will be to use the kinetic molecular theory to describe molecular collisions which are essential events in many chemical reactions collisions with the wall in the derivation of an expression for the pressure of a gas it is useful to consider the frequency with which gas molecules collide with the walls of the container to derive this expression consider the expression for the collision volume all of the molecules within this volume and with a velocity such that the xcomponent exceeds
