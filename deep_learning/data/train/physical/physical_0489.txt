their standard states with the other pathway involves a series of steps that take the elements from neutral species in their standard states to ions in the gas phase with with with with with it should be clear that when added after proper manipulation if needed the second set of reactions yield the first reaction because of this the total enthalpy changes must all add this can be depicted graphically the advantage being that arrows can be used to indicate endothermic or exothermic changes an example of the bornhaber cycle for nacl is shown below figure the bornhaber cycle for
