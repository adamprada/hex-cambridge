chateliers principle enables us to predict the spontaneous change that occurs definition le chateliers principle if a change is imposed on the state of a system at equilibrium the system adjusts to reach a new equilibrium state in doing so the system undergoes a spontaneous change that opposes the imposed change le chateliers principle is useful and it is worthwhile to learn to apply it the principle places no limitations on the nature of the imposed change or on the number of thermodynamic variables that might change as the system responds however since our reasoning based on the principle is
