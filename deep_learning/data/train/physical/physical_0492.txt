of a pure compound we suppose that the vial and its contents are at a single temperature and that the liquid and the vapor are in equilibrium with one another at this temperature what will happen if we now thermostat the vial at some new and greater temperature we see that the imposed change is an increase in temperature or equivalently an addition of heat to the system the system cannot respond by decreasing its temperature because the temperature change is the imposed change similarly it cannot respond by changing its volume because the system volume is fixed evidently the
