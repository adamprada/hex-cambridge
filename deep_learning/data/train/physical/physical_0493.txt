thermally isolated cylinder that is closed by a piston we ask what will happen if we decrease the volume that is the imposed change is a step decrease in volume accompanied by an increase in pressure the new volume is fixed but the pressure is free to adjust to a new value at the new equilibrium position the principle asserts that the system will respond so as to decrease its pressure decreasing the system pressure is accomplished by condensing vapor to liquid which is accompanied by the release of the latent heat of vaporization since we suppose that the system
