to its original pressure and original temperature albeit with fewer moles of the substance present in the gas phase icewater equilibrium suppose that we have a closed system consisting of ice in equilibrium with liquid water at some temperature and pressure what will happen if we impose an increase in the temperature this system we suppose that the system occupies a container of fixed volume initially it is at equilibrium with a constanttemperature bath we impose the change by moving the container to a new bath whose temperature is higherbut not high enough to melt all of the ice the
