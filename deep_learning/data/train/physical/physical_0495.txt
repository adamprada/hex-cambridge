a piston and ask how the system must respond if we impose a step decrease in its volume we impose the volume decrease by applying additional force to the piston the imposed step change in the volume is accompanied by an increase in the system pressure the new volume is fixed but the system pressure can adjust the principle asserts that the system will respond by decreasing its pressure the system pressure will decrease if some of the ice melts melting ice consumes heat since we are now assuming that the system is thermally isolated this heat cannot come from
