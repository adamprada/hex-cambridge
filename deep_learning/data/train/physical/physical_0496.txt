some temperature and that we seek to increase the pressure while maintaining the temperature constant we can imagine that the system is contained in a cylinder that is closed by a piston the cylinder is immersed in a constanttemperature bath we increase the pressure by applying additional force to the piston as in the examples above we view this as a step change in volume that is accompanied by an increase of the pressure to a transitory nonequilibrium value the principle asserts that the system will respond by undergoing a change that opposes this pressure increase the system can reduce
