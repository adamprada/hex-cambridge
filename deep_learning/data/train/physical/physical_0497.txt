any equilibrium system would cause the system to run away from that original position since no real system can be maintained at a perfectly constant set of conditions any real system could undergo spontaneous change equilibrium would be unattainable if we assume that a system must behave oppositely to the way that is predicted by le chateliers principle we arrive at a prediction that contradicts our experience le chateliers principle is inherently qualitative we will discuss it further after we develop the thermodynamic criteria for equilibrium we will find that the thermodynamic criteria for equilibrium tell us quantitatively how two
