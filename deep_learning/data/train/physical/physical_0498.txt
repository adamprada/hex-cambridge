remains normalized gives this is a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem that we can write in matrix notation as it is called a generalized eigenvalue problem because of the appearance of the overlap matrix on its right hand side this set of equations for the coefficients can be made into a conventional eigenvalue problem as follows the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the overlap matrix are found by solving all of the eigenvalues are positive because is a positivedefinite matrix next one forms the matrix whose elements are another matrix can be formed in a similar way replacing with one then multiplies
