it turns out that the solutions offer more than just an upper bound to the lowest true energy of the hamiltonian it can be shown that the nth eigenvalue of the matrix is an upper bound to the true energy of the nth state of the hamiltonian a consequence of this is that between any two eigenvalues of the matrix there is at least one true energy of the hamiltonian this observation is often called the bracketing condition the ability of linear variational methods to provide estimates to the ground and excitedstate energies from a single calculation is one of
