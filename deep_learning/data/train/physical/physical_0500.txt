change along some continuous path in the plane we can specify such a path as a function where is a constant or as whether the differential is exact or inexact we can sum up increments of change along short segments of the path to find the change in between and let and be two neighboring points on the curve as the system traverses between these points the change in is if we sum up such increments of along the curve from to the sum approximates the change in along this path in the limit that all of the incremental and
