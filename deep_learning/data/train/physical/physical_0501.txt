on the values of at the end points of the integration path the line integral of the total differential is independent of the path it follows that the line integral of an exact differential around any closed path must be zero a circle in the middle of the integral sign is often used to indicate that the line integral is being taken around a closed path in this notation writing indicates that is exact and is a state function in concept the evaluation of line integrals is straightforward since the path of integration is a line the integrand involves only
