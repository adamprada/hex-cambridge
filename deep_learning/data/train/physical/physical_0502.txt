the path can always be expressed as a parametric function of a dummy variable that is we can always find functions and such that and then substitution converts the differential expression into a function of integration of this expression from to gives while the line integral of an exact differential between two points is independent of the path of integration this not the case for an inexact differential for an inexact differential the integral between two points depends on the path of integration to illustrate these ideas let us consider some examples these examples illustrate methods for finding the integral
