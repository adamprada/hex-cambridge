a larger mole fraction in the vapor phase than in the liquid phase this is summarized in the following theoretical diagram for an ideal mixture of two compounds one having a pure vapor pressure of and the other having a pure vapor pressure of in figure the liquid phase is represented at the top of the graph where the pressure is higher figure the liquid phase is represented at the top of the graph where the pressure is higher oftentimes it is desirable to depict the phase diagram at a single pressure so that temperature and composition are the variables
