by and a vapor phase indicated with a composition indicated by the relative amounts of material in each phase can be described by the lever rule as described previously further if the vapor with composition is condensed the temperature is lowered to that indicated by point b and revaporized the new vapor will have the composition consistent with this demonstrates how the more volatile liquid the one with the lower boiling temperature which is a in the case of the above diagram can be purified from the mixture by collecting and reevaporating fractions of the vapor if the liquid was
