the recognition that threedimensional probabilitydensity functions can be expressed as products of independent onedimensional functions and that and are the constants and now because the probability density associated with any given velocity is just a number that is independent of the coordinate system we can equate the threedimensional probabilitydensity functions for cartesian and spherical coordinates so that we take the partial derivative of this last equation with respect to the probability densities and are independent of however is a function of because we find since and making this substitution and dividing by the original equation gives cancellation and rearrangement of
