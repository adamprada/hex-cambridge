the probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity becomes this is the result we want except that it contains the unknown parameters and the value of must be such as to make the integral over all velocities equal to unity we require so that where we use the definite integral see appendix d the scalarvelocity function in the threedimensional probabilitydensity function becomes the probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity becomes the threedimensional probability density in spherical coordinates becomes the probability that an arbitrarily selected molecule has a velocity vector whose magnitude lies between and while its component lies between and and
