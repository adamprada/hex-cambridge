of heat that raised the temperature of one gram of water one degree kelvin the amount of heat exchanged by a known amount of water could then be calculated from the amount by which the temperature of the water changed if for example introducing g mole of copper metal initially at k into g of water initially at k resulted in thermal equilibrium at k the water surrendered this amount of heat was taken up by the copper so that cal was required to increase the temperature of one gram of copper by one degree k given this information the
