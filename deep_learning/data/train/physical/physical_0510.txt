defined as exactly this definition assumes that heat and work are both forms of energy this assumption is an intrinsic element of the first law of thermodynamics this aspect of the first law is of course just a restatement of joules original idea when we want to measure the heat added to a system measuring the temperature increase that occurs is often the most convenient method if we know the temperature increase in the system and we know the temperature increase that accompanies the addition of one unit of heat we can calculate the heat input to the system evidently
