each addition and plot heat versus temperature figure shows such a plot in experiments like this it is often convenient to introduce the heat by passing a known electrical current through a known resistance immersed in the substance the rate at which heat is produced is except for the usually negligible amount that goes into warming the resistor all of it is transferred to the substance at any particular temperature the slope of the graph is the increment of heat input divided by the incremental temperature increase this slope is so useful it is given a name it is the
