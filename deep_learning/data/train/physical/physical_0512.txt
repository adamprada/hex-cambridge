are most conveniently done with the system at a constant pressure however the heat capacity at constant volume plays an important role in our theoretical development the heat capacity is denoted when the pressure is constant and when the volume is constant we have the important definitions and since no pressurevolume work can be done when the volume is constant less heat is required to effect a given temperature change and we have as a general result in we consider this point further if the system contains a gas the effect of the volume increase can be substantial for a
