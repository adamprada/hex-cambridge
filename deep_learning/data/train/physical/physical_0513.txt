that work is done on a system we mean that the energy of the system increases because of some nonthermal interaction between the system and its surroundings the amount of work done on a system is determined by the nonthermal energy change in its surroundings we define work as the scalar product of a vector representing an applied force and a second vector representing the displacement of the object to which the force is applied the definition is independent of whether the process is reversible or not if the force is a function of the displacement we have pressurevolume work
