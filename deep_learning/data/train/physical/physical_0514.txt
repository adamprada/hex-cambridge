a displacement normal to the area the work is we can find the general relationship between work and the change in the volume of a system by supposing that the system is confined within a cylinder closed by a piston see figure the surroundings apply pressure to the system by applying force to the piston we suppose that the motion of the piston is frictionless figure pressurevolume work the system occupies the volume enclosed by the piston if the crosssectional area of the cylinder is and the system occupies a length the magnitude of the systems volume is if an
