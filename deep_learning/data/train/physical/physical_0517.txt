for an arbitrary form of nonpressurevolume work let us use to represent this variable we can think of as a generalized displacement when there is an incremental change in this variable there is a corresponding change in the energy of the system for a displacement let the increase in the energy of the system be the energy increase also depends on the magnitude of the force that must be applied to the system parallel to the displacement let this force be then for this arbitrary abstract process we have or since is the contribution to the incremental change in the
