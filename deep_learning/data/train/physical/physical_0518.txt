and the potential is the negative of the pressure for gravitational work the characteristic variable is elevation for a given system the potential depends on the gravitational acceleration and the mass of the system when a process changes the composition of a system it is often important to relate the work done on the system to the composition change formally we express the incremental work resulting from the th generalized displacement as where and are the incremental changes in the work done on the system and the number of moles of the substance in the system to see how this
