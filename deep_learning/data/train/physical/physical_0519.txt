of electrical potential the energy change that occurs when a charge passes through a potential difference is we have evidently charge is the characteristic variable for electrical work we have and letting the magnitude of the electron charge be electrons carry charge then the magnitude of the charge carried by one mole of electrons is the faraday that is see letting be the number of moles of electrons we have and so that the work done when moles of electrons pass through the potential difference becomes we find the work done when ions pass through a potential difference by essentially
