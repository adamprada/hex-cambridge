this overall equation we can write down three that are reasonably simple and plausible the could be broken first and the bond formed thereafter alternatively the bond could be formed first and the bond broken thereafter in the first case we have an intermediate species of reduced coordination number and in the second we have an intermediate of increased coordination number finally we can suppose that the bondforming and bondbreaking steps occur simultaneously so that no intermediate species is formed at all heterolytic bondbreaking precedes bondmaking bondmaking precedes bondbreaking bondbreaking and bondmaking are simultaneous the distinction between mechanism b and
