an independent existence for this distinction to be meaningful we must have a criterion that establishes the shortest lifetime we are willing to associate with real molecules it might seem that any minimum lifetime we pick must be wholly arbitrary fortunately this is not the case there is a natural definition for a minimum molecular lifetime the definition arises from the fact that molecules undergo vibrational motions if a collection of atoms retains a particular relative orientation for such a short time that it never undergoes a motion that we would recognize as a vibration it lacks an essential characteristic
