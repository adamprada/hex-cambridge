called an activated complex or a transition state for the reaction and a superscript double dagger is conventionally used to signal that a structure has this character the distinction between a bona fide intermediate and a transition state is clear enough in principle but it can be very difficult to establish experimentally these considerations justify our earlier definition an elementary reaction is one in which there are no intermediates any atomic arrangement that occurs during an elementary reaction does not persist long enough to vibrate before the arrangement goes on to become products or reverts to reactants an elementary reaction
