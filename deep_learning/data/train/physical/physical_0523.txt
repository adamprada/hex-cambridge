occur as a single elementary process for example the reaction can not plausibly occur in a single collision of three ferrous ions one chromate ion and seven hydronium ions it is just too unlikely that all of these species could find themselves in the same place at the same time in the proper orientation and with sufficient energy to react in such cases the stoichiometric mechanism must be a series of elementary steps for this reaction a skeletal representation of one plausible series is microscopic reversibility and the second law last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul
