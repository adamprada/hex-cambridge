mechanisms it does not assert that the numerical value of this function is necessarily the same for each of the mechanisms however that these numerical values must be equal follows directly when we introduce another of our most basic observations no matter how many mechanisms may be available to a reaction in a particular system the concentration of any reagent can have only one value in an equilibrium state at equilibrium etc therefore the numerical values of the equilibrium constants must be the same the uniqueness of the equilibrium composition is a fundamental feature of our ideas about what chemical
