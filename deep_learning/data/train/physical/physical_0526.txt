moves outward doing work on the surroundings when the catalyst container is open reaction occurs according to and the piston moves inward figure shows these changes schematically at the end of a cycle the machine is in exactly the same state as it was in the beginning and the temperature of the reaction mixture is the same at the end of a cycle as it was at the beginning by connecting the piston to a load we can do net work on the load as the machine goes through a cycle for example if we connect the piston to a
