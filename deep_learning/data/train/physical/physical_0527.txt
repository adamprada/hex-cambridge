machine maintained at a constant temperature if energy is conserved the machine must absorb heat from the bath during the cycle otherwise the machine would be doing work with no offsetting consumption of energy this would be a violation of the first law of thermodynamics see sections from experience we know that this machine cannot function in the manner we have described this experience is embodied in the second law of thermodynamics we know that it is impossible to construct a machine that operates in a cycle exchanges heat with its surroundings at only one temperature and produces work in
