reversibility asserts that a unique function of concentrations characterizes the equilibrium state for any reaction mechanism but does not require that every mechanism reach the same state at equilibrium this statement of the second law implies that a reactions equilibrium composition unique but it does not specify a law relating the equilibrium concentrations of the reacting species in chapters and we see that by augmenting this statement of the second law with some additional ideas we are led to a more rigorous statement from which we are eventually able to infer the same functional form for the equilibrium constant microscopic
