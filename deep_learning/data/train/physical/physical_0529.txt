equilibrium state implies either microscopic reversibility or the second law also even though the principle of microscopic reversibility is inferred from the laws of mechanics our development of the equilibrium constant relationshipwhich we do view as a law of thermodynamicsdepends on our equations for the rates of elementary reactions our rate equations are not logical consequences of the laws of motion rather they follow from assumptions we make about the average behavior of systems that contain many molecules consequently we should not suppose that we have deduced a thermodynamic result the condition for chemical equilibrium solely from the laws of
