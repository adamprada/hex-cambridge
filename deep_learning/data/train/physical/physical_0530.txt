timeduration so it is not designed to compute the rates at which events take place if one is interested in simulating such dynamical processes even when the nmolecule system is at or near equilibrium it is more appropriate to carry out a classical molecular dynamics md simulation in such an md calculation one has to assign initial values for each of the internal and external coordinates of each of the molecules and an initial value of the kinetic energy or momentum for each coordinate after which a timepropagation algorithm generates values for the coordinates and momenta at later times for
