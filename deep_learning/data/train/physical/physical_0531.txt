set of such initial coordinates and momenta to generate a single trajectory rather one creates an ensemble of initial coordinates and momenta designed to represent the experimental conditions the md calculation is to simulate the time evolution of the system for each set of initial conditions is then followed using md and various outcomes eg reactive events barrier crossings folding or unfolding events chemisorption ocurrences etc are monitored throughout each md simulation an average over the ensemble of trajectories is then used in computing averages and creating histograms for the md simulation it is the purpose of this section to
