momenta for example the widely used verlet algorithm is derived as follows one expands the value of the coordinate at the and time steps in taylor series in terms of values at the st time step one adds these two expansions to obtain which allows one to compute in terms of and and the force at the step while not requiring knowledge of velocities if the two taylor expansions are subtracted one obtains as the expression for the velocity at the time step in terms of the coordinates at the and steps there are many other such propagation schemes that
