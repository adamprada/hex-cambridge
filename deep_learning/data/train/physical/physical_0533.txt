of an empirical force field in the latter case the systems potential energy is expressed in terms of analytical functions of intramolecular bond lengths bond angles and torsional angles as well as intermolecular distances and orientations the parameters appearing in such force fields have usually been determined from electronic structure calculations on molecular fragments spectroscopic determination of vibrational force constants and experimental measurements of intermolecular forces force fields lets interrupt our discussion of md propagation of coordinates and velocities to examine the ingredients that usually appear in the force fields mentioned above in figure c we see a molecule in
