of bond stretching and bending top left and dihedral angle distortion top right within a molecule and equations describing how the energy varies with these geometry changes and noncovalent interactions describing electrostatic and van der waals interactions among the atoms in the molecule a these functional forms would be used to describe how the energy changes with the bond lengths and angles within for example each of the molecules shown in figure c lets call them solute molecules as well as for any water molecules that may be present if these molecules are explicitly included in the md simulation the
