a ubiquitous component in condensedphase chemistry much effort has been devoted to generating highly accurate intermolecular potentials to describe the interactions among water molecules in the popular tipp and tipp models the waterwater interaction is given by where roo is the distance between the oxygen atoms of the two water molecules in å and indices and run over or sites respectively for tipp or tipp with labeling sites on one water molecule and labeling sites on the second water molecule the parameter is å kcal mol a and b are conventional lennardjones parameters for oxygen atoms and qi is the
