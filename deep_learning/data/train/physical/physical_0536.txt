of along the bisector of the two oh bonds as shown in figure d in using either the tipp or tipp model the intramolecular bond lengths and angles are often constrained to remain fixed when doing so one is said to be using a rigid water model there are variants to these two site and site models that for example include van der waals interactions between atoms on different water molecules and there are models including more than sites and models that allow for the polarization of each water molecule induced by the dipole fields as represented by the partial
