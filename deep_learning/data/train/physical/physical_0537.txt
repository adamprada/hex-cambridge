page provides links to numerous software packages that use these kinds of force fields to carry out md simulations these links also offer more detailed information about the performance of various force fields as well as giving values for the parameters used in those force fields the parameter values are usually obtained by fitting the intramolecular or intermolecular functional form eg as shown above to energies obtained in electronic structure calculations at a large number of geometries or adjusting them to cause md or mc simulations employing the force field to reproduce certain thermodynamic properties eg radial distribution functions solvation
