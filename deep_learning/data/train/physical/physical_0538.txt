undergoes a surface hop near a conical intersection it is most common to use a combined qmmm approach like we talked about in section of chapter a qm treatment of the portion of the system that undergoes the electronic transition is combined with a forcefield mm treatment of the rest of the system to carry out the md simulation lets now return to the issue of propagating trajectories given a force field and a set of initial conditions appropriate to describing the system to be simulated by applying one of the timepropagation algorithms to all of the coordinates and momenta
