an md simulation of liquid water with initial conditions chosen to represent water at a given temperature t would determine the initial momenta to generate a histogram of oo distances this would allow one to construct the kind of radial distribution function shown in figure using md simulation rather than mc the radial distribution function obtained in such an md simulation should be identical to that obtained from mc because statistical mechanics assumes the ensemble average mc is equal to the longtime average md of any property for a system at equilibrium of course one could also monitor quantities that
