until the dynamics has randomized the energy before monitoring the subsequent time evolution in the problem discussed in chapter we use md to follow the time progress of a system representing a single bimolecular collision in two crossed beams of molecules each such beam contains molecules whose initial translational velocities are narrowly defined rather than maxwellboltzmann distributed in this case we do not allow the system to equilibrate because we are not trying to model an equilibrium system instead we select an ensemble of initial conditions that represent the molecules in the two beams and we then follow the newton
