step requires that one evaluate the potential energy change accompanying the displacement of only one molecule this uses only of the order of computational steps again for pair wise additive potentials another factor that complicates md simulations has to do with the wide range of times scales that may be involved for example for one to use a time step dt short enough to follow highfrequency motions eg oh stretching in a simulation of an ion or polymer in water solvent dt must be of the order of s to then simulate the diffusion of an ion or the folding
