s s ch nh oh bond vibration rotation of small molecule routinely accessible time duration for atomistic md simulation time duration for heroic atomistic md simulation time duration achievable using coarsegraining techniquesa time needed for protein folding a these techniques are discussed in section because one can not afford to carry out simulations covering s using time steps needed to follow bond vibrations s it is necessary to devise strategies to focus on motions whose time frame is of primary interest while ignoring or approximating faster motions for example when carrying out longtime md simulations one can ignore the highfrequency
