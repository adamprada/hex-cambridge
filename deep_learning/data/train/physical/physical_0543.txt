coarse graining the goal of coarse graining is to bring the computational cost of a simulation into the realm of reality this is done by replacing the fully atomistic description of the system in which coordinates sufficient to specify the positions and in md the velocities of every atom by a description in terms of fewer functional groups often referred to as beads the tipp and tipp models for the waterwater interaction potential discussed above are not coarsegrained models because they contain as many or more centers as atoms an example of a coarsegrained model for the waterwater interaction is
