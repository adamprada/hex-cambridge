potential different values are needed to describe the behavior of si ge diamond or water even though they all can adopt tetrahedral coordination the form of the threebody part of this potential is designed to guide the orientations among oxygen atoms to adopt tetrahedral character although the above potential seems more complicated than for example the form used in the tipp or tipp potential it has three important advantages when it comes to carrying out md simulations because the sw potential contains no terms varying with distance as ie no coulomb interactions among partial charges it is of qualitatively shorter
