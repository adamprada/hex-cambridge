relative movements of the oxygen centers which occur on time scales ca times longer this means that one can use longer md steps the net result is that this coarsegrained model of the waterwater interaction allows md simulations to be carried out for qualitatively longer time durations of course this is only an advantage if the simulations provide accurate results in the table shown below taken from the above reference we see md simulation results as well as experimental results obtained with the above mw model with various tipnp models and with two other popular waterwater potentials spc and spce
