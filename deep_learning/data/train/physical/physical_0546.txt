various beadbead interaction distances c in the table shown below the reference cited above specifies the locations and masses of the phosphate sugar and base beads in the b form of the dna helix the masses need to be chosen so that the coarsegrained dynamical motions of these units replicate within reasonable tolerances the center of mass motions of the phosphate sugar and base moieties when atomistic md simulations are carried out on smaller test systems containing these nucleotide units the potential used to carry out the coarsegrained md simulations is given by the equations shown below taken from the
