in the above reference the values of the parameters used in this force field potential given in the above reference are reproduced in the two tables shown below although there are numerous parameters in this potential the key to the success of this coarse graining is that there are only six kinds of sites whose positions and velocities must be propagated in the md simulation phosphate sites sugar sites and four kinds of base sites this is far fewer coordinates that would arise in a fully atomistic md simulation i will refer the reader to the reference cited above for
