discussed above located on each nucleus of the molecule these functions are still denoted but their radial and angular dependences involve the distance and orientation of the electron relative to the particular nucleus on which the ao is located other than these two changes performing a scf calculation on a molecule or molecular ion proceeds just as in the atomic case detailed earlier let us briefly review how this iterative process occurs once atomic basis sets have been chosen for each atom the one and twoelectron integrals appearing in the and overlap matrices must be evaluated there are numerous highly
