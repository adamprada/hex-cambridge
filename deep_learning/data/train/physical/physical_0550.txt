as the direct integraldriven approach a shapes sizes and energies of orbitals each molecular spinorbital mo that results from solving the hf scf equations for a molecule or molecular ion consists of a sum of components involving all of the basis aos in this expression the are referred to as lcaomo coefficients because they tell us how to linearly combine aos to form the mos because the aos have various angular shapes eg or shapes and radial extents ie different orbital exponents the mos constructed from them can be of different shapes and radial sizes lets look at a few
