the antibonding mo labeled has lcaomo coefficients of different sign for the a and b aos as was the case in the h√ºckel or tightbinding model outlined in chapter the energy splitting between the two mos depends on the overlap between the two aos which in turn depends on the distance between the two nuclei an analogous pair of bonding and antibonding mos arises when two orbitals overlap sideways as in ethylene to form and mos which are illustrated in figure figure two atomic orbitals on carbon atoms combine to form a bonding and antibonding molecular orbital the shapes of
