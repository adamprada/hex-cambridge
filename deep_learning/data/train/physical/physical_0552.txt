that we solved in part of this text another thing to note about the mos shown above is that they will differ in their quantitative details but not in their overall shapes when various functional groups are attached to the ethylene molecules c atoms for example if electronwithdrawing groups such as cl oh or br are attached to one of the c atoms the attractive potential experienced by a electron near that c atom will be enhanced relative to the potential near the other c atom as a result the bonding mo will have larger lcaomo coefficients ckm belonging to
