contribute there are bonding and antibonding mos formed by combining several aos for example the four equivalent ch bonding mos in shown in figure each involve c and as well as h basis aos figure the four ch bonds in methane the energies of the mos depend on two primary factors the energies of the aos from which the mos are constructed and the overlap between these aos the pattern in energies for valence mos formed by combining pairs of firstrow atoms to form homonuclear diatomic molecules is shown in figure figure energies of the valence molecular orbitals in homonuclear
