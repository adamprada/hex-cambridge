nodal properties in addition to the bonding and antibonding mos discussed and illustrated earlier two other kinds of mos are important to know about nonbonding mos arise for example when an orbital on one atom is not directed toward and overlapping with an orbital on a neighboring atom for example the lone pair orbitals on or on the oxygen atom of are nonbonding orbitals they still are described in the lcaomo manner but their coefficients do not contain dominant contributions from more than one atomic center finally there is a type of orbital that all molecules possess but that is
