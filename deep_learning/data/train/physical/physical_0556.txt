a frequency in the range inputs energy into the rotational motions of the primarily water molecules contained in the food these rotationally hot water molecules then collide with neighboring molecules ie other water as well as proteins and other molecules in the food and in the cooking vessel to transfer some of their motional energy to them through this means the translational kinetic energy of all the molecules inside the cooker gains energy this process of rotationtotranslation energy transfer is how the microwave radiation ultimately heats the food which cooks it what happens when you put the food into the
