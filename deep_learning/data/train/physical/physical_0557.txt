we make the mistake of putting anything metal into our microwave oven lets now learn more about how the microwave photons cause the molecules to become rotationally excited using microwave radiation molecules having dipole moment vectors can be made to undergo rotational excitation in such processes the timevarying electric field of the microwave electromagnetic radiation interacts with the molecules via a potential energy of the form this potential can cause energy to flow from the microwave energy source into the molecules rotational motions when the energy of the former matches the energy spacing between two rotational energy levels this idea
