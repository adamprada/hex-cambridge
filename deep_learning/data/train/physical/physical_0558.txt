spacing will not be absorbed in this transition that is why is more than enough energy not good enough the reason is that for two systems in this case the photons electric field and the molecules rotation which causes its dipole moment to also rotate to interact and thus exchange energy this is what photon absorption is they must have very nearly the same frequencies if the photons frequency exceeds the rotational frequency of the molecule by a significant amount the molecule will experience an electric field that oscillates too quickly to induce a torque on the molecules dipole that
