equilibrium bond length and its reduced mass as thus in principle measuring the rotational energy level spacings via microwave spectroscopy allows one to determine the second identity above simply defines what is called the rotational constant in terms of the moment of inertia the rotational energy levels described above give rise to a manifold of levels of nonuniform spacing as shown in the figure figure rotational energy levels vs rotational quantum number the nonuniformity in spacings is a result of the quadratic dependence of the rotational energy levels on the rotational quantum number ej jj biggdfrachbaribiggtag moreover the level with
