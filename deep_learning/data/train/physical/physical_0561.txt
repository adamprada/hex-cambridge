matrix having elements and expressed in terms of the cartesian coordinates of the nuclei a and of the center of mass in an arbitrary moleculefixed coordinate system analogous definitions hold for and the principle moments are then obtained as the eigenvalues of this x matrix for molecules with all three principle moments equal the rotational energy levels are given by ejk dfrachbarjji and are independent of the quantum number and on the quantum number that again describes the orientation of how the molecule is spinning in space such molecules are called spherical tops for molecules called symmetric tops with two
