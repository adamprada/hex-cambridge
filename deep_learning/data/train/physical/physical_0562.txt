positions of atomic nuclei relative to the center of mass of the molecule so a microwave spectrum can in principle determine the moments of inertia and hence the geometry of a molecule in the discussion given above we treated these positions and thus the moments of inertia as fixed ie not varying with time of course these distances are not unchanging with time in a real molecule because the molecules atomic nuclei undergo vibrational motions because of this it is the vibrationallyaveraged moments of inertia that must be incorporated into the rotational energy level formulas specifically because the rotationally energies
