is still very much under active study by theoretical and experimental chemists for this reason it is a very challenging task to use microwave data on rotational energies to determine geometries equilibrium or vibrationally averaged for these kinds of molecules so in the area of rotational spectroscopy theory plays several important roles it provides the basic equations in terms of which the rotational line spacings relate to moments of inertia it allows one given the distribution of geometrical bond lengths and angles characteristic of the vibrational state the molecule exists in to compute the proper vibrationallyaveraged moment of inertia it
