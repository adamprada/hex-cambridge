by molecules with electronic transitions in this energy range eg colored molecules such as those contained in plant leaves and other dark material these molecules are thereby promoted to excited electronic states some such molecules reemit the photons that excited them but most undergo socalled radiationless relaxation that allows them to return to their ground electronic state but with a substantial amount of internal vibrational energy that is these molecules become vibrationally very hot subsequently these hot molecules as they undergo transitions from highenergy vibrational levels to lowerenergy levels emit infrared ir photons if our atmosphere were devoid of water
