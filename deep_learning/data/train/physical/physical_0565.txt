kinetic energy of the collisionpartner molecules in this manner the temperature which is measure of the average translational energy increases of course the vibrationally hot molecules can also reemit their ir photons but there is a thick layer of such molecules forming a blanket around the earth and all of these molecules are available to continually absorb and reemit the ir energy in this manner the blanket keeps the ir radiation from escaping and thus keeps our atmosphere warm those of us who live in dry desert climates are keenly aware of such effects clear cloudless nights in the desert
