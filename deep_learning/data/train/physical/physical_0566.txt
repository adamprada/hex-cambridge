molecules dipole moment associated with motion along the vibrational normal mode labeled as the ir radiation is scanned it comes into resonance with various vibrations of the molecule under study and radiation can be absorbed knowing the frequencies at which radiation is absorbed provides knowledge of the vibrational energy level spacings in the molecule absorptions associated with transitions from the lowest vibrational level to the first excited lever are called fundamental transitions those connecting the lowest level to the second excited state are called first overtone transitions excitations from excited levels to even higher levels are named hotband absorptions fundamental
