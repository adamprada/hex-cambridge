remains an area of intense research interest within the theory community in a polyatomic molecule with atoms there are many vibrational modes the total vibrational energy of such a molecule can be approximated as a sum of terms one for each of the or for a linear molecule vibrations ev vntext or hbaromegaj bigvj dfracbig tag here is the harmonic frequency of the mode and is the vibrational quantum number associated with that mode as we discussed in chapter the vibrational wave functions are products of harmonic vibrational functions for each mode psi prodjntext or psivj x jtag and the
