oscillator energy expression occur as the quantum number grows these deviations are explained in terms of the molecules true potential deviating strongly from the harmonic potential at higher energy as shown in the figure figure harmonic parabola and anharmonic potentials at larger bond lengths the true potential is softer than the harmonic potential and eventually reaches its asymptote which lies at the dissociation energy above its minimum this deviation of the true from causes the true vibrational energy levels to lie below the harmonic predictions it is convention to express the experimentally observed vibrational energy levels along each of the
