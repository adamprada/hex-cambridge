terms dominate the slope of such a plot is expected to be and the small intercept should be such a plot of experimental data which clearly can be used to determine the and parameters of the vibrational mode of study is shown in figure figure birgesponer plot of vibrational energy spacings vs quantum number these socalled birgesponer plots can also be used to determine dissociation energies of molecules if the vibration whose spacings are plotted corresponds to a bondstretching mode by linearly extrapolating such a plot of experimental values to large values one can find the value of at which
