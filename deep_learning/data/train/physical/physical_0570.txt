nonharmonic floppy vibrations by carrying out dynamical simulations on a bornoppenheimer energy surface xray crystallography in xray crystallography experiments one employs crystalline samples of the molecules of interest and makes use of the diffraction patterns produced by scattered xrays to determine positions of the atoms in the molecule relative to one another using the famous bragg formula in this equation is the wavelength of the xrays is a spacing between layers planes of atoms in the crystal is the angle through which the xray beam is scattered and is an integer that labels the order of the scattered beam because
