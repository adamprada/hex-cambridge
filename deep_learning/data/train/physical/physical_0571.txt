way to probe interatomic distances in molecules the primary difficulties with xray measurements are that one needs to have crystalline samples often materials simply cannot be grown as crystals that one learns about interatomic spacings as they occur in the crystalline state not as they exist for example in solution or in gasphase samples this is especially problematic for biological systems where one would like to know the structure of the biomolecule as it exists within the living organism nevertheless xray diffraction data and its interpretation through the bragg formula provide one of the most widely used and reliable ways
