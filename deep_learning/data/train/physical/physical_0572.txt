magnetic spin levels by a magnetic field is called the zeeman effect and it is illustrated in figure figure zeeman splitting of magnetic nucleuss two levels caused by magnetic field the factor is introduced to describe the screening of the external field at the nucleus caused by the electron cloud that surrounds this nucleus in effect is the magnetic field experienced local to the nucleus it is this screening that gives rise to the phenomenon of chemical shifts in nmr spectroscopy and it is this factor that allows nmr measurements of shielding factors to be related by theory to the
