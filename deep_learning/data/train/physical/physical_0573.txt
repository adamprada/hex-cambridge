given nucleus absorbs rf radiation allows one to determine the local shielding for that nucleus this in turn provides information about the electronic environment local to that nucleus as illustrated in the above figure this data tells the chemist a great deal about the molecules structure because it suggests what kinds of functional groups occur within the molecule to extract even more geometrical information from nmr experiments one makes use of another feature of nuclear spin states in particular it is known that the energy levels of a given nucleus eg the one are altered by the presence of other
