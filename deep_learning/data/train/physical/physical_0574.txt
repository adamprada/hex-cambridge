x the second involves a nucleus a that is close to two equivalent nuclei x and the third describes a nucleus a close to three equivalent nuclei x figure splitting pattern characteristic of ax case in figure are illustrated the splitting in the x nucleus absorption due to the presence of a single a neighbor nucleus right and the splitting in the a nucleus absorption left caused by the x nucleus in both of these examples the x and a nuclei have only two values so they must be spin nuclei this kind of splitting pattern would for example arise
