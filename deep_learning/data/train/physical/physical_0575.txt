group in this case the spin a line is split by the eight spin states that the three equivalent spin h nuclei can occupy the magnitudes of these coupling constants depend on the distances r between the two nuclei to the inverse sixth power ie as they also depend on the values of the two interacting nuclei in the presence of splitting caused by nearby usually covalently bonded nuclei the nmr spectrum of a molecule consists of sets of absorptions each belonging to a specific nuclear type in a particular chemical environment and thus have a specific chemical shift that
