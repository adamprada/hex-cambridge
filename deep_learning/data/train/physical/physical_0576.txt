the spectrum ie only the proton absorptions are shown of appears along with plots of the integrated intensities under each set of peaks the latter data suggests the total number of nuclei corresponding to that group of peaks notice how the protons absorption the absorption of the two equivalent protons on the group and that of the three equivalent protons in the group occur at different field strengths ie have different chemical shifts also note how the peak is split only slightly because this proton is distant from any others but the protons peak is split by the neighboring groups
