chemical shifts or shielding and then using the theoretical equations relating the two quantities knowledge about the electronic environment tells one for example about the degree of polarity in bonds connected to that nuclear center tells us through the splitting patterns associated with various nuclei the number and nature of the neighbor nuclei again providing a wealth of molecular structure information theoretical simulation of structures we have seen how microwave infrared and nmr spectroscopy as well as xray diffraction data when subjected to proper interpretation using the appropriate theoretical equations can be used to obtain a great deal of structural
