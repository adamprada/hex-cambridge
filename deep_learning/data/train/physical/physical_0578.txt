case in which the energy depends on only two geometrical parameters even in such a case one can find several local minima and transition state structures connecting them figure potential energy surface in two dimensions showing reactant and product minima transition states and paths connecting them as we discussed in chapter among the stationary points on the potential energy surface pes those at which all eigenvalues of the second derivative hessian matrix are positive represent geometrically stable isomers of the molecule those stationary points on the pes at which all but one hessian eigenvalue are positive and one is negative
