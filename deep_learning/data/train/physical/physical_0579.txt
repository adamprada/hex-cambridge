vibrational motion depends on whether one wishes needs to properly include quantum effects eg zeropoint motion and wave function nodal patterns in the simulation once the vibrational motions have been described for a particular isomer and given knowledge of the geometry of that isomer one can evaluate the moments of inertia one can properly vibrationally average all of the quantities that enter into these moments and hence one can simulate the microwave spectrum of the molecule also given the hessian matrix for this isomer one can form its massweighted variant whose nonzero eigenvalues give the normalmode harmonic frequencies of vibration
