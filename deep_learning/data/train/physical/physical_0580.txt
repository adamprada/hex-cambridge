such a theoretical simulation of a molecule for various reasons especially in the early days of developing theoretical tools to solve the electronic schr√∂dinger equation or the vibrational motion problem one would do so for molecules whose structures and ir and nmr spectra were well known the purpose in such cases was to calibrate the accuracy of the theoretical methods against established experimental data now that theoretical tools have been reasonably well tested and can be trusted within known limits of accuracy one often uses theoretically simulated structural and spectroscopic properties to identify spectral features whose molecular origin is not
