these molecules may be the most reliable way to access such data moreover one might use simulations to examine the behavior of molecules under extreme conditions such as high pressure confinement to nanoscopic spaces high temperature or very low temperatures for which experiments could be very difficult or expensive to carry out let me tell you about an example of how such theoretical simulation has proven useful probably even essential for interpreting experimental data the data is reported in n i hammer jw shin j m headrick e g diken j r roscioli g h weddle and m a johnson
