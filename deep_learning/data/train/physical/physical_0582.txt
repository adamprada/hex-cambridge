frequency range is absorbed this range corresponds to frequencies of hoh bending vibrations this excess internal energy can cause one or more of the weakly bound ar atoms to be ejected from the cluster thus decreasing the number of intact ions in the mass spectrometer the decrease in the number of intact ions is a direct measure then of the absorption of the ir light by monitoring the number of ie the strength of the mass spectrometers signal at this particular masstocharge ratio as the ir radiation is tuned through the cm frequency range the experimentalists obtain spectral signatures ie
