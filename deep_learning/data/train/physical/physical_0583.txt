structure of the underlying ion was nor did they know exactly which hoh bending or oh or od stretching vibrations were causing the various peaks shown in figure a a and b by carrying out electronic structure calculations on a large number of geometries for and searching for local minima on the ground electronic state of this ion there are a very large number of such local minima and then using the massweighted hessian matrix at each local minima to calculate the structures vibrational energies the experimentalists were able to figure out what structure for was most consistent with their
