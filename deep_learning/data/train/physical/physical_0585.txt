this problem one treats the molecule or ion of interest using the electronic structure methods outlined earlier in this chapter but with one modification the oneelectron component of the hamiltonian which contains the electronnuclei coulomb potential is modified to also contain a term that describes the potential energy of interaction of the electrons and nuclei with the surrounding medium in the simplest such models this solvation potential depends only on the dielectric constant of the surroundings in more sophisticated models the surroundings are represented by a collection of fractional point charges that may also be attributed with local dipole moments
