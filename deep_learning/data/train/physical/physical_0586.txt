addition to describing how the surroundings affect the hamiltonian of the molecule or ion of interest one needs to describe the motions or spatial distributions of the mediums constituent atoms or molecules this is usually done within a purely classical treatment of these degrees of freedom that is if equilibrium properties of the solvated system are to be simulated then montecarlo mc sampling this subject is treated in chapter of this text of the surrounding mediums coordinates is used within such a mc sampling the potential energy of the entire system is calculated as a sum of two parts i
