might write a computer program to evaluate the classical partition function for a system consisting of ar atoms in a box of volume at temperature t the classical hamiltonian consists of a sum of kinetic and interatomic potential energies the integration over the momentum variables can be carried out analytically and allows to be written as the contribution to provided by the integral over the coordinates is often called the configurational partition function if the density of the ar atoms is high as in a liquid or solid state the potential will depend on the coordinates of the ar atoms
