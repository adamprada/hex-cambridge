undertake the mc procedure allows one to evaluate such highdimensional integrals by not dividing each of the axes into discrete points but rather selecting values of for which the integrand is nonnegligible while also avoiding values of for which the integrand is small enough to neglect by then summing over only values of that meet these criteria the mc process can estimate the integral of course the magic lies in how one designs a rigorous and computationally efficient algorithm for selecting those that meet the criteria to illustrate how the mc process works let us consider carrying out a mc
