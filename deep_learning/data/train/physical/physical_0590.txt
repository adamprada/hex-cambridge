the potential energy often this energy is expressed as a sum of intramolecular bondstretching and bending contributions one for each molecule plus a pairwise additive intermolecular potential although the mc process does not require that one employ such a decomposition the energy could be computed in other ways if appropriate for example might be evaluated as the bornoppenheimer energy if an ab initio electronic structure calculation on the full molecule system were feasible the mc process does not depend on how is computed but most commonly it is evaluated as shown above metropolis monte carlo in each step of the
