procedure detailed below approximately this has been shown to optimize the performance of the mc algorithm in implementing the mc process it is usually important to consider carefully how one defines the coordinates that will be used to generate the mc steps for example in the case of ar atoms discussed earlier it might be acceptable to use the cartesian coordinates of the atoms however for the water example it would be very inefficient to employ the cartesian coordinates of the water molecules displacement of for example one of the atoms along the xaxis while keeping all other coordinates fixed
