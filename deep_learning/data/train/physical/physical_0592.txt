the oh stretching and hoh bending coordinates to keep the energy change within a few another point to make about how the mc process is often used is that when the intermolecular energy is pair wise additive evaluation of the energy change accompanying the change in requires computational effort that is proportional to the number of molecules in the system because only those factors with or equal to the single molecule that is displaced need be computed this is why pair wise additive forms for are often employed let us now return to how the mc process is implemented if
