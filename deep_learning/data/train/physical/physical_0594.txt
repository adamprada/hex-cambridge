system being discussed and then average this data over all of the accepted steps to generate an oxygenoxygen radial distribution function as shown in figure alternatively one might accumulate the intermolecular interaction energies between pairs of water molecules and average this over all accepted configurations to extract the cohesive energy of the liquid water figure radial distribution functions between pairs of oxygen atoms in ho at three different temperatures the mc procedure also allows us to compute the equilibrium average of any property that depends on the coordinates of the molecules such an average would be written in terms of
