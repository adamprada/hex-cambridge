mc simulations work when the straightforward way fails that is how can one handle thousands or millions of coordinates when the above analysis would suggest that performing an integral over so many coordinates would require computations the main thing to understand is that the site discretization of the coordinates is a stupid way to perform the above integral because there are many in fact most coordinate values where the value of the quantity a whose average one wants multiplied by is negligible on the other hand the mc algorithm is designed to select as accepted steps those coordinates for which
