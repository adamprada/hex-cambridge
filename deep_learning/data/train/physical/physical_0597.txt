coordinates for which the total potential energy is low so coordinates with high are very infrequently accepted ii however is designed to identify events in which pairs of molecules approach closely and thus have high values so there is a competition between and that renders the mc procedure ineffective in such cases because the average one wants to compute involves the product which is small for most values of q what is done to overcome this competition is to introduce a socalled umbrella weighting function that i attains it largest values where is large and ii is positive and takes
