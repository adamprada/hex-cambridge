q again with as the weighting factor and finally iii taking the average of divided by the average of to obtain the final result the secret to the success of umbrella sampling is that the product causes the mc process to emphasize in its acceptance and rejection procedure coordinates for which both and and hence are significant of course the tradeoff is that the quantities and whose averages one computes using as the mc weighting function are themselves susceptible to being very small at coordinates where the weighting function is large lets consider some examples of when and how one
