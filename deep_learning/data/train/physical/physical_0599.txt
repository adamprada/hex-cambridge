to the ensemble appropriate to the first system this result suggests that one can form the ratio of the partition functions by computing the ensemble average of using the first systems weighting function in the mc process likewise to compute for second system the average value of any property that depends only on the coordinates of the particles one can proceed as follows where is the ensemble average of the quantity taken with respect to the ensemble appropriate to the first system using the result derived earlier for the ratio this expression for can be rewritten as in this form
