kind of approach be useful suppose one were interested in performing a mc average of a property for a system whose energy landscape has many local minima separated by large energy barriers and suppose it was important to sample configurations characterizing the many local minima in the sampling a straightforward mc calculation using as the weighting function would likely fail because a sequence of coordinate displacements from near one local minimum to another local minimum would have very little chance of being accepted in the mc process because the barriers are very high as a result the mc average would
