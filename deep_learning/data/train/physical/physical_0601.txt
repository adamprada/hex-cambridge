figure a qualitative depiction of the potential for a system having a large barrier and for the umbrellamodified system with potential the mcaccepted coordinates generated using the modified potential would sample the various local minima and thus the entire landscape in a much more efficient manner because they would not be trapped by the large energy barriers by using these mcaccepted coordinates one can then estimate the average value of a property appropriate to the potential having the large barriers by making use of the identity the above umbrella strategy could be useful in generating a good sampling of configurations
