transitionstate structures figure b qualitative depiction of and coordinate ion in water and of the energy profile connecting these two structures using an umbrella function similar to that discussed earlier to simply lower the barrier connecting the two ion structures may not be sufficient although this would allow one to sample both local minima its sampling of structures near the transition state would be questionable if the quantity by which the barrier is lowered to allow mc steps moving over the barrier to be accepted with nonnegligible probability is large in such cases it is wise to employ a series
