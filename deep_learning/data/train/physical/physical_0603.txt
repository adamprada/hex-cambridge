the umbrellaaltered weighting function in uq sq is the value of the value of the intrinsic reaction coordinate irc evaluated for the current geometry of the system q is the value of the irc characterizing the first window and d is the width of this window the first window could for example correspond to geometries near the coordinate local minimum of the solvated ion structure the width of each window d should be chosen so that the energy variation within the window is no more than a kt in this way the mc process will have a good ie ca
