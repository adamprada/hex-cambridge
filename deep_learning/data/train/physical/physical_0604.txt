of s along the irc within the second window this process is repeated at a series of connected windows whose centers range from the coordinate ion through the transition state and to the coordinate ion after performing this series of umbrellaaltered samplings one has in hand a series of histograms within the window gives the relative probability of the system being at a point s along the irc to generate the normalized absolute probability function ps expressing the probability of being at a point s one can proceed as follows because the first and second windows are connected at the
