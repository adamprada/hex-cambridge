way one can compute the probability of accessing the ts and the free energy profile at any point along the irc it is by using a series of connected windows within each of which the mc process samples structures whose energies can fluctuate by that one generates a smooth connection from lowenergy to highenergy eg ts geometries contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and professor of chemistry u utah telluride schools on theoretical chemistry integrated by tomoyuki hayashi uc davis nonideality henrys law and azeotropes last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry
