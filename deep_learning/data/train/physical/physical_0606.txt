law by the lower example solubility of carbon dioxide in water the solubility of in water at oc is x m with a partial pressure of over the solution of bar assuming the density of a saturated solution to be kgl calculate the henrys law constant for solution in one l of solution there is g of water assuming the mass of co dissolved is negligible the solubility of can be used to find the number of moles of dissolved in l of solution also and so the mol fraction of is and so or azeotropes an azeotrope is defined
