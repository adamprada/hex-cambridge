the boiling point of a minimum boiling azeotrope that is higher that when components are miscible single phase another possibility that is common is for two substances to form a twophase liquid form a minimum boiling azeotrope but for the azeotrope to boil at a temperature below which the two liquid phases become miscible in this case the phase diagram will look like figure example in the diagram make up of a system in each region is summarized below the diagram the point e indicates the azeotrope composition and boiling temperature single phase liquid mostly compound a single phase liquid
