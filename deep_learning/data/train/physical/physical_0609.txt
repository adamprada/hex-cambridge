both sides by gives where is the compression factor as discussed previously now we can use the expression above to obtain the fugacity coefficient as defined by taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields or using some calculus and substitutions from above int leftdfracpartial ln gammapartial p rightt dp int leftdfracpartial ln fpartial p dfracpartial ln p partial p rightt dp finally integrating from to yields if the gas behaves ideally in general this will be the limiting value as since all gases behave ideal as the pressure approaches the advantage to using the fugacity in this manner is
