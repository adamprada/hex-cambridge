in the case of gases where fugacity was introduced to allow us to use the ideal models activity is used to allow for the deviation of real solutes from limiting ideal behavior the activity of a solute is related to its concentration by where is the activity coefficient is the molaliy of the solute and is unit molality the activity coefficient is unitless in this definition and so the activity itself is also unitless furthermore the activity coefficient approaches unity as the molality of the solute approaches zero insuring that dilute solutions behave ideally the use of activity to describe
