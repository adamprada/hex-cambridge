is the activity of the solute substituting his into the above relationship yields using a molal definition for the activity coefficient the expression for the total molar gibbs function of the solutes becomes this expression can be rearranged to yield where all of the deviation from ideal behavior comes from the last term unfortunately it impossible to experimentally deconvolute the term into the specific contributions of the two ions so instead we use a geometric average to define the mean activity coefficient for a substance that dissociates according to the general process the expression for the mean activity coefficient is
