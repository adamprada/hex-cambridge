chemistry at university of utah the newton equations of motion for vibration the kinetic and potential energy matrices the harmonic vibrational energies and normal mode eigenvectors the use of symmetry symmetry adapted modes point group symmetry of the harmonic potentialcontributors and attributions having seen how one can use information about the gradients and hessians on a bornoppenheimer surface to locate geometries corresponding to stable species and transition states let us now move on to see how this same data is used to treat vibrations on this surface for a polyatomic molecule whose electronic energys dependence on the cartesian coordinates of
