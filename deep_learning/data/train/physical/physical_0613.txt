length of the step to be taken along this cartesian direction if the geometry corresponds to a minimum or transition state the gradient terms will all vanish and the hessian matrix will possess for linear species or for nonlinear molecules positive eigenvalues and or zero eigenvalues corresponding to translational and or rotational motions of the molecule for a minimum and one negative eigenvalues and or positive eigenvalues for a transition state the newton equations of motion for vibration the kinetic and potential energy matrices truncating the taylor series at the quadratic terms assuming these terms dominate because only small displacements
