the time evolution of a set of socalled massweighted cartesian coordinates defined as in terms of which the above newton equations become and the massweighted hessian matrix elements are the harmonic vibrational energies and normal mode eigenvectors assuming that the undergo some form of sinusoidal time evolution and substituting this into the newton equations produces a matrix eigenvalue equation in which the eigenvalues are the squares of the socalled normal mode vibrational frequencies and the eigenvectors give the amplitudes of motion along each of the massweighted cartesian coordinates that belong to each mode hence to perform a normalmode analysis of
