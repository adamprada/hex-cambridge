often says that there is one imaginary frequency because one of the values is negative this value of characterizes the curvature of the energy surface along the irc at the transition state the positive vibrational eigenvalues of transitionstate geometries are used as discussed in chapter to evaluate statistical mechanics partition functions for reaction rates and the negative value plays a role in determining the extent of tunneling through the barrier on the reaction surface within this harmonic treatment of vibrational motion the total vibrational energy of the molecule is given as a sum of or independent contributions one for each
