to use when locating minima and transition states on bornoppenheimer energy surfaces although massweighted coordinates are indeed essential for evaluating harmonic vibrational frequencies and as we will see later for tracing out socalled intrinsic reaction paths their use produces the same minima and transition states as one finds using coordinates that are massweighted this is because the condition that all components of the gradient of the energy surface vanish at a minimum or at a transition state will automatically be obeyed when expressed in terms of massweighted coordinates since notice that this means the geometries of all local minima and
