frequencies and eigenvectors by exploiting molecular point group symmetry for molecules that possess symmetry at a particular stable geometry the electronic potential displays symmetry with respect to displacements of symmetry equivalent cartesian coordinates for example consider the water molecule at its equilibrium geometry as illustrated in figure a very small movement of the molecules left atom in the positive direction produces the same change in the potential as a correspondingly small displacement of the right atom in the negative direction similarly movement of the left h in the positive y direction produces an energy change identical to movement of the
