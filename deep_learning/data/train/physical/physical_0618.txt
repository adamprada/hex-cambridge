the irreducible representation in the appropriate point group and j labels the particular combination of that symmetry ie there may be more than one kind of displacement that has a given symmetry g these symmetryadapted coordinates can be formed by applying the point group projection operators that are treated in detail in chapter to the individual cartesian displacement coordinates to illustrate again consider the molecule in the coordinate system described above the massweighted cartesian displacement coordinates can be symmetry adapted by applying the following four projection operators to each of the original coordinates the symbol s denotes reflection through a
