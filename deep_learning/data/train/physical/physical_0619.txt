transformations of the original massweighted cartesian coordinates these transformation coefficients can be used to carry out a unitary transformation of the x massweighted hessian matrix in so doing we need only form blocks hgammajl sumkk cgammajk hkk sqrtmk mk cgammalk within which the symmetries of the two modes are identical the offdiagonal elements hgammajgammal sumkk cgammajk hkk sqrtmk mk cgammalk vanish because the potential and the full vibrational hamiltonian commutes with the point group symmetry operations as a result the x massweighted hessian eigenvalue problem can be subdivided into two x matrix problems of and symmetry one x matrix of
