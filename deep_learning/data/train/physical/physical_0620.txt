normal mode of symmetry in terms of the massweighted cartesian coordinates the relationship can then be used to express these coefficients in terms of the original cartesian coordinates regardless of whether symmetry is used to block diagonalize the massweighted hessian six for nonlinear molecules or five for linear species of the eigenvalues will equal zero the eigenvectors belonging to these zero eigenvalues describe the translations and or rotations of the molecule for example when expressed in terms of the original ie nonmassweighted cartesian coordinates are three translation eigenvectors of and symmetry and is a rotation about the yaxis in the
