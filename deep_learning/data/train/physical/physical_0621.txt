bending mode respectively as illustrated in figure figure symmetric and asymmetric stretch modes and bending mode of water the method of vibrational analysis presented here can work for any polyatomic molecule one knows the massweighted hessian and then computes the nonzero eigenvalues which then provide the squares of the normal modes harmonic vibrational frequencies point group symmetry can be used to block diagonalize this hessian and to label the vibrational modes according to symmetry as we show in figure for the molecule in tetrahedral symmetry figure symmetries of vibrations of methane contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and
