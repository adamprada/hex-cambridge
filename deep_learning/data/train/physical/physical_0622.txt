with the surroundings as the process takes place or for a process in which the increments of heat and work are arbitrarily small likewise we can denote the entropy change for the spontaneous process as or but we cannot find the entropy change by measuring or if we cannot find the entropy change we cannot find the helmholtz or gibbs free energy changes from their defining relationships and moreover intensive variablespressure temperature and concentrationsmay not have welldefined values in a spontaneously changing system when we say that a reversible process occurs with some thermodynamic variable held constant we mean what
