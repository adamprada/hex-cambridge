of the system remains the same throughout the process when we say that a spontaneous process occurs at constant pressure isobarically or isopiestically we mean that the pressure applied to the system by the surroundings is constant throughout the spontaneous process and that the system pressure is equal to the applied pressure at all times when we say that a spontaneous process occurs at constant temperature we may mean only that the system is continuously in thermal contact with its surroundings the temperature of the surroundings is constant in the initial and final states the system temperature is equal to
