meaning is the same we can make similar statements about most thermodynamic functions often there is no particular reason to prefer over or vice versa however there are circumstances in which the delta notation serves particular purposes if a system undergoes a change in which some thermodynamic variables remain constant the delta notation provides a convenient way to indicate that a particular variable is not constant for example if the volume of a system changes while the applied pressure remains constant we write similarly we often want to describe processes in which some state functions are different in the final
