equations is that to compute the hamiltonian matrix one must know the lcao coefficients of the orbitals which the electrons occupy on the other hand these lcao coefficients are supposed to be found by solving the hartree matrix eigenvalue equations this paradox leads to the need to solve these equations iteratively in a socalled selfconsistent field scf technique in the scf process one inputs an initial approximation to the coefficients this then allows one to form the hamiltonian matrix defined above the hartree matrix equations are then solved for new coefficients and for the orbital energies the new lcao coefficients
