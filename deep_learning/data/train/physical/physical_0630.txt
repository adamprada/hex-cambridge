the however much effort has been expended at developing alternative sets of functions to use as basis orbitals the result of this effort has been to produce two kinds of functions that currently are widely used the basis orbitals commonly used in the lcao process fall into two primary classes slatertype orbitals stos are characterized by quantum numbers and and exponents which characterize the orbitals radial size the symbol denotes the normalization constant cartesian gaussiantype orbitals gtos are characterized by quantum numbers and which detail the angular shape and direction of the orbital and exponents which govern the radial size
