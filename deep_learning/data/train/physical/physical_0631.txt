and linearmolecule calculations because the multicenter integrals which arise in polyatomicmolecule calculations we will discuss these integrals later in this chapter cannot efficiently be evaluated when stos are employed in contrast such integrals can routinely be computed when gtos are used this fundamental advantage of gtos has lead to the dominance of these functions in molecular quantum chemistry to overcome the primary weakness of gto functions ie their radial derivatives vanish at the nucleus it is common to combine two three or more gtos with combination coefficients which are fixed and not treated as lcao parameters into new functions called
