plane wave orbitals of the form where is a normalization constant and and are quantum numbers detailing the momenta or wavelength of the orbital along the and cartesian directions the advantage to using such simple orbitals is that the integrals one must perform are much easier to handle with such functions the disadvantage is that one must use many such functions to accurately describe sharply peaked charge distributions of for example innershell core orbitals while still retaining enough flexibility to also describe the much smoother electron density in the valence regions much effort has been devoted to developing and tabulating
