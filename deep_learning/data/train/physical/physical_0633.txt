the primary core and valence basis must be specified within this category the following choices are common a minimal basis in which the number of cgto orbitals is equal to the number of core and valence atomic orbitals in the atom a doublezeta dz basis in which twice as many cgtos are used as there are core and valence atomic orbitals the use of more basis functions is motivated by a desire to provide additional variational flexibility so the lcao process can generate molecular orbitals of variable diffuseness as the local electronegativity of the atom varies a valence doublezeta vdz
