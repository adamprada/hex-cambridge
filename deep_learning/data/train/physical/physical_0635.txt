flexibility to the lcao process in forming bonding orbitals between pairs of valence atomic orbitals this is illustrated in figure where polarization dp orbitals on c and o are seen to contribute to formation of the bonding orbital of a carbonyl group by allowing polarization of the carbon atoms orbital toward the right and of the oxygen atoms orbital toward the left figure oxygen and carbon form a bond that uses the polarization functions on each atom polarization functions are essential in strained ring compounds such as cyclopropane because they provide the angular flexibility needed to direct the electron density
