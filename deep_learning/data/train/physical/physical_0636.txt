each atom in the molecule the lcaomo procedure can be used to determine the coefficients that describe the occupied and virtual ie unoccupied orbitals it is important to keep in mind that the basis orbitals are not themselves the scf orbitals of the isolated atoms even the proper atomic orbitals are combinations with atomic values for the coefficients of the basis functions the lcaomoscf process itself determines the magnitudes and signs of the in particular it is alternations in the signs of these coefficients allow radial nodes to form other factors that affect reaction rates last updated save as pdf
