if the energy needed make or break a chemical bond to the isotopically substituted atom is a significant component of the activation energy for the reaction kinetic isotope effects are usually small in comparison to other factors that affect reaction rates a tenfold change in the reaction rate is a big kinetic isotope effect effects much smaller than this are often useful indeed the absence of a kinetic isotope effect can help distinguish among alternative mechanisms in studies of reaction rates that are focused on finding the reaction mechanism many characteristics of the reaction that are not strictly raterelated can
