system is the same as its initial state the postulate that energy is a state function is then equivalent to the statement that the postulate that energy is conserved is equivalent to the statement that now what can we say about obviously if we combine the information from the two postulates it follows that the essential point however is that is not required by either postulate alone is not required by the postulate that energy is a state function because the surroundings do not necessarily traverse a cycle whenever the system does is not required by conservation of energy which
