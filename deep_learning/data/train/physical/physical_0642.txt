is a contradiction the existence of a perpetual motion machine of the first kind proposition mfl implies that the first law energy is a state function proposition fl is false mfl fl from this result we can validly conclude if the first law is true the existence of a perpetual motion machine of the first kind is impossible mfl fl flmflflmfl we cannot conclude that the impossibility of perpetual motion of the first kind implies that energy is a state function mfl fl does not imply mflfl that is the impossibility of perpetual motion of the first kind as we
