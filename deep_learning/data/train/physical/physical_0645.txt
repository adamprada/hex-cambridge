which that outcome has occurred in the past given a distribution the possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive in any given trial the random variable can have only one of its possible values consequently a discrete distribution is completely described when the probability of each of its outcomes is specified many distributions are comprised of a finite set of n mutually exclusive possible outcomes if each of these outcomes is equally likely the probability that we will observe any particular outcome in the next trial is we often find it convenient to group the set of possible outcomes into subsets
