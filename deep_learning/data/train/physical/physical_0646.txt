refer to an exhaustive and mutually exclusive partitioning of the possible outcomes distinguishing between outcomes and events just gives us some language conventions that enable us to create alternative groupings of the same set of real world observations suppose that we define a particular event to be a subset of outcomes that we denote as u if in a large number of trials the fraction of outcomes that belong to this subset is f we say that the probability is f that the outcome of the next trial will belong to this event to express this in more mathematical notation
