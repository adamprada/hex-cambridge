the mixture is given by it should be noted that while the volume of a substance is never negative the partial molar volume can be an example of this appears in the dissolution of a strong electrolyte in water because the water molecules in the solvation sphere of the ions are physically closer together than they are in bulk pure water there is a volume decrease when the electrolyte dissolves this is easily observable at high concentrations where a larger fraction of the water in the sample is tied up in solvation of the ions contributors and attributions patrick e
