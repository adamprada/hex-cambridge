meaning analytically the schrödinger equation for the two electrons moving about the he nucleus the schrödinger equation for the two electrons moving in an molecule even if the locations of the two nuclei labeled a and b are held clamped as in the bornoppenheimer approximation these two problems are examples of what is called the threebody problem meaning solving for the behavior of three bodies moving relative to one another motions of the sun earth and moon even neglecting all the other planets and their moons constitute another threebody problem none of these problems even the classical newtons equation for
