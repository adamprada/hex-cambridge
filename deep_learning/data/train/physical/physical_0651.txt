for the screening of the full nuclear charge by the two electrons as a starting point to solve for the vibrational energies of a diatomic molecule whose energy vs bond length is known one could use the morse oscillator wave functions and energies as starting points but once one has decided on a reasonable model to use how does one connect this model to the real system of interest perturbation theory and the variational method are the two tools that are most commonly used for this purpose and it is these two tools that are covered in this chapter the
