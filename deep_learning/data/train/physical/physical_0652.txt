electric field when the perturbation results from the interaction of the molecule of interest with an electric field in such cases it is usual to write the decomposition of as a fundamental assumption of perturbation theory is that the wave functions and energies for the full hamiltonian can be expanded in a taylor series involving various powers of the perturbation parameter hence one writes the energy and the wave function as zeroth first second etc order pieces which form the unknowns in this method e e e e e cdots with and being proportional to next one substitutes these expansions
