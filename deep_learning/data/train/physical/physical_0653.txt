the zerothorder equation simply instructs us to solve the model schr√∂dinger equation to obtain the zerothorder wave function and its zerothorder energy since is a hermitian operator it has a complete set of such eigenfunctions which we label and ek one of these states will be the one we are interested in studying eg we might be interested in the effect of an external electric field on the state of the hydrogen atom but as will become clear soon we actually have to find the full set of and eg we need to also find the etc states of the
