other zerothorder states for example expanding in this manner gives now the unknowns in the firstorder equation become and the expansion coefficients to solve one proceeds as follows first one multiplies this equation on the left by the complex conjugate of the zerothorder function for the state of interest and integrates over the variables on which the wave functions depend this gives the first and third terms cancel one another because and the fourth term reduces to because is assumed to be normalized this allows the above equation to be written as which is the rspt expression for it says
