in rspt one assumes that the only contribution of to the full wave function psioccurs in zerothorder this is referred to as assuming intermediate normalization of y in other words because and for so the coefficients appearing in the above equation are all one needs to describe if the state of interest is nondegenerate in zerothorder ie none of the other is equal to e this equation can be solved for the needed expansion coefficients which allow the firstorder wave function to be written as where the index is restricted such that not equal the state you are interested in
