zerothorder states to make for this extra step is carried out in practice by forming the matrix representation of in the original set of degenerate zerothorder states and then finding the unitary transformation among these states that diagonalizes this matrix these transformed states are then what one uses as and in the rspt expressions this means that the paradoxical result is indeed obeyed by this choice of states so one does not need to determine the coefficients for belonging to the degenerate zerothorder states ie these coefficients can be assumed to be zero the bottom line is that the expression
