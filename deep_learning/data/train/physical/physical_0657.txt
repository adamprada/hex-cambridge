limited to states that are not degenerate with in zerothorder these are the fundamental working equations of rayleighschr√∂dinger perturbation theory they instruct us to compute the average value of the perturbation taken over a probability distribution equal to to obtain the firstorder correction to the energy they also tell us how to compute the firstorder correction to the wave function and the secondorder energy in terms of integrals coupling to other zerothorder states and denominators involving energy differences an analogous approach is used to solve the second and higherorder equations for example the equation for the nth order energy and
