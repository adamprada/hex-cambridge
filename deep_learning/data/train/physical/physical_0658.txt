righthand side vanishes because and are orthogonal the terms containing the nth order expansion coefficients can be brought to the lefthand side to produce the following equation for these unknowns langlepsij psinrangle e langlepsij psinrangle langle psijv psinrangle e langlepsij psinrangle e langlepsijpsinrangle e langle psijpsinrangle en langle psijpsirangle as long as the zerothorder energy is not degenerate with or that the zerothorder states have been chosen as discussed earlier to cause there to no contribution to from such degenerate states the above equation can be solved for the expansion coefficients which then define the rspt equations can be solved
