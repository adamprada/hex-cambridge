further attention i recommend that students have in memory their own brain not a computer the equations for and so they can make use of them even in qualitative applications of perturbation theory as we will discuss later in this chapter but first lets consider an example problem that illustrates how perturbation theory is used in a more quantitative manner an example problem as we discussed earlier an electron moving in a quasilinear conjugated bond framework can be modeled as a particle in a box an externally applied electric field of strength interacts with the electron in a fashion that
