this example let me now do all the steps needed to solve this part of the problem try to make sure you can do the algebra but also make sure you understand how we are using the firstorder perturbation equations the zerothorder wave functions and energies are given by and and the perturbation is the firstorder correction to the energy for the state having and denote is the first integral can be evaluated using the following identity with the second integral can be evaluated using the following identity with and making all of these appropriate substitutions we obtain this result
