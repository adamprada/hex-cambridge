wave function made by the state is given by the two integrals in the numerator involve and using the integral identities and intcosaxdx fracasinax we obtain the following and intl xsinleftdfrac pi xlrightsinleftdfracpi xlrightdx fracleftintl xcosleftdfracpi xlrightdx intl xcosleftdfracpi xlrightdxright fracleft leftfraclpicosleftdfracpi xlright fraclxpisinleftdfracpi xlright rightbiggl leftfraclpicosleftdfracpi xlright fraclxpisinleftdfracpi xlrightright bigglright fraclpi fraclpi fraclpi fraclpi fraclpi making all of these appropriate substitutions we obtain for the firstorder wave function actually only the contribution so the wave function through first order ie the sum of the zeorth and firstorder pieces is in figure we show the and zerothorder functions as well
