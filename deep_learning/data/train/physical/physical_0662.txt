expectation value of the dipole moment operator with being the sum of our zeroth and firstorder wave functions in computing this integral we neglect the term proportional to because we are interested in only the term linear in because this is what gives the dipole moment again allow me to do the algebra and see if you can follow where e intl psileftxfraclrightpsi dx e intl psileftxfraclrightpsi dx e intl psileftxfraclrightpsi dx e intl psileftxfraclrightpsi dx the first integral is zero we discussed this earlier when we used symmetry to explain why this vanishes the fourth integral is neglected since
