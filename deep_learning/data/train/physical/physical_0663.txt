result above we then find notice that this finding suggests that the larger the box ie the length of the conjugated molecule the more polarizable the electron density this result also suggests that the polarizability of conjugated polyenes should vary nonlinearly with the length of the conjugated chain other examples lets consider a few more examples of how perturbation theory is used in chemistry either quantitatively ie to actually compute changes in energies and wave functions or qualitatively ie to interpret or anticipate how changes might alter energies or other properties the stark effect when a molecule is exposed to
