is the dipole moment of the molecule in the absence of the field for species that possess no dipole moment eg nondegenerate states of atoms and centrosymmetric molecules this firstorder energy vanishes it vanishes in the two specific cases mentioned because is either even or odd under the inversion symmetry but the product is even and the dipole operator is odd so the integrand is odd and thus the integral vanishes if one is dealing with a degenerate state of a centrosymmetric system things are different for example the and states of the hydrogen atom are degenerate so to apply
