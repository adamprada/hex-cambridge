two corrected zerothorder wave functions corresponding to these two shifted energies are and correspond to orbitals polarized into or away from the electric field the stark effect example offers a good chance to explain a fundamental problem with applying perturbation theory one of the basic assumptions of perturbation theory is that the unperturbed and perturbed hamiltonians are both bounded from below ie have a discrete lowest eigenvalues and allow each eigenvalue of the unperturbed hamiltonian to be connected to a unique eigenvalue of the perturbed hamiltonian considering the example just discussed we can see that these assumptions are not met
