to a nucleus located at the origin the deep well and the potential due to the applied electric field along directions for which is negative to the right in figure a this potential becomes large and positive as the distance of the electron from the nucleus increases for bound states such as the and states discussed earlier such regions are classically forbidden and the wave function exponentially decays in this direction however in directions along which is positive the potential is negative and strongly attractive for smallr ie near the nucleus then passes through a maximum eg near in figure
