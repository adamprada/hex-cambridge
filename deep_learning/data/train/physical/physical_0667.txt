states lies far below the maximum in the potential perturbation theory can be used we know the energies of hydrogenic ions vary with and with the principal quantum number as so as long as the zerothorder energy of the state will like below the barrier on the potential surface because the wave function can penetrate this barrier this state will no longer be a true bound state it will be a metastable resonance state recall we studied such states in chapter where we learned about tunneling however if the zerothorder energy lies far below the barrier the extent of tunneling
