asymptotic part of the wave function where the electron is unbound another example of stark effects in degenerate cases arises when considering how polar diatomic molecules rotational energies are altered by an electric field the zerothorder wave functions appropriate to such cases are given by where the spherical harmonic is the rotational wave function is the vibrational function for level and is the electronic wave function the diagonal elements of the electricdipole operator vanish because the vibrationally averaged dipole moment which arises as is a vector quantity whose component along the electric field is again taking the field to lie
