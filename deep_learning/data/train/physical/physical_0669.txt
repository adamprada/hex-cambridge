formula for a zerothorder state only certain other zerothorder states will have nonvanishing coupling matrix elements these nonzero integrals are governed by which can be shown to be of course if the term does not occur the limitation that must equal arises as above because the perturbation contains no terms dependent on the variable the limitation that comes from a combination of three conditions angular momentum coupling which you learned about in chapter tells us that which happens to be proportional to can couple to to generate terms having or for their quantum number but only for their quantum number
