many applications of perturbation theory and that will also be common to variational calculations that we discuss later in this chapter once one has identified the specific zerothorder state of interest one proceeds as follows the firstorder energy is evaluated in doing so one should first make use of any symmetry point group symmetry is treated later in this chapter such as inversion angular momentum spin etc to determine whether this expectation value will vanish by symmetry in which case we dont bother to consider this matrix element any more we used this earlier when considering and to conclude that
