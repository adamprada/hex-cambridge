dominant amount to the sum you will encounter many times when reading literature articles in which perturbation theory is employed situations in which researchers have focused attention on zerothorder states that are close in energy to the state of interest and that have the correct symmetry to couple strongly ie have substantial to that state electronelectron coulomb repulsion in one of the most elementary pictures of atomic electronic structure one uses nuclear charge screening concepts to partially account for electronelectron interactions for example in ss li one might posit a zerothorder wave function consisting of a product in which two
