coulomb interaction integrals being defined as to carry out the electron integral appearing in one proceeds as follows for the integral one integrates over the spin variables using and and then integrates over the coordinate of the third electron using to obtain which is the two integrals arise when carrying out similar integration for the terms arising from and so through first order the energy of the li atom at this level of treatment is given by the factor contains the contributions from the kinetic energy and electronnuclear coulomb potential the terms describe the coulombic repulsions among the three electrons
