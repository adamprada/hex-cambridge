containing the kinetic energy the coulomb attraction to the nucleus i use the li atom as an example here and a potential this potential which is written in terms of coulomb integrals similar to those we discussed earlier as well as socalled exchange integrals that we will discuss in chapter is designed to approximate the interaction of an electron at location with the other electrons in the atom or molecule because is oneelectron additive its eigenfunctions consist of products of eigenfunctions of the operator offers an approximation to the true coulomb interactions expressed in terms of a smearedout electron distribution
