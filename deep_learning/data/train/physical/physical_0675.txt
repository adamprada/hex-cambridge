partially miscible liquidsthe lever rulecontributors and attributions as suggested by the gibbs phase rule the most important variables describing a mixture are pressure temperature and composition in the case of single component systems composition is not important so only pressure and temperature are typically depicted on a phase diagram however for mixtures with two components the composition is of vital important so there is generally a choice that must be made as to whether the other variable to be depicted is temperature or pressure temperaturecomposition diagrams are very useful in the description of binary systems many of which will for
