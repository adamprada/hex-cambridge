chemistry laboratory is the combination of diethyl ether and water in this case the differential solubility in the immiscible solvents allows the twophase liquid system to be used to separate solutes using a separatory funnel method figure as is the case for most solutes their solubility is dependent on temperature for many binary mixtures of immiscible liquids miscibility increases with increasing temperature and then at some temperature known as the upper critical temperature the liquids become miscible in all compositions an example of a phase diagram that demonstrates this behavior is shown in figure an example of a binary combination
