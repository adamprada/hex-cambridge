both an upper and lower critical temperature forming twophase liquid systems at temperatures between these two temperatures an example of a combination of substances that demonstrate the behavior is nicotine and water the lever rule the composition and amount of material in each phase of a two phase liquid can be determined using the lever rule this rule can be explained using the following diagram figure suppose that the temperature and composition of the mixture is given by point b in the above diagram the horizontal line segment that passes through point b is terminated at points a and c
