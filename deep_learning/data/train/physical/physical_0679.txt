aspects of point group symmetry because this example contains most of the complexities that arise in any application of group theory to molecular problems example the symmetry group of ammonia the ammonia molecule belongs in its groundstate equilibrium geometry to the point group its symmetry operations consist of two rotations rotations by and respectively about an axis passing through the nitrogen atom and lying perpendicular to the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms three vertical reflection operations and the identity operation corresponding to these six operations are symmetry elements the threefold rotation axis and the three symmetry planes and
