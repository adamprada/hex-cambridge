objects belonging to the constituent atoms or molecular fragments in a more general case is introduced these objects are the orbitals of the individual atoms or of the fragments in the mo case they are unit vectors along the cartesian and directions located on each of the atoms and representing displacements along each of these directions in the vibrationrotation case symmetry tools are used to combine these objects into new objects each of which belongs to a specific symmetry of the point group because the hamiltonian electronic in the mo case and vibrationrotation in the latter case commutes with the
