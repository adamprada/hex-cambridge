finds that the six matrices when multiplied together in all possible ways obey the same multiplication table as did the six symmetry operations we say the matrices form a representation of the group because the matrices have all the properties of the group characters of representations one important property of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements which is called the trace of the matrix and is denoted so is called the trace or character of the matrix in the above example the importance of the characters of the symmetry operations lies in the fact that they do
