the same character as other members of the class the character of a class depends on the space spanned by the basis of functions on which the symmetry operations act another basis and another representation above we used as a basis if alternatively we use the onedimensional basis consisting of the orbital on the natom we obtain different characters as we now demonstrate the act of the six symmetry operations on this can be represented as follows sn overseterightarrow sn hspacept sn oversetcrightarrow sn hspacept sn oversetcrightarrow sn we can represent this group of operations in this basis by the
