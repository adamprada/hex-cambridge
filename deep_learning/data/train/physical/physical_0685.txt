objects reducible and irreducible representations reducible representations note that every matrix in the four dimensional group representation labeled has the socalled block diagonal form beginarraycccchline hline a b c d e f g h i hline endarray this means that these matrices are really a combination of two separate group representations mathematically it is called a direct sum representation we say that is reducible into a onedimensional representation and a threedimensional representation formed by the x submatrices that we will call de leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept dc leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept dc leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright dsigmav leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept dsigmav leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept
