group is equal to the number of classes since there are three classes of operation ie e and we have found all the irreducible representations of the point group there are no more the irreducible representations have standard names the first that arising from the and orbitals is called the arising from is called and is called not to be confused with the identity operation e we will see shortly where to find and identify these names thus our original representation was a combination of two representations and one representation we say that is a direct sum representation a consequence
