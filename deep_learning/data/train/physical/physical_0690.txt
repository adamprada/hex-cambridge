displacements rotations etc transforms either as one of the irreducible representations or as a direct sum reducible representation symmetry tools are used to first determine how the basis transforms under action of the symmetry operations they are then used to decompose the resultant representations into their irreducible components more examples the p orbitals of nitrogen for a function to transform according to a specific irreducible representation means that the function when operated upon by a pointgroup symmetry operator yields a linear combination of the functions that transform according to that irreducible representation for example a orbital is the axis of
