symmetry operation acting on that orbital for example a diagonal element of the matrix is the component of along the direction more rigorously it is thus the character of the matrix is the sum of and in general the character of any symmetry operation can be computed by allowing to operate on each orbital then projecting along ie forming and summing these terms if these rules are applied to the and orbitals of nitrogen within the point group one obtains this set of characters is the same as above and agrees with those of the representation for the point group
