then computing the component of the resulting function along the original function the resulting characters are and in agreement with what we calculated before using the orthogonality of characters taken as vectors we can reduce the above set of characters to hence we say that our orbital set of three orbitals forms a reducible representation consisting of the sum of and irs this means that the three orbitals can be combined to yield one orbital of symmetry and a pair that transform according to the representation projector operators symmetry adapted linear combinations of atomic orbitals to generate the above and
