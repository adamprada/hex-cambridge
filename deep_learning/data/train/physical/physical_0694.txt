as though three orbitals having symmetry were generated but only two of these are really independent functions for example is related to and as follows thus only and are needed to span the twodimensional space of the representation if we include in our set of orbitals and require our orbitals to be orthogonal then we must find numbers and such that is orthogonal to a straightforward calculation gives or which agrees with what we used earlier to construct the functions in terms of the functions summary let us now summarize what we have learned thus far about point group symmetry
