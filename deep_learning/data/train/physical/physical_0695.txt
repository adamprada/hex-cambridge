determine how many times the irreducible representation occurs in the reducible representation the expression for is in which is the order of the point group the total number of symmetry operations in the group eg for for example the reducible representation and formed by the three orbitals discussed above can be decomposed as follows these equations state that the three orbitals can be combined to give one orbital and since is degenerate one pair of orbitals as established above with knowledge of the the symmetryadapted orbitals can be formed by allowing the projectors to operate on each of the primitive
