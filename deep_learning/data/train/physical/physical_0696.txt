each atom directed in the and directions form a basis for action by the operations of the point group in the case of the characters of the resultant x representation matrices form a reducible representation in the point group for example under the and atoms are interchanged so unit vectors on either one will not contribute to the trace unit zvectors on and remain unchanged as well as the corresponding yvectors however the xvectors on and are reversed in sign the total character for the and atoms are interchanged so unit vectors on either one will not contribute to the
