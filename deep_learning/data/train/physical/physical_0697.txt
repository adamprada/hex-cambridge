have symmetry we could obtain symmetryadapted vibrational and rotational bases by allowing symmetry projection operators of the irreducible representation symmetries to operate on various elementary cartesian atomic displacement vectors centered on the four atoms direct product representations direct products in nelectron wave functions we now turn to the symmetry analysis of orbital products such knowledge is important because one is routinely faced with constructing symmetryadapted electron configurations that consist of products of individual spin orbitals one for each electron a pointgroup symmetry operator s when acting on such a product of orbitals gives the product of acting on each of
