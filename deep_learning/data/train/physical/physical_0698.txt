representations the representation matrices for the term products shown above consist of products of the matrices belonging to each this matrix product is not a simple product but what is called a direct product to compute the characters of the direct product matrices one multiplies the characters of the individual matrices of the irreducible representations of the orbitals that appear in the electron configuration the directproduct representation formed by the orbital products can therefore be symmetryanalyzed reduced using the same tools as we used earlier for example if one is interested in knowing the symmetry of an orbital product of
