representation as a result only the singly occupied or degenerate orbitals need to be considered when forming the characters of the reducible directproduct representation for this example this means that the directproduct characters can be determined from the characters of the two active ie nonclosedshell orbitals the orbitals that is from the directproduct characters belonging to a particular electronic configuration eg one must still decompose this list of characters into a sum of irreducible characters for the example at hand the directproduct characters decompose into one one and one representation this means that the configuration contains and symmetry elements projection
