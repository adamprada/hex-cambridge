bosons with respect to interchange of any pair of particles this step reduces the set of electron states that can arise for example in the above configuration case only and states arise the and possibilities disappear when the antisymmetry projector is applied in contrast for an configuration all states arise even after the wave function has been made antisymmetric the steps involved in combining the point group symmetry with permutational antisymmetry are illustrated in chapter of this text as well as in chapter of my qmic text direct products in selection rules two states and that are eigenfunctions of a
