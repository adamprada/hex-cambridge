symmetric representation of the group if the integral is to not vanish in terms of the projectors introduced above we must have not vanish here the subscript denotes the totally symmetric representation of whatever point group applies the symmetry of the product is according to what was covered earlier given by the direct product of the symmetries of of and of so the conclusion is that the integral will vanish unless this triple direct product contains when it is reduced to its irreducible components a component of the totally symmetric representation another way to state the above result and a
