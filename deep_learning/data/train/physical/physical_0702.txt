used consider the integral that arises in formulating the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with a molecule within the electricdipole approximation here is the vector giving together with the unit charge the quantum mechanical dipole moment operator where and are the charge and position of the nth nucleus and is the position of the jth electron now consider evaluating this integral for the singlet transition in formaldehyde here the closedshell ground state is of symmetry and the singlet excited state which involves promoting an electron from the nonbonding lone pair orbital on the oxygen atom into the antibonding orbital on the
