to conclude that the excitation in formaldehyde is electric dipole forbidden overview we have shown how to make a symmetry decomposition of a basis of atomic orbitals or cartesian displacements or orbital products into irreducible representation components this tool is very helpful when studying spectroscopy and when constructing the orbital correlation diagrams that form the basis of the woodwardhoffmann rules that play useful roles in predicting whether chemical reactions will have energy barriers in excess of thermodynamic barriers we also learned how to form the directproduct symmetries that arise when considering configurations consisting of products of symmetryadapted spin orbitals finally
