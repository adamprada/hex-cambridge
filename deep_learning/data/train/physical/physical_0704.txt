of science mathematics case icase iicase iii because a proposed mechanism can only be valid if it is consistent with the rate law found experimentally the rate law plays a central role in the investigation of chemical reaction mechanisms the discussion above introduces the problems and methods associated with collecting rate data and with finding an empirical rate law that fits experimental concentrationversustime data we turn now to finding the rate laws that are consistent with a particular proposed mechanism for simplicity we consider reactions in closed constantvolume systems in principle numerical integration can be used to predict the concentration
