that can be compared to the experimental results to produce refined estimates in practice we tailor our choice of reaction conditions so that we can use various approximations to test whether a proposed mechanism can explain the data we now consider the most generally useful of these approximations in this discussion we assume that the overall reaction goes to completion that is at equilibrium the concentration of the reactant whose concentration is limiting has become essentially zero if the overall reaction involves more than one elementary step then an intermediate compound is involved a valid mechanism must include this intermediate
