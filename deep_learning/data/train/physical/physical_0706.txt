whose kinetics are described by the following simultaneous differential equations the general analytical solution for this system of coupled differential equations can be obtained but it is rather complex because increases early in the reaction passes through a maximum and then decreases at long times in principle experimental data could be fit to these equations the numerical approach requires that we select values for and and then numerically integrate to get and as functions of time in principle we could refine our estimates of and by comparing the calculated values of one or more concentrations to the experimental ones in
