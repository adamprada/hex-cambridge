significantly in the present instance setting means that the ratelaw term can be replaced to a good approximation by where once we have decided upon the reaction conditions we are going to use whether the resulting concentrationversustime data can be described by a single differential equation depends on the relative magnitudes of the rate constants in the several steps of the overall reaction particular combinations of relationships that lead to simplifications are often referred to by particular names we talk about a combination that has a ratedetermining step or one that involves a prior equilibrium or one in which a
