of is tantamount to the formation of a molecule of and the reaction produces at essentially the same rate that it consumes or we say that the first step is the ratedetermining step in the reaction we have the assumption that means that we can neglect the smaller term in the equation for giving the approximation letting and recognizing that our assumptions make the massbalance condition becomes choosing means that the rate equation becomes firstorder since is not strictly constant it is a pseudofirstorder rate constant the disappearance of is said to follow a pseudofirstorder rate equation the concept of
