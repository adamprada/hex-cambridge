at hand we do not consider to be an intermediate is a product that happens to be at equilibrium with the coproduct case ii suppose that in this case is fast compared to the rate at which is converted to and we say that is the ratedetermining step we can now distinguish three subcases depending upon the way behaves during the course of the reaction case iia suppose that and then is rapid and essentially quantitative that is within a short time of initiating the reaction all of the stoichiometrically limiting reactant is converted to letting and recognizing that our
