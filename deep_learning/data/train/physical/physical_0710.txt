have where the disappearance of a and the formation of d follow a pseudofirstorder rate equation the pseudofirstorder rate constant is a composite quantity that is directly proportional to case iic if we suppose that the first step is effectively at equilibrium during the entire time that is being produced as in case iib but that is not negligibly small compared to we again have with the massbalance condition becomes eliminating between the massbalance and equilibriumconstant equations gives so that becomes the formation of follows a pseudofirstorder rate equation the disappearance of is also pseudofirstorder but the pseudofirstorder rate constant
