we expect the graph of versus time to have a slope that is approximately zero in this case we have so that with becomes as in the previous cases the disappearance of and the formation of follow a pseudofirstorder rate equation the pseudofirstorder rate constant is again a composite quantity which depends on and the values of all of the rate constants case iii illustrates the steadystate approximation in which we assume that the concentration of an intermediate species is much smaller than the concentrations of other species that affect the reaction rate under these circumstances we can be confident
