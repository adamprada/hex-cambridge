makes it possible to greatly simplify the set of simultaneous differential equations that is predicted by the mechanism when there are multiple intermediates to which the approximation is applicable remarkable simplifications can result this often happens when the mechanism involves freeradical intermediates the name steadystate approximation is traditional when we use it we do so on the understanding that the state which is approximately steady is the concentration of the intermediate not the state of the system since a net reaction is occurring the state of the system is distinctly not constant prelude to chemical equilibria last updated save as
