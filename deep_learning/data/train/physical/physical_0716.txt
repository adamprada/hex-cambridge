be used to do many useful things such as allow us to drive our cars use electronic devices heat our homes and cook our food chemistry is important as well since many of the processes in which we generate energy depend on chemical reactions such as the combustion of hydrocarbons to generate heat or electron transfer reactions to generate electron flow the previous chapter investigated gases which are convenient systems to use to frame many discussions of thermodynamics since they can be modeled using specific equations of state such as the ideal gas law or the van der waals law
