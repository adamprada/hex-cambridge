surface the larger the column height is observed to be the ambient air pressure can be computed by equating the force generated by the mass of the mercury in the column to the force generated by ambient air pressure after normalizing for surface area the resulting relationship is where is the density of the mercury gcm is the acceleration due to gravity and is the height of the column torricelli found that at sea level the height of the column was cm a force of n acting on an area of m is a pascal pa a standard atmosphere is
