solution the change in the gibbs function due to an isothermal change in pressure can be expressed as delta g intpp left dfracpartial gpartial p rightt dp and since substituting equation refmax results in assuming that the molar volume is independent or pressure over the stated pressure range becomes so the molar change in the gibbs function can be calculated by substituting the relevant values contributors patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay pressure dependence of kp le ch√¢teliers principle last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and
