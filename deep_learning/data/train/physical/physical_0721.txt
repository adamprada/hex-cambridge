that describes the composition of the equilibrium mixture substituting the above expression into the expression for yields this expression can be factored into two pieces one containing the mole fractions and thus describing the composition and one containing the total pressure the second factor is a constant for a given total pressure if the first term is given the symbol the expression becomes in this expression has the same form as an equilibrium constant but is not itself a constant the value of will vary with varying composition and will need to vary with varying total pressure in most cases
