gas will lower the total pressure of the reaction mixture and thus relieving the stress introduced by increasing the pressure this is exactly what is expected according to le chateliers principle it should be noted that there are several ways one can affect the total pressure of a gasphase equilibrium these include the introduction or removal of reactants or products perhaps through condensation or some other physical process a change in volume of the reaction vessel or the introduction of an inert gas that does not participate in the reaction itself changes in the temperature will be discussed in a
