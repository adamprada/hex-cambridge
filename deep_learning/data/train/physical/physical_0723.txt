to the rule that increasing the total pressure will cause a shift in the reaction favoring the side with fewer moles of gas occurs when the total pressure is increased by introducing an inert gas to the mixture the reason is that the introduction of an inert gas will affect the total pressures and the partial pressures of each individual species example a l vessel is charged with atm of a and the following reaction is allowed to come to equilibrium at k with what are the equilibrium partial pressures and mole fractions of a and b if the volume
