meaningful since the equilibrium pressure of b cannot be negative so the equilibrium partial pressures are given by so the mole fractions are given by part b the volume is doubled again an ice table is useful the initial pressures will be half of the equilibrium pressures found in part a a b initial atm atm change x x equilibrium atm x atm x so the new equilibrium pressures can be found from and the values of that solve the problem are we reject the negative root since it would cause both of the partial pressures to become negative so
