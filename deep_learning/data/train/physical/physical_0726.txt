container wall why do we not observe pressure variations that reflect the wide variety of speeds with which molecules strike the wall qualitatively the answer is obvious a single molecule whose scalar velocity is contributes to the pressure on the walls of its container see problem when we measure pressure we measure an average squared velocity even if we measure the pressure over a very small area and a very short time the number of molecules striking the wall during the time of the measurement is very large consequently the average speed of the molecules hitting the wall during any
