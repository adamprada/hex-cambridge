to our deductions of and we also obtain their derivatives the probabilitydensity functions and from the properties of probabilitydensity functions we have let be the arbitrarily small increment of volume in velocity space in which the and components of velocity lie between and and and and then the probability that the velocity of a randomly selected molecule lies within is note that the product is not a threedimensional probability density function this is most immediately appreciated by recognizing that is not an incremental volume in velocity space that is we let be the probabilitydensity function for the velocity vector in
