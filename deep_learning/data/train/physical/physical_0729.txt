the point when and are arbitrarily small these two points specify the diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular parallelepiped whose edges have the lengths and the volume of this parallelepiped is hence the differential volume elementdifferential volume element in cartesian coordinates becomes in spherical coordinates mathematically this conversion is obtained using the absolute value of the jacobian of the transformation that is where the jacobian is a determinate of partial derivatives since the differential unit of volume in spherical coordinates is the probability that the velocity components lie within the indicated ranges is we can develop the next step in
