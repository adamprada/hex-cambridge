must be normalized this means that from which we see that and it is important to recognize that while and are probability density functions and are not however is a probability density function we can see this by noting that if were a probability density its integral over all possible values of would be one instead we find similarly when we find we can show explicitly that our notation now allows us to express the probability that an arbitrarily selected molecule has a velocity vector whose magnitude lies between and while its component lies between and and its component lies
