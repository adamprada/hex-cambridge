adiabatically from l to l the initial temperature is k what is the final temperature what are the initial and final pressures how much work is done on the gas what are and for the gas in this process the equation of state for a hardsphere gas is where is the number of moles and is the molar volume of the hard spheres how much work is done on this gas when n moles of it expand reversibly and isothermally from to strictly speaking can the spontaneous expansion of a real gas be isothermal can it be free can it
