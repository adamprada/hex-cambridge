since the temperature of the water increases and the process is to be reversible we must keep the temperature of the thermal reservoir just greater than that of the water throughout the process we can accomplish this by using a quantity of ideal gas as the heat reservoir by reversibly compressing the ideal gas we can reversibly deliver the required heat while maintaining the required temperature we consider this operation further in section random variables expected values and population sets last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no
