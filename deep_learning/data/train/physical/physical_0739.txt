any number of new games by dividing the needles circular path into nonoverlapping segments each segment is a possible outcome we number the possible outcomes Ï‰ label these outcomes and denote their probabilities as we say that the probability of outcome is the expected frequency of outcome we denote the respective payoffs as straightforward generalization of our last analysis shows that the expected value for participation in any game of this type is moreover the spinner is representative of any distribution so it is reasonable to generalize further we can say that the expected value of the outcome of a
