specifies the way that the possible outcomes are populated in this particular series of observations we call a population set if we make a second series of n observations we obtain a second population set we infer that the best forecast we can make for the number of occurrences of outcome in any future series of n observations is we call the expected number of observations of outcome in a sample of size in a particular series of trials the number of occurrences of outcome and hence of is for the set of outcomes the average value of is collecting
