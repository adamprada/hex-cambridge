single population set is significantly more probable than any of many others nevertheless every outcome occurs with a welldefined probability we infer that the set is always an adequate proxy for calculating the expected value for the most probable population set to illustrate this kind of distribution suppose that there are possible outcomes of which the first and last thousand have probabilities that are so low that they can be taken as zero while the middle outcomes have approximately equal probabilities then for and while for we are illustrating the situation in which the number of outcomes we can observe
