to the same expected value let us compute the arithmetic average using the most probable population set for a sample of n trials in this case the number of observations of the outcome is for a discrete distribution is the value of that we calculate from the most probable population set or its proxy we can extend the definition of the expected value to cases in which the cumulative probability distribution function and the outcomevalue function are continuous in the domain of the random variable to do so we divide this domain into a finite number of intervals we let
