initialrate measurements are used extensively for other types of reactions the method of initial rates is usually less effective than alternative methods to illustrate the application of the method suppose we have a reaction and that we are able to measure small changes in with good accuracy we seek a rate law of the form for any given experiment we approximate by and approximate the average concentrations of the reagents over the interval by their initial values and by carrying out an number of such experiments with suitably chosen initial concentrations we can determine the functional form of the rate
