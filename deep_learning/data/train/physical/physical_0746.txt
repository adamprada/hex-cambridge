increases the reaction rate by a factor of four implying that the rate is proportional to the second power of we infer that the rate law is given the form of the rate law an estimate of the value of the rate constant can be obtained from the data for each experiment for this illustration we calculate from each of the experiments rate laws for elementary processes last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics bimolecular elementary processestermolecular elementary processesunimolecular elementary processes bimolecular elementary processes if we think about
