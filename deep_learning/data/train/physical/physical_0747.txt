it is clear that this conclusion must apply to any bimolecular reaction if we have a vessel containing some concentration of molecules and some concentration of molecules the collection experiences some number of collisions per unit time if we double the concentration of molecules each molecule is twice as likely as before to encounter a molecule indeed for any increase in the concentration of molecules the number of collisions of an molecule with molecules increases in the same proportion the number of collisions must be proportional to the concentration of molecules likewise increasing the concentration of a molecules must increase
