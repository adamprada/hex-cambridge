rate at which such collisions occur is which is just times the rate at which collisions of any energy occur between molecules of type and molecules of type if reaction occurs at every collision between a molecule and a molecule in which the kinetic energy along the line of centers exceeds the collision rate equals the reaction rate we have if the temperaturedependence of the rate constant is given by the arrhenius equation the rate of the bimolecular reaction between species and species is where is independent of temperature and the collisiontheory model for the bimolecular reaction is almost the
