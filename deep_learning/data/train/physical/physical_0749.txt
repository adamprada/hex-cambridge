value is often much smaller than the calculated collision frequency we rationalize this observation by recognizing that our collidingspheres model provides no role for the effect of molecular structures when the colliding molecules are not spherical the collision angle is an incomplete description of their relative orientation if the relative orientation of two colliding molecules is unfavorable to reaction it is entirely plausible that they can fail to react no matter how energetic their collision to recognize this effect we suppose that the reaction rate is proportional to a steric factor where represents the probability that a colliding pair of
