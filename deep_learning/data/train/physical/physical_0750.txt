moved by a reactant molecule in unit time is much less in solution than in a gas this decreases the probability that two reactant molecules will meet on the other hand once two reactant molecules near one another the solvent molecules tend to keep them together and they are likely to collide with one another many times before they finally drift apart this is known as the solventcage effect we can expect these effects to roughly offset one another termolecular elementary processes a termolecular elementary process is a reaction in which three reactant molecules collide for this to happen an
