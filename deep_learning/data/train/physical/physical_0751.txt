molecules is smaller than the number of collisions between two molecules the probability of a termolecular collision and hence the rate of a termolecular elementary process is proportional to the concentrations of all three reacting species however the low probability of a termolecular collision means that we can expect the termolecular rate constant to be very small if termolecular mechanisms are rare highermolecularity mechanisms must be exceedingly rare if indeed any occur at all for most chemical reactions the mechanism is a series of unimolecular and bimolecular elementary reactions unimolecular elementary processes a unimolecular elementary process is one in which
