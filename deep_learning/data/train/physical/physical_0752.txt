of moles that react in time is so that dividing by the volume of the system we have in the limit that the term on the left becomes the reaction rate and since we have thus a constant reaction probability implies that a unimolecular reaction has a firstorder rate law if the volume is constant we have the idea that a unimolecular reaction corresponds to a constant reaction probability can be rationalized by introducing a simple model of the reaction process this model assumes that reactant molecules have a distribution of energies that only molecules whose energies exceed some minimum
