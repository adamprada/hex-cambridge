a subsequent one reaction can occur only if the excess energy reaches the specific internal motion before the molecule undergoes a deactivating collision we return to these ideas in and in summary only two kinds of elementary processes are needed to develop a mechanism for nearly any chemical change these elementary processes and their rate laws are unimolecular a bimolecular a b finally we should note that we develop these rate laws for elementary processes under the assumption that the rate at which molecules collide is proportional to the concentrations of the colliding species in doing so we implicitly assume
