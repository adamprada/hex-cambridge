passage of sufficient time the concentrations of the various species present in the reactor become constant we say that the reactor contains steadystate concentrations of the reactants and products when the reactor reaches this steady state processes that increase reagent concentrations are occurring at the same rate as processes that decrease them let the reaction be of the form the concentrations of the reagents in the feed solution are known let the concentration of in the fresh feed solution be let the rate at which fresh reagentcontaining solution is fed to the reactor be homogeneous reaction mixture is withdrawn from
