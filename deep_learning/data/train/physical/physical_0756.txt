the reactor changes since all of the reaction occurs within the vessel and the vessel is entirely filled with the solution is also the number of moles of consumed by reaction per unit time per unit volume of solution at steady state the number of moles of in the reactor is determined by the number of moles of entering the reactor per unit time the number of moles of being consumed by reaction per unit time and the number of moles of leaving the reactor in the effluent stream per unit time in unit time the number of moles entering
