a series of experiments in which the steadystate concentrations of the various reactants and products vary for each experiment it is necessary to determine both the reaction rate and the steadystate concentration of each reagent that might be involved in the rate law using the equation above the rate is calculated from the difference between a reagent concentration in the feed solution and its steadystate concentration in the reactor the concentration of each reagent in the effluent is the same as its concentration in the reactor so the necessary concentration information can be obtained by chemical analysis of the effluent
