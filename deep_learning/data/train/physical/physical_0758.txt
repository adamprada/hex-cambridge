of reactions by knowing the reaction enthalpy for constituent reactions the enthalpy of a reaction that can be expressed as the sum of the constituent reactions can be calculated the key lies in the canceling of reactants and products that ccur in the data reactions but not in the target reaction example find for the reaction given with with solution the target reaction can be generated from the data reactions plus equals cog og rightarrow cog so standard enthalpy of formation one of the difficulties with many thermodynamic state variables such as enthalpy is that while it is possible to
