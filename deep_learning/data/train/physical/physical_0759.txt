using this definition a convenient reaction for which enthalpies can be measured and tabulated is the standard formation reaction this is a reaction which forms one mole of the substance of interest in its standard state from elements in their standard states the enthalpy of a standard formation reaction is the standard enthalpy of formation some examples are with with it is important to note that the standard state of a substance is temperature dependent for example the standard state of water at c is solid whereas the standard state at room temperature is liquid once these values are tabulated
