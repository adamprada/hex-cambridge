ionization potential with the removal of subsequent electrons requires energies called the nd ionization potential rd ionization potential and so on with with an atom can have as many ionization potentials as it has electrons although since very highly charged ions are rare only the first few are important for most atoms similarly the electron affinity can be defined for the formation of negative ions in this case the first electron affinity is defined by with the minus sign is included in the definition in order to make electron affinities mostly positive some atoms such as noble gases will have
