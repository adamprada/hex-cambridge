are formed as an example consider the combustion of ethanol in this reaction five ch bonds one cc bond and one co bond and one oo bond must be broken also four co bonds and one oh bond are formed bond average bond energy kjmol ch cc co oo co oh the reaction enthalpy is then given by beginalign delta hc kjmol kjmol kjmol nonumber kjmol kjmol kjmol nonumber kjmol endalign because the bond energies are defined for gasphase reactants and products this method does not account for the enthalpy change of condensation to form liquids or solids and so
