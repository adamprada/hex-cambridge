no headers chemical reactions occur under a wide variety of circumstances many chemicals are manufactured by passing a homogeneous mixture of gaseous reactants through a bed of solid catalyst pellets corrosion of metals is a reaction between the solid metal and oxygen from the air often catalyzed by other common chemical species like water or chloride ion an enormous number of biological reactions occur within the cells of living organisms in the laboratory we typically initiate a reaction by mixing the reactants often with a solvent in a temperaturecontrolled vessel chemical reactions can be carried out in batch reactors and
