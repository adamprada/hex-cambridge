which reaction mixture is continuously withdrawn the contents of this container are constantly stirred in our discussion we assume that the reactor is completely filled with a homogeneous liquid solution we express the rate of reaction within the cstr in moles per liter of reactor volume per second when we talk about the rate of a particular reaction we intend to specify the amount of chemical change that occurs in unit time because of that reaction it is usually advantageous to specify the amount of chemical change in units of moles we can specify the amount of chemical change by
