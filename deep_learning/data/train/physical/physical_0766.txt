most convenient units are usually concentration per second for reactors containing heterogeneous catalysts we typically express the reaction rate in moles per unit volume of catalyst bed per second for corrosion of a metal surface we often express the rate in moles per unit area per second for biological reactions we might express the reaction rate in moles per gram of biological tissue per second for reactions in liquid solutions we typically express the rate in moles per liter of reaction mixture per second or evidently we need to express the rate of a reaction in a way that accounts
