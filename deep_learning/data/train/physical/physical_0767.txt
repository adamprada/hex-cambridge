open system can vary with time since the system is closed the reaction is the is the only process that can change the amount of that is present let be the increase in the number of moles of in a short interval that includes time let the average rate at which the number of moles of increases in this interval be the corresponding instantaneous rate is to express this information per unit volume we can define the instantaneous rate of reaction of at time as experimental studies of reaction rate are typically done in constantvolume closed systems under conditions in
