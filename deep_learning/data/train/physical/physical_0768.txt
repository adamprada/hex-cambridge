satisfied if both and vary with time we have the instantaneous rate at which substance undergoes a particular reaction is equal to only if the reaction is the sole process that changes the contribution to made by vanishes only if the volume is constant if a single reaction is the only process that occurs in a particular system the rate at which the number of moles of any reactant or product changes is a measure of the rate of the reaction however these rates depend on the stoichiometric coefficients and the size of the system for a reaction of specified
