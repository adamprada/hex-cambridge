moles of a reactant divided by the negative of the reactants stoichiometric coefficient for the stoichiometry we have if is the limiting reagentlimiting reagent varies from zero when the reaction is initiated with to when at any time we have and we can define a unique reaction rate as the relationship between the instantaneous rate at which reactant undergoes this reaction and the reaction rate is if the volume is constant we have and the reaction rate is the name extent of reaction is sometimes given to the fraction of the stoichiometrically possible reaction that has occurred to distinguish this
