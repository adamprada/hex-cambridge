one we talk about the order in a chemical species and the order of the reaction to characterize the rate law above we say that the reaction is order in compound order in compound order in compound and order in compound we also say that the reaction is order overall here is an experimentally determined parameter that we call the rate constant or rate coefficient it frequently happens that we are interested in an overall chemical change whose stoichiometric mechanism involves two or more elementary reactions in this case an exact rate model includes a differential equation for each elementary
