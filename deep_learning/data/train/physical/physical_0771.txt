appears in a rate law a rate constant in a complex rate law the constants can often be presented in more than one way in the example above we can divide numerator and denominator by say to obtain a representation in which the constant coefficients have different values one of which is unity most of the rest of this chapter is devoted to understanding the relationship between an observed overall reaction rate and the rates of the elementary processes that contribute to it our principal objective is to understand chemical equilibrium rates at in terms of competing forward and reverse
