the prediction of large numbers of properties and behaviors for gases there are a number of times that deviations from ideality are extremely important the van der waals equation several equations of state have been suggested to account for the deviations from ideality one simple but useful expression is that proposed by johannes diderik van der waals johannes diderik van der waals biographical figure johannes van der waals van der waals equation introduced corrections to the pressure and volume terms of the ideal gas law in order to account for intermolecular interactions and molecular size respectively or in this expression
