case of every scientific model some other useful twoparameter and threeparameter or more equations of state include the redlichkwong dieterici and clausius models table these have the advantage that they allow for temperature dependence on some of the parameters which as will be seen later is necessary to model certain behaviors of real gases table other equations of state model equation of state ideal van der waals van der waals j d redlichkwong redlich kwong dieterici dieterici clausius virial equations the virial equation a very handy expression that allows for deviations from ideal behavior is the virial equation of state
