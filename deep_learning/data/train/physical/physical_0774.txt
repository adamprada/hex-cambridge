predict the value of the second virial coefficient the leonardjones potential an intermolecular potential function is used to describe the interactions between molecules these interactions will have to include attractive forces which will draw molecules together and repulsive forces which will push them apart if the molecules are hard spheres lacking any attractive interactions the potential function is fairly simple in this function is determined by the size of the molecules if two molecules come within a distance of one another they collide bouncing off in a perfectly elastic collision real molecules however with have a range of intermolecular separations
