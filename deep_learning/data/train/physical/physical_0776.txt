given by the boyle temperature a useful way in which deviations from ideality can be expressed is by defining the compression factor given by where is the molar volume for an ideal gas under all combinations of and however real gases will show some deviation although all gases approach ideal behavior at low p high vm and high t the compression factor for nitrogen at several temperatures is shown below over a range of pressures figure compressibility of select gases as a function of applied pressure as can be seen the gas behaves closer to ideally over a longer range
