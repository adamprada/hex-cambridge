should make some sense given that the first virial coefficient provides most of the deviation from the ideal gas law and so it must vanish as the gas behaves more ideally critical behavior the isotherms lines of constant temperature of co reveal a very large deviation from ideal behavior at high temperatures co behaves according to boyles law however at lower temperatures the gas begins to condense to form a liquid at high pressures at one specific temperature the critical temperature the isotherm begins to display this critical behavior the temperature pressure and molar volume and at this point define
