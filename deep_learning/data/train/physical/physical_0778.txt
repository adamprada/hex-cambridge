used in this fashion to determine the values of the molecular parameters used in an equation of state such as the van der waals equation for a given substance the principle of corresponding states the principle of corresponding states was proposed by van der waals in van der waals j d he noted that the compression factor at the critical point is very nearly the same for any substance this is consistent with what is predicted by the van der waals equation which predicts irrespective of substance further it can be noted that based on reduced variables defined by several
