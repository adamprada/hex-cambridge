expand on the qualifications with which we begin this chapter we imagine that the results of a large number of experiments are available for our analysis our characterization of these results has been that all gases obey the same equationsboyles law charles law and the ideal gas equationand do so exactly this is an oversimplification in fact they are always approximations they are approximately true for all gases under all reasonable conditions but they are not exactly true for any real gas under any condition it is useful to introduce the idea of hypothetical gases that obey the classical gas
