limit as the pressure goes to zero this is an important observation that we use extensively at any given pressure and temperature the ideal gas laws are better approximations for a compound that has a lower boiling point than they are for a compound with a higher boiling point another way of saying this is that they are better approximations for molecules that are weakly attracted to one another than they are for molecules that are strongly attracted to one another forces between molecules cause them to both attract and repel one another the net effect depends on the distance
