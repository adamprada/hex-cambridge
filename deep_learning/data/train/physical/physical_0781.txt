only equation that gives a useful representation for the interrelation of gas pressurevolumetemperature data there are many such equations of state they are all approximations but each can be a particularly useful approximation in particular circumstances we discuss van der waals equation equation and the virial equations later in this chapter nevertheless we use the ideal gas equation extensively we will see that much of chemical thermodynamics is based on the behavior of ideal gases since there are no ideal gases this may seem odd at best if there are no ideal gases why do we waste time talking about
