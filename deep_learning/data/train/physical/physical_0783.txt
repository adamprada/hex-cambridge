reversible expansion of an ideal gas is fairly easy to calculate if the gas expands reversibly the external pressure can be replaced by a single value which represents both the pressure of the gas and the external pressure or but now that the external pressure is not constant cannot be extracted from the integral fortunately however there is a simple relationship that tells us how changes with changing the equation of state if the gas is assumed to be an ideal gas and if the temperature is held constant so that the expansion follows an isothermal pathway the nrt term
