can be depicted graphically as the area under the pv curve depicting the expansion comparing examples and for which the initial and final volumes were the same and the constant external pressure of the irreversible expansion was the same as the final pressure of the reversible expansion such a graph looks as follows the work is depicted as the shaded portion of the graph it is clear to see that the reversible expansion the work for which is shaded in both light and dark gray exceeds that of the irreversible expansion shaded in dark gray only due to the changing
