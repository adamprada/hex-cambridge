an ideal gas can store this energy is in the translational kinetic energy of the molecules otherwise molecular collisions would not need to be elastic which as you recall was a postulate of the kinetic molecular theory and since the average kinetic energy is a function only of the temperature it and therefore can only change if there is a change in temperature hence for any isothermal process for an ideal gas and perhaps just as usefully for an isothermal process involving an ideal gas as any energy that is expended by doing work must be replaced with heat lest
