are considered the following important result is obtained however since the volume is constant as such can be expressed only in terms of the heat that flows into or out of the system at constant volume recall that can be found by this suggests an important definition for the constant volume heat capacity which is when equation refeq is integrated the example isochoric pathway consider mol of an ideal gas with that undergoes a temperature change from k to k at a constant volume of l calculate and for this change solution since this is a constant volume process equation
