capacity example isobaric gas expansion consider mol of an ideal gas with that changes temperature change from k to k at a constant pressure of atm calculate and for this change solution assuming is independent of temperature so via equation refheat specifically the integrated version of it using differences instead of differentials now that and are determined then work can be calculated it makes sense that is negative since this process is an gas expansion example isothermal gas expansion calculate and for mol of an ideal gas expanding reversibly and isothermally at k from a volume of l and a
