and on what will it depend the key to answering these questions comes in the solution to how we calculate the work done if the adiabatic expansion is reversible and done on an ideal gas and equating these two terms yields using the ideal gas law for an expression for and rearranging to gather the temperature terms on the right and volume terms on the left yields this expression can be integrated on the left between and and on the right between and assuming that is independent of temperature over the range of integration it can be pulled from the
