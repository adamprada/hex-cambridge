vacuum chamber so that the system we study experimentally better meets the assumptions we make in our analysis alternatively we could expand our theory to include the effects of atmospheric drag to raise an initially stationary bowling ball to a greater height requires that we apply a vertical upward force that exceeds the downward gravitational force on the ball let height increase in the upward direction and let and be the height and vertical velocity of the ball at time let the mass of the ball be and let the ball be at rest at time zero representing the initial
