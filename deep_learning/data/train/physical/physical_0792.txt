that its velocity becomes zero at exactly the time that it reaches there are infinitely many ways we could apply forces to meet these conditions the net change in the balls energy is the same for all of them we find it useful to use a hypothetical process to calculate this energy change in this hypothetical process the upward force is always just sufficient to oppose the gravitational force on the ball that is so that and from the development above and of course this is a hypothetical process because the ball would not actually move under these conditions we
