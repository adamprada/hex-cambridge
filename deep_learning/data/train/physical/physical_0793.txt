the direction of motion the advantage of working with the hypothetical reversible process is that the integral of the applied force over the distance through which it acts is the change in the potential energy of the system while we cannot actually carry out a reversible process we can compute the work that must be done if we know the limiting force that is required in order to effect the change this is true because the velocity and kinetic energy of the ball are zero throughout the process when the process is reversible the change in the potential energy of
