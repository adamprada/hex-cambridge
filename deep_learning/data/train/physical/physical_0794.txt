seldom find a need to do so for systems in which the motion of the whole system is important the laws of mechanics are usually sufficient we find out what we want to know about such systems by solving their equations of motion when we discuss the first law of thermodynamics we write or for the energy change that accompanies some physical change in a system since chemical applications rarely require that we consider the location of the system or the speed with which it may be moving usually encompasses only work that changes the energy of the system itself
