system and its surroundings when we use a piston to compress a gas in a cylinder we must apply sufficient inward force on the piston to overcome the outward force applied by the gas in any real system it is necessary also to overcome the force of friction in order to slide the piston into the cylinder we ignore friction imagining that we can make its effects arbitrarily small the gas can be compressed only if the applied pressure exceeds the gas pressure if the applied pressure equals the gas pressure the piston remains stationary if the applied pressure is
