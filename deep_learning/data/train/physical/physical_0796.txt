in any real experiment we must have and any real experiment is necessarily irreversible in a reversible experiment we have and the reversible work is for one mole of an ideal gas we have since the temperature is constant the reversible isothermal work becomes where and are the initial and final volumes of the gas respectively this has a straightforward graphical interpretation for an ideal gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to as sketched in figure the reversible work corresponds to the area between this curve and the abscissa and between the initial and the final gas volumes figure
