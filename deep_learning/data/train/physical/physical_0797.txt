process the shaded area in figure represents the work done on the gas when the applied pressure is instantaneously decreased to the final pressure attained by the gas in the reversible process for the reversible process the pressurevolume curve accurately depicts the state of the gas as the volume increase takes place the temperature of the gas is constant along this curve while we can trace a similar line of pressurevolume points for the irreversible expansion this line does not define a set of intermediate states that the system occupies during the irreversible expansion the state of the gas is
