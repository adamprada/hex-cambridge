state of the spontaneous process are the same as those for the equilibrium initial state of the reversible process so long as we can say that the process takes the system from the same initial state to the same final state a similar argument can be made for reversible and irreversible work of any kind whatever the force the isothermal reversible work done on the system is always less than the irreversible work for taking the system between the same two states this is an important result in chapter we find that it is a logical consequence of the second
