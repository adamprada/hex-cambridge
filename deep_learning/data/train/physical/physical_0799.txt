have and the system temperature varies continuously around the closed path the work done on the system as it traverses the highpressure segment from to is represented in figure by area figure reversible pressurevolume work in a cycle we have the work done on the system as it traverses the lowpressure segment from to is represented by area we have when the lowpressure segment is traversed in the opposite direction we have when the system traverses the cycle in the counterclockwise direction the net work done on the system is thus the net work done on the system is represented
