arbitrarily close to one another in the sense that the successive values of every thermodynamic are arbitrarily close to one another these suppositions are equivalent to assuming that the state of the system and the value of every thermodynamic variable are continuous functions of time then every thermodynamic variable is either constant or a continuous function of other thermodynamic variables when we talk about a reversible process we have in mind a physical system that behaves in this way and in which an arbitrarily small change in one of the thermodynamic variables can reverse the direction in which other thermodynamic
