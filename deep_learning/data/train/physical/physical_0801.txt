transfer heat to the system only when the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the system however if the process is to be reversible this temperature difference must be arbitrarily small so that heat can be made to flow from the system to the surroundings by an arbitrarily small decrease in the temperature of the surroundings similar considerations apply when the process involves the exchange of work between system and surroundings we focus on changes in which the work exchanged between system and surroundings is pressurevolume work a process can occur reversibly only if the pressure of
