process they are not sufficient a spontaneous process can occur under conditions in which the system temperature is arbitrarily close to the temperature of the surroundings and the system pressure is arbitrarily close to the applied pressure consider a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in a cylinder closed by a frictionless piston we suppose that the surroundings are maintained at a constant temperature and that the surroundings apply a constant pressure to the piston we suppose that the system contains a small quantity of a poorly effective catalyst by controlling the activity of the catalyst we can arrange for the
