these are exactly the same functions as we plotted earlier when we graphed the and orbitals the energy eigenvalues corresponding to each such eigenfunction are given as ej frachbar jjmu r b jj and are independent of thus each energy level is labeled by and is fold degenerate because ranges from to again this is just like we saw when we looked at the hydrogen orbitals the p orbitals are fold degenerate and the d orbitals are fold degenerate the socalled rotational constant defined as depends on the molecules bond length and reduced mass spacings between successive rotational levels which
