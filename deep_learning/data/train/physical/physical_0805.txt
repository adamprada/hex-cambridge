molecule gives rise to changes in which are then reflected in changes in the rotational energy levels ie there are different values for different vibrational levels the coupling between rotational and vibrational motion gives rise to rotational constants that depend on vibrational state as well as dynamical couplings called centrifugal distortions which cause the total rovibrational energy of the molecule to depend on rotational and vibrational quantum numbers in a nonseparable manner within this rigid rotor model the absorption spectrum of a rigid diatomic molecule should display a series of peaks each of which corresponds to a specific transition the
