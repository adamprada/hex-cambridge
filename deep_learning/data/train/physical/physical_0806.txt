the energy of this level by the boltzmann formula where is the rotational partition function for low values of the degeneracy is low and the factor is near unity as increases the degeneracy grows linearly but the factor decreases more rapidly as a result there is a value of given by taking the derivative of with respect to and setting it equal to zero at which the intensity of the rotational transition is expected to reach its maximum this behavior is clearly displayed in the above figure the eigenfunctions belonging to these energy levels are the spherical harmonics which are
