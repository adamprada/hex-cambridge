rotational kinetic energy the classical rotational kinetic energy for a rigid polyatomic molecule is where the are the three principal moments of inertia of the molecule the eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor this tensor has elements in a cartesian coordinate system whose origin is located at the center of mass of the molecule that can be computed as ikk sumj mj rj rkj hspacecm textfor k k ikk sumj mj rkj rkj hspacecm textfor k ne k as discussed in more detail in r n zare angular momentum john wiley new york the components of the corresponding quantum
