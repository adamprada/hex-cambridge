values are identical the molecule is termed a spherical top in this case the total rotational energy can be expressed in terms of the total angular momentum operator as a result the eigenfunctions of are those of and as well as both of which commute with and with one another is the component of along the labfixed axis and commutes with because and act on different angles the energies associated with such eigenfunctions are ejkm frachbar jji for all ie quantum numbers ranging from to in unit steps and for all ie quantum numbers ranging from to each energy level
