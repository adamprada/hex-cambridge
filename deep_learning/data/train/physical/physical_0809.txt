molecule is an oblate symmetric top an american football is prolate and a frisbee is oblate again the rotational kinetic energy which is the full rotational hamiltonian can be written in terms of the total rotational angular momentum operator and the component of angular momentum along the axis with the unique principal moment of inertia here the moment of inertia i denotes that moment that is common to two directions that is i is the nonunique moment of inertia as a result the eigenfunctions of are those of and or and of and the corresponding energy levels are ejkm frachbar
