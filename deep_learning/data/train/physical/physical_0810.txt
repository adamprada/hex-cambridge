they do not require any further discussion at this time iii asymmetric tops the rotational eigenfunctions and energy levels of a molecule for which all three principal moments of inertia are distinct a socalled asymmetric top cannot analytically be expressed in terms of the angular momentum eigenstates and the and quantum numbers in fact no one has ever solved the corresponding schr√∂dinger equation for this case however given the three principal moments of inertia and a matrix representation of each of the three contributions to the rotational hamiltonian can be formed within a basis set of the rotationmatrix functions discussed
