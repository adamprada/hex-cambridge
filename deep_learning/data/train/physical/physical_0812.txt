proceeds a reacting species could diffuse into a reactor across a semipermeable membrane controlled amounts of a reacting species could be added either continuously or at specified intervals each of the simultaneous processes contributes to the change in the number of moles of present at every instant each of these contributions can be characterized by a rate over a short time interval let be the contribution that the process makes to the change in the amount of in volume if even though the process may not be a reaction we use to represent its rate its contribution to the rate
