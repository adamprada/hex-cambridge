of these individual processes can be expressed as and but the rates at which the concentrations of hydroxide ion and iodide ion change depend on the rates of both reactions we have in principle either of the reaction rates can be measured by finding the change over a short time interval in the number of moles of a particular substance present simultaneous processes occur when a reaction does not go to completion the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate can reach equilibrium before the limiting reactant is completely consumed the reaction rate defined as falls to zero however ethyl acetate molecules continue
