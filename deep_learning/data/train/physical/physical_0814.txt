be ambiguous to refer to the reaction or the rate of reaction the rates of the forward and of the net reaction are distinctly different things so long as no intermediate species accumulate to significant concentrations in the reaction mixture we can find the forward and reverse rates for a reaction like this at any particular equilibrium composition in a straightforward way when we initiate reaction with no acetic acid or ethanol present the rate of the reverse reaction must be zero we can find the rate law for the forward reaction by studying the rate of the hydrolysis reaction
