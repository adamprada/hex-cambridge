solid phase that is mostly compound a and a liquid phase which contains both a and b a sample in region ii such as the temperaturecomposition combination depicted by point b will consist of two phases is a liquid mixture of a and b with a composition given by that at point a and the other is a single phase solid that is mostly pure compound b but with traces of a entrained within it as always the lever rule applies in determining the relative amounts of material in the two phases in the case where the widths of the
