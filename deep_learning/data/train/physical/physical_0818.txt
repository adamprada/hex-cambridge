diagram will look like figure figure a simplified phase diagram of a twocomponent system that exhibits an eutectic point in this diagram the vertical boundary at is indicative of the compound formed by and from the mole fraction of it is evident that the formula of compound is the reaction that forms compound c is thus at overall compositions where there is excess compound a b is the limiting reagent and for there is an excess of compound is now the limiting reagent with this in mind the makeup of the sample in each region can be summarized as two
