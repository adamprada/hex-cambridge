other words it will decompose upon melting as a result the phase diagram will take a lightly different form as is shown in figure figure a phase diagram of a twocomponent system that exhibits incongruent melting in this diagram the formula of the stable compound is consistent with but you will notice that the boundary separating the two twophase solid regions does not extend all of the way to the single phase liquid portion of the diagram this is because the compound will decompose upon melting the process of decomposition upon melting is also called incongruent melting the makeup of
