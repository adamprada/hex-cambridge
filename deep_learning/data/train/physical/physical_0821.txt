integrable form that can be used to see how solubility will vary with temperature so if the enthalpy of fusion is constant over the temperature range of to the temperature of interest and will give the mole fraction of the solute in a saturated solution at the temperature the value depends on both the enthalpy of fusion and the normal melting point of the solute contributors and attributions patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay solubility of ionic compounds last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry
