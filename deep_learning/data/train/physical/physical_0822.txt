x so the equilibrium expression is example common ion what is the maximum solubility of at c in m nas with solution in this problem we need to consider the existence of saq from the complete dissociation of the strong electrolyte nas an ice table will help as usual initial m change x x equilibrium x m x given the miniscule magnitude of the solubility product x will be negligibly small compared to ms the equilibrium expression is the huge reduction in solubility is due to the common ion effect the existence of sulfide in the solution due to sodium
