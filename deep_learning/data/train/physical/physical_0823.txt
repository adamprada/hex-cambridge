c c from normalization c c c c c c c and therefore c for the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue c c c c c c c again the second row offers no new information c c from normalization c c c c c c c and therefore c therefore the eigenvector matrix becomes b first determine the eigenvalues det det det from a the solutions then become and next determine the eigenvectors first the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue the third root c c row one c c c c row two c c c c again the third row
