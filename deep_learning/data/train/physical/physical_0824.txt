c c c c c c c note again two equations in three unknowns cc cc cc from orthogonalization now there are five equations with six unknowns arbitrarily choose c whenever there are degenerate eigenvalues there are not unique eigenvectors because the degenerate eigenvectors span a or more dimensional space not two unique directions one always is then forced to choose one of the coefficients and then determine all the rest different choices lead to different final eigenvectors but to identical spaces spanned by these eigenvectors c c c c cc cc cc from orthogonalization c c c c and
