of the many coefficients gives the following yz sinq cosf yz yz xz sinq sinf xz xz xy cosq xy and xy upon substitution of these coefficients sinq cosf sinq sinf and cosq next and from the chain rule qf qf qf rf rf rf and rq rq rq again evaluation of the the many coefficients results in qf qf qf rf rf rf rq y rq x and rq upon substitution of these coefficients y x note these many coefficients are the elements which make up the jacobian matrix used whenever one wishes to transform a function from one
