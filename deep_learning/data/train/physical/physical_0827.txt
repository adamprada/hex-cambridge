and x directions allows us to analyze the orbitals as follows the core o s o s combination is an a orbital whereas the o s o s combination is a b orbital the valence orbitals are o s o s a o s o s b o px o px b o px o px a o py o py a o py o py b o pz o pz b o pz o pz a h s h s a and finally the h s h s b iv for the next two problems we will use the
