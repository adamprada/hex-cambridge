atoms this results in a very large dx this implies that it is extremely difficult for he atoms to vibrate with small displacement as a solid even as absolute zero is approached a w w e making this substitution results in the following three integrals w a a w a b optimize b by evaluating b so b or b and b substituting this value of b into the expression for w gives w a a pam pam am am am which is in error by only a h kx f a for a x a f for x Â³
