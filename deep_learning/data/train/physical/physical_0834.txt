when l and m otherwise vanishes from orthonormality in quantum chemistry when using orthonormal functions it is typical to write the term as a delta function for example dlm which only has values of or dij when i j and when i ¹ j this delta function when inserted into the sum then eliminates the sum by picking out the nonzero component for example dlm so e e and e inserting these energy expressions above yields e c e e e e a d a a r xcm r å ah å acs å the above diagram indicates how the
