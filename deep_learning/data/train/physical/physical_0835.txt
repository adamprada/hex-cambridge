an orbital correlation diagram but can be used to help generate one the energy levels on each side c and h can be superimposed to generate the reactant side of the orbital correlation diagram and the center ch levels can be used to form the product side ignoring the core levels this generates the following orbital correlation diagram a the two f p orbitals top and bottom generate the following reducible representation dh e c c sh s sv gp this reducible representation reduces to a and a irreducible representations projectors may be used to find the symmetryadapted aos for
