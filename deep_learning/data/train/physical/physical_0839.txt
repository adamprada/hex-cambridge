cv point group for example pxapza is xz b and pyapza is yz b and hence the pmlms state is a combination of b and b symmetries but the three pmlms functions are degenerate for the c atom and any combination of these three functions would also be degenerate therefore we can choose new combinations that can be labeled with pure cv point group labels pxzms pxapza b pyxms pyapxa a pyzms pyapza b now we can do likewise for the five degenerate d states dmlms papb ab dmlms papb ab dmlms dmlms dmlms ab analogous to the three p
