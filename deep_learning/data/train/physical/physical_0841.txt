cs symmetry would make the a and b orbitals identical in symmetry a the b orbitals would maintain their different symmetry going to a symmetry thus b and a both a in cs symmetry and odd under reflection through the molecular plane can mix the system could thus follow the a component of the cp h surface to the place marked with a circle on the ccd where it crosses the b surface upon which it then moves and continues to products as a result the barrier would be lowered you can estimate when the barrier occurs late or early
