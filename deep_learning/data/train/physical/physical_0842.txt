products this problem in many respects is analogous to problem the b surface certainly requires a two configuration ci wavefunction the ssnpx ppyspx and the snpxs pspxpz the a surface could use the ssn pspy only but once again there is no combination of d determinants which gives purely this configuration pspy thus mixing of both d and s determinants are necessary to yield the required pspy configuration hence even the a surface would require a multiconfigurational wavefunction for adequate description configuration correlation diagram for the reaction ch c ch a ccl is tetrahedral and therefore is a spherical top
