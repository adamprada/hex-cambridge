the spherical harmonics results in only sstates having nonzero values for anm we can then drop the y integrating this term will only result in unity in determining the value of ass ynr ys e remember for js z and for ys z anm e e rdr anm e rdr anm we obtain anm anm anm anm the transition probability is the square of this amplitude tnm for z the difference in these two results parts a and b will become negligible at large values of z when the perturbation becomes less significant than in the case of z is
