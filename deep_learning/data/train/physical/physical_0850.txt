can exert no torque that twists the molecule about this axis as a result the light can not induce transitions that excite the molecules spinning motion about this axis a b atom ssp p ground state l s gives a degeneracy ls of o atom ssp p ground state l s gives a degeneracy ls of the total number of states formed is then b we need only consider the p orbitals to find the low lying molecular states which in reality look like this this is the correct ordering to give a s ground state the only lowlying electron
