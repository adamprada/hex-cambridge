g the ground state bo is s corresponding to a p electron configuration an electron configuration of p s leads to a p and a p state the p will be lower in energy a p s configuration will lead to higher lying states of s d and s h there should be bands corresponding to formation of bo in the s p and p states since each of these involves removing a bonding electron the franckconden integrals will be appreciable for several vibrational levels and thus a vibrational progression should be observed a the bending p vibration is degenerate
