the starting guess mo coefficients on disk using the program mocoefs it asks us for the first and second mo vectors we input for the first mo this means that the first mo is times the he s orbital plus times the h s orbital this bonding mo is more likely to be heavily weighted on the atom having the higher nuclear charge and for the second our beginning lcaomo array looks like and is placed on disk in a file we choose to call mocoefsdat we also put the ao integrals on disk using the program rwints it asks
