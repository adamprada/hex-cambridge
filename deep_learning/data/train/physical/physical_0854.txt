the following manner since s is symmetric and positive definite we can find an ssuch that ss ss s etc rewrite fc sce by inserting unity between fc and multiplying the whole equation on the left by s this gives sfssc ssce sce letting f sfs c sc and inserting these expressions above give fc ce note that to get the next iterations mo coefficients we must calculate c from c c sc so multiplying through on the left by sgives sc ssc c this will be the method we will use to solve our fock equations find sby using
