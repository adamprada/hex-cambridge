linear term is much larger than those of the cubic and higher terms g the converged scf total energy calculated using the result of problem is an upper bound to the ground state energy but during the iterative procedure it is not only at convergence does the expectation value of the hamiltonian for the hartree fock determinant become equal to that given by the equation in problem h yes the s configuration does dissociate properly because at at r the lowest energy state is he h which also has a s orbital occupancy ie s on he and s on
