operator in the mo basis these can be obtained by calculating them by hand they are more easily obtained by using the trans program put the e ao integrals on disk by running the program rwints in this case you are inserting z z and z insert for all the e integrals call the output file aodipoleints for example the converged moao coefficients should be in a file mocoefsdat is fine the transformed integrals can be written to a file name of your choice for example modipoleints these matrix elements are z z z the excitation energies are e e
