s to normalize we divide by s s in the x ci we obtained s s j the expression for the nd order rspt is e au comparing the x ci energy obtained to the scf result we have au sto total energy stog total energy g total energy the stog orbitals were generated as a best fit of primitive gaussians giving cgto to the sto so stog can at best reproduce the sto result the g orbitals are more flexible since there are cgtos per atom this gives orbitals more parameters to optimize and a lower total energy r
