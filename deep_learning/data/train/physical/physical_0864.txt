to be of the order of constructing the slater determinant corresponding to the state sasa with the rows labeling the orbitals and the columns labeling the electron gives sasa starting with the ms s state which in a box for this ml ms case would contain only one product function sasa and applying s gives s ssms ssms ssms sasa ssasa ssasa sbsa sasb so ssms ssms the three triplet states are then ssms sasa ssms and ssms sbsb the singlet state which must be constructed orthogonal to the three singlet states and in particular to the ssms state can
