ml one state ms and s ml three states ms and by inspecting the box in problem c it should be fairly straightforward to write down the wavefunctions for each of these d ml papb d ml papb s ml s ml ms papa s ml ms s ml ms pbpb we can conveniently couple another s electron to the states generated from the ss configuration sl s with sl s giving l s s states and s states sl s with sl s giving l s s states constructing a box for this case would yield ml ms sasasa
