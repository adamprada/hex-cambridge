recognized as ssms ssms ssms ssms as illustrated in problem a p configuration two equivalent p electrons gives rise to the term symbols p d and s coupling an additional electron d to this p configuration will give the desired sspd term symbols pls with dls generates l and s with term symbols f fd dp and p dls with dls generates l and swith term symbols g f d p and s sls with dls generates l and swith term symbol d the notation used for the slater condon rules will be as follows a zero spin orbital difference
