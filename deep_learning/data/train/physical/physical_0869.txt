i would need x x fpos at x fpos per second this will require seconds or a little over eight minutes e because the statistical fluctuations in mc calculations are proportional to n where n is the number of steps taken i will have to take times as many steps to cut the statistical errors in half so this will require x seconds or seconds f if we have one million rather than one thousand atoms the second calculation of part d would require times as much time this ratio arises because the time to compute the change in potential
