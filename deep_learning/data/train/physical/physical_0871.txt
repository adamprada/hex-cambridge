rotations and five vibrations recall that one vibration is missing and is the reaction coordinate in the adsorbed state no has translations one rotation and three vibrations cl has translations one rotation and three vibrations the nocl ts which is bent has translations one rotation and eight vibrations again one vibration is missing and is the reaction coordinate so in computing the partition function ratio qtsvqnov qclv for the adsorbed and gasphase cases one does not obtain the same number of translational rotational and vibrational factors in particular the ratio of these factors for the adsorbed and gasphase cases gives
