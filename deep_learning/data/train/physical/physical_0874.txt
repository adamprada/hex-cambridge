is trapped in a potential well formed by its interactions with neighboring species this potential is denoted with the volumetonumber ratio written to keep in mind that it likely depends on the packing density ie the distances among neighbors within the crystal keep in mind that f represents the interaction of any specific atom ion or molecule with the other such species so not is the total interaction energy among all of the species the factor of is necessary to avoid double counting each such species is assumed to undergo local harmonic vibrational motions about its equilibrium position within the
