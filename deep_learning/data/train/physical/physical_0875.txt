in the denominator because unlike a gas of species each of these species atoms ions or molecules are constrained to stay put ie not free to roam independently in the trap induced by their neighbors in this sense the species are distinguishable rather than indistinguishable as they are in the gas case the factor arises when one asks what the total energy of the crystal is aside from its vibrational energy relative to separated species in other words what is the total cohesive energy of the crystal this energy is times the energy of any single species but as noted
