consistent with experimental observation that is careful experimental data shows that all crystal heat capacities approach zero proportional to at low temperature the einstein models approaches zero but not in the form found in experiments so although the einstein model offers a very useful model of how a crystals stability relates to and how its depends on vibrational frequencies of the phonon modes it does not work well at low temperatures nevertheless it remains a widely used model in which to understand the phonons contributions to thermodynamic properties as long as one does not attempt to extrapolate its predictions to
