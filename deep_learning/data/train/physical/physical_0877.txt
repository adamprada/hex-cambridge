of quantum states within a threedimensional box one can determine how many waves can fit within a cubic crystalline box having frequencies between and the approach to this problem is to express the allowed wave lengths and frequencies as where is the length of the box on each of its sides and is an integer this prescription forces all wave lengths to match the boundary condition for vanishing at the box boundaries then carrying out a count of how many waves have frequencies between and for a box whose sides are all equal gives the following expression the primary observation
