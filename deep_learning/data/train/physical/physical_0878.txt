over the frequencies weighted by the density of such states see the vibrational contribution to expressed in section where the integral over ranges from to nm it turns out that the heat capacity obtained by taking the temperature derivative of this expression for can be written as follows where the socalled debye function is defined by and the integral is taken from to the important thing to be noted about the debye model is that the heat capacity as defined above extrapolates to at high temperatures thus agreeing with the law of dulong and petit and varies at low temperature
