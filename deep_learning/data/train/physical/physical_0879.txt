are used frequency occurs nuj dfracpi sqrtdfrackjm each species in the crystal is assumed to vibrate at this frequency in contrast the debye model says that the species vibrate collectively and with frequencies ranging from n up to the socalled debye frequency which is proportional to the speed at which phonons propagate in the crystal in turn this speed depends on the stiffness ie the interspecies potentials within the crystal lattice theories of surfaces and liquids this kind of theory can be applied to a wide variety of chemical and physical problems so it is a very useful model to
