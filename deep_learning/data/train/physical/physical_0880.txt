a and b can represent situations in which the site is either occupied a or unoccupied b by a molecule that is chemisorbed or physisorbed to the site this point of view is taken when one applies lattice models to adsorption of gases or liquids to solid surfaces the sites can represent individual spin molecules or ions within a lattice and the states a and b can denote the a and b spin states of these species this point of view allows the lattice models to be applied to magnetic materials the sites can represent positions that either of two
