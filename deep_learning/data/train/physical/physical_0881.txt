dark a species and are occupied by lighter b species figure twodimensional lattice having sites with a and b species the partition function for such a lattice is written in terms of a degeneracy and an energy as usual the degeneracy is computed by considering the number of ways a total of species can be arranged on the lattice the interaction energy among the a and b species for any arrangement of the a and b on the lattice is assumed to be expressed in terms of pair wise interaction energies in particular if only nearest neighbor interaction energies are
