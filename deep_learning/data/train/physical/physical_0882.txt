of a and b species multiplied by the number of neighbors per species using the above relationships among and we can rewrite the interaction energy as the reason it is helpful to write in this manner is that it allows us to express things in terms of two variables over which one has direct experimental control and and one variable that characterizes the degree of disorder among the a and b species that is if is small the a and b species are arranged on the lattice in a phaseseparated manner whereas if is large the a and b are
