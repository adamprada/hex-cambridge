factors because as in the einstein and debye crystal models the a and b species are not free to roam but are tied to lattice sites and thus are distinguishable this expression for can be rewritten in a manner that is more useful by employing the earlier relationships for and where the quantity plays a central role in all lattice theories because it provides a measure of how different the ab interaction energy is from the average of the aa and bb interaction energies as we will soon see if is large and negative ie if the aa and bb
