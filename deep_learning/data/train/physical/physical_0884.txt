by a b species if mixing were random this approximation produces finally we realize that the sum is equal to the number of ways of arranging a species and b species on the lattice regardless of how many ab neighbor pairs there are this number is of course so the braggwilliams lattice model partition function reduces to the most common connection one makes to experimental measurements using this partition function arises by computing the chemical potentials of the a and b species on the lattice and equating these to the chemical potentials of the a and b as they exist
