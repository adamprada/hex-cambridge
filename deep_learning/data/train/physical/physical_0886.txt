interaction energies among various species as let us examine that physical meaning of the above result for the vapor pressure first if one were to totally ignore the interaction energies ie by taking one would obtain the well known raoults law expression for the vapor pressure of a mixture in figure i plot the a and b vapor pressures vs the two straight lines are of course just the raoults law findings i also plot the vapor pressure for three values of the interaction energy parameter when is positive meaning that the ab interactions are more energetically favorable than the
