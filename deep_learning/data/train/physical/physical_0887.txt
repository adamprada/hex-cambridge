that in such cases the function suggested in this braggwilliams model displays a behavior that suggests a phase transition may occur hints of this behavior are clear in figure where one of the plots displays both a maximum and a minimum but the plots for and for do not let me now explain this further by examining the derivative of with respect to setting this derivative to zero in search of a maximum or minimum and solving for the values of that make this possible one obtains because is a mole fraction it must be less than unity and greater
