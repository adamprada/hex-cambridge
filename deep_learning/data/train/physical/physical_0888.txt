reason that a phase separation is may be favored in such cases ie the a species prefer to be near other a species more than to be near b species and similarly for the b species however thermal motion can overcome a slight preference for such separation that is if is not large enough can overcome this slight preference this is why must be less than not just less than zero so the bottom line is that if the aa and bb interactions are more attractive on average than are the ab interactions one can experience a phase separation in
