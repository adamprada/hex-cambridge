way we obtain expressions for how the vapor pressures of the two species in the liquid or solid mixture display behavior that reflects their interaction energies let me now briefly show you how the lattice model is applied in some other areas in studying adsorption of gases to sites on a solid surface one imagines a surface containing m sites per unit area a with molecules that have been adsorbed from the gas phase bound to these sites in this case the interaction energy introduced earlier involves only interactions among neighboring adsorbed molecules there are no lateral interactions among empty
