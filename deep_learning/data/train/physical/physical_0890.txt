molecules have adsorbed clearly plays the role that the mole fraction played earlier this socalled adsorption isotherm equation allows one to connect the pressure of the gas above the solid surface to the coverage as in our earlier example something unusual occurs when the quantity is negative and beyond a critical value in particular differentiating the expression for with respect to and finding for what values vanishes one finds since is a positive fraction this equation can only produce useful values if in this case this means that if the attractions between neighboring adsorbed molecules is strong enough it can
