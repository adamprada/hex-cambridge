molecules are located and are the total number such spins so is a measure of what is called the net magnetization of the sample the result of applying the braggwilliams approximation in this case is that one again observes a critical condition under which strong spin pairings occur in particular because the interactions between a and a spins denoted and between and spins denoted are equal and opposite the variable characteristic of all lattice models reduces to x ealphabeta ealphaalpha ebetabeta j the critical condition under which one expects like spins to pair up and thus to form islands of
