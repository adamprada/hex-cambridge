all such equations can be cast into sums of two parts that arising from and that arising from in this section we will be discussing the contributions of to such equations the first thing that is done to develop the socalled cluster expansion of is to assume that the total intermolecular potential energy can be expressed as a sum of pair wise additive terms where labels the distance between molecule and molecule this allows the exponential appearing in to be written as a product of terms one for each pair of molecules each of the exponentials is then expressed as
