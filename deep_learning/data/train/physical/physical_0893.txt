fij fkl cdots which is called the cluster expansion in terms of the pair functions when this expansion is substituted into the expression for we find where the integral is over all of the molecules center of mass coordinates the integrals involving only one function are all equal ie for any pair the molecules are identical in their interaction potentials and reduce to the integrals over produce which combines with to produce the seen finally because depends only on the relative positions of molecules and the six dimensional integral over can be replaced by integrals over the relative location of
