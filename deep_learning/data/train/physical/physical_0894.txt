using the equivalence of the molecules and the fact that depends only on the relative positions of and j to dfracn pi v int f r dr int f r dr where again i used the fact that is very large to replace by on the other hand cluster integrals with for example but and different reduce as follows because depends only on the relative positions of molecules and and depends on the relative positions of and the ninedimensional integral over can be changed to a sixdimensional integral over and an integral over the location of molecule the latter integral
