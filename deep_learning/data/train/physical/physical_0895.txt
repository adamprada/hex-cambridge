is proportional to this causes the former to be more important than the latter because they are more numerous the linked terms only become important at densities where there is a significant probability that three molecules occupy nearby regions of space the unlinked terms on the other hand do not require that molecules and be anywhere near molecules and this also causes the unlinked terms to dominate especially at low and moderate densities i should note that a similar observation was made in chapter when we discussed the configuration interaction and coupledcluster expansion of electronic wave functions that is we
