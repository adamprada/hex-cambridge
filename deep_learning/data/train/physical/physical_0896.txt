involving or etc generally one finds that the unlinked terms eg in this example are most important because they are proportional to higher powers of and because they do not require more than binary collisions it is most common however to employ a severely truncated expansion and to retain only the linked terms doing so for produces at the lower levels qrm inter dfrac bigdfracnvbig pi v int f r dr dfrac bigdfracnvbig pi v int f r dr one of the most common properties to compute using a partition function that includes molecular interactions in the cluster manner is
