molecules and a second contribution that arises from the intermolecular forces it thus allows experimental measurements of the deviation from ideal ie noninteracting behavior to provide a direct way to determine intermolecular potentials for example by measuring pressures at various values and various temperatures one can determine and thus gain valuable information about the intermolecular potential contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and professor of chemistry u utah telluride schools on theoretical chemistry integrated by tomoyuki hayashi uc davis some important properties of events last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at
