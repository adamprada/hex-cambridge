distribution these calculations are specified by the central limit theorem which we discuss in section in general when we combine events from two distributions we can view the result as an event that belongs to a third distribution at first encounter the idea of combining events and distributions may seem esoteric a few examples serve to show that what we have in mind is very simple since an event is a set of outcomes an event occurs whenever any of the outcomes in the set occurs partitioning the outcomes of tossing a die into even outcomes and odd outcomes illustrates
