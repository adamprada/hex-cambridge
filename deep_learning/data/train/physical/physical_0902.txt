know the probability of each of two mutually exclusive events that belong to an exhaustive set the probability that one or the other of them will occur in a single trial is equal to the sum of the individual probabilities let us call the independent events a and b and represent their probabilities as and respectively the probability that one of these events occurs is the same thing as the probability that either a occurs or b occurs we can represent this probability as the probability of this combination of events is the sum that is above we define y
