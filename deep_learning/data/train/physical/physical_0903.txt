one of these events will occur in a single trial is if these independent events encompass all of the possible outcomes the sum of their individual probabilities must be unity figure a simple case that illustrates the laws of probability the probability of compound events let us now suppose that we make two trials in circumstances where event is possible in the first trial and event is possible in the second trial we represent the probabilities of these events by and and stipulate that they are independent of one another that is the probability that occurs in the second trial
