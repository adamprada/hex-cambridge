converts the specified reactants into the specified products the oxidation of methane to methanol is a reaction that illustrates the value of this approach the normal products in the oxidation of methane are of course carbon dioxide and water if the reaction is done with an excess of methane a portion of the carboncontaining product will be carbon monoxide rather than carbon dioxide in any circumstance methanol is at best a trace product nevertheless it would be very desirable to devise a catalyst that quantitativelyor nearly quantitativelyconverted methane to methanol according to the equation this is frequently called a selective
