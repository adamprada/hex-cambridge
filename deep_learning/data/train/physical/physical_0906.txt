transported by ship at present the economic feasibility of marine transport of liquefied natural gas lng is marginal but it appears to be improving this technology would make it possible to utilize the fuel value of known natural gas resources that are presently useless because they are located too far from population centers when we contemplate trying to develop a catalyst and a manufacturing plant to carry out this reaction we soon discover reasons for wanting to know the enthalpy change one is that the oxidative manufacture of methanol will be exothermic so burning the methanol produced will yield less
