heat is produced so that he can provide adequate cooling equipment because we do not know how to carry out this reaction we cannot measure its enthalpy change directly however if we have the enthalpies of formation for methane and methanol we can compute this enthalpy change summing the reactions gives and summing the enthalpy changes gives figure a thermochemical cycle to find the diagram in figure shows how these conventions and the fact that enthalpy is a state function work together to produce for the reaction the result that the standard reaction enthalpy is given by this cycle highlights
