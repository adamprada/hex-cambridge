place it is necessary to recognize that there can be enthalpy changes associated with the pressurevolume changes and with the processes of mixing the reactants and separating the products let us suppose that the reactants and products are gases in their hypothetical idealgas states at bar and that we carry out the reaction by mixing the reactants in a sealed pressure vessel we suppose that the reaction is then initiated and that the products are formed rapidly reaching some new pressure and an elevated temperature to be specific we could imagine the reaction be the combustion of methane we would
