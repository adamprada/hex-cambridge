the following sequence of changes where the middle equation corresponds to the process whose enthalpy change we actually measure summing the reaction equations gives and summing the enthalpy changes for the series of steps gives the standard enthalpy change for the reaction it turns out that the enthalpy changes for the compression mixing separation and expansion processes are usually small compared to this is the principal justification for our frequent failure to consider them explicitly for ideal gases these enthalpy changes are identically zero in chapter we see that the entropy changes for the mixing and separation processes are important
