heat capacity data usually give values for rather than when the temperaturedependence of is known such compilations usually express it as an empirical polynomial function of temperature in chapter we find an explicit function for the dependence of on pressure if we have an equation of state for a substance we can find this pressure dependence immediately it is usually negligible for ideal gases it is zero and is independent of pressure compilations often give data for the standard state heat capacity at a specified temperature for condensed phases this is the heat capacity for the substance at one bar
