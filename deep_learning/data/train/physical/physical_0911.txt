of any liquid or solid substance to be the most stable form of that substance at a pressure of one bar for example for water at c the standard state is ice at a pressure of one bar at c it is liquid water at a pressure of one bar ii at any particular temperature we define the standard state of a gas to be the ideal gas standard state at that temperature by the ideal gas standard state we mean a finite low pressure at which the real gas behaves as an ideal gas we know that it is
