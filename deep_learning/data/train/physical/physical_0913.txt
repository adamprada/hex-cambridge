for any element at any particular temperature we define the standard enthalpy of formation to be zero when we define standard enthalpies of formation we choose the elements in their standard states as a common reference state for the enthalpies of all substances at a given temperature while we could choose any arbitrary value for the enthalpy of an element in its standard state choosing it to be zero is particularly convenient state functions in systems undergoing spontaneous change last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers
