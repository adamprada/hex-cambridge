other state functions whose values can be computed from these measurable quantities from observations that we make on systems that are undergoing reversible change we develop numerous relationships among these state functions no real system can change in exactly the manner we have in mind when we talk about a reversible process strictly speaking any process that actually occurs must be spontaneous the idea of reversible change is clearly an abstraction from reality nevertheless we can determineto a good approximationthe way in which one variable depends on another in a reversible process we accomplish this by making measurements on a
