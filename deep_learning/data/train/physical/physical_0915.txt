thermodynamics the first is that we can measure the entropy change for a process only if the process is reversible the second and subtler reason is that an intensive variable may not have a unique value in a system that is undergoing a spontaneous change if the temperature the pressure or the concentration of a component varies from point to point within the system then that state function does not have a unique value and we cannot use it to model the change this occurs for example when gasoline explodes in a cylinder of a piston engine the system consists
