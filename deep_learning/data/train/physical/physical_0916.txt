ambiguity about the volume of the system at any instant while pointtopoint variability means that the concentrations of the chemical components are not defined for the system as a whole we are confident that there is some specific number of moles of each component present in the system at every instant we can reach this conclusion by imagining that we can instantaneously freeze the composition by stopping all reactions we can then find the number of moles of each component at our leisure if the system is not too inhomogeneous we can devise an alternative procedure for makingin conceptsuch composition
