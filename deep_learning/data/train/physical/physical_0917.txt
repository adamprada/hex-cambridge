it applies to the energy entropy enthalpy and the helmholtz and gibbs free energies as long as the pointtopoint variability within the system is small enough so that a division of the system into macroscopic subsystems produces subsystems that are approximately homogeneous we can find the value for any extensive thermodynamic function in each individual subsystem and for the system as a whole the measurement we propose has the character of a gedanken experiment we can describe a procedure for making the measurement whether we can actually perform the procedure or not this argument does not work for intensive thermodynamic
