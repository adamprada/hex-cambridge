different reaction rates no single temperature represents the state of the whole system and we can make the same statement about any other intensive thermodynamic function for a nonhomogeneous system that can be subdivided into approximately homogeneous macroscopic subsystems we can measure in principle the values of the systems extensive state functions however its intensive state functions are essentially undefined on the other hand we may be able to assume that an effectively homogeneous subsystem of macroscopic proportions does have welldefined extensive and intensive state functions even if it is not in an equilibrium state while a spontaneously changing system
