surroundings the chemical process is not at equilibrium but the component concentrations are homogeneous an important question now arises are all of the equations of equilibrium thermodynamics applicable to a system in which some processes occur spontaneously that they are not is evident from the fact that we can calculate an entropy change from its defining equation only if the behavior of the system is reversible nevertheless we will find that the relationships among state functions that we derive for reversible processes can be augmented to describe spontaneous processes that occur in homogeneous systems the necessary augmentation consists of the
