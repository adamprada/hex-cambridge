only if the process is reversible while if and only if the process is spontaneous we find a close connection between the criteria for change and the compositiondependent terms that are needed to model the thermodynamic functions during spontaneous processes we find that if and only if the process is reversible while if and only if the process is spontaneous in thinking about spontaneous processes we should also keep in mind that the validity of our general relationships among state functions does not depend on our ability to measure the state functions of any particular state of a system for
