water at c and bar will spontaneously vaporize to form gaseous water at bar the equations of thermodynamics are creatures of theory we should not expect every circumstance that is described by the theory to exist in reality what we require is that the theory accurately describe every circumstance that actually occurs to develop the equations of classical thermodynamics we consider reversible processes we then find general criteria for change that apply to any sort of change in any system later we devise criteria based on the changes that occur in the composition of the system in this book we
