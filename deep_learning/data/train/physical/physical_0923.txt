do so we need only to solve the quantum mechanical equations that give the energy levels associated with the reactants and the energy levels associated with a transitory chemical structure called the transition state for the reaction from the energy levels we calculate partition functions from partition functions we calculate thermodynamic functions and from these thermodynamic functions we obtain the reaction rate there is a big difference between in principle and in practice while increases in computer speed make it increasingly feasible to do quantum mechanical calculations to useful degrees of accuracy the results of such calculations remain too inaccurate
