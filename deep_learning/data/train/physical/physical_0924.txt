based on energy levels derived from spectroscopic measurements in chapter we consider a particular example to illustrate this point statistics for molecular speeds last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers expected values for several quantities can be calculated from the maxwellboltzmann probability density function the required definite integrals are tabulated in appendix d the most probable speed is the speed at which the maxwellboltzmann equation takes on its maximum value at this speed we have from which the average speed or is the expected value of
