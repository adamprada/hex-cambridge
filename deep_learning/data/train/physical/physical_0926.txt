estimate we can make of the mean from data points is where is the ordinary arithmetic average similarly the best estimate we can make of the variance is now a complication arises in that we usually do not know the value of the best we can do is to estimate its value as it turns out that using this approximation in the equation we deduce for the variance gives an estimate of the variance that is too small a more detailed argument see section shows that if we use to approximate the mean the best estimate of usually denoted is
