probability density curve let and be the increments of area and mass in the thin slice of the cutout that lies above a small increment of let be the density of the plate expressed as mass per unit area since the plate is uniform is constant we have and so that the mean of the distribution corresponds to a vertical line on this cutout at if the cutout is supported on a knifeedge along the line gravity induces no torque the cutout is balanced since the torque is zero we have since is a constant property of the cutout it
