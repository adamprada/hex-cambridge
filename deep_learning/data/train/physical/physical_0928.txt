only the estimated mean then is the best prediction we can make choosing makes the difference as small as possible these ideas relate to another interpretation of the mean we saw that the variance is the second moment about the mean the first moment about the mean is since the last two integrals are and respectively the first moment about the mean is zero we could have defined the mean as the value for which the first moment of about is zero the first moment about the mean is zero the second moment about the mean is the variance we
