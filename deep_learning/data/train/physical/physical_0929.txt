will explore the tools that one uses to carry out such an analysis of the surface but first it is important to describe how one locates the minimumenergy and transitionstate geometries on such surfaces finding local minima many strategies that attempt to locate minima on molecular potential energy landscapes begin by approximating the potential energy for geometries collectively denoted in terms of cartesian coordinates in a taylor series expansion about some starting point geometry ie the current molecular geometry in an iterative process or a geometry that you guessed as a reasonable one for the minimum or transition state that
