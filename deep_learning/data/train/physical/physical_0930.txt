knowledge that is available is and the gradient components eg computation of the second derivatives is usually much more computationally taxing than is evaluation of the gradient so one is often forced to work without knowing the hessian matrix elements the linear approximation suggests that one should choose step elements that are opposite in sign from that of the corresponding gradient elements if one wishes to move downhill toward a minimum the magnitude of the step elements is usually kept small in order to remain within the trust radius within which the linear approximation to is valid to some predetermined
