of these eigenvalues will be nonzero for linear molecules will be nonzero the or zero eigenvalues of have eigenvectors that describe translation and rotation of the entire molecule they are zero because the energy surface does not change if the molecule is rotated or translated it can be difficult to properly identify the or translation and rotation eigenvalues of the hessian because numerical precision issues often cause them to occur as very small positive or negative eigenvalues if the molecule being studied actually does possess internal ie vibrational eigenvalues that are very small eg the torsional motion of the methyl
