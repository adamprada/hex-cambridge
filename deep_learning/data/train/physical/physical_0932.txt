designed to locate energy minima and transition states the eigenvectors of form the columns of the array that brings to diagonal form therefore if we define and to be the component of the step and of the gradient along the eigenvector of the quadratic expansion of can be written in terms of steps along the or directions that correspond to nonzero hessian eigenvalues the advantage to transforming the gradient step and hessian to the eigenmode basis is that each such mode labeled m appears in an independent uncoupled form in the expansion of this allows us to take steps along
