all positive values this indicates that one may be close to a minimum on the energy surface because all are positive at minima in such a case the step is opposed to the gradient along all or directions much like the gradientbased strategy discussed earlier suggested the energy change that is expected to occur if the step is taken can be computed by substituting into the quadratic equation for this clearly suggests that the step will lead downhill in energy along each eigenmode as long as all of the values are positive for example if one were to begin with
