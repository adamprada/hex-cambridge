and propene whose geometry might be located using the prescription outlined above product of the cycloaddition reaction methylcyclobutane lower right beginning at one would find that of the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix are nonzero where is the total number of atoms in the ethylenepropene complex of these nonzero eigenvalues three will have eigenvectors describing radial and angular displacements of the two fragments relative to one another the remaining will describe internal vibrations of the complex the eigenvalues belonging to the interfragment radial and angular displacements may be positive or negative because you made no special attempt to orient the
