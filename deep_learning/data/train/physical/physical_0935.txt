be better to not take for the step along this particular direction but to take a small step in the direction opposite to the gradient to improve chances of moving downhill such smalleigenvalue issues could arise for example if the torsion angle of propenes methyl group happened during the sequence of geometry steps to move into a region where eclipsed rather than staggered geometries are accessed near eclipsed geometries the hessian eigenvalue describing twisting of the methyl group is negative near staggered geometries it is positive whenever one or more of the are negative at the current geometry one is
