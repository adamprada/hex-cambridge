toward a minimum this is what i recommended in the preceding paragraph when an eclipsed geometry which is a transition state for rotation of the methyl group is encountered if one is seeking an energy minimum finding transition states on the other hand if one is in a region where one hessian eigenvalues is negative and the rest are positive and if one is seeking to find a transition state then taking steps along all of the modes having positive eigenvalues and taking along the mode having negative eigenvalue is appropriate the steps will act to keep the energy near
