path leading to the cycloaddition products methylcyclobutane as also shown in figure a consider employing either of two strategies to begin the walk leading from the van der waals complex to the desired transition state ts one could find the lowest nontranslation or nonrotation hessian eigenvalue and take a small step uphill along this direction to begin a streambed walk that might lead to the ts using the smallest hessian eigenvalue to identify a direction to explore makes sense because it is along this direction that the energy surface rises least abruptly at least near the geometry of the reactants
