the cycloaddition ts that we want the takehome lesson here is that uphill streambed walks beginning at a minimum on the reactants potential energy surface may or may not lead to the desired ts such walks are not foolish to attempt but one should examine the nature of the eigenmode being followed to judge whether displacements along this mode make chemical sense clearly only rotating the methyl group is not a good way to move from ethylene and propene to methylcyclobutane the second strategy suggested above might succeed but it would probably still need to be refined for example if
