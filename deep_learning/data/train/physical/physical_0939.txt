products until one finds a geometry at which a negative hessian eigenvalues eigenmode has substantial components along what appears to be reasonable for the desired reaction path ie substantial displacements leading to shorter interfragment carboncarbon distances once one has found such a geometry one can use the strategies detailed earlier eg to then walk uphill along one mode while minimizing along the other modes to move toward the ts if successful such a process will lead to the ts at which all components of the gradient vanish and all but one eigenvalue of the hessian is positive the takehome lesson
