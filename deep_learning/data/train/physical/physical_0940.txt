or step components nb the step components along the or modes having zero hessian eigenvalues can be taken to be zero because the would simply translate or rotate the molecule one must compute the to do so we use the relationship and write its inverse using the unitary nature of the matrix to compute the desired cartesian step components in using the hessianbased approaches outlined above one has to take special care when one or more of the hessian eigenvalues is small this often happens when one has a molecule containing soft modes ie degrees of freedom along which the
