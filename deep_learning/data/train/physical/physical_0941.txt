in this chapter and again in chapter we will discuss how to follow socalled reaction paths that connect these two kinds of stationary points using the type of gradient and hessian information that we introduced earlier in this chapter it is sometimes important to find geometries at which two bornoppenheimer energy surfaces and intersect because such regions often serve as efficient funnels for trajectories or wave packets evolving on one surface to undergo socalled nonadiabatic transitions to the other surface lets spend a few minutes thinking about under what circumstances such surfaces can indeed intersect because students often hear that
