can cross only if the square root factor vanishes because this factor is a sum of two squares each thus being positive quantities this can only happen if two identities hold simultaneously ie at the same geometry and the main point then is that in the dimensional space the two states will generally not have equal energy however in a space of two lower dimensions because there are two conditions that must simultaneously be obeyed and their energies may be equal they do not have to be equal but it is possible that they are it is based upon such
