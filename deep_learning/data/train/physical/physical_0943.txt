symmetry can cross in a space of dimension ie in a plane an example of such a surface intersection is shown in figure c figure c depiction of the and bornoppenheimer surfaces arising when al combines with to form first considering the reaction of al s p p with to form alha as if it were to occur in symmetry the atoms occupied p orbital can be directed in either of three ways if it is directed toward the midpoint of the hh bond it produces an electronic state of symmetry if it is directed out of the plane of
