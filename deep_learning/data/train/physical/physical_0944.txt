orbitals occupied as follows two electrons occupy a bonding alh orbital of symmetry two electrons occupy a bonding alh orbital of symmetry and the remaining electron occupies a nonbonding orbital of character localized on the al atom and having a symmetry this orbital occupancy of the molecules ground state does not correlate directly with any of the three degenerate configurations of the ground state of which are and as explained earlier it is this lack of direct configuration correlation that generates the reaction barrier show in figure c let us now return to the issue of finding the lowerdimensional or
