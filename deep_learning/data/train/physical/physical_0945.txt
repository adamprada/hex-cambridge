now the function one is seeking to locate a minimum on is the potential energy surface difference once one such geometry has been located one subsequently tries to follow the seam ie for a triatomic molecule this is the onedimensional line of crossing for larger molecules it is a dimensional space within which the function remains zero professor david yarkony has developed efficient routines for characterizing such subspaces d r yarkony acc chem res the basic idea is to parameterize steps away from in a manner that constrains such steps to have no component along either the gradient of or
