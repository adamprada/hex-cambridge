place on the lowerenergy surface that have to access the surfacecrossing seam to evolve onto the upper surface the energy at rmecp reflects the lowest energy needed to access this surface crossing such intersection seam location procedures are becoming more commonly employed but are still under very active development so i will refer the reader to prof yarkonys paper cited above for further guidance for now it should suffice to say that locating such surface intersections is an important ingredient when one is interested in studying for example photochemical reactions in which the reactants and products may move from one
