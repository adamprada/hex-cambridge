at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers for a spontaneous process we conclude that the entropy change of the system must satisfy the inequality for any process that occurs reversibly we conclude that for every incremental part of a reversible process that occurs in a closed system we have the following relationships at constant entropy the energy relationship becomes at constant temperature the helmholtz free energy relationship becomes for reversible processes in which all work is pressurevolume work from these general equations we find the following relationships for reversible processes when various pairs of variables are held constant if
