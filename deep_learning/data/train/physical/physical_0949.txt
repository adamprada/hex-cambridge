the normal freezing point by todays standards this inverted temperature scale makes little sense the modern celsius temperature scale defines c as the normal freezing point of water and c as the normal boiling point the difference is c comparing this to the fahrenheit scale one can easily construct a simple equation to convert between the two scales solving these equations for and yields and so conversion between the two scales is fairly simple many physical properties of matter suggest that there is an absolute minimum temperature that can be attained by any sample this minimum temperature can be shown
