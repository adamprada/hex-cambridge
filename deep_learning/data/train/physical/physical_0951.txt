fluid on which to base our temperature measurements temperatures outside the liquid range of the chosen substance have to be measured in some other way evidently we can choose to use a gas as the working fluid in our thermometer that is our gasvolume measuring device is itself a thermometer this fact proves to be very useful because of a further experimental observation to a very good approximation we find if we keep the pressures in the thermometer and in some other gaseous system constant at low enough values both gases behave as ideal gases and we find that the
