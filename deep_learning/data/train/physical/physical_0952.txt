in an ideal gas thermometer and to measure any temperature accurately of course practical problems emerge when we attempt to make such measurements at very high and very low temperatures the very nearly direct proportionality of two lowpressure real gas volumes contrasts with what we observe for liquids and solids in general the volume of a given liquid or solid substance is not exactly proportional to the volume of a second liquid or solid substance over a wide range of temperatures in practice the idealgas thermometer is not as convenient to use as other thermometerslike the mercuryinglass thermometer however the
