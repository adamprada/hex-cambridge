observations we are confident that no system can attain a temperature below absolute zero thus the size of the kelvin one degree on the kelvin scale is fixed by the difference in temperature between a system at the triple point of water and one at absolute zero if our ideal gas thermometer has volume at thermal equilibrium with some other constanttemperature system the proportionality of and means that with the triple point fixed at k experiments find the freezing point of airsaturated water to be k when the system pressure is atmosphere so the melting point of ice is k
