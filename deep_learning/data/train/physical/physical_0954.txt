gas behavior if we make sufficiently accurate measurements for extremely accurate work we need a way to correct the temperature value that we associate with a given realgas volume the issue here is the value of the partial derivative for one mole of an ideal gas is a constant for a real gas it is a function of temperature let us assume that we know this function let the molar volume of the real gas at the triple point of water be and its volume at thermal equilibrium with a system whose true temperature is be we have when we
