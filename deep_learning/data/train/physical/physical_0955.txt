we use the temperatures that we measure with an uncorrected realgas thermometer these temperatures are a first approximation to the idealgas temperature scale using this scale we make nonpressurevolumetemperature measurements that establish as a function of temperature for the real gas this function is where is the constantpressure heat capacity and is the joulethomson coefficient both are functions of temperature we introduce in section we discuss the joulethomson coefficient further in section below and in detail in section typically and the value of is well approximated by with established using this scale integration yields a secondapproximation to the idealgas temperatures
