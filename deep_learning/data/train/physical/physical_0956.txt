temperature scale is a creature of theory whose realworld counterpart would be the scale established by an idealgas thermometer whose gas actually obeyed at all conditions we have seen that such an idealgas thermometer is itself a creature of theory the current realworld standard temperature scale is the international temperature scale of its this defines temperature over a wide range in terms of the pressurevolume relationships of helium isotopes and the triple points of several selected elements the triple points fix the temperature at each of several conditions up to k the freezing point of copper needless to say the
