gpartial t rightp s and so it should be fairly straightforward to determine how each changes with changing temperature and but the temperature dependence of the entropy needed to be known in order to evaluate the integral a convenient workaround can be obtained starting from the definitions of the free energy functions and dividing by yields and now differentiating each expression with respect to at constant or respectively yields and or differentiating with respect to provides a simpler form that is mathematically equivalent and focusing on the second expression since all of the arguments apply to the first as well
