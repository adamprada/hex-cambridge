can be calculated fairly easily it will be assumed that is constant over the temperature range of k k so using equation refgh with the data just calculated gives note became a little bit less negative at the higher temperature which is to be expected for a reaction which is exothermic an increase in temperature should tend to make the reaction less favorable to the formation of products which is exactly what is seen in this case contributors and attributions patrick e fleming department of chemistry and biochemistry california state university east bay temperature dependence of enthalpy last updated save
