equation refeq a common empirical model used to fit heat capacities over broad temperature ranges is after combining equations refeq and refeq the enthalpy change for the temperature change can be found obtained by a simple integration solving the definite integral yields beginalign delta h left at dfracb t dfracct righttt att dfracbtt c left dfract dfract right labelineq endalign this expression can then be used with experimentally determined values of and some of which are shown in the following table table empirical parameters for the temperature dependence of substance a j mol k b j mol k c j
