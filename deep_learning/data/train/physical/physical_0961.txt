terms involving k are on the left and all other terms are on the right results in the van t hoff equation which describes the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant because of the assumptions made in the derivation of the gibbshelmholtz equation this relationship only holds if is independent of temperature over the range being considered this expression also suggests that a plot of as a function of should produce a straight line with a slope equal to such a plot is known as a van t hoff plot and can be used to determine the reaction enthalpy example
