pcl and clcl bonds predict whether or not an increase in temperature will lead to a larger or smaller degree of dissociation for the reaction xy dxy kjmol pcl clcl solution the estimated reaction enthalpy is given by the total energy expended breaking bonds minus the energy recovered by the formation of bonds since this reaction involves breaking two pcl bonds costing kjmol and the formation of one clcl bond recovering kjmol it is clear that the reaction is endothermic by approximately kjmol as such an increase in temperature should increase the value of the equilibrium constant causing the degree
