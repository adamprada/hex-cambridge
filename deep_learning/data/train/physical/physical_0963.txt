at ordinary temperatures is very low the pressure at the top of the mercury column is very low and can usually be ignored the pressure at the bottom of the column of mercury is equal to the pressure of a column of air extending from the elevation of the barometer all the way to the top of the earths atmosphere as we take the barometer to higher altitudes we find that the height of the mercury column decreases because less and less of the atmosphere is above the barometer figure atmospheric pressure versus altitude if we assume that the atmosphere
