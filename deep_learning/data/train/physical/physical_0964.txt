earths surface while its top is a distance from the earths surface the volume of this cylindrical section is then let the mass of the gas in this section be the pressure at is less than the pressure at by the weight of this gas divided by the crosssectional area the weight of the gas is the pressure difference is we have since we are assuming that the sample of gas in the cylindrical section behaves ideally we have substituting for and taking the limit as we find where we introduce as the number of moles of gas in the
