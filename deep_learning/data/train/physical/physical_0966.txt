electrons in the presence of fixed nuclei as a way to represent the fully adjusted state of the electrons at any fixed positions of the nuclei of course we then have to have a way to describe the differences between how the electrons and nuclei behave in the absence of this approximation and how they move within the approximation these differences give rise to socalled nonbornoppenheimer corrections radiationless transitions surface hops and nonadiabatic transitions which we will deal with later it should be noted that this separation of time scales between fast electronic and slow vibration and rotation motions does
