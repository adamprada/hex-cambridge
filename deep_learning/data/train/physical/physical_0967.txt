obtains what are called electronic wave functions which also depend on where the nuclei are located the energies are what we usually call potential energy surfaces an example of such a surface is shown in figure figure two dimensional potential energy surface showing local minima transition states and paths connecting them this surface depends on two geometrical coordinates and is a plot of one particular eigenvalue vs these two coordinates although this plot has more information on it than we shall discuss now a few features are worth noting there appear to be three minima ie points where the derivative
