figure shows just one of the surfaces each molecule has a groundstate surface ie the one that is lowest in energy as well as an infinite number of excitedstate surfaces lets now return to our discussion of the bo model and ask what one does once one has such an energy surface in hand the motion of the nuclei are subsequently within the bo model assumed to obey a schr√∂dinger equation in which defines a rotationvibration hamiltonian for the particular energy state of interest the rotational and vibrational energies and wave functions belonging to each electronic state ie for each
