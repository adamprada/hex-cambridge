and the vibrationrotation states that belong to each such surface i should point out that the cartesian coordinates used to describe the positions of the molecules nuclei can be replaced by cartesian coordinates specifying the center of mass of the nuclei and other socalled internal coordinates that can be used to describe the molecules orientation these coordinates appear in the rotational kinetic energy and its bond lengths and angles these coordinates appear in the vibrational kinetic and potential energies when centerofmass and internal coordinates are used in place of the cartesian coordinates the bornoppenheimer energy surfaces are seen to depend
