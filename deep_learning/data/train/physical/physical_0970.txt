models of electronic motions in conjugated molecules and in atoms rotations of linear molecules and vibrations of chemical bonds your first application of quantum mechanics motion of a particle in one dimension this is a very important problem whose solutions chemists use to model a wide variety of phenomena lets begin by examining the motion of a single particle of mass in one direction which we will call while under the influence of a potential denoted the classical expression for the total energy of such a system is where is the momentum of the particle along the xaxis to focus
