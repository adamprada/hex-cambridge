motion will be small at values where the particle is moving quickly ie where is low and will be high where the particle moves slowly where is high so the photographic plate will show a bright region where is high because the particle moves slowly in such regions and less brightness where is low note however that as approaches the classical turning points the velocity approaches zero so the above expression for will approach infinity it does not mean the probability of finding the particle at the turning point is infinite it means that the probability density is infinite there
