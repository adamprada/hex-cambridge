the box so the speed is constant hence is constant for all values within this onedimensional box i ask that you keep these plots in mind because they are very different from what one finds when one solves the schr√∂dinger equation for this same problem also please keep in mind that these plots represent what one expects if the particle were moving according to classical newtonian dynamics which we know it is not quantum treatment to solve for the quantum mechanical wave functions and energies of this same kind of problem we first write the hamiltonian operator as discussed above
