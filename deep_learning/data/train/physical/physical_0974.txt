the particle cannot access regions of space where the potential is infinite the second condition that we make use of is that must be continuous this means that the probability of the particle being at cannot be discontinuously related to the probability of it being at a nearby point it is also true that the spatial derivative must be continuous except at points where the potential has an infinite discontinuity like it does in the example shown on the right in figure the continuity of relates to continuity of momentum recall is a momentum operator when a particle moves under
