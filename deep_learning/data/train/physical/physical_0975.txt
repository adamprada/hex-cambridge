mechanics so that the predictions of the quantum theory would be in line with experimental observations energies and wave functions the secondorder differential equation has two solutions because it is a second order equation in the region between and where and where is defined as hence the most general solution is some combination of these two we could alternatively use and as the two independent solutions we do so later in section to illustrate because and can be rewritten in terms of and that is they span exactly the same space the fact that must vanish at nb vanishes for
