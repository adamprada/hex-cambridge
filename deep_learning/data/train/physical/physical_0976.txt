this is unacceptable because it would imply that the particle is never observed anywhere the other possibility is that lets explore this answer because it offers the first example of energy quantization that you have probably encountered as you know the sin function vanishes at integral multiples of hence must be some multiple of lets call the integer and write using the definition of in the form solving this equation for the energy we obtain this result says that the only energy values that are capable of giving a wave function that will obey the above conditions are these specific
