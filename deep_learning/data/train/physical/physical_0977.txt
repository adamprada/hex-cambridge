into gives the value of a can be found by remembering that is supposed to represent the probability density for finding the particle at such probability densities are supposed to be normalized meaning that their integral over all values should amount to unity so we can find a by requiring that where the integral ranges from to looking up the integral of and solving the above equation for the socalled normalization constant gives and so the values that can take on are the choice is unacceptable because it would produce a wave function that vanishes at all the full x
