schr√∂dinger equation what the allowed values of are these values are quantized meaning that they occur only for discrete values determined by a quantum number by the mass of the particle m and by characteristics of the potential in this case probability densities lets now look at some of the wave functions and compare the probability densities that they represent to the classical probability densities discussed earlier the and wave functions are shown in the top of figure the corresponding quantum probability densities are shown below the wave functions in two formats as plots and shaded plots that could relate
