density illustrated in figure figure classical probability density for potential shown the classical density is easy to understand because we are familiar with classical dynamics in this case we say that is constant within the box because the fact that is constant causes the kinetic energy and hence the speed of the particle to remain constant and this is true for any energy in contrast the quantum wave functions plot is peaked in the middle of the box and falls to zero at the walls the density has two peaks one to the left of the box midpoint and one
