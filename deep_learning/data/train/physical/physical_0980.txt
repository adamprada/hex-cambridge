at time to there at time unfortunately quantum mechanics does not deal with issues such as a particles trajectory ie where it is at various times but only with its probability of being somewhere ie the next section will treat such paradoxical issues even further classical and quantum probability densities as just noted it is tempting for most beginning students of quantum mechanics to attempt to interpret the quantum behavior of a particle in classical terms however this adventure is full of danger and bound to fail because small light particles simply do not move according to newtons laws to
