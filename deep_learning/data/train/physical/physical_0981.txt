should not be comparable for the case in figure we note that is highest at the box midpoint and vanishes at and in a classical mechanics world this would mean that the particle moves slowly near and more quickly near and because the particles total energy must remain constant as it moves in regions where it moves slowly the potential it experiences must be high and where it moves quickly must be small this analysis nb based on classical concepts would lead us to conclude that the arises from the particle moving in a potential that is high near and
