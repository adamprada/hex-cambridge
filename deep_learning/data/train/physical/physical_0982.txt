suggests that is different for these two cases what is wrong with our attempt to understand the quantum plots the mistake we made was in attempting to apply the equations and concepts of classical dynamics to a plot that did not arise from classical motion simply put one cannot ask how the particle is moving ie what is its speed at various positions when the particle is undergoing quantum dynamics most students when first experiencing quantum wave functions and quantum probabilities try to think of the particle moving in a classical way that is consistent with the quantum this attempt
