showing seven peaks and six nodes it would have seven maxima separated by six nodes if we were to plot for a very large value such as we would find a plot having maxima separated by nodes with the maxima separated approximately by distances of l such a plot when viewed in a coarsegrained sense ie focusing with somewhat blurred vision on the positions and heights of the maxima looks very much like the classical plot in which is constant for all another way to look at the difference between the lown and highn quantum probability distributions is reflected in
