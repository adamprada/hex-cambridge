the form of the classical for the same potential that was used to solve the schr√∂dinger equation except near turning points and in classically forbidden regions it is also true that at any specified energy classical and quantum results agree better when one is dealing with heavy particles than for light particles for example a given energy corresponds to a higher quantum number in the particleinabox formula for a heavier particle than for a lighter particle hence heavier particles moving with a given energy have more classical probability distributions to gain perspective about this matter in the table shown below
