mol of energy eg would be adequate for recall it is high quantum states where one expects the classical and quantum spatial probability distribution to be similar so when treating electrons one is probably nearly always going to have to make use of quantum mechanics and one will not be able to rely on classical mechanics for light nuclei with masses near times the electrons mass if the particle is constrained to a small distance range eg again even low quantum states will have energies in excess of kcal mol only when free to move over of to does kcal
