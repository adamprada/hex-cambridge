having kcal mol of translational energy when constrained to å kcal mol requires to exceed so heavy particles will even at low energies behave classically except if they are constrained to very short distances we will encounter this socalled quantumclassical correspondence principal again when we examine other model problems it is an important property of solutions to the schrödinger equation because it is what allows us to bridge the gap between using the schrödinger equation to treat small light particles and the newton equations for macroscopic big heavy systems time propagation of wave functions for a particle in a box
