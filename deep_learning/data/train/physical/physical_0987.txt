time is this is a superposition of the and eigenstates the probability density associated with this function is the and components the superposition and the probability density at are shown in the first three panels of figure figure the and wave functions upper left their superposition upper right and the bottom left and timeevolved bottom right probability densities of the superposition it should be noted that the probability density associated with this superposition state is not symmetric about the midpoint even though the and component wave functions and densities are such a density describes the particle localized more strongly in
