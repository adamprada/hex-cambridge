to the result of this timevariation in the cos factor is that changes in form from that shown in the bottom left panel of figure to that shown in the bottom right panel at and then back to the form in the bottom left panel at one can interpret this time variation as describing the particles probability density not its classical position initially localized toward the right side of the box moving to the left and then back to the right of course this time evolution will continue over more and more cycles as time evolves further this example illustrates
