need to know when we ask how it moves from one place to another nevertheless superposition wave functions can offer to some extent the opportunity to follow the motion of the particle for example the superposition state written above as has a probability amplitude that changes with time as shown in figure moreover this amplitudes major peak does move from side to side within the box as time evolves so in this case we can say with what frequency the major peak moves back and forth in a sense this allows us to follow the particles movements but only to
