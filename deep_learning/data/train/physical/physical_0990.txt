are important observation that i hope the student will keep fresh in mind they are also important ingredients in modern quantum dynamics in which localized wave packets which are similar to superposed eigenstates discussed above are used to detail the position and speed of a particles main probability density peak the above example illustrates how one timeevolves a wave function that is expressed as a linear combination ie superposition of eigenstates of the problem at hand there is a large amount of current effort in the theoretical chemistry community aimed at developing efficient approximations to the evolution operator that do
