to first find the eigenstates of and to expand in terms of these eigenstates after which the desired function is written as the basic idea is to break the operator into its kinetic and potential energy components and to realize that the differential operators appear in only the importance of this observation lies in the fact that and do not commute which means that is not equal to nb recall that for two quantities to commute means that their order of appearance does not matter why do they not commute because contains second derivatives with respect to the coordinates qj
