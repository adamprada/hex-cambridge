slices one then expresses the evolution operator as a product of shorttime propagators the student should by now be familiar with the fact that and are operators so from now on i will no longer necessarily use bold lettering for these quantities if one can then develop an efficient means of propagating for a short time one can then do so over and over again times to achieve the desired fulltime propagation it can be shown that the exponential operator involving can better be approximated in terms of the and exponential operators as follows so if one can be satisfied
