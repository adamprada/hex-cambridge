the eigenfunctions of are the momentum eigenfunctions that we discussed earlier and they obey the following orthogonality and completeness relations writing as and using the above expression for gives then inserting the explicit expressions for and in terms of gives now allowing to act on produces the integral over above can be carried out analytically and gives so the final expression for the shorttime propagated wave function is which is the working equation one uses to compute knowing notice that all one needs to know to apply this formula is the potential at each point in space one does not
