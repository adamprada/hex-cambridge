to the atmosphere thereafter the flywheel drives the piston inward the economic viability of the steam engine derives in part from the fact that the spent steam can be vented to the atmosphere at the end of each cycle however this is not a necessary feature of heat engines we can devise engines that alternately heat and cool a captive working fluid to convert heat energy into mechanical work stirling engines are practical devices of this type a carnot engine is a conceptual engine that exploits the response of a closed system to temperature changes a carnot engine extracts heat
