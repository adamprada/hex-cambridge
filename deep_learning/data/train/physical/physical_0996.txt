it follows that the energy input to the carnot engine is and the useful work that appears in the surroundings is the heat accepted by the lowtemperature reservoir is a waste product in the sense that it represents energy that cannot be converted to mechanical work using this cycle all feasible heat engines share this feature of the carnot engine in contrast a perpetual motion machine of the second kind converts its entire heat intake to work no portion of its heat intake goes unused the efficiency with which the carnot engine converts the input energy to useful output energy
