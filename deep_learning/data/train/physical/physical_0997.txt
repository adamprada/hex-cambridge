path represents the pressurevolume work exchanged between the system and its surroundings if the area is not zero the system temperature changes during the cycle if the cycle is reversible all of the heat transfers that occur must occur reversibly we can apply our reasoning about reversible cycles to any closed system containing any collection of chemical substances so long as any phase changes or chemical reactions that occur do so reversibly this means that all phase and chemical changes that occur in the system must adjust rapidly to the new equilibrium positions that are imposed on them as a
