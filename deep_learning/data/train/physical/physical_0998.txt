and in a second step we reversibly and adiabatically expand the ideal gas until its temperature falls to that of the second lowtemperature heat reservoir we designate the pressure volume and temperature at the end of this adiabatic expansion as and we begin the return portion of the cycle by reversibly and isothermally compressing the ideal gas at the temperature of the cold reservoir we continue this reversible isothermal compression until the ideal gas reaches the pressure and volume from which an adiabatic compression will just return it to the initial state we designate the pressure volume and temperature at
