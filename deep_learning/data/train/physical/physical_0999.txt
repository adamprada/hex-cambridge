work done on the system is the sum of the work for these four steps the heat input occurs at the hightemperature reservoir so that the heat discharge occurs at the lowtemperature reservoir so that for one cycle of the reversible idealgas carnot engine because the two adiabatic steps involve the same limiting temperatures the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature and for both steps we see from section that and the integrals over are the same except for the direction of integration they sum to zero so that and using this result the second equation for
