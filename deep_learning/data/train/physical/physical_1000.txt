that occurs when the system reversibly absorbs a small of increment of heat at a particular temperature for an ideal gas traversing a carnot cycle we have shown that is of course the entropy function described in our entropybased statement of the second law we now want to see what the machinebased statement of the second law enables us to deduce about the properties of since the change in is zero when an ideal gas goes around a complete carnot cycle we can conjecture that is a state function of course the fact that around one particular cycle does not
