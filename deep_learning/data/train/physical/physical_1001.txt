no headers to show that for any reversible system taken around a carnot cycle we first observe that the carnot cycle can be traversed in the opposite direction in this case work is delivered to the engine and a quantity of heat is transferred from the lowtemperature reservoir to the hightemperature reservoir operated in reverse the carnot engine is a refrigerator suppose that we have two identical idealgas carnot machines one of which we operate as an engine while we operate the other as a refrigerator if we configure them so that the work output of the engine drives the
