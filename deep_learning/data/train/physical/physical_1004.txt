equation is unaffected by the direction of operation because changing the direction changes the sign of every energy term in the cycle changing the direction of operation is equivalent to multiplying both the numerator and denominator by minus one then from it follows that since we sized a and b so that we have so that for any reversible carnot engines a and b operating between the same two heat reservoirs for the ideal gas engine we found for any reversible carnot engine we have so that and this means that the efficiency relationship applies to any reversible carnot engine
