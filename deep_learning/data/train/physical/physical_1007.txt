equilibrium between the phases gathering pressure terms on one side and temperature terms on the other the differences and are the changes in molar volume and molar entropy for the phase changes respectively so the expression can be rewritten or equation refclap is the clapeyron equation this expression makes it easy to see how the phase diagram for water is qualitatively different than that for most substances specifically the negative slope of the solidliquid boundary on a pressuretemperature phase diagram for water is very unusual and arises due to the fact that for water the molar volume of the liquid
