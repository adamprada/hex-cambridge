makes the integration very easy if the enthalpy of vaporization is independent of temperature over the range of conditions this is the clausiusclapeyron equation it can also be used to describe the boundary between solid and vapor phases by substituting the enthalpy of sublimation example the vapor pressure of a liquid triples when the temperature is increased from c to c what is the enthalpy of vaporization for the liquid solution the problem can be solved using the clausiusclapeyron equation equation refcc the following values can be used substitution into the clausiusclapeyron equation yields the clausiusclapeyron equation also suggests that
