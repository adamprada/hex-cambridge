course on the precision needed in the experiment for this fit of the data is found to be kjmol temperature dependence to for systems that warrant it temperature dependence of can be included into the derivation of the model to fit vapor pressure as a function of temperature for example if the enthalpy of vaporization is assumed to take the following empirical form and substituting it into the differential form of the clausiusclapeyron equation equation refdiffcc generates or and so the integrated form becomes the results of fitting these data to the temperature dependent model are shown in the table
