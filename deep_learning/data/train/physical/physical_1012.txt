introduced does reaction begin it is also possible indeed probable that a system can be at equilibrium with respect to one process and not be at equilibrium with respect to other processes which while possible simply do not occur under the conditions at hand for example if an aqueous solution of the oxygencarrying protein hemoglobin is added to the hydrogenair system the protein will add or lose coordinated oxygen molecules until the equilibrium composition is reached if our investigation is focused on the proteinoxygenation reaction we do not hesitate to say that the system is at equilibrium the nonoccurrence of
