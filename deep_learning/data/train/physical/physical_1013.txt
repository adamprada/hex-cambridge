neither gain nor lose material an isolated system is a closed system that can neither gain nor lose energy in consequence its volume is fixed in an isolated system change ceases when equilibrium is reached and conversely we will consider several commonly encountered kinds of change including mechanical motions heat transfers phase changes partitioning of a solute between two phases and chemical reactions here we review briefly what occurs in each of these kinds of change in chapter we review the characteristics that each of these kinds of change exhibits at equilibrium a system in mechanical equilibrium is stationary because
