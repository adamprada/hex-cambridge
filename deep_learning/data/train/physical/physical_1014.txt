and c are in thermal equilibrium with one another this observation is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics it justifies the concept of temperature and the use of a standard systema thermometerto measure temperature for an isolated system to be in phase equilibrium it must contain macroscopic quantities of two or more phases and the amount of each phase present must be unchanging for example at k and bar and in the presence of one atmosphere of air liquid water and ice are in equilibrium the amounts of water and ice remain unchanged so long as the system remains
