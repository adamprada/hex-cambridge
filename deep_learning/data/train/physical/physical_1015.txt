the same irrespective of the amounts of the phases present in the particular system for example if one of the species is present in both a gas phase and a condensed phase we can specify the equilibrium state by specifying the pressure and temperature of the system however we can change the relative amounts of the phases present in this equilibrium state by changing the volume of the system if its volume can change the system is not isolated partitioning of a solute between two immiscible condensed phases is important in many chemical systems if we add water and chloroform
