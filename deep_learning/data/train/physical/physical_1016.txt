we are accustomed to representing chemical substances by symbols and representing their reactions by chemical equations thus for the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate we write a chemical equation like this expresses a stoichiometric relationship between reactants and products often we invoke it as a symbol for various distinctly different physical situations for example we may view the equation as a symbolic representation of a single solution that contains the four compounds ethyl acetate water acetic acid and ethanoland possibly other substances we may view the equation as a symbolic representation of a relationship between two systems whose proportions are arbitrary
