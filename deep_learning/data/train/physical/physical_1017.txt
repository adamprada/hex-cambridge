the intended interpretation is normally evident from the context indeed we often skip back and forth among these interpretations in the course of a single discussion nevertheless it is important to avoid confusing them by doing experiments we can discover that there is an equation that uniquely defines the position of a chemical reaction at equilibrium an equation that we usually think of as the definition of the equilibrium constant if our measurements are not too accurate or we confine our study to a limited range of concentrations or the system is particularly well behaved we can express the equilibrium
