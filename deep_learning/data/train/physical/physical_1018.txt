possible for systems in which this reaction occurs the equilibrium constant computed as a function of reactant activities always has exactly the same numerical value we can develop the equilibrium constant expression from three distinctly different theoretical treatments we develop it first from some basic ideas about the rates of chemical reactions then we obtain same result from both the macroscopicbehavior considerations of classical thermodynamics and the molecularproperty considerations of statistical thermodynamics our most basic concept of equilibrium is based on the observation that change in an isolated system eventually ceases once change ceases it never resumes in this book
