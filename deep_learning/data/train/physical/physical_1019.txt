system and its surroundings is inherently more variable than an isolated system for a given isolated system only one equilibrium state exists for a system that interacts with its surroundings many different equilibrium states may be possible in chemical thermodynamics our goal is to develop mathematical models that specify the equilibrium states available to a system we seek models in which the independent variables include pressure temperature volume and other conditions that can be imposed on the system by its surroundings in this conception an equilibrium system is characterized by a set of points in a variable space we can
