players for example and so equation reftotal becomes in order to evaluate the partial derivative above first consider then the total differential can be expressed dividing by and constraining to constant will generate the partial derivative we wish to evaluate the last term will become unity so after converting to partial derivatives we see that this incidentally is an example of partial derivative transformation type iii now we are getting somewhere and so the equation refeq can be rewritten if we can find an expression for we are almost home free fortunately that is an easy expression to derive begin
