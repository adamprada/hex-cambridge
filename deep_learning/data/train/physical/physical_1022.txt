that allowed us to use the combined first and second laws in the form that means that this expression can be applied to any substance whether gas liquid animal vegetable or mineral but what is the result for an ideal gas since we know that for an ideal gas and substitution back into equation reffinal yields beginalign cp cv dfractv leftdfractrightleftdfracpright so for an ideal gas that is good to know no example derive the expression for the difference between and by beginning with the definition of differentiating dividing by to generate the partial derivative definition of in this approach
