substance can evaporate or achieve equilibrium with other gases present the latter is of interest in the case of the reaction the reaction is endothermic so at higher temperatures a larger degree of dissociation is observed the procedure is to first calibrate the internal volume of the dumas bulb this is done using a heavy gas such as sf and comparing the mass of the bulb when evacuated to the mass of the bulb full of the calibrant gas at a particular pressure and temperature figure the dumas bulb is then charged with a pure sample of the gas to
