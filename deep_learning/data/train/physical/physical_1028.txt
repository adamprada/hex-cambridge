which then leads to the expulsion of gas when the pressure is equilibrated the degree of dissociation is then determined based on the calculated gas density at each temperature where is the measured density and is the theoretical density if no dissociation occurs calculated from the ideal gas law for the given temperature pressure and molar mass of the dissociating gas and is the number of fragments into which the dissociating gas dissociates ieg for equation reqeq the equilibrium constant is then calculated as finally a vant hoff plot is generated to determine the reaction enthalpy contributors and attributions patrick
