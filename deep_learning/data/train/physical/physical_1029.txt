appears as a dependence of rate constants on that variable temperature usually has a big effect the experimentally observed dependence of rate constants on temperature can be expressed in a compact fashion over small temperature ranges it can usually be expressed adequately by the arrhenius equation where and are called the arrhenius activation energy and the frequency factor or preexponential factor respectively the arrhenius equation is an empirical relationship as we see below for our collisiontheory model theoretical treatments predict that the preexponential term a is weakly temperature dependent when we investigate reaction rates experimentally the temperature dependence of a
