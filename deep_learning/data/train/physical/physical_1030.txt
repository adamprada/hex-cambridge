relationships describing the nature of gas samples have been derived completely empirically meaning based solely on observation rather making an attempt to define the theoretical reason these relationships may exist these are the empirical gas laws boyles law one of the important relationships governing gas samples that can be modeled mathematically is the relationship between pressure and volume robert boyle hunter did experiments to confirm the observations of richard towneley and henry powers to show that for a fixed sample of gas at a constant temperature pressure and volume are inversely proportional or boyle used a glass utube that was
