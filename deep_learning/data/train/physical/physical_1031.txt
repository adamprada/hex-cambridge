the volume scale or the second law of thermodynamics also predicts an absolute minimum temperature but that will be developed in a later chapter gaylussacs law gaylussacs law states that the pressure of a fixed sample of gas is proportional to the temperature as with charles law this suggests the existence of an absolute minimum to the temperature scale since the pressure can never be negative or combined gas law boyles charles and gaylussacs laws can be combined into a single empirical formula that can be useful for a given amount of gas the following relationship must hold or avogadros
