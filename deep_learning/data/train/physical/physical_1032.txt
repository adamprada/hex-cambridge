ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers from the fundamental equation for a reversible process we find that the criterion for reversible change at constant entropy is for a reversible process at constant entropy and volume we find to consider the energy change for a spontaneous process we begin with which is independent of whether the change is spontaneous or reversible for a spontaneous process in which both pressurevolume and nonpressurevolume work are possible we have which we can rearrange to for a spontaneous constantentropy change that occurs while the system is in contact with its
