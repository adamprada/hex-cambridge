only pv work these equations state the criteria for change under conditions in which the entropy and volume of the system remain constant if the process is reversible the energy change must be equal to the nonpressurevolume work if the process is spontaneous the energy change must be less than the nonpressure volume work if only pressurevolume work is possible the energy of the system must decrease in a spontaneous process and remain constant in a reversible process each of these differentialexpression criteria applies to every incremental part of a change that falls within its scope in consequence corresponding criteria
