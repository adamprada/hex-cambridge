occur at constant entropy and satisfy the criterion for a change that occurs reversibly and in which the entropy of the system is constant the energy change is equal to the net work of all kinds done on the system a spontaneous change in a mechanical system dissipates mechanical energy as heat by friction if this heat appears in the surroundings and the thermal state of the system remains unchanged such a spontaneous processes satisfies the criterion we have arrived at the criterion for change that we are accustomed to using when we deal with a change in the potential
