we find that the helmholtz and gibbs free energy functions are useful because they provide criteria for spontaneous change when the process is constrained to occur isothermally the energy of a collision between gas molecules last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers it is useful to extend our model of molecular collisions to suppose that one or both of the molecules can undergo chemical change as a result of the collision in doing so we are introducing some ideas that we develop further in chapter when
