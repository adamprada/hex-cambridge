about what we mean by the violence of the collision evidently what we have in mind has two components the relative velocity and the collision angle if the collision is a glancing one we expect the effect on the molecules to be minimal even if the relative velocity is high on the other hand a direct collision might lead to reaction even if the relative velocity is comparatively low with these ideas in mind we see that a reasonable model is to suppose that forces acting along the line of centers can lead to reaction whereas forces acting perpendicular to
