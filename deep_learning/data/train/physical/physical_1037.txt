potential energies change the maximum change in this potential energy is just the amount of kinetic energy that the colliding molecules can use to effect this deformation we can identify this amount of kinetic energy with the component of the molecules kinetic energy that is associated with their relative motion along the line of centers if we now associate a threshold level of deformation with the occurrence of a chemical change the kinetic energy required to effect this deformation determines whether the change can occur if the available kinetic energy is less than that required to achieve the threshold level
