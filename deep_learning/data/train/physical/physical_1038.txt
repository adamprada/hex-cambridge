the relative velocity that is we have only the component that depends on the relative velocity can contribute to the deformation of the colliding molecules the relative velocity can be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the line of centers the parallel component is the projection of the velocity vector onto the line of centers this is and the perpendicular component is we see that the kinetic energy associated with the relative motion of particles and has a component parallel to the line of centers and a component perpendicular to it the idea that the kinetic energy parallel to
