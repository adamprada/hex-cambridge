system is in contact with its surroundings we have so that now let us introduce the additional constraint that the system is subjected to a constant applied pressure throughout the process thus is a welldefined property that can be measured at any stage of the process the incremental pressurevolume work done by the surroundings on the system is in principle the system can undergo spontaneous change so rapidly that there can be a transitory difference between the system pressure and the applied pressure in practice pressure adjustments occur very rapidly except in extreme cases we find that is a good
