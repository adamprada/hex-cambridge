if the process is reversible the enthalpy change must be equal to the nonpressurevolume work if the process is spontaneous the enthalpy change must be less than the nonpressurevolume work if only pressurevolume work is possible the enthalpy of the system must decrease in a spontaneous process and remain constant in a reversible process since each of these differential criteria applies to every incremental part of a reversible change that falls within its scope corresponding criteria apply to finite spontaneous changes these criteria are listed in the summary in section the entropy change around any cycle for any reversible system
