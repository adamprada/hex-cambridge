a state function to do so we introduce an experiencebased theorem the pressurevolume diagram for any reversible system can be tiled by intersecting lines that represent isothermal and adiabatic paths these lines can be packed as densely as we please so that the tiling of the pressurevolume diagram can be made as closely spaced as we please the perimeter of any one of the resulting tiles corresponds to a path around a carnot cycle given any arbitrary closed curve on the pressurevolume diagram we can select a set of tiles that just encloses it see figure the perimeter of this
