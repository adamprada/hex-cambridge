consists of segments that are common to two tiles when we traverse both of these tiles in a clockwise direction the shared segment is traversed once in one direction and once in the other when we add up for these two traverses of the same segment we find that the sum is zero because we have in one direction and in the other this means that the sum of around all of the tiles will just be equal to the sum of around those segments that lie on the perimeter of the enclosing set that is we have where because
