and for any reversible engine producing pressurevolume work we have around any cycle we can extend this analysis to reach the same conclusion for a reversible engine that produces any form of work to see this let us consider the tiling theorem more carefully when we say that the adiabats and isotherms tile the pressurevolume plane we mean that each point in the pressurevolume plane is intersected by one and only one adiabat and by one and only one isotherm when only pressurevolume work is possible every point in the pressurevolume plane represents a unique state of the system therefore
