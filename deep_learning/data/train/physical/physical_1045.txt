effects on the energy of the system are not necessarily the same in general is not the same as where from we know that a reversible carnot engine doing any form of work can be matched with a reversible idealgas carnot engine in such a way that the engines complete the successive isothermal and adiabatic steps in parallel at each step each engine experiences the same heat work energy and entropy changes as the other just as we can plot the reversible idealgas carnot cycle as a closed path in pressurevolume space we can plot a carnot cycle producing any
