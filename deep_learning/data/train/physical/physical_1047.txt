the energy and volume are constant for a system in which only pressurevolume work is possible the system is isolated the conditions we have just derived are entirely equivalent to our earlier conclusions that and for an isolated system that is at equilibrium or undergoing a spontaneous change respectively summing the incremental contributions to a finite change of state produces the parallel relationships spontaneous process only work reversible process only work the validity of these expressions is independent of any variation in either or the entropy change for a spontaneous process at constant h and p last updated save as
