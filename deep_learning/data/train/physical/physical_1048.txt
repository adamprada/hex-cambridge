a finite change of state produces the parallel relationships spontaneous process constant and reversible process constant and if only pressurevolume work is possible we have and spontaneous process constant only work reversible process constant and only work and for a finite change of state spontaneous process only work reversible process only work in this and earlier sections we develop criteria for spontaneous change that are based on and we are now able to develop similar criteria for a spontaneous change in a system that is in thermal contact with constanttemperature surroundings these criteria are based on and however before doing
