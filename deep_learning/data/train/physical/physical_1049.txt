to reach this conclusion by a more detailed argument let us consider an arbitrary system that is in contact with its surroundings we can subdivide these surroundings into subsystems as diagrammed in figure we define a surroundings subsystem surroundings that interacts with the system and a more remote surroundings subsystem surroundings that does not that is we assume that we can define surroundings so that it is unaffected by the process then we define an augmented system consisting of the original system plus surroundings the augmented system is isolated from the remote portion of the surroundings so that the entropy
