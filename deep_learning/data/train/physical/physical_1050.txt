by convincing but not entirely rigorous arguments in section we find that for any reversible process thus for any possible process we have the equality applies when the process is reversible the inequality applies when it is spontaneous because entropy is a state function and change sign when the direction of a process is reversed we say that a process for which is an impossible process our definitions mean that these classificationsreversible spontaneous and impossibleare exhaustive and mutually exclusive we conclude that is necessary and sufficient for a process to be reversible is necessary and sufficient for a process to
