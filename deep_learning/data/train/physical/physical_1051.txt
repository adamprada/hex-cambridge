the probability that an observation made on produces a value of in the range is and the probability that an observation made on produces a value of in the range is the probability that making one observation on each of these distributions produces a value of that lies in the range and a value of that lies in the range is in a straightforward generalization we define the expected value of as if is a sum of functions of independent variables we have if is a product of independent functions we have we can extend these conclusions to functions of
