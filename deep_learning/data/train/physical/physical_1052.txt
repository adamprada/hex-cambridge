have if we consider the special case of repeated trials in which the functions are all the same function so that the expected value of becomes and the expected value of becomes now let us consider independent trials on the same distribution and let then the expected value of becomes by definition the average of repeated trials is so that the expected value of the mean of a distribution of an averageof repeated trials is this proves one element of the central limit theorem the mean of a distribution of averagesof values of a random variable drawn from a parent
