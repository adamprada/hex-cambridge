changes we write anything we do to increase the energy of a closed system can be classified as either adding heat to the system or doing work on the system heat work and energy are all extensive variables they are additive if a system acquires an increment of heat from one source and an increment from another source the total heat acquired by the system is if work of one kind and work of a second kind are done on the system the total work is in keeping with the thermodynamic perspective that we can partition the universe into system
