that is we are not free to choose another convention for this energy accounting ample experimental evidence supports our assumption that energy conservation is a fundamental property of nature in summary we postulate that for any change whatsoever that a closed system may undergo we can identify energy inputs either as heat or as one or more forms of work such that and if a system undergoes a series of changes that ultimately return it to its original state the energy change for the entire series of changes will be zero there are two components to this postulate the first
