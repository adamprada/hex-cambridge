of its mass when this is case the total incremental energy change is the same thing as the incremental change in the internal energy of the system when we need to distinguish the internal energy of a system from its total energy we write for the internal energy and for the total energy letting incremental changes in the kinetic and potential energy of the whole system be and respectively we have and for processes of interest in chemical systems we normally have then the total energy and the internal energy are the same thing in section we introduce characteristic variables
