conditions a given amount of a particular substance makes a fixed contribution to the energy of the system if we transfer matter across the boundary of a system we change the energy of the system we can always alter the original system to include the matter that is to be transferred the altered system is closed and so by the first law its energy is the same after the transfer as it was before in section we develop an explicit mathematical function to model the contribution made to the energy of a system by a specified quantity of matter in
