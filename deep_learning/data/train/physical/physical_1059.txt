appear as in increase in the thermal energy of the system to illustrate this point let us consider a reversible process and an irreversible process each of which increases the temperature of one gram of water by one degree k the initial and final states of the system are the same for both processes in the reversible process we bring the water whose temperature is into contact with a thermal reservoir at an incrementally higher temperature and allow of heat to transfer to the system by convection no work is done we have and in this case there is no
