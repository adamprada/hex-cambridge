and uncoiling the spring generates bulk motion within the water within a short time the energy of this bulk motion is completely dissipated as molecularlevel kinetic energy or heat beginning in we consider the reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas this simple process provides a further illustration of the interconversion of heat and work within a system for this process we find that thermal energy crosses the system boundary and is converted entirely into work that appears in the surroundings the energy of the system is unchanged the energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature in an
