the temperature of the system remains constant at the change in the helmholtz free energy for this process is substituting gives spontaneous process constant rearranging we have using the inequality we have when we stipulate that this becomes spontaneous process constant where is all of the work of any kind done on the system during a small increment of the spontaneous process if we introduce the still further requirement that the volume is constant we have and then spontaneous process constant and and if only pressurevolume work is possible spontaneous process constant and only work from our earlier discussion of
