the gibbs free energy inequality becomes spontaneous process constant and if only pressurevolume work is possible this becomes spontaneous process constant and only work from our earlier discussion of reversible processes we have the parallel relationships reversible process constant and reversible process constant and only work since each of these differentialexpression criteria applies to every incremental part of a reversible change that falls within its scope we have the following criteria for finite spontaneous changes when the temperature of the system is constant spontaneous process constant spontaneous process constant and spontaneous process constant and only work spontaneous process constant and
