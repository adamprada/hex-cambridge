is however at any intermediate point in the process the system can have any temperature whatsoever in states b and c the helmholtz free energies are and the change in the helmholtz free energy is or rearranging and using we have so that spontaneous process constant if we require further that the system volume remain constant there is no pressurevolume work and we have spontaneous process constant and if only pressurevolume work is possible and spontaneous process constant and only work under the same temperature assumptions and assuming that the gibbs free energies are and so that or the pressurevolume
