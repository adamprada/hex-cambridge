that of the bath the atmosphere applies a constant pressure to the system the reaction is an irreversible process it proceeds spontaneously until its equilibrium position is reached until equilibrium is reached the reaction cannot be reversed by an arbitrarily small change in the applied pressure or the temperature of the surroundings and are criteria for spontaneous change that apply to this situation whatever the temperature of the system might be during any intermediate part of the process the frequency of collisions between unlike gas molecules last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at
