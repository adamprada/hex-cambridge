we want to use the simplest possible size and shape accordingly we consider a model in which gas molecules are spheres with welldefined radii we let the radii of molecules and be and respectively see figure when such molecules collide their surfaces must come into contact and the distance between their centers must be we call the collision radius figure the molecular collision radius let us consider a molecule of type in a container with a large number of molecules of type we suppose that there are molecules of type per unit volume every molecule of type has some velocity
