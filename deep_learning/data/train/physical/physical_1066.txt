as it does so it collides with any type molecule whose center is within a distance of its own center for the moment let us suppose that the trajectory of molecule is unaffected by the collisions it experiences then in unit time molecule sweeps out a cylinder whose length is and whose crosssectional area is the volume of this cylinder is see figure figure the collision volume of a gas molecule in unit time since there are molecules of type per unit volume the number of type molecules in the cylinder is each of these molecules is a molecule of
