that now we need to reevaluate the assumption that the trajectory of a molecule of a molecule is unaffected by its collisions with molecules of type clearly this is not the case the path of molecule changes abruptly at each collision the actual cylinder that molecule sweeps out will have numerous kinks as indicated in figure the kinked cylinder can be produced from a straight one by making a series oblique cuts one for each kink across the straight cylinder and then rotating the ends of each cut into convergence if we think of the cylinder as a solid rod
