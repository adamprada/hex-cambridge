stating the criteria for change using only the properties of the system let us consider how some thermodynamic functions change when a process is reversible we consider a closed system and focus on making incremental changes in the state of the system for a reversible process we have the reversible pressurevolume work is if nonpressurevolume work is also possible the reversible work becomes where is the increment of reversible nonpressurevolume work the energy change is any reversible process this equation is of central importance it is sometimes called the combined first and second laws of thermodynamics or the fundamental equation
