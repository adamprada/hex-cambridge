the subscript specifies that the entropy is constant for a reversible process in which all of the work is pressurevolume work we have and the fundamental equation becomes reversible process only pressurevolume work for a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the energy must change when the entropy changes by and the volume changes by now let us apply the fundamental equation to an arbitrary process that occurs reversibly and at constant entropy and constant volume under these conditions and therefore at constant entropy and volume a necessary and sufficient
