an equilibrium state can undergo no further change thus the condition defines a unique or primitive equilibrium state if a closed system behaves reversibly any composition changes that occur in the system must be reversible for chemical applications composition changes are of paramount importance we return to these considerations in chapter where we relate the properties of chemical substancestheir chemical potentialsto the behavior of systems undergoing both reversible and spontaneous composition changes if a closed system behaves reversibly and only pressurevolume work is possible we see from the fundamental equation that specifying the changes in any two of the three
