of relationships for enthalpy the helmholtz free energy and the gibbs free energy we define for an incremental change in a system we have using the fundamental equation to substitute for de this becomes for a reversible process in which all of the work is pressurevolume work we have reversible process only pressurevolume work for a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the enthalpy must change when the entropy changes by and the pressure changes by if a reversible process occurs at constant entropy and pressure then and at constant
