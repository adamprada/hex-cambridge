pressurevolume work for a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the helmholtz free energy must change when the temperature changes by and the volume changes by for a reversible isothermal process we have and from we have reversible isothermal process where we recognize that the reversible pressurevolume work is and the work of all kinds is we see that is the total of all the work done on the system in a reversible process at constant temperature this is the reason that is used as the symbol for the helmholtz
