which all of the work is pressurevolume work reversible process only pressurevolume work for a reversible process in which only pressurevolume work is possible this equation gives the amount by which the gibbs free energy must change when the temperature changes by and the pressure changes by for a reversible process that occurs at constant temperature and pressure and at constant temperature and pressure the process will be reversible if and only if any reversible process if only pressurevolume work is possible reversible process only pressurevolume work where the subscripts indicate that temperature and pressure are constant in this section
