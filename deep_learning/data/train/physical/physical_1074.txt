a corresponding criterion for a finite reversible change these criteria are summarized in in developing the criteria in this section we stipulate that various combinations of the thermodynamic functions that characterize the system are constant we develop these criteria for systems undergoing reversible change consequently the requirements imposed by reversibility must be satisfied also in particular the system must be composed of homogeneous phases and its temperature must be the same as that of the surroundings the pressure of the system must be equal to the pressure applied to it by the surroundings when we specify that a reversible process
