type moving with the relative velocity through a gas of stationary type molecules in unit time molecule travels a distance and collides with many molecules of type we can characterize each such collision by the angle between the velocity vector and the line of centers of the colliding pair for glancing collisions we have for headon collisions we have all else being equal the collision will be more violent the smaller the angle evidently we can describe the average effect of collisions more completely if we can specify the frequency of collisions as a function of more precisely we want
