is the circumference times the radial thickness since the radius of the shell is its circumference is the radial thickness of the annulus is just the change in the distance between the velocity vector and the wall of the cylinder when changes by a small amount this is therefore the area of the annulus is and the volume of the cylindrical shell swept out by a type molecule traveling at exactly the speed in unit time is we again let be the number of molecules of type per unit volume the number of collisions per unit time between a molecule
