we have the result we need recognizing that possible values of lie in the range and that possible values of lie in the range we can find the frequency of all possible collisions by summing over all possible values of and that is in section we obtained this result by a slightly different argument in which we did not explicitly consider the collision angle the gibbsduhem equation last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry at california state university east bay contributors and attributions for a system at equilibrium the gibbsduhem equation must
