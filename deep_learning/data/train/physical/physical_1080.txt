particles whose wavefunctions are even under are called bose particles or bosons those for which is odd are called fermions electrons belong to the latter class of particles the simple spinorbital product function used in hartree theory does not have the proper permutational symmetry for example the be atom function is not odd under the interchange of the labels of electrons and instead one obtains however such products of spinorbitals ie orbitals multiplied by or spin functions can be made into properly antisymmetric functions by forming the determinant of an matrix whose row index labels the spin orbital and whose
