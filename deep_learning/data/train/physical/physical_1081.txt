write such a determinant is as follows where the sum is over all n permutations of the spinorbitals and the notation means that a is affixed to any permutation that involves an odd number of pair wise interchanges of spinorbitals and a sign is given to any that involves an even number to properly normalize such a determinental wavefunction one must multiply it by so the final result is that a wavefunction of the form which is often written in shorthand notation as has the proper permutational antisymmetry note that such functions consist of as sum of factors all of
