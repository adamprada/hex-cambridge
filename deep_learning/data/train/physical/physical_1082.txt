the same as the hartree schr√∂dnger equation treated earlier in fact if one variationally minimizes the expectation value of the electron hamiltonian for the above antisymmetric product wavefunction subject to the condition that the spinorbitals are orthonormal one obtains the following equation for the optimal in this expression which is known as the hartreefock equation the same kinetic and nuclear attraction potentials occur as in the hartree equation moreover the same coulomb potential appears however one also finds a socalled exchange contribution to the hartreefock potential that is equal to and is often written in shorthand notation as notice that
