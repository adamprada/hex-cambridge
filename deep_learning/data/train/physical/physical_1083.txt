that depend on the fourth power of the spinorbitals ie as when these terms are differentiated to minimize the expectation value they generate factors that scale linearly and with the third power of the spinorbitals these are the factors and appearing in the hartreefock equations shown above when the lcao expansion of each hartreefock hf spinorbital is substituted into the above hf schr√∂dinger equation a matrix equation is again obtained where the overlap integral is as defined earlier and the matrix element is clearly the only difference between this expression and the corresponding result of hartree theory is the presence
