between two electrons whose coordinates and are both distributed throughout the overlap region this overlap region is where both and have appreciable magnitude so exchange integrals tend to be significant in magnitude only when the two orbitals involved have substantial regions of overlap finally a few words are in order about one of the most computer timeconsuming parts of any hartreefock calculation or those discussed later the task of evaluating and transforming the twoelectron integrals when m gtos are used as basis functions the evaluation of of these integrals often poses a major hurdle for example with basis orbitals there
