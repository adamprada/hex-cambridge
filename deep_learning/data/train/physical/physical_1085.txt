functions are used to obtain more efficient approximations to their integrals when these functions are far apart moreover such expansions offer a reliable way to ignore ie approximate as zero many integrals whose product functions are sufficiently distant such approaches show considerable promise for reducing the twoelectron integral list to one whose size scales much less strongly with the size of the ao basis and form an important component if efforts to achieve cpu and storage needs that scale linearly with the size of the molecule koopmans theorem the hfscf equations imply that the orbital energies can be written as
