so one obtains the coulomb minus exchange interaction of with all of the occupied spinorbitals in hence the energies of occupied orbitals pertain to interactions appropriate to a total of electrons while the energies of virtual orbitals pertain to a system with electrons this difference is very important to understand and to keep in mind let us consider the following model of the detachment or attachment of an electron in an electron system in this model both the parent molecule and the species generated by adding or removing an electron are treated at the singledeterminant level the hartreefock orbitals of
