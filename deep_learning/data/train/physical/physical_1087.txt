with spinorbitals through occupied is which can also be written as likewise the energy of the electron determinant wavefunction is the difference between these two energies is given by that is the energy difference is equal to minus the expression for the energy of the spinorbital which was given earlier so within the limitations of the hf frozenorbital model the ionization potentials ips and electron affinities eas are given as the negative of the occupied and virtual spinorbital energies respectively this statement is referred to as koopmans theorem it is used extensively in quantum chemical calculations as a means of
