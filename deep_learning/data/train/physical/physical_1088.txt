a given orbital occupation in terms of the orbital energies alone we need to also keep track of the interelectron coulomb and exchange energies the heat exchanged by a spontaneous process at constant entropy last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers to continue our effort to find change criteria that use only properties of the system let us consider a spontaneous process during which the system is in contact with its surroundings and the entropy of the system is constant for every incremental part of this
