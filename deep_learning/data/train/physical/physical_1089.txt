incremental part of the process for any finite change it follows that the overall heat must satisfy the same inequality spontaneous process constant entropy for a spontaneous process that occurs with the system in contact with its surroundings but in which the entropy of the system is constant the system must give up heat to the surroundings and are criteria for spontaneous change at constant system entropy in section we develop criteria for reversible processes the criteria relate changes in the systems state functions to the reversible nonpressurevolume work that is done on the system during the process now we
