k the difference between these values is the enthalpy change in vaporizing one mole of liquid methanol to its ideal gas standard state at k since this is the difference between the enthalpy of methanol in its standard state as an ideal gas and methanol in its standard state as a liquid we can call this difference the standard enthalpy of vaporization for methanol this is not a reversible process because liquid methanol at bar is not at equilibrium with its vapor at an arbitrarily low pressure at k note that is not the same as the ordinary enthalpy of
