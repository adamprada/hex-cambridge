the construction the cooling that they observed as the gas expanded from a high pressure region to a lower pressure region was extremely important and lead to a common design of modern refrigerators not all gases undergo a cooling effect upon expansion some gases such as hydrogen and helium will experience a warming effect upon expansion under conditions near room temperature and pressure the direction of temperature change can be determined by measuring the joulethomson coefficient this coefficient has the definition schematically the joulethomson coefficient can be measured by measuring the temperature drop or increase a gas undergoes for a
