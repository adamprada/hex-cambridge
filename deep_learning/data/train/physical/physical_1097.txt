these are the upper and lower inversion temperatures figure the typical behavior of the joulethomson coefficient at different temperatures and pressures using the tools of mathematics it is possible to express the joulethomson coefficient in terms of measurable properties consider enthalpy as a function of pressure and temperature this suggests that the total differential can be expressed it will be shown later again once we develop the maxwell relations that a simple substitution shows so for an ideal gas so which causes the first term to vanish so for constant enthalpy expansion there can be no change in temperature this
