experiments put at f became the calibration standard later the centigrade scale was developed with fixed points at degrees and degrees at the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water respectively the centigrade scale is now called the celsius scale after anders celsius anders a swedish astronomer in celsius proposed a scale on which the temperature interval between the boiling point and the freezing point of water was divided into degrees however a more positive number corresponded to a colder condition further reflection convinces us that the charles law equation can be simplified by defining a new
