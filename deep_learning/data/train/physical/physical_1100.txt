the size of one unit of temperature is defined using the celsius scale ie is the temperature in degrees celsius this is the origin of the kelvin temperature scale then on the kelvin temperature scale is degrees that is when k is degrees celsius the temperature at which the volume extrapolates to zero is called the absolute zero of temperature when the size of one unit of temperature is defined using the fahrenheit scale and the zero of temperature is set at absolute zero the resulting temperature scale is called the rankine scale after william rankine a scottish engineer who
