particles the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample of gas is proportional to the temperature qualitatively this model predicts the form of the ideal gas law more particles means more collisions with the wall smaller volume means more frequent collisions with the wall higher molecular speeds means more frequent collisions with the walls putting all of these together yields which is exactly the form of the ideal gas law the remainder of the job is to derive a value for the constant of proportionality that is consistent with experimental observation for simplicity imagine a collection of gas
