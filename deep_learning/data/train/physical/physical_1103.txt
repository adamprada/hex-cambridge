the area over which collisions are spread the smaller the pressure will be figure the collision volume is the subset of the total volume that contains molecules that will actually collide with area in the time interval first off the pressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the container would be due entirely to the force imparted each time a molecule collides with the interior surface of the container this force will be scaled by the number of molecules that hit the area of the wall in a given time for this reason it is convenient to define
