the collision volume and thus the number of molecules that will collide with the wall is given by and thus the number of molecules colliding with the wall will be the magnitude of that force imparted per collision will be determined by the timerate of change in momentum of each particle as it hits the surface it can be calculated by determining the total momentum change and dividing by the total time required for the event since each colliding molecule will change its velocity from vx to vx the magnitude of the momentum change is mvx thus the force imparted
