velocity in the x direction the distribution function for velocities in the x direction known as the maxwellboltzmann distribution is given by this function has two parts a normalization constant and an exponential term the normalization constant is derived by noting that normalizing the maxwellboltzmann distribution the maxwellboltzmann distribution has to be normalized because it is a continuous probability distribution as such the sum of the probabilities for all possible values of vx must be unity and since can take any value between and then equation refprob must be true so if the form of is assumed to be the
