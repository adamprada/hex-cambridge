the probability of measuring the value this can also be extended to problems where the measurable properties are not discrete like the numbers that result from rolling a pair of dice but rather come from a continuous parent population in this case if the probability is of measuring a specific outcome the average value can then be determined by where is the function describing the probability distribution and with the integration taking place across all possible values that x can take calculating the average value of a value that is useful and will be used in further developments is the
