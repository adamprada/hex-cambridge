of the distribution the problem becomes in other words we will consider only half of the distribution and then double the result to account for the half we ignored for simplicity we will write the distribution function as where and a table of definite integrals shows so substituting our definitions for and produces this expression indicates the average speed for motion of in one direction however real gas samples have molecules not only with a distribution of molecular speeds and but also a random distribution of directions using normal vector magnitude properties or simply using the pythagorean theorem it can
