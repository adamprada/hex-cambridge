the motions and collisions of perfectly elastic spheres proposed a form for this distribution of speeds which proved to be consistent with observed properties of gases such as their viscosities he derived this expression based on a transformation of coordinate system from cartesian coordinates to spherical polar coordinates in this new coordinate system v represents the magnitude of the velocity or the speed and all of the directional data is carried in the angles and the infinitesimal volume unit becomes applying this transformation of coordinates and ignoring the angular part since he was interested only in the speed maxwells distribution
