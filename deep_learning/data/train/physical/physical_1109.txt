exponential term causes it to drop back down asymptotically to zero the distribution will spread over a larger range of speed at higher temperatures but collapse to a smaller range of values at lower temperatures table figure maxwell distribution of speeds for hydrogen molecules at differing temperatures calculating the average speed using the maxwell distribution as a distribution of probabilities the average molecular speed in a sample of gas molecules can be determined the following can be found in a table of integrals so which simplifies to note the value of is twice that of which was derived in an
