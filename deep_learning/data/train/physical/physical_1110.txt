differing molecular masses the probability distribution function can also be used to derive an expression for the most probable speed the average and the rootmeansquare speeds as a function of the temperature and masses of the molecules in the sample the most probable speed is the one with the maximum probability that will be the speed that yields the maximum value of it is found by solving the expression for the value of that makes it true this will be the value that gives the maximum value of for the given temperature similarly the average value can be found using
