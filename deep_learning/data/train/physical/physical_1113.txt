function of the surroundings thus is the energy of the system is the energy of the surroundings is an incremental change in the energy of the system and is an incremental change in the energy of the surroundings if we are careful to remember that heat and work are not state functions it is useful to extend this notation to increments of heat and work if units of energy are transmitted to the system as heat we let be the thermal energy transferred to the surroundings in the same process then and likewise we let be the work done on
