by a decrease in the energy of the surroundings and conversely energy is conserved heat is not work is not the first law of thermodynamics in a process in which a closed system accepts increments of heat and work from its surroundings the change in the energy of the system is energy is a state function for any process for a reversible process in which a system passes from state a to state b the amount by which the energy of the system changes is the line integral of along the path followed denoting an incremental energy change along this
