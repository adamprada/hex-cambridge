increment of heat from its surroundings the entropy change is defined by we introduce the superscript rev to distinguish heat and work exchanged in reversible processes from heat and work exchanged in irreversible irrev or spontaneous spon processes when a system passes reversibly from state a to state b the entropy change for the system is the line integral of along the path followed the entropy change for the surroundings is defined by the same relationship every system has an entropy the entropies of the system and of its surroundings can change whenever a system undergoes a change if the
