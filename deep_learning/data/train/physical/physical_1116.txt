likewise since for every part of a spontaneous process we have for any spontaneous process the third law deals with the properties of entropy at temperatures in the neighborhood of absolute zero it is possible to view the third law as a statement about the properties of the temperature function it is also possible to view it as a statement about the properties of heat capacities a statement in which the third law attributes particular properties to the entropy of pure substances is directly applicable to chemical systems this statement is that of lewis and randall third law of thermodynamics
