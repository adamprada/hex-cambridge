at the absolute zero of temperature the third law enables us to find thermodynamic properties absolute entropies and gibbs free energies of formation from which we can make useful predictions about the equilibrium positions of reactions the third law can be inferred from experimental observations on macroscopic systems it also arises in a natural way when we develop the theory of statistical thermodynamics in both developments the choice of zero for the entropy of each element in some crystalline state at absolute zero iswhile arbitrarylogical natural and compellingly convenient the lindemannhinshelwood mechanism for firstorder decay last updated save as pdf
