unimolecular reactions provides a mathematical model of these ideas since molecules exchange energy via collisions any given molecule acquires excess energy by collisions with other molecules and loses it within a short time through other collisions if it retains its excess energy long enough it will react if collisions are very infrequent every molecule that acquires excess energy reacts before it undergoes a deactivating collision in this case the reaction rate is proportional to the rate at which molecules acquire excess energy which is proportional to the number of collisions in a collection of molecules the total number of collisions
