rates cobalt pentammine complexes have been studied extensively mechanism in acidic aqueous solutions the reaction etc usually proceeds exclusively through the aquo complex the first step in the reaction is the breaking of a bond and the formation of a bond step subsequently a moiety can replace the aquo group step for example in aqueous solution water is always present at a much higher concentration than the various possible entering groups so it is reasonable that it should be favored in the competition to form the new bond to nevertheless we expect the strength of the bond to be an
