the reaction is this is called the basehydrolysis reaction it is faster than the formation of the aquo complex in acidic solutions and the rate is law found to be this rate law is consistent with nucleophilic attack by the hydroxide ion at the cobalt center so that bond formation occurs simultaneously with breaking of the bond however this interpretation means that the hydroxide ion is a uniquely effective nucleophile toward cobaltiii nucleophilic displacements have been investigated on many other electrophiles in general hydroxide is not a particularly effective nucleophile toward other electrophilic centers so assignment of an mechanism to
