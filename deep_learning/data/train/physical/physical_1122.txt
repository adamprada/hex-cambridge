series of proton transfers to step and from step the aqueous solvent the aquo complex rearranges to the final product with as the leaving group the mechanism is the evidence in favor of the mechanism is persuasive it requires that the ammine protons be acidic so that they can undergo the acidbase reaction in the first step that this reaction occurs is demonstrated by protonexchange experiments in basic the ammine protons undergo exchange according to the ammine protons are also necessary base hydrolysis does not occur for similar compounds like in which there are no protons on the nitrogen atoms
