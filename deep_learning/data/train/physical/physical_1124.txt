introduces some of this terminology and some of the mechanistic complications that can be observed the catalytic specificity of enzymes is explained by the idea that the enzyme and the substrate have complex threedimensional structures these structures complement one another in the sense that enzyme and substrate can fit together tightly bringing the catalytically active parts of the enzymes structure into close proximity with those substrate chemical bonds that are changed in the reaction this is often called the lock and key model for enzyme specificity invoking the idea that the detailed features of the enzymes structure are shaped to
