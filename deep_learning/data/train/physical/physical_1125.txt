products diffuse away the enzyme can then complex with another substrate molecule and catalyze its reaction representing the enzyme substrate enzymesubstrate complex and products as and respectively the simplestcase michaelismenten mechanism is complexation equilibrium substrate transformation where is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the enzymesubstrate complex and is the rate constant for the ratedetermining transformation of the enzymesubstrate complex into products since the firstorder decay of the enzymesubstrate complex is the productforming step the reaction rate is expected to be letting the product concentration be and the initial concentrations of enzyme and substrate be and respectively material balance
