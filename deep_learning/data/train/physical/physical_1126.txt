law becomes inconvenient in practice the integrated form of the rate law is seldom used as noted earlier enzyme catalysis is usually studied using the method of initial rates that is the rate is approximated as by measuring the amount of product formed over a short time interval in which the rate and equilibrium constants can then be found by fitting the rate measured at various initial concentrations and to the equation since the concentration of the enzymesubstrate complex is normally small compared to the concentration of the substrate the michaelismenten mechanism can also be analyzed by applying the steadystate
