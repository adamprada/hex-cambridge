to the question of whether a system is at equilibrium the idea that we can subdivide a system without changing its equilibrium properties is subject to an important qualification we intend that both subsystems be qualitatively equivalent to the original for example if we divide a system at vaporliquid equilibrium into subsystems each subsystem must contain some liquid and some vapor if we subdivide it into one subsystem that is all liquid and another that is all vapor the subsystems are not qualitatively equivalent to the original we can be more precise about the criterion we have in mind an
