a macroscopic sample of a pure gas we know that we need four variables to completely describe the state of the gas the number of moles of the gas its pressure its volume and its temperature this assumes that we are not interested in the motion of the container that contains the gas it assumes also that no other extrinsic factorslike gravitational electric or magnetic fields affect the behavior that we propose to model when we do experiments in which the amount pressure volume and temperature of a pure gas vary we find that we can develop an equation that
