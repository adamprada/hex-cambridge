gas we have where the number of moles per unit volume is the gas concentration we see that any equation of state can be expressed as a function of three intensive variables pressure temperature and concentration the existence of an equation of state means that only two of the three intensive variables that describe the gas sample are independent of one another at equilibrium a sample of pure gas has two degrees of freedom viewed as a statement about the mathematical model this is true because knowledge of the equation of state and any two of the intensive variables enables
