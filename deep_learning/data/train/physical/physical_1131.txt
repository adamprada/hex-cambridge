fixing two of the three intensive variables is sufficient to fix the equilibrium properties of the system fixing the equilibrium properties means of course that the state of the system is fixed to within an arbitrary factor which can be specified either as the number of moles present or as the system volume similar results are obtained when we study the pressurevolumetemperature behavior of pure substances in condensed phases at equilibrium a pure liquid or a pure solid has two degrees of freedom if we consider a homogeneous mixture of two nonreacting gases we discover that three variables are necessary
