phase equilibrium with one another we find that there is only one independent intensive variable figure illustrates this for water to maintain phase equilibrium the system pressure must be the equilibrium vapor pressure of the substance at the system temperature if we keep the pressure and temperature constant at equilibrium values we can increase or decrease the concentration moles per unit system volume by removing or adding heat in this process we change one variable concentration while maintaining phase equilibrium if we keep the pressure constant and impose a temperature increase vaporization continues the concentration decreases until the liquid phase
