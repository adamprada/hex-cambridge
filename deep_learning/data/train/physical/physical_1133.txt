there is only one independent intensive variable in the liquid region of the water phase diagram we can vary pressure and temperature and the system remains liquid water along the liquidgas equilibrium line we can vary the temperature and remain at equilibrium only if we simultaneously vary the pressure so as to remain on the liquidgas equilibrium line similar statements apply if we contrast varying pressure and temperature for the pure solid to varying the pressure and temperature along the solidliquid or the solidgas equilibrium line at the triple point nothing is variable for a fixed quantity of water the
