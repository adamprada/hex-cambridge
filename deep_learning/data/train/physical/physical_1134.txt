present a system contains as many phases as there are kinds of macroscopic homogeneous bounded portions that are either solid liquid or gas if we add a lump of pure aluminum to our icewater system the new system contains three phases water ice and aluminum the equilibrium properties of the new system are the same if the aluminum is added as a groundup powder the powder contains many macroscopic homogeneous bounded portions that are aluminum but each of these portions has the same composition there is only one kind of aluminum particle molecules on the surface of a substance can
