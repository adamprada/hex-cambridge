in turn written in terms of the equilibrium constant expression of statistical mechanics discussed in chapter for example for a bimolecular reaction passing through a ts denoted ab one writes the concentration in molecules per unit volume of ab species in terms of the concentrations of a and of b and the respective partition functions as there is however one aspect of the partition function of the ts species that is specific to this theory the partition function contains all of the usual translational rotational vibrational and electronic partition functions that one would write down as we did in chapter
