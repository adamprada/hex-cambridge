if one knows the gradients and hessian matrix elements of the energy surface at the ts one can express the variation of the potential energy along the cartesian coordinates of the molecule as follows where e is the energy at the ts and the denote displacements away from the ts geometry of course at the ts the gradients all vanish because this geometry corresponds to a stationary point as we discussed in chapter the hessian matrix has zero eigenvalues whose eigenvectors correspond to overall translation and rotation of the molecule this matrix has positive eigenvalues whose eigenvectors correspond to the
