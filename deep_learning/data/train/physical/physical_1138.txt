step along the negatively curved direction the gradient no longer vanishes because one is no longer at the stationary point returning to the tst rate calculation one therefore is able to express the concentration of species at the ts in terms of the reactant concentrations and a ratio of partition functions the denominator of this ratio contains the conventional partition functions of the reactant molecules and can be evaluated as discussed in chapter however the numerator contains the partition function of the ts species but with one vibrational component missing ie other than the one missing the tss partition function
