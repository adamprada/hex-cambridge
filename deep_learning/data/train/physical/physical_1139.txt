remembering our discussion of such matters in chapter we know that the momentum factor entering into the classical partition function for translation along the reaction coordinate is here m is the mass factor associated with the reaction coordinate s we can express the rate or frequency at which such trajectories pass through the narrow region of width as with being the speed of passage cm s and being the inverse of the distance that defines the ts region so has units of s in summary we expect the rate of trajectories moving through the ts region to be however we
