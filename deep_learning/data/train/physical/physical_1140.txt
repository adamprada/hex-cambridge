account for the fact that a reactive trajectory must have at least in energy along s is to integrate over only values of greater than to account for the fact that some trajectories with energies above may recross we include a socalled transmission coefficient k whose value is between zero and unity in the most elementary tst tunneling is ignored putting all of these pieces together we carry out the integration over just described to obtain where the momentum is integrated from to and the scoordinate is integrated only over the small region if the transmission coefficient is factored out
