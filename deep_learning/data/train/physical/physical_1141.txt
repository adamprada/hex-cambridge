number of molecules per unit volume just as appeared in earlier expressions for equilibrium constants as in chapter the above rate expression undergoes only minor modifications when unimolecular reactions are considered for example in the hypothetical reaction via the ts one obtains where again is a partition function of a with one missing vibrational component before bringing this discussion of tst to a close i need to stress that this theory is not exact it assumes that the reacting molecules are nearly in thermal equilibrium so it is less likely to work for reactions in which the reactant species are
