we now illustrate variational transition state theory within the tst expression for the rate constant of a bimolecular reaction or of a unimolecular reaction the height e of the barrier on the potential energy surface appears in the ts species partition function or respectively in particular the ts partition function contains a factor of the form in which the bornoppenheimer electronic energy of the ts relative to that of the reactant species appears this energy is the value of the potential energy at the ts geometry which we denote it turns out that the conventional ts approximation to overestimates reaction
