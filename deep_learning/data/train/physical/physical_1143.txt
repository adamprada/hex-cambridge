this means is that the location s along the reaction path at which the freeenergy reaches a saddle point is not the same the location where the bornoppenheimer electronic energy has its saddle this interpretation of how and differ can be appreciated by recalling that partition functions are related to the helmholtz free energy by so determining the value of where reaches a minimum is equivalent to finding that where the free energy is at a maximum so in vtst one adjusts the dividing surface through the location of the reaction coordinate s to first find that value where has
