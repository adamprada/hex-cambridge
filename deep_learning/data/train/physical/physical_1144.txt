for reactions involving light species recall from chapter that tunneling probabilities depend exponentially on the mass of the tunneling particle i refer the reader to the web page of prof don truhlar who has been one of the pioneers of vtst for further details reaction path hamiltonian theory let us review what the reaction path is as defined earlier in chapter it is a path that begins at a transition state ts and evolves along the direction of negative curvature on the potential energy surface as found by identifying the eigenvector of the hessian matrix hjk dfraceqkqj that belongs to
