reaction path the bornoppenheimer potential energy surfacef its gradient components and its hessian components can be evaluated in terms of derivatives of with respect to the cartesian coordinates of the molecule however when one carries out reaction path dynamics one uses a different set of coordinates for reasons that are similar to those that arise in the treatment of normal modes of vibration as given in chapter in particular one introduces massweighted coordinates that are related to the cartesian coordinates in the same way as we saw in chapter the gradient and hessian matrices along these new coordinates xj can
