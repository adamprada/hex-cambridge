vectors possess nearly zero gradient component and positive curvature this means that at any point on the reaction path being discussed one is at or near a local minimum along all directions that are transverse to the reaction path direction ie the gradient direction one can move to a neighboring point on the reaction path by moving a small infinitesimal amount along the gradient in terms of the massweighted hessians eigenmode directions and the potential energy surface can be approximated in the neighborhood of each such point on the reaction path by expanding it in powers of displacements away from
