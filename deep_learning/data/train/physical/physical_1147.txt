massweighted hessian decompose the internal coordinates into along which is harmonic and one along which the reaction evolves in terms of these same coordinates the kinetic energy can also be written and thus the classical hamiltonian can be constructed because the coordinates we use are massweighted in cartesian form the kinetic energy contains no explicit mass factors t dfrac sumj mj leftfracdqjdtright dfrac sumj leftfracdxjdtright this means that the momenta conjugate to each massweighted coordinate obtained in the usual way as all have identical unit mass factors associated with them to obtain the working expression for the reaction path hamiltonian
