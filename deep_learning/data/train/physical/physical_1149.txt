thermal reaction is of interest or could be chosen equal to the mean collision energy of a beamcollision experiment timeevolving the and coordinate and momentum using the above hamiltonian assuming that each transverse mode remains in the quantum state that it had when the reaction began the assumption that remains fixed which is why this model is called vibrationally adiabatic does not mean that the energy content of the mode remains fixed because the frequencies vary as one moves along the reaction path as a result the kinetic energy along the reaction coordinate will change both because varies along and
