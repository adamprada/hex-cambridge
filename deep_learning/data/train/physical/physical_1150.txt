at two neighboring points and along the reaction path in summary once a reaction path has been mapped out one can compute along this path the massweighted hessian matrix and the potential given these quantities all terms in the rph are in hand this knowledge can subsequently be used to perform the propagation of a set of classical coordinates and momenta forward in time for any initial ie momenta and one can use the above form for h to propagate the coordinates and momenta forward in time in this manner one can use the rph theory to follow the time
