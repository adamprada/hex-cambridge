in this way one can determine the overall reaction probability classical dynamics simulation of rates one can also perform classical dynamics simulations of reactive events without using the reaction path hamiltonian following a procedure like that outlined in chapter where classical condensedmedia md simulations were discussed one can timeevolve the newton equations of motion of the molecular reaction species using for example the cartesian coordinates of each atom in the system and with either a bornoppenheimer surface or a parameterized functional form eg a force field of course it is essential that whatever function one uses must be able to
