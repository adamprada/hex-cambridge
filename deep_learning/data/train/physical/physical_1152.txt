the coordinate at the initial geometry by applying the timepropagation process one generates a set of new coordinates and new velocities appropriate to the system at time using these new coordinates and momenta as and and evaluating the forces at these new coordinates one can again use the newton equations to generate another finitetimestep set of new coordinates and velocities through the sequential application of this process one generates a sequence of coordinates and velocities that simulate the systems dynamical behavior in using this kind of classical trajectory approach to study chemical reactions it is important to choose the initial
