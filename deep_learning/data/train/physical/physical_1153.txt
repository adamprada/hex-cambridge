bc molecules with a distribution of relative speeds that is within the sample of molecules which likely contains or more molecules some a bc pairs have low relative kinetic energies when they collide and others have higher relative kinetic energies there is a probability distribution for this relative kinetic energy that must be properly sampled in choosing the initial conditions the bc molecules may not all be in the same rotational or vibrational state there is a probability distribution function describing the fraction of bc molecules that are in a particular state and a particular state an ensemble of initial
