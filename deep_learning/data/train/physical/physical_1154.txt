larger values have more geometrical volume element than smaller values figure coordinates needed to characterize an atomdiatom collision showing the impact parameter b so to simulate the entire ensemble of collisions that occur between a atoms and bc molecules in various states and having various relative kinetic energies and impact parameters b one must run classical trajectories or quantum propagations for a large number of and values with each such trajectory assigned an overall weighting or importance factor of after such an ensemble of trajectories representative of an experimental condition has been carried out one has available a great deal
