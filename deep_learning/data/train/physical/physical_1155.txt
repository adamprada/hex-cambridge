kassel and marcus to use this theory one imagines an ensemble of molecules that have been activated to a state in which they possess a specified total amount of internal energy of which an amount exists as rotational energy and the remainder as internal vibrational energy the mechanism by which the molecules become activated could involve collisions or photochemistry it does not matter as long as enough time has passed to permit one to reasonably assume that these molecules have the energy distributed randomly among all their internal vibrational degrees of freedom when considering thermally activated unimolecular decomposition of a
