fragments collision energy to be randomly distributed among all vibrational modes of the collision complex for bimolecular reactions that proceed directly ie without forming a longlived intermediate one does not employ rrkmtype theories because their primary assumption of energy randomization almost certainly would not be valid in such cases the rrkm expression of the unimolecular rate constant for activated molecules a ie either a longlived complex formed in a bimolecular collision or a hot molecule dissociating to products through a transition state a rightarrow ts rightarrow p is krm rate dfracgee erm rotneerm roth here the total energy is related
