possesses having energies up to and including this energy is the total energy but with the activation energy removed and the overall rotational energy of the ts removed the quantity is the density of internal vibrational quantum states excluding the mode describing the reaction coordinate that the activated molecule possesses having an energy between and in this expression the energy is the total energy with the rotational energy of the activated species removed in the most commonly employed version of rrkm theory the rotational energies of the activated molecules and of the ts are assumed to be related by here
