energy required to access the ts and the amount of energy contained in the rotational degrees of freedom that is thus not available to the vibrations to implement a rrkm rate coefficient calculation one must know the total energy available the barrier energy the geometries and hence the moments of inertia and of the activated molecules and of the ts respectively the rotational energy of the activated molecules as well as all vibrational energies of the activated molecules and all vibrational energies of the ts ie excluding the reaction coordinate the rotational energy of the ts species can then be
