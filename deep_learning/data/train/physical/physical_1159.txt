energy the rrkm rate coefficient is computed for a range of values with each related to the collisional impact parameter that we discussed earlier in that case the collisional angular momentum is given as where is the relative collision speed related to the collision energy and m is the reduced mass of the two colliding fragments again using erm rot erm rot erm rot left fraciiright the ts rotational energy can be related to that of the activated species finally the rrkm rate coefficient is evaluated by averaging the result over a series of impact parameters each of which implies
