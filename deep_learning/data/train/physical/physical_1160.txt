by taking the difference it determines professor bill hase has been one of the early pioneers involved in applying rrkm theory to chemical processes correlation function expressions for rates recall from chapter that rates of photon absorption can in certain circumstances be expressed either in terms of squares of transition dipole matrix elements connecting each initial state to each final state textbfe cdot langle phif boldsymbolmu phii rangle or in terms of the equilibrium average of the product of a transition dipole vector at time dotted into this same vector at another time sumi rhoi langle phii textbfe cdot boldsymbolmu
