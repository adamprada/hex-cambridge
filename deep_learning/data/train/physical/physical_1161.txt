the statetostate and timecorrelation function expressions one can begin with a classical expression for the rate constant given below here is the partition function of the reactant species l is the number of coordinates and momenta upon which the hamiltonian depends and is the flux factor and the reaction probability are defined in terms of a dividing surface which could for example be a plane perpendicular to the reaction coordinate and located along the reaction path that was discussed earlier in this chapter in section points on such a surface can be defined by specifying one condition that the l
