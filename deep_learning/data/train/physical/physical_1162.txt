then by convention the origin of the reaction coordinate so now we see how the dividing surface can be defined but how are the flux and probability c constructed the flux factor is defined in terms of the dividing surface function as follows deltaftextbfq sumj dfracfqj dfracdqjdt here is the heaviside step function if if whose derivative is the dirac delta function and the other identities follow by using the chain rule when the dividing surface is defined in terms of the reaction path coordinate as introduced earlier ie the factor sumj dfracfqj dfracdqjdt contains only one term when the
