of the dividing surface such trajectories obey ctextbfptextbfq limt rightarrow infty hfqt this longtime limit can in turn be expressed in a form where the flux factor again occurs in this expression the flux pertains to coordinates and momenta at because of time reversibility the integral can be extended to range from until t infty using the expressions for c and for as developed above in the equation for the rate coefficient given at the beginning of this section allows the rate coefficient to be rewritten as follows in this form the rate constant appears as an equilibrium average represented
