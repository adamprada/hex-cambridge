when again obeys at which time the quantity can be evaluated as ftextbfptextbfq deltaftextbfq sumj dfracfqj dfracdqjdt using the coordinates and momenta at time to compute these quantities using a planar dividing surface attached to the reaction path at as noted earlier allows to be calculated in terms of the initial momentum lying along the reaction path direction as and permits to be computed when the trajectory again crosses this surface at at time as so all that is really needed if the dividing surface is defined in this manner is to start trajectories with to keep track of the
