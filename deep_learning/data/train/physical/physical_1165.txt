total correlation function which integrates over all times of course if this same trajectory later undergoes yet another crossing of the dividing surface at t with positive it will contribute a positive term to the correlation function via thus the correlation function approach to computing the rate coefficient can properly account for surface recrossings unlike the tst which requires one to account for such effects in the transmission coefficient k wave packet propagation the discussions in chapters and should have made it clear that it is very difficult to timepropagate wave functions rigorously using quantum mechanics on the other hand
