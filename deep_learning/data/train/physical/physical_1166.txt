which one assumes will evolve according to newtonian dynamics lets see how these steps are taken in more detail and try to understand when such an approach is expected to work or to fail first the form of the socalled wave packet quantum function is written as follows here we have a total of n coordinates that we denote it is these coordinates that the quantum wave function depends upon the total wave function is a product of terms one for each coordinate notice that this wave function has two distinct ways in which the coordinate appear first it has
