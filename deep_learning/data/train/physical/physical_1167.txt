according to the newton equations where is the potential energy surface bornoppenheimer or force field upon which we wish to propagate the wave packet and is the mass associated with coordinate for the form of the wave function given above the and parameters can be shown to be the expectation values of the coordinates and momenta pj int y i hbardfracqj y dq moreover the parameter appearing in the gaussian part of the function can be shown to equal the dispersion or spread of this wave function along the coordinate there is an important characteristic of the above gaussian wave
