packet function is the most classical function that one can have because its uncertainty product is as small as possible ie equals we say this is the most classical possible quantum function because in classical mechanics both the coordinate and the momentum can be known precisely so whatever quantum wave function allows these two variables to be least uncertain is the most classical to use wave packet propagation to simulate a chemical dynamics event one begins with a set of initial classical coordinates and momenta as well as a width or uncertainty for each coordinate each width must be chosen
