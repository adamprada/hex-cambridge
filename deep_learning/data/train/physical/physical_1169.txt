initial conditions classical newtonian dynamics would then be used to propagate the and in the hcl example introduced above this propagation would be performed using the excitedstate energy surface for since for the molecule is assumed to be on this surface the total energy at which the initial wave packet it delivered to the upper surface would be dictated by the energy of the photon used to perform the excitation in figure two such examples are shown once the packet is on the upper surface its position and momentum begin to change according to the newton equations this in turn
