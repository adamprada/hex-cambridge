clear classical behavior for example as time evolves it moves to large rvalues and its speed as evidenced by the spacings between neighboring packets for equal time steps is large when the potential is low and small when the potential is higher as we learned in chapter the time correlation function can be used to extract spectral information by fourier transformation for the hcl example considered here this correlation function will be large at but will decay in magnitude as the wave packet moves to the right at t t etc because its overlap with becomes smaller and smaller as
