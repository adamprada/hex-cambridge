the steepness of the excitedstate surface this steepness determines how fast grows which then determines how fast the hcl bond fragments in the lowerenergy photon case shown in figure a qualitatively different behavior occurs in and thus in the spectrum the packets movement to larger causes to initially undergo decay however as the packet moves to its larger turning point shortly after time it strikes the outer wall of the surface where it is reflected subsequently it undergoes motion to smaller r eventually returning to its initial value of r such recurrences which occur on time scales that we denote
