transform of ct will display a series of peaks spaced by with the envelope of such peaks having a width determined by in more complicated multimode cases eg in molecules containing several coordinates the periodic motion of the wave packet usually shows another feature that we have not yet discussed let us for simplicity consider a case in which only two coordinates are involved for the wave packet to return to or near its initial location enough time must pass for both coordinates to have undergone an excursion to their turning points and back for example consider the situation in
