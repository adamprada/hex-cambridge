ps the correlation function will not be large because one of the mode contribution to will be small however after ps both modes coordinates will be in positions to produce a large value of ct the highfrequency mode will have undergone oscillations and the lowerfrequency mode will have undergone oscillations my point in discussing this example is to illustrate that molecules having many coordinates can produce spectra that display rather complicated patterns but which in principle can be related to the time evolution of these coordinates using the correlation functions connection to the spectrum of course there are problems that
