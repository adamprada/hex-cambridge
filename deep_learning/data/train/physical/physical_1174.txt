of tunneling resonances given in chapter we also encountered reflected and transmitted waves furthermore when a wave strikes a barrier that has two or more holes or openings in it one observes wave fronts coming out of these openings the problem with the most elementary form of wave packets presented above is that each packet contains only one piece it therefore can not break into two or more pieces as it for example reflects from turning points or passes through barriers with holes because such wave packets can not fragment into two or more packets that subsequently undergo independent dynamical
