of the timedependent wave packet approach prof eric heller for more information on this subject surface hopping dynamics there are of course chemical reactions and energytransfer collisions in which two or more bornoppenheimer bo energy surfaces are involved under such circumstances it is essential to have available the tools needed to describe the coupled electronic and nuclearmotion dynamics appropriate to this situation the way this problem is addressed is by returning to the schr√∂dinger equation before the singlesurface bo approximation was made and expressing the electronic wave function which depends on the electronic coordinates and the nuclear coordinates as here
