as well as in the amplitudes we next substitute this expansion into the timedependent schr√∂dinger equation where is the electronic hamiltonian which depends on the nuclear coordinates and thus on the time variable we then multiply the resultant equation on the left by one of the wave functions and integrate over the electronic coordinates to obtain an equation for the amplitudes here is the electronic hamiltonian matrix element that couples to this set of coupled differential equations for the amplitudes can be solved numerically by for example starting at with and and propagating the amplitudes values forward in time the
