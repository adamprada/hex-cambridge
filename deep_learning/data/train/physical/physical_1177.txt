elements are becoming more commonly available in widely utilized quantum chemistry and dynamics computer packages although their efficient evaluation remains a challenge that is undergoing significant study qualitatively one can expect a coupling to be large if motion along a coordinate causes an orbital occupied in to be distorted in a manner that would produce significant overlap with an orbital in if the electronic functions appearing in the equations are bo eigenfunctions the offdiagonal elements vanish and the diagonal elements are the bo energy levels in this case only the terms involving generate transitions between surfaces on the other hand
