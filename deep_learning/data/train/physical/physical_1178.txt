equations for socalled density matrix elements the diagonal elements of the matrix are the state probabilities while the offdiagonal elements contain information about the phases of the complex quantities so in place of the equations for the one can use the following equations for the setting it is then possible to derive an equation for the time evolution of the diagonal elements of the density matrix where in addition to calculating amplitudes the probabilities then being computed as one often needs to identify using perhaps the kind of strategy discussed in chapter the seam at which the surfaces of interest
