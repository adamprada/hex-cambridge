one propagates a classical trajectory describing the time evolution of the ra and dradt on this initial surface as one is propagating the classical trajectory one also propagates the coupled differential equations for the density matrix elements with the nuclei moving on the energy surface after each timepropagation step of duration one evaluates the quantity shown above these elements give estimates for the rate of change of the population of the state due to transitions to other states from which one computes these quantities control the fractional change in the probability of being on the surface due to transitions from
