by a change in the kinetic energy of the nuclei so that total energy is conserved if this results in an increase in speed if it produces a decrease in speed in the latter case if lies considerably below it might turn out that there is just not enough total energy to access the surface in this case the hop is not allowed to occur following the above decision about allowing the hop and adjusting the speed along the direction of the vector the trajectory is then continued with the system now propagating on the or surface and the differential
