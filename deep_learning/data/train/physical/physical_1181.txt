whose averages can be used to estimate the overall probability of ending up in the electronic state the algorithm discussed above is the socalled fewestswitches method detailed in j c tully j chem phys pioneered by prof john tully this surfacehopping algorithm remains one of the most widely used approaches to treating such coupledstate dynamics landauzener surface jumps there is a simplified version of the surface hopping procedure just discussed that is often used when one has two electronic surfaces that intersect in a region of space that i is energetically accessible in the experiment being simulated and ii can
