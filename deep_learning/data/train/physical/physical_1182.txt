invoked it is the purpose of this section to derive and explain this landauzener equation in chapter we learned that the rates of transitions from one state labeled to another labeled can sometimes be expressed in terms of matrix elements of the perturbation connecting the two states as follows because the coupling matrix elements have units of energy and the function has units of inverse frequency the rate expression clearly has units of in the rate equation is the energy of the transition induced by light of energy and is the perturbation due to the electric dipole operator these photoninduced
