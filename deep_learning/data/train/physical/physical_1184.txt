i now want to pursue using this approximation in our expression for the rate of surface jumping transitions gives we now use to write the rate as where we define the electronic transition integrals in shorthand as because of the energyconserving dfunction we can actually simplify this expression even further by summing over the complete set of the finalstates vibrationrotation functions and making use of the completeness relation to obtain this expression can be seen to have units of s since the delta function has units of inverse energy and each electronic coupling integral has units of energy in the
