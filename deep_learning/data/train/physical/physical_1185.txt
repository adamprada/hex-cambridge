along the normal vector now using the function can be expressed as with the factor constraining the integral to lie within the seam this result can be interpreted as follows gives the probability density for being at a point on the seam this factor has units of lengthn gives the rate of transitions from one surface to the other at the point on the seam this factor has units of length times s the factor has units of length n so the entire expression has units of s as it should in this form the rate expression can be used
