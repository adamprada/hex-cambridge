a trajectory being at the point on the seam and lying within a distance along the direction normal to the seam the quantity is the component of the velocity along with which the system moves through the seam divided by the thickness this ratio gives the inverse of the time the system spends within the thin region or equivalently the frequency of passing through the thin strip of the seam at s the quantity is the volume element whose units cancel those of if we multiply this rate at which trajectories pass through by the probability that a surface jump
