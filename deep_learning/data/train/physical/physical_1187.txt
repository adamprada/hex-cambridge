coordinates and momenta selected to represent an experimental condition are run on the potential energy surface whenever any trajectory passes very close to an intersection seam between and another surface the seam geometry nearest to is determined and the gradient of the energy difference is evaluated at in addition the component of the velocity along the direction of this gradient is computed the electronic coupling matrix elements between the two states are evaluated at s and the above formula is used to estimate the probability of a surface jump in most applications of lz theory the electronic states in the
