b a molecule is prepared eg by photon absorption in an excited electronic state the upper blue curve that undergoes a crossing with a dissociative electronic state the green curve one may wish to estimate the rate of the process called predissociation in which the excited molecule jumps to the dissociative surface and falls apart this rate is often computed by multiplying the frequency at which the excited molecule passes through the curve crossing by the lz estimate of the surface jumping probability p with computed as discussed above and usually being equal to the vibrational frequency of the bond
