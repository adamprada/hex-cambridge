either of two ways a the system collides on the green curve and undergoes a surface jump at the crossing thus ending up on the blue surface from which it promptly fluoresces this process has a probability computed using the lz formula b the system collides on the green curve and does not jump to the blue curve at the crossing but remains on the green curve this has probability until it reaches the turning point after reflecting off the turning point the system still on the green curve jumps to the blue curve this has probability when it again
