believe it or not no one has ever solved exactly any such equation for of any atom they can be used as perturbation or variational startingpoint approximations when one may be satisfied with qualitatively accurate answers in particular the solutions of this oneelectron hydrogenic problem form the qualitative basis for much of atomic and molecular orbital theory as discussed in detail in part these orbitals are labeled by and quantum numbers for the bound states and by and quantum numbers and the energy for the continuum states much as the particleinabox orbitals are used to qualitatively describe electrons in conjugated
