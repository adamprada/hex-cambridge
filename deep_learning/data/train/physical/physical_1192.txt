the two electrons so for them within this approximation one then occupies two orbitals with two orbitals with and two orbitals with in forming the full sixelectron product wave function of the lowestenergy state of carbon however such approximate orbitals are not sufficiently accurate to be of use in quantitative simulations of atomic and molecular structure in particular their energies do not properly follow the trends in atomic orbital ao energies that are taught in introductory chemistry classes and that are shown pictorially in figure figure energies of atomic orbitals as functions of nuclear charge for neutral atoms for example
