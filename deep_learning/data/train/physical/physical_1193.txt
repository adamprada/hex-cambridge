are introduced to remove all of the h e and me factors from the schr√∂dinger equation to effect the unit transformation that results in the hamiltonian appearing as above one notes that the kinetic energy operator scales as whereas the coulomb potentials scale as and as so if each of the cartesian coordinates of the electrons and nuclei were expressed as a unit of length multiplied by a dimensionless length factor the kinetic energy operator would involve terms of the form and the coulomb potentials would appear as and with the and factors now referring to the dimensionless coordinates a
