described by their equations of motion if the initial state of the constituent particles can be specified the equations of motion can be either classical mechanical or quantum mechanical we consider the implications of the principle for molecular processes that constitute elementary reactions however the principle also applies to equilibria in other molecular processes notably the absorption and emission of radiation when we apply it to elementary reactions we see that the principle of microscopic reversibility provides a necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium from a reactionmechanism perspective the principle also imposes several significant conditions on the sequences of elementary
