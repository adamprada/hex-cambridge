following reactionrate equations at equilibrium each of these equations must equal zero since we have three equations in three unknowns it might at first appear that we can solve for the three unknowns and we can see however either from the equations themselves or by considering the physical situation that they represent that only two of these equations are independent that is we have while we cannot solve for and independently we can solve for their ratios which are since we deduce these equations from the condition that all the time derivatives are zero it might seem that they should
