must be sufficient to uniquely specify the position of equilibrium it is easy to show that a set of rate constants that satisfies the oneatatime set also satisfies the cyclic set therefore if microscopic reversibility is a sufficient condition for equilibrium the cyclic network rate equations are necessarily equal to zero at equilibrium in short if we assume that microscopic reversibility is a sufficient condition for equilibrium we encounter no inconsistencies because the cyclic set of equations is satisfied by the same equilibriumconcentration ratios on the other hand if we suppose that setting for all species is a sufficient condition
