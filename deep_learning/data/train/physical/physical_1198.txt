the principle of microscopic reversibility is true it is false that setting for all species is a sufficient condition for equilibrium figure potential energy versus reaction coordinate setting the derivatives for the reaction network equal to zero is not sufficient to assure that the system is at equilibrium it is merely necessary to assure that the network is at equilibrium we must apply the principle of microscopic reversibility and require that each elementary process in the network be at equilibrium the principle of microscopic reversibility requires that any elementary process occur via the same sequence of transitory molecular structures in
