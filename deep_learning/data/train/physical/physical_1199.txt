the course of the reaction we call this path the reaction coordinate we suppose that we can plot the energy of the system as a function of the systems position on the path or displacement along the reaction coordinate in the context of such a graph the principle of microscopic reversibility is essentially the observation that the path is the same irrespective of the direction in which it is traversed two such paths are sketched in figure in this sketch and are the activation energies for the two forward reactions and are the activation energies for the reverse reactions the
