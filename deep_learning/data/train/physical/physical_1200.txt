the molecule is traveling in the direction of the positive axis or the negative axis that is must be an even function the probability density function must be symmetric around hence we can express relative to its fixed value at we integrate from to as goes from zero to an arbitrary velocity to find or the value of must be such as to make the integral of over all possible values of equal to unity that is we must have where we use the definite integral see appendix d it follows that the onedimensional probabilitydensity function becomes note that this
