the relative velocity coordinates since the velocity of the center of mass and the relative velocity are independent we might expect that the jacobian of this transformation is just the product of the two individual jacobians this turns out to be the case the jacobian of the transformation is a sixbysix determinate it is messy but straightforward to show that it is equal to the product of two threebythree determinants and that the absolute value of this product is one therefore we have we transform the probability density by substituting into the onedimensional probability density functions that is where the
