is actually of interest it might seem that we should refer the spherical coordinates to the frame this is an unnecessary distinction because all three coordinate frames are parallel to one another and and are the same vectors in all three frames letting the cartesian velocity components are expressed in spherical coordinates by the angles and are defined in the usual manner relative to the axis system the jacobian of this transformation is a sixbysix determinate which can again be converted to the product of two threebythree determinates we find the probability that the components of the velocity of the
