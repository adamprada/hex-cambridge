probability increment for the scalar component of the relative velocity by integrating over all possible values of and we find in we find the most probable velocity the mean velocity and the rootmeansquare velocity for a gas whose particles have mass by identical arguments we obtain the most probable relative velocity the mean relative velocity and the rootmeansquare relative velocity to do so we can simply substitute for in the earlier results in particular the mean relative velocity is if particles and have the same mass the reduced mass becomes in this case we have we can arrive at this
