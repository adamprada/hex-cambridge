functions have the same values as those of a true equilibrium system from the first law applied to any spontaneous process in a closed system we have and since the temperature of the system and its surroundings are equal and constant for the reversible process we have so long as the temperature of the surroundings is constant we have for the spontaneous process it follows that so that constant a given isothermal process does the minimum possible amount of work on the system when it is carried out reversibly in section we find this result for the special case in
