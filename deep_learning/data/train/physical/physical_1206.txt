at equilibrium ultimately this statement defines what we mean by primitive equilibrium from our statement of the second law of thermodynamics we have criteria for spontaneous change and for equilibrium in any macroscopic system an isolated system can undergo any change that results in an increase in the entropy of the system the converse is also true an isolated system whose entropy can increase can undergo change any such change is said to be spontaneous if an isolated system cannot change in such a way that its entropy increases the system cannot change at all and is said to be
