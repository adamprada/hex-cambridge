criteria to make predictions about a particular system we need to find the entropy changes that occur when the system changes to use these ideas to understand chemistry we need to relate these statements about macroscopic systems to the properties of the molecules that comprise the system since an isolated system does not interact with its surroundings in any way no change in an isolated system can cause a change in its surroundings if an isolated system is at equilibrium no change is possible and hence there is no system change for which the entropy of the universe can increase
