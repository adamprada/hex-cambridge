ideal gas is zero is a straightforward conclusion this will be the criterion for an ideal mixture in general real mixtures will deviate from this limiting ideal behavior due to interactions between molecules and other concerns also many substances undergo chemical changes when they mix with other substances but for now we will limit ourselves to discussing mixtures in which no chemical reactions take place entropy of mixing the entropy change induced due to isothermal mixing assuming again no interactions between the molecules in the gas mixture is again going to be the sum of the contributions from isothermal expansions
