is always between and that as such the entropy change for a system undergoing isothermal mixing is always positive as one might expect since mixing will make the system less ordered the entropy change for a system undergoing isothermal mixing is always positive free energy of mixing calculating should be no more difficult than calculating for isothermal mixing and constant total pressure and so it follows from above that for the isothermal mixing of two gases at constant total pressure delta gmix ntot rt left chia ln chia chib ln chib right the relationships describing the isothermal mixing of two
