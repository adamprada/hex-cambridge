the variables that are associated with a chemical system include pressure volume temperature and the number of moles of each substance present all of these variables can be measured directly that is every equilibrium state of a system is associated with a specific value of each of these variables and this value can be determined without reference to any other state of the system energy and entropy are also variables that are associated with a thermodynamic system we can only measure changes in energy and entropy that is we can only measure energy and entropy for a process in which
