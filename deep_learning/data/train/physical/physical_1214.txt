which a chemical system can exchange work with its surroundings can affect its behavior workproducing forces can involve many phenomena including gravitational field electric field and magnetic fields surface properties and sound pressure waves in chapter we discuss the work done when an electric current passes through an electrochemical cell otherwise this book focuses on pressurevolume workpressurevolume work and gives only passing attention to the job of incorporating other forms of work into the general theory we include pressurevolume work because it occurs whenever the volume of a system changes a thermodynamic theory that did not include volume as a
