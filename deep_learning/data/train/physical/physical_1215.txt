of the system and the same at any location within the system intensive variables stand in contrast to extensive variables the magnitude of an extensive variable is directly proportional to the size of the system thus volume is an extensive variable energy is an extensive variable we shall see that entropy enthalpy the helmholtz free energy and the gibbs free energy are extensive variables also for any extensive variable we can create a companion intensive variable by dividing by the size of the system for example we can convert the mass of a homogeneous system into a companion variable the
