one another a system can be at equilibrium under a great many different circumstances we say that the system can have many equilibrium positions a complete description of all of these equilibrium positions requires models that can specify how much of each of the substances that make up the system is present in each phase however if a system is at equilibrium a halfsize copy of it is also at equilibrium whether a system is at equilibrium can be specified without specifying the sizes of the phases that make it up this means that we can characterize the equilibrium states
