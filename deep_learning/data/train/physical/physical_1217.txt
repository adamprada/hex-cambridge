variables can change while all of the intensive variables remain constant and the system remains at equilibrium in the next section we review the phase equilibria of water a system comprised of liquid and gaseous water in phase equilibrium illustrates these points specifying either the pressure or temperature specifies the equilibrium state to within the sizes of the two phases for a complete description we must specify the number of moles of water in each phase by adding or removing heat while maintaining the original pressure and temperature we can change the distribution of the water between the two phases
