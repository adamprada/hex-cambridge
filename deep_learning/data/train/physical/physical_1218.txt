it is not one of our goals is to relate thermodynamic functions to our experiencebased ideas about what equilibrium is and is not to do so we need to introduce the idea of a reversible process in which the system undergoes a reversible change we will see that the states that are accessible to a system that is at equilibrium in terms of gibbs phase rule are identically the states that the system can be in while undergoing a reversible change a principal goal of the remainder of this chapter is to clarify this equivalence between the range of states
