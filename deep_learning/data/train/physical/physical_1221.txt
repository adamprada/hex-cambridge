phenomena and the equations used to describe such behavior quantum mechanics is cast in a language that is not familiar to most students of chemistry who are examining the subject for the first time its mathematical content and how it relates to experimental measurements both require a great deal of effort to master with these thoughts in mind i have organized this material in a manner that first provides a brief introduction to the two primary constructs of quantum mechanics operators and wave functions that obey a schr√∂dinger equation next i demonstrate the application of these constructs to several chemically
