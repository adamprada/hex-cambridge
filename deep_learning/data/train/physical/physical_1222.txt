experimentally measurable physical quantity eg energy dipole moment orbital angular momentum spin angular momentum linear momentum kinetic energy has a classical mechanical expression in terms of the cartesian positions and momenta of the particles that comprise the system of interest each such classical expression is assigned a corresponding quantum mechanical operator formed by replacing the in the classical form by the differential operator and leaving the coordinates that appear in untouched if one is working with a classical quantity expressed in terms of curvilinear coordinates it is important that this quantity first be rewritten in cartesian coordinates the replacement of
