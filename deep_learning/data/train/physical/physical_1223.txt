particles with an externally applied field the last term eq whose potential energy varies linearly as the particles move away from their equilibrium positions let us try more examples the sum of the components of angular momenta recall that vector angular momentum is defined as of a collection of particles has the following classical expression fsumjn xjpyj yjpxjtag and the corresponding operator is if one transforms these cartesian coordinates and derivatives into polar coordinates the above expression reduces to where is the azimuthal angle of the particle the component of the dipole moment for a collection of particles has a
