relationship of these quantum mechanical operators to experimental measurement lies in the eigenvalues of the quantum operators each such operator has a corresponding eigenvalue equation in which the are called eigenfunctions and the scalar numbers are called eigenvalues all such eigenvalue equations are posed in terms of a given operator in this case and those functions that acts on to produce the function back again but multiplied by a constant the eigenvalue because the operator usually contains differential operators coming from the momentum these equations are differential equations their solutions depend on the coordinates that contains as differential operators an
