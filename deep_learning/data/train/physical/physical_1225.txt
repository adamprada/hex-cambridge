in only those discrete values other operators have eigenvalues that can take on a continuous range of values for these properties laboratory measurement can give any value in this continuous range an important characteristic of the quantum mechanical operators formed as discussed above for any measurable property is the fact that they are hermitian an operator that acts on coordinates denoted is hermitian if int phii textbff phij dq int textbff phii phij dq tag or equivalently for any functions and the operator corresponding to any power of the coordinate itself is easy to show obeys this identity but what
