eigenvalues display a property termed orthonormality this property means that not only may and each normalized so their probability densities integrate to unity int psin dx int psin dxtag but they are also orthogonal to each other where the complex conjugate of the first function appears only when the solutions contain imaginary components eg the functions which eigenfunctions of the component of angular momentum the orthogonality condition can be viewed as similar to the condition of two vectors and being perpendicular in which case their scalar sometimes called dot product vanishes textbfv cdot textbfv i want you to keep this
