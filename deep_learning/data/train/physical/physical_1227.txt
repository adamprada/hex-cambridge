acting on a set of functions denoted is for all of the operators formed following the rules stated earlier one finds that these matrices have the following property which makes the matrices what we call hermitian if the functions upon which f acts and f itself have no imaginary parts ie are real then the matrices turn out to be symmetric fij fji tag the importance of the hermiticity or symmetry of these matrices lies in the fact that it can be shown that such matrices have all real ie not complex eigenvalues and have eigenvectors that are orthogonal or
