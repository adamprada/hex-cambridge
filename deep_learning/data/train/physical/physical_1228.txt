above derivation can still be used to show that and are orthogonal to the other eigenfunctions etc of that have different eigenvalues for the eigenfunctions and that are degenerate ie have equal eigenvalues we cannot show that they are orthogonal because they need not be so however because any linear combination of these two functions is also an eigenfunction of having the same eigenvalue we can always choose a combination that makes and orthogonal to one another finally for any given eigenfunction we have however the hermitian character of f allows us to rewrite the left hand side of this
