coordinates upon which the operator acts the particular operator that corresponds to the total energy of the system is called the hamiltonian operator the eigenfunctions of this particular operator are called wave functions a special case of an operator corresponding to a physically measurable quantity is the hamiltonian operator that relates to the total energy of the system the energy eigenstates of the system are functions of the coordinates that depends on and of time t the function gives the probability density for observing the coordinates at the values at time for a manyparticle system such as the molecule the
