form a complete set of functions the momentum operators eigenfunctions are and they obey these eigenfunctions can also be shown to be orthonormal expanding in terms of these normalized momentum eigenfunctions gives we can find the expansion coefficients by multiplying the above equation by the complex conjugate of another labeled momentum eigenfunction and integrating over the quantities then give the probability of finding momentum at time in classical mechanics the coordinates and their corresponding momenta are functions of time the state of the system is then described by specifying and in quantum mechanics the concept that qj is known as
