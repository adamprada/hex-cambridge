total angular momentum as stated earlier if the state of some molecular system is characterized by a wave function y that happens to be an eigenfunction of a quantum mechanical operator f one can immediately say something about what the outcome will be if the physical property f corresponding to the operator f is measured in particular since where is one of the eigenvalues of we know that the value will be observed if the property is measured while the molecule is described by the wave function in fact once a measurement of a physical quantity has been carried out
