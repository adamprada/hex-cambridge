of the operator g will be observed in the measurement but will the molecules wave function remain after g is measured the eigenfunction of or will the measurement of g cause y to be altered in a way that makes the molecules state no longer an eigenfunction of it turns out that if the two operators f and g obey the condition then when the property g is measured the wave function will remain unchanged this property that the order of application of the two operators does not matter is called commutation that is we say the two operators commute
