itself be proportional to we write this proportionality conclusion as g chij muj chij tag which means that is also an eigenfunction of g this in turn means that measuring the property g while the system is described by the wave function does not change the wave function it remains if there are more than one function that are eigenfunctions of f having the same eigenvalue then the relation only allows us to conclude that is some combination of these degenerate functions below i offer some examples that i hope will clarify what these rules mean and how the relate
