the original eigenvalue observed however if the two operators do not commute one simply cannot reach the above conclusions in such cases measurement of the property corresponding to the first operator will lead to one of the eigenvalues of that operator and cause the system wave function to become the corresponding eigenfunction however subsequent measurement of the second operator will produce an eigenvalue of that operator but the system wave function will be changed to become an eigenfunction of the second operator and thus no longer the eigenfunction of the first i think an example will help clarify this discussion
