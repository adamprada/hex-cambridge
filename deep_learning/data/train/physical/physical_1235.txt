but one does not know the amplitudes telling how much a given value contributes to one can express as such a linear combination because the hermitian quantum mechanical operators formed as described above can be shown to possess complete sets of eigenfunctions this means that any function of the appropriate variables can be written as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions as done above if one subsequently carries out a measurement of the fact that and commute means that this second measurement will not alter the fact that contains only contributions with but it will result in observing only one
