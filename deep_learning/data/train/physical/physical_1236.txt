of will not alter the fact that contains only components however because and do not commute we can not assume that is still an eigenfunction of it will be a combination of eigenfunctions of having but having values between and with m now referring to the eigenvalue of no longer to when is measured the value will be found with probability after which the wave function will be the eigenfunction of and and no longer an eigenfunction of i understand that these rules of quantum mechanics can be confusing but i assure you they are based on laboratory observations about
