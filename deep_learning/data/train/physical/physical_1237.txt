how the wave functions are found by applying the basic equation of quantum mechanics the schrödinger equation to a few exactly soluble model problems knowing the solutions to these easy yet chemically very relevant models will then facilitate learning more of the details about the structure of quantum mechanics the schrödinger equation is a differential equation depending on time and on all of the spatial coordinates necessary to describe the system at hand thirtynine for the example cited above it is usually written where is the unknown wavefunction and is the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system
