the electron respectively the timeindependent equation if the hamiltonian operator does not contain the time variable explicitly one can solve the timeindependent schrödinger equation in cases where the classical energy and hence the quantum hamiltonian do not contain terms that are explicitly time dependent eg interactions with time varying external electric or magnetic fields would add to the above classical energy expression time dependent terms the separations of variables techniques can be used to reduce the schrödinger equation to a timeindependent equation in such cases is not explicitly time dependent so one can assume that is of the form nb
