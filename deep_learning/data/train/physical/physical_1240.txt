separated schrödinger equation read as follows the first of these equations is called the timeindependent schrödinger equation it is an eigenvalue equation in which one is asked to find functions that yield a constant multiple of themselves when acted on by the hamiltonian operator such functions are called eigenfunctions of and the corresponding constants are called eigenvalues of for example if were of the form then functions of the form would be eigenfunctions because frachbari fracpartialpartial phi expi mphi fracmhbari expi mphitag in this case is the eigenvalue in this example the hamiltonian contains the square of an angular momentum
