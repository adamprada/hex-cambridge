to unity in summary whenever the hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly one can solve the timeindependent schrödinger equation first and then obtain the time dependence as once the energy is known in the case of molecular structure theory it is a quite daunting task even to approximately solve the full schrödinger equation because it is a partial differential equation depending on all of the coordinates of the electrons and nuclei in the molecule for this reason there are various approximations that one usually implements when attempting to study molecular structure using quantum mechanics it should be noted that
