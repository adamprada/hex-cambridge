measurement capable of making this determination were carried out is and the probability of finding it in the state is both of which are independent of time this does not mean that or the spatial probability density describes is timeindependent because the product contains cross terms that depend on time it is important to note that applying to such a superposition state in the manner shown above which then produces a superposition of states each of whose amplitudes carries its own time dependence only works when has no time dependence if were timedependent acting on would contain an additional factor
