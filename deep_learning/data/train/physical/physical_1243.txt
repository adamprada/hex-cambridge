partly definition and partly a generalization from experience it was proposed that mechanical energy and heat are manifestations of a common quantity energy later by further definition and generalization the concept was expanded to include other forms of energy the energy concept evolved into the prescript that there exists a quantity state function that is conserved through any manner of change whatsoever the element of definition arises from the fact that we recognize new forms of energy whenever necessary in order to ensure that the conservation condition is satisfied the element of experience arises from the fact that this prescript
