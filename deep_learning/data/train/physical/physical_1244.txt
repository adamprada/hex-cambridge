is the particle energy is its momentum is its rest mass and is the speed of light in transformations of fundamental particles in which the sum of the rest masses of the product particles is less than that of the reactant particles conservation of energy requires that the sum of the momenta of the product particles exceed that of the reactant particles the momentum increase means that the product particles have high velocities corresponding to a high temperature for the product system the most famous expression of this result is that meaning that we can associate this quantity of energy
