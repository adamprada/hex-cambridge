surroundings the change in the entropy of the system is entropy is a state function for any reversible process and conversely for any spontaneous process and conversely if a spontaneous process takes a system from state a to state b state b may or may not be an equilibrium state state a cannot be an equilibrium state since we cannot use the defining equation to find the entropy change for a spontaneous process we must use some other method if we are to estimate the value of the entropy change this means that we must have either an empirical mathematical
