reaction that occurs only in the presence of a catalyst in this case the solution can be effectively at equilibrium even when the composition does not correspond to an equilibrium position of the reaction in an effort to be more precise we can term this a quasiequilibrium state by which we mean that the system is unchanging even though a spontaneous change is possible if we introduce a very small quantity of catalyst and consider the state of the system before any reaction occurs all of the state functions that characterize the system must be essentially unchanged nevertheless as soon
