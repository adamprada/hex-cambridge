supplement the machinebased statement of the second law with additional assumptions in order to arrive at all of the properties of the entropy function that are asserted in the entropybased statement however before we undertake to develop the entropybased statement of the second law from the machinebased statement let us develop the converse that is let us show that the machinebased statement is a logical consequence of the entropybased statement to do so we assume that a perpetual motion machine of the second kind is possible to help keep our argument clear let proposition be the machinebased statement we are
