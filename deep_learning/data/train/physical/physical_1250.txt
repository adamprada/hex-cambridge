of the second law also enables us to determine the entropy change in the surroundings from our secondlaw definition of entropy in one cycle this machine system delivers net work to the surroundings it accepts a net quantity of heat from the surroundings which are at temperature simultaneously the surroundings surrender a quantity of heat where and the change that occurs in one cycle of the machine need not be reversible however whether the change is reversible or not the entire thermal change in the surroundings consists in the exchange of an amount of heat by a constant temperature reservoir
