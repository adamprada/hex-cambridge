arguments demonstrate that our machinebased statement implies the entropybased statement we introduce additional postulates in order to make them these include the premise that the pressure temperature volume and energy of a reversible system are continuous functions of one another duhems theorem the tiling theorem and the presumption that the conclusions we develop for pressurevolume work are valid for any form of work we can sum up this situation by saying that our machinebased statement serves a valuable heuristic purpose the entropybased statement of the second law is a postulate that we infer by reasoning about the consequences of the
