elements between any pair of slater determinants constructed from spinorbitals that are orthonormal one uses the socalled slatercondon rules these rules express all nonvanishing matrix elements involving either one or two electron operators oneelectron operators are additive and appear as twoelectron operators are pairwise additive and appear as the slatercondon rules give the matrix elements between two determinants and for any quantum mechanical operator that is a sum of one and two electron operators it expresses these matrix elements in terms of oneand twoelectron integrals involving the spinorbitals that appear in and and the operators and as a first step
