of course a specific example of such an operator that contains both one and twoelectron components the electric dipole operator and the electronic kinetic energy are examples of oneelectron operators for which one takes the electronelectron coulomb interaction is a twoelectron operator for which one takes the two slater determinants whose matrix elements are to be determined can be written as where the spinorbitals and appear in the first and second determinants respectively and the operators and describe the permutations of the spinorbitals appearing in these two determinants the factors and are the signs associated with these permutations as discussed
