and with this allows the above quantity to be rewritten as c for any permutation operator the operator is just another permutation operator moreover for any the set of all operators runs over all permutations and the sign associated with the operator is the sign belonging to times the sign associated with so the double sum ie over and over appearing in the above expression for the general matrix element of contains identical sums over the single operator of the sign of this operator multiplied by the effect of this operator on the spinorbital product on the righthand side langle
