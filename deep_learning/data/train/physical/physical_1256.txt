and in these dimensional spatial and spin coordinate for each of electrons integrals a integrals of the form for all or and for all i and or vanish because the spinorbitals appearing in positions and in the two determinants are orthogonal to one another for the operator even integrals with or vanish because there are still two spinorbital mismatches at the other two locations among and for the operator even integrals with or or vanish because two mismatches remain and even with both and or the integrals vanish because one spinorbital mismatch remains the main observation to make is that
