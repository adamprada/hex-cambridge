overcome at least one spinorbital orthogonality integral remains for the operator the only nonvanishing result arises from the and term d the only other permutation that generates another nonvanishing result is the permutation that interchanges and and it produces where the negative sign arises from the factor all other permutations would interchange other spinorbitals and thus generate orthogonality integrals involving other electrons coordinates if there is only one spinorbital mismatch say in location the integrals we need to evaluate are of the form and e again beginning with the only nonvanishing contribution from the operator is for all other permutations
