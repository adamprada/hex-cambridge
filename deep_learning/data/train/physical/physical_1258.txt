generates from the operator and from the operator h the permutation that interchanges spinorbitals in the kth and jth location produces the summations over and appearing above can alternatively be written as and so in summary once maximal coincidence has been achieved the slatercondon sc rules provide the following prescriptions for evaluating the matrix elements of any operator containing a oneelectron part and a twoelectron part if and are identical then where the sums over and run over all spinorbitals in if and differ by a single spinorbital mismatch where the sum over runs over all spinorbitals in except if
