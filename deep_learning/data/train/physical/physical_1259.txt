and l indices label the spinorbitals referring to coordinates the and denote and with and being the or spin functions if the operators and do not contain any electron spin operators then the spin integrations implicit in these integrals all of the are spinorbitals so each is accompanied by an or spin function and each involves the adjoint of one of the or spin functions can be carried out using thereby yielding integrals over spatial orbitals the system and the surroundings last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry at california state university
