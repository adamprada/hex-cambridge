systems depending on the nature of the boundary that separates the system from the surroundings and specifically whether or not it allows to the transmittance of matter or energy across it open system allows for both mass and energy transfer across its boundary closed system allows for energy transfer across its boundary but not mass transfer isolated system allows neither mass nor energy transfer across its boundary further systems can be homogeneous consisting of only a single phase of matter and with uniform concentration of all substances present throughout or heterogeneous containing multiple phases andor varying concentrations of the constituents
