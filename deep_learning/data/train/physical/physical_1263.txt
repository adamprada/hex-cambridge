the thermodynamic universe we imagine the system to be enclosed by a boundary which may or may not correspond to a material barrier surrounding the collection of matter that we designate as the system for our purposes a system will always contain a macroscopic quantity of matter however this is not necessary thermodynamic principles can be applied to a volume that is occupied only by radiant energy everything inside the boundary is part of the system everything outside the boundary is part of the surroundingssurroundings every increment of energy that the system receives as either heat or work is passed
