a phase can consist of a single chemical substance or it can be a homogeneous solution containing two or more chemical substances when we say that a phase is homogeneous we mean that the pressure temperature and composition of the phase are the same in every part of the phase since gases are always miscible a system cannot contain two gas phases that are in contact with one another however multiple solid and immiscibleliquid phases can coexist the third law of thermodynamics last updated save as pdf page id contributed by patrick flemingassistant professor chemistry and biochemistry at california state
