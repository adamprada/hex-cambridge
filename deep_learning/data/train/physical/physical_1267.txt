perfect order this also has another important consequence in that it suggests that there must also be a zero to the temperature scale these consequences are summed up in the third law of thermodynamics the entropy of a perfectly ordered crystal at k is zero this also suggests that absolute molar entropies can be calculated by where is the heat capacity an entropy value determined in this manner is called a third law entropy naturally the heat capacity will have some temperature dependence it will also change abruptly if the substance undergoes a phase change unfortunately it is exceedingly difficult
