at the same temperature by exchanging heat and work with it in a concerted fashion we can make this change of state arbitrarily small so that successive equilibrium states with the same temperature are arbitrarily close to one another this succession of arbitrarily close equilibrium states is an isotherm therefore at least one isotherm intersects any equilibrium state there cannot be two such isotherms if there were two isotherms the system would have two temperatures violating the principle that temperature is a state function in an adiabatic process the system exchanges energy as work but not as heat from experience
