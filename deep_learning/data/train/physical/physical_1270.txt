equilibrium system would not be unique from the same initial state two reversible adiabatic experiments could do the same amount of the same kind of work and reach different final states of the system for example in two different experiments we could raise a weight reversibly from the same initial elevation do the same amount of work in each experiment and find that the final elevation of the weight is different any such outcome conflicts with the observations that underlie our ideas about reversible processes more specifically the existence of two adiabats through a given point in any space violates
