process that connects two states a and b is reversible we see that the system follows the same path in opposite directions when it does work going from a to b as it does when work is done on it as it goes from b to a from another perspective we can say that the tiling theorem is a consequence of our assumptions about reversible processes our conception of a reversible process is that the energy pressure temperature and volume are continuous functions of state with continuous derivatives that there is one and only one isotherm for every state is
