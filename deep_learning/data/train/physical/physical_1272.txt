vertical a reversible carnot cycle is a closed rectangle and the area of this rectangle corresponds to the reversible work done by the system on its surroundings in one cycle any equilibrium state of the system corresponds to a particular point in this space any closed path can be tiled arbitrarily densely by isotherms and isentropes any reversible cycle involving any form of work is represented by a closed path in this space figure is an alternative illustration of the argument that we make in section the path in this space is independent of the kind of work done reinforcing
