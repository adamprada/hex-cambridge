derivatives more compactly in this notation we indicate the partial derivative with respect to with held constant at the particular value by writing we can also write the total differential of as in which case and are merely new names for and respectively to express the fact that there exists a function such that and we say that is an exact differential inexact differentials it is important to recognize that a differential expression in equation reftotal may not be exact in our efforts to model physical systems we encounter differential expressions that have this form but for which there is
