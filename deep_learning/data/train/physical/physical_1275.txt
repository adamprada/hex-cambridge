science mathematics no headers the central limit theorem establishes very important relationships between the statistics for two distributions that are related in a particular way it enables us to understand some important features of physical systems the central limit theorem concerns the distribution of averages if we have some original distribution and sample it three times we can calculate the average of these three data points call this average we could repeat this activity and obtain a second average of three values we can do this repeatedly generating averages several things will be true about these averages the set of
