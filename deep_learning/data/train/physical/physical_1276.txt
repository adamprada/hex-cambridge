also true of these averagesofseven however we can now say something more the distribution of the will be less spread out than the distribution of the the corresponding probability density functions are sketched in figure figure the variance of an average of is proportional to the central limit theorem relates the mean and variance of the distribution of averages to the mean and variance of the original distribution if random samples of values are taken from a distribution whose mean is µ and whose variance is averages of these values are approximately normally distributed with a mean of µ and
