have some reasonable wavefunction that is used to approximate the true wavefunction within this approximate wavefunction one embeds one or more variables that one subsequently varies to achieve a minimum in the energy of computed as an expectation value of the true hamiltonian the optimal values of the parameters are determined by making to achieve the desired energy minimum we also should verify that the second derivative matrix has all positive eigenvalues otherwise one may not have found the minimum the theoretical basis underlying the variational method can be understood through the following derivation suppose that someone knew the exact
