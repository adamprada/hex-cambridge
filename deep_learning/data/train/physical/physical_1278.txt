them as tools in our derivation because we know they exist even if we never know them with the above expansion of our trial function in terms of the exact eigenfunctions let us now substitute this into the quantity that the variational method instructs us to compute using the fact that the obey and that the are orthonormal the above expression reduces to one of the basic properties of the kind of hamiltonian we encounter is that they have a lowestenergy state sometimes we say they are bounded from below which means their energy states do not continue all the
