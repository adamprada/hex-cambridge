result that is as follows we are allowed to imbed into our trial wavefunction parameters that we can vary to make computed as equation as low as possible because we know that we can never it lower than the true groundstate energy the philosophy then is to vary the parameters in to render as low as possible because the closer is to the better is our variational wavefunction let me now demonstrate how the variational method is used in such a manner by solving an example problem example two electron atoms suppose you are given a trial wavefunction of the
