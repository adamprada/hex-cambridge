surprised by this number now using this optimal in our energy expression gives since is the bohr radius Ã¥ ev or one atomic unit of energy is this energy any good the total energies of some twoelectron atoms and ions have been experimentally determined to be as shown in table below using our optimized expression for lets now calculate the estimated total energies of each of these atoms and ions as well as the percent error in our estimate for each ion table comparison of experimental true total energies with predicted for select twoelectron species z atom experimental calculated error
