the coordinates and momenta of the system at and and are their values according to newtonian mechanics at time as shown above an example of a time correlation function that relates to molecular spectroscopy is the dipoledipole correlation function that we discussed in chapter for which and are both the electric dipole interaction between the photons electric field whose direction is characterized by the vector and the molecules dipole operator the fourier transform of this particular relates to the absorption intensity for light of frequency it turns out that many physical properties eg absorption line shapes raman scattering intensities and
