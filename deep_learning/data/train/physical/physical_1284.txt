or classical trajectories which produce the qt values entering into the expression for in the classical case one carries out a large number of newtonian trajectories with initial coordinates and momenta chosen to represent the equilibrium condition of the molecule system for example one could use the mc method to select these variables employing as the probability function for accepting or rejecting initial and values in this case the weighting function contains not just the potential energy but also the kinetic energy and thus the total hamiltonian because now we need to also select proper initial values for the momenta
