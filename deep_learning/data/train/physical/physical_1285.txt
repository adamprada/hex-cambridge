some idea of the steps that are involved realizing that this remains an area of very active research development as noted in section it is possible to timepropagate a wave function that is known at if one is able to expand in terms of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian however for systems comprised of many molecules which are most common in statistical mechanics studies it is impossible to compute or realistically approximate these eigenfunctions thus it is not productive to try to express in terms of these eigenfunctions therefore an entirely new set of tools has been introduced to handle
