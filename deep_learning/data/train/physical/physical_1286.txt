appears in the definition of can be combined for example with the first time propagation step and actually handled as part of the time propagation as follows the latter expression can be viewed as involving a propagation in complex time from to although having a complex time may seem unusual as i will soon point out it turns out that it can have a stabilizing influence on the success of these tools for computing quantum correlation functions much like we saw earlier in section socalled feynman path integral techniques can be used to carry out the above time propagations one
