above approximation is valid up to terms of order so for short times ie small these symmetric split operator approximation to the propagator should be accurate the time evolved wave function can then be expressed as the potential is except when external magnetic fields are present a function only of the coordinates of the system while the kinetic term is a function of the momenta assuming cartesian coordinates are used by making use of the completeness relations for eigenstates of the coordinate operator int dq qjrangle langle qjlabel and inserting this identity times once between each combination of factors the
