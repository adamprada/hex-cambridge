connect to further insight into the meaning of the above is gained by first realizing that fracmdelta t qj qj fracmdelta t qj qj delta t int t dt is the finitedifference representation within the discrete time steps of length dt of the integral of tdt over the jth time step and that is the representation of the integral of over the jth time step so for any particular path ie any specific set of values the sum over all such terms represents the integral over all time from until of the socalled lagrangian this time integral of the lagrangian
