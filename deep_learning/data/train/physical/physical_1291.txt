for which the action is smallest because such paths produce the lowestfrequency oscillations in and thus may be less subject to cancelation by contributions from other paths the paths that minimize the action are in fact the classical paths that is they are the paths that the system whose quantum wave function is being propagated would follow if the system were undergoing classical newtonian mechanics subject to the conditions that the system be at at and at at in this socalled semiclassical approximation to the propagation of the initial wave function using feynman path integrals one finds all classical paths
