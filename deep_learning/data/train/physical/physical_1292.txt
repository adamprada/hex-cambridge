evaluating for example spectroscopic line shapes if one adopted a timeindependent approach one would have to know the energies and wave functions of a system comprised of many interacting molecules this knowledge is simply not accessible for any but the simplest molecules for this reason the timedependent framework in which one propagates classical trajectories or uses pathintegral techniques to propagate initial wave functions offers the most feasible way to evaluate the correlation functions that ultimately produce spectral line shapes and other time correlation functions for complex molecules in condensed media before finishing this section it might help if i showed
