a value in more general functionals might depend not only of f but on various derivatives of lets consider an example suppose one has a functional of the form meaning that the functional involves an integral from through of an integrand that may contain i the variable explicitly ii the function and iii the derivative of this function with respect to the variable this is the kind of integral one encounters when evaluating the action integral where the function is the coordinate that evolves from to the task at hand is to determine that function for which this integral is
