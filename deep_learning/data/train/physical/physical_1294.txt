is a function that obeys this is how we guarantee that we are only considering paths that connect to the proper at and at by considering all possible functions that obey these conditions we have in a parameterization of all paths that begin at and end at tf where the exact path does but differ by a small amount from substituting into gives the terms in the integrand are then expanded in powers of the parameter and substituted into the integral for collecting terms of each power of allows this integral to be written as the condition that se be
