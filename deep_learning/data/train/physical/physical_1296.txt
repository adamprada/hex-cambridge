wave function that solves this equation is expanded in an orderbyorder manner as in conventional perturbation theory here is the eigenfunction of from which transitions to other eigenstates denoted of are being considered because in the absence of the external perturbation the states of are known to vary with time as this component of the time dependence of the total wave function is included in the above expansion then the firstorder correction is expanded in terms of the complete set of states after which the expansion coefficients become the unknowns to be solved for it should be noted that this
