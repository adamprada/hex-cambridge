spatial part and is the timedependence to allow for the possibility that photons over a range of frequencies may impinge on the molecules we can proceed with the derivation for photons of a given frequency and after obtaining our final result average over a distribution of frequencies characterized by a function giving the number of photons with frequencies between and for perturbations that do not vary in a sinusoidal manner eg a perturbation arising from a collision with another molecule the derivation follows a different path at this point application below because spectroscopic timedependent perturbations are extremely common in chemistry
