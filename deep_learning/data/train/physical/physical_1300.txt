label the function is plotted in figure for a given value of as a function of it is sharply peaked around decays rapidly as increases and displays recurrences of smaller and smaller intensity when passes through multiples of figure plot of vs for a given value of at larger values of the main peak in the plot of this function becomes narrower and higher such that in the limit the area under this plot approaches the importance of this observation about the area under the plot shown in figure can be appreciated by returning to our result and introducing the
