shown in figure is so sharply peaked around that extending the range of integration makes no difference we are allowed to factor the out of the integral as f by assuming the light sources distribution function is very smoothly varying ie not changing much in the narrow range of frequencies around where the function in figure is sharply peaked the result of this derivation of tdpt is the above expression for the average probability of observing a transition from state to state this probability is seen to grow linearly with the time duration over which the system is exposed to
