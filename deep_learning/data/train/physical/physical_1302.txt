not obey only when this condition is met an the function shown in figure be integrated to generate a probability prediction that grows linearly with time so one has to be careful when using pulsed lasers of very short duration to not employ the simplified rate expression given above eg ev corresponds to a frequency of ca x s so to study an electronic transition of this energy one needs to use a light source of duration significantly longer than s to make use of the simplified result the working equations of tdpt given above allow one to estimate because
