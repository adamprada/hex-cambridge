is interested in transitions from a particular initial state into a manifold of states that exist in a continuum having energies between and this occurs for example when treating photoionization of a neutral or photodetachment of an anion here the ejected electron exists in a continuum wave function whose density of states is given by the formulas discussed in chapter in such cases the expression given above for the rate is modified by summing over all final states having energies within and returning to the earlier expression intrhoeffracpilangle psifvrpsifrranglehbar intinftyinfty fomegafracsinomegaomegaftomegaomegafdomega def label using and assuming the matrix elements do
