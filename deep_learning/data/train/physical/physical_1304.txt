energy is obtained by averaging the above result over the probabilities of the system being in various initial states which we label here the function guarantees that only states and whose energies differ by are permitted to enter the sum the nature of the initialstate probability depends on what kind of experiment is being carried out might be a boltzmann distribution if the initial states are in thermal equilibrium for example application experimental oscillations in figure the function is plotted for one value of as a function of there also appear in this figure dots that represent experimental data these
