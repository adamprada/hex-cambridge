arises from the motion of the ion along the axis writing the distance as and expanding in inverse powers of we can express the ionatom interaction potential as the first term contains no factors dependent on the atoms electronic coordinates so it plays no role in causing electronic transitions in the second term the factor can be neglected compared to the terms because the ion is assumed to be somewhat distant from the atoms valence electrons to derive an equation for the probability of the atom undergoing a transition from to one returns to the tdpt expression and substitutes the
