this socalled adiabatic case ie with the ion moving slowly relative to the oscillation frequency electronic transitions should not be expected in the other limit the factor will remain approximately equal to unity so the integration needed reduces to the integral involving vanishes because is odd and the remainder of the integrand is an even function of the integral involving can be performed by trigonometric substitution so the denominator reduces to and gives this result suggests that the probability of a transition should vary as the square of the ions charge and inversely with the speed of the collision of
