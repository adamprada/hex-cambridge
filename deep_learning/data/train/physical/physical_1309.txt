is the slope of the surface in each pathway direction there are a couple of very important experiments people have done to explore the measurement of those kinds of slopes understanding them it turns out depends on two very important physical properties of substances exact differentials we have seen that the total differential of can be expressed as equation reftotal in general if a differential can be expressed as the differential will be an exact differential if it follows the euler relation in order to illustrate this concept consider using the ideal gas law the total differential of can be
