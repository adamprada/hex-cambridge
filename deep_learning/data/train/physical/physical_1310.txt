previous chapter several useful definitions have been stated toolbox of useful relationships the following measurable quantities have been defined heat capacities cv equiv left dfracpartial upartial t rightv and cp equiv left dfracpartial hpartial t rightp coefficient of thermal expansion alpha equiv left dfracpartial vpartial t rightp or left dfracpartial vpartial t rightp v alpha isothermal compressibility kappat equiv dfracv left dfracpartial vpartial p rightt or left dfracpartial vpartial p rightt v kappa t the following relation has been derived and the following relationships were given without proof yet and together these relationships and definitions make a powerful set of
