chain rule on partial derivatives but now we are getting somewhere we can now substitute for using our toolbox of useful relationships leftdfracpartial hpartial v rightt left t leftdfracpartial vpartial t rightp v right leftdfracpartial ppartial v rightt using the distributive property of multiplication this expression becomes leftdfracpartial hpartial v rightt t leftdfracpartial vpartial t rightpleftdfracpartial ppartial v rightt v leftdfracpartial ppartial v rightt labeleq using the cyclic permutation rule transformation type ii the middle term of equation refeq can be simplified leftdfracpartial hpartial v rightt t leftdfracpartial ppartial t rightv v leftdfracpartial ppartial v rightt and now all of
