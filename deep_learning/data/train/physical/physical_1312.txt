find enthalpy changes last updated save as pdf page id contributed by paul ellgenretired teach chemistry at oklahoma school of science mathematics no headers figure a cyclic path on the phase diagram for water because enthalpy is a state function the enthalpy change in going between any two states of a system is independent of the path for a series of changes that restore a system to its original state the sum of all the enthalpy changes must be zero this fact enables us to find the enthalpy changes for many processes for which it is difficult to measure heat
