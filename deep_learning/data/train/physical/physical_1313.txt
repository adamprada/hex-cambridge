want to find the enthalpy of sublimation at the temperature and pressure represented by points d and d points a a d and d are all at the same temperature this temperature is about k or c this temperature is very slightly greater than k or cwhich is the temperature at which ice and water are at equilibrium in the presence of air at a total pressure of one atmosphere we want to calculate the enthalpy change for the equilibrium conversion of one mole of ice to gaseous water at the pressure where the solidgas equilibrium line intersects the line
