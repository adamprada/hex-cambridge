it is experimentally straightforward to find the enthalpy change for all of them except the sublimation step dd all of these steps can be carried out reversibly this strategy is useful in general we make extensive use of reversible cycles to find thermodynamic information for chemical systems the enthalpy changes for these steps are s c atm liq c atm liq c atm liq c atm liq c atm g c atm g c atm g c g c g c g c s c s c s c atm summing the enthalpy changes around the cycle gives using results
