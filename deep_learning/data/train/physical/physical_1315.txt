der waals equation is it fits pressurevolumetemperature data for a real gas better than the ideal gas equation does the improved fit is obtained by introducing two parameters designated and that must be determined experimentally for each gas van der waals equation is particularly useful in our effort to understand the behavior of real gases because it embodies a simple physical picture for the difference between a real gas and an ideal gas in deriving boyles law from newtons laws we assume that the gas molecules do not interact with one another simple arguments show that this can be only
