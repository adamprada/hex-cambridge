them the attractive force is usually assumed to be proportional to to recognize that real gas molecules both attract and repel one another we need only remember that any gas can be liquefied by reducing its temperature and increasing the pressure applied to it if we cool the liquid further it freezes to a solid now two distinguishing features of a solid are that it retains its shape and that it is almost incompressible we attribute the incompressibility of a solid to repulsive forces between its constituent molecules they have come so close to one another that repulsive forces between
