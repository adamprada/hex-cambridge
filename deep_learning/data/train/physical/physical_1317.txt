the solid these forces must be present in the liquid and gas phases also in the gas phase molecules are far apart in the liquid or the solid phase they are packed together at its boiling point the volume of a liquid is much less than the volume of the gas from which it is condensed at the freezing point the volume of a solid is only slightly different from the volume of the liquid from which it is frozen and it is certainly greater than zero these commonplace observations are readily explained by supposing that any molecule has a
