distance at which there is a balance between intermolecular forces of attraction and repulsion evidently molecules are very close to one another in condensed phases if we suppose that the empty spaces between molecules are negligible the volume of a condensed phase is approximately equal to the number of molecules in the sample multiplied by the volume of a single molecule then the molar volume is avogadros number times the volume occupied by one molecule if we know the density d and the molar mass we can find the molar volume as the volume occupied by a molecule v becomes
