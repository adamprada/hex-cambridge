a real gas effectively occupy a volume then moles of them effectively occupy a volume van der waals equation says that the volume of a real gas is the volume that would be occupied by noninteracting point masses plus the effective volume of the gas molecules themselves when data for real gas molecules are fit to the van der waals equation the value of is usually somewhat greater than the volume estimated from the liquid density and molecular weight see problem similarly we have we can understand this as a logical consequence of attractive interactions between the molecules of the
