if they attract one another when they come close to one another the effect of this attraction should be proportional to so van der waals equation is consistent with the idea that the pressure of a real gas is different from the pressure of the hypothetical ideal gas by an amount that is proportional to the frequency and strength of attractive interactions but why should attractive interactions have this effect why should the pressure of the real gas be less than that of the hypothetical ideal gas perhaps the best way to develop a qualitative picture is to recognize that
