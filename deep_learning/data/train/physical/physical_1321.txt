expression as a decrease in pressure figure potential energy versus distance for hard sphere molecules it is frequently useful to describe the interaction between particles or chemical moieties in terms of a potential energy versus distance diagram the van der waals equation corresponds to the case that the repulsive interaction between molecules is nonexistent until the molecules come into contact once they come into contact the energy required to move them still closer together becomes arbitrarily large often this is described by saying that they behave like hard spheres the attractive force between two molecules decreases as the distance between
