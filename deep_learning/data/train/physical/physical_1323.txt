the scf wave function used to generate the molecular orbitals csfs generated by carrying out single double triple etc level excitations ie orbital replacements relative to the reference csf ci wave functions limited to include contributions through various levels of excitation are denoted s singly d doubly sd singly and doubly sdt singly doubly and triply excited the orbitals from which electrons are removed can be restricted to focus attention on correlations among certain orbitals for example if excitations out of core orbitals are excluded one computes a total energy that contains no core correlation energy the number of csfs
