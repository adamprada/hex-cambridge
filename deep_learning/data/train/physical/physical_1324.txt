in the ci expansion this may be an over estimate of the number of csfs needed but it demonstrates how rapidly the number of csfs can grow with the number of electrons the hamiltonian matrix elements between pairs of csfs are in practice evaluated in terms of one and two electron integrals over the molecular orbitals prior to forming the matrix elements the one and two electron integrals which can be computed only for the atomic eg sto or gto basis must be transformed to the molecular orbital basis this transformation step requires computer resources proportional to the fifth power
