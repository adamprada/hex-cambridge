mobased integral list in total these four transformation steps require computer operations a variant of the ci method that is sometimes used is called the multiconfigurational selfconsistent field mcscf method to derive the working equations of this approach one minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian for a trial wave function consisting of a linear combination of csfs in carrying out this minimization process one varies both the linear expansion coefficients and the lcaomo coefficients describing those spinorbitals that appear in any of the csfs this produces two sets of equations that need to be solved a matrix eigenvalue equation
