for a new set of coefficients and so on until convergence is reached b perturbation theory this method uses the singleconfiguration scf process to determine a set of orbitals then with a zerothorder hamiltonian equal to the sum of the electrons fock operators perturbation theory is used to determine the ci amplitudes for the other csfs the m√∏llerplesset perturbation mppt procedure is a special case in which the above sum of fock operators is used to define the amplitude for the reference csf is taken as unity and the other csfs amplitudes are determined by using as the perturbation this
