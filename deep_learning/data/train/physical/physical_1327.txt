rspt with the above fluctuation potential as the perturbation the perturbation equations determine what csfs to include through any particular order this is one of the primary strengths of this technique it does not require one to make further choices in contrast to the ci treatment where one needs to choose which csfs to include for example the firstorder wave function correction is where the scf orbital energies are denoted and represents a csf that is doubly excited and are replaced by and relative to the scf wave function the denominators arise from because each of these zerothorder energies is
