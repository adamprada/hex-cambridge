go read the subsection on these rules before returning here from the slatercondon rules we know that the matrix elements in question are given by here the factor simply permutes the coordinates and to generate the exchange integral the sum of two electron integrals on the righthand side above can be extended to include the terms arising from because vanishes as a result the entire righthand side can be seen to reduce to the matrix element of the fock operator the matrix elements vanish because the spinorbitals are eigenfunctions of and are orthogonal to each other the mppt energy is
