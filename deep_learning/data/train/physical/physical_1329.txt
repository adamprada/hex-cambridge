contributions from the doubly excited csfs also enter the various orders of mppt are usually denoted mpn eg mp means secondorder mppt c the coupledcluster method as noted above when the hartreefock wave function is used as the zerothorder starting point in a perturbation expansion the first and presumably most important corrections to this function are the doublyexcited determinants in early studies of ci treatments of electron correlation it was observed that double excitations had the largest coefficients after the scf wave function which has the very largest moreover in ci studies that included single double triple and quadruple level
