etc level excited csfs when acting on as i show below this socalled coupledcluster cc form for then has the characteristic that the dominant contributions from quadruple excitations have coefficients nearly equal to the products of the coefficients of their constituent double excitations in any practical calculation this sum of operators would be truncated to keep the calculation practical for example if excitation operators higher than were neglected then one would use however even when is so truncated the resultant would contain excitations of higher order for example using the truncation just introduced we would have this function contains single
