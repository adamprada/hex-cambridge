doubleexcitation amplitudes after writing in terms of an exponential operator one is faced with determining the amplitudes of the various single double etc excitations generated by the operator acting on this is done by writing the schr√∂dinger equation as and then multiplying on the left by to obtain the cc energy is then calculated by multiplying this equation on the left by and integrating over the coordinates of all the electrons in practice the combination of operators appearing in this expression is rewritten and dealt with as follows this socalled bakercampbellhausdorf expansion of the exponential operators can be shown truncate
