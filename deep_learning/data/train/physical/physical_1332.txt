the righthand side of and the fact that that is the determinants are orthonormal the number of such equations is equal to the number of doubly excited determinants which is equal to the number of unknown amplitudes so the above quartic equations must be solved to determine the amplitudes appearing in the various operators then as noted above once these amplitudes are known the energy can be computed using the earlier quartic equation having to solve many coupled quartic equations is one of the most severe computational challenges of cc theory clearly the cc method contains additional complexity as a
