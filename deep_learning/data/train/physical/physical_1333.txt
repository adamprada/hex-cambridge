chemistry which move beyond the singleconfiguration picture by adding to the wave function more configurations ie excited determinants whose amplitudes they each determine in their own way as noted earlier these conventional approaches can lead to a very large number of csfs in the correlated wave function and as a result a need for extraordinary computer resources the density functional approaches are different here one solves a set of orbitallevel equations in which the orbitals feel potentials due to the nuclear centers having charges coulombic interaction with the total electron density and a socalled exchangecorrelation potential denoted the particular electronic
