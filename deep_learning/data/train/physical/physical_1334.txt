functions of the system the groundstate density therefore determines all properties of the system one proof of this theorem proceeds as follows determines the number of electrons because assume that there are two distinct potentials aside from an additive constant that simply shifts the zero of total energy and which when used in and respectively to solve for a ground state produce and that have the same oneelectron density if we think of as trial variational wave function for the hamiltonian we know that similarly taking as a trial function for the hamiltonian one finds that adding the equations in
