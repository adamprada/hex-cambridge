groundstate density however how are the kinetic energy and the electronelectron interaction energy expressed in terms of r there is another point of view that i find sheds even more light on why it makes sense that the groundstate electron density contains all the information needed to determine all properties it was shown many years ago by examining the mathematical character of the schr√∂dinger equation that the groundstate wave function has certain socalled cusps in the neighborhoods of the nuclear centers in particular must obey that is the derivative or slope of the natural logarithm of the true groundstate wave
