find points at which the density had sharp points characterized by nonzero derivatives in the natural logarithm of the density the positions of such points specify the nuclear centers and by measuring the slopes in at each location one could determine the charges of these nuclei through this demonstrates why the groundstate density is all one needs to fully determine the locations and charges of the nuclei as well as the number of electrons and thus the entire hamiltonian the main difficulty with dft is that the hohenbergkohn theorem shows the values of etc are all unique functionals of the
