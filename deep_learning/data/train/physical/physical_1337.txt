radius of a sphere in three dimensions and we realize that the density of quantum states in this space is one state per unit volume in the space because and must be positive integers the volume covering all states with energy less than or equal to a specified energy is the volume of the sphere of radius since there is one state per unit of such volume is also the number of states with energy less than or equal to and is called the integrated density of states the number of states with energy between and the density of states
