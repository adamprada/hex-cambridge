have no interactions among themselves in terms of the electron density it therefore may be plausible to express kinetic energies in terms of electron densities but it is still by no means clear how to do so for real atoms and molecules with electronnuclear and electronelectron interactions operative in one of the earliest dft models the thomasfermi theory the kinetic energy of an atom or molecule is approximated using the above kind of treatment on a local level that is for each volume element in space one assumes the expression given above to be valid and then one integrates over
