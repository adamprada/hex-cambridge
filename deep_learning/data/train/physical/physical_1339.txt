energy functional does not produce results that are of sufficiently high accuracy to be of great use in chemistry what is missing in this theory are the exchange energy and the electronic correlation energy moreover the kinetic energy is treated only in the approximate manner described earlier ie for noninteracting electrons within a spatially uniform potential dirac was able to address the exchange energy for the uniform electron gas coulomb interacting electrons moving in a uniform positive background charge whose magnitude balances the total charge of the electrons if the exact expression for the exchange energy of the uniform electron
