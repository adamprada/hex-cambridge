states of the inert gas atoms becke finds to equal a common gradient correction to the earlier local kinetic energy functional is called the weizsacker correction and is given by although the above discussion suggests how one might compute the groundstate energy once the groundstate density is given one still needs to know how to obtain kohn and sham ks introduced a set of socalled ks orbitals obeying the following equation where the socalled exchangecorrelation potential could be obtained by functional differentiation if the exchangecorrelation energy functional were known ks also showed that the ks orbitals could be used to
