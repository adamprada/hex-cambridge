correlation energy even for the uniform electron gas that is valid at arbitrary values of therefore much work has been devoted to creating efficient and accurate interpolation formulas connecting the low and high density uniform electron gas one such expression is where is the correlation energy per electron here and and the parameter is how the density enters since is equal to that is is the radius of a sphere whose volume is the effective volume occupied by one electron a reasonable approximation to the full would contain the dirac and perhaps gradient corrected exchange functional plus the above but
