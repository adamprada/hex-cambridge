density is computed as often itself is expanded in an atomic orbital basis which need not be the same as the basis used for the and the expansion coefficients of are computed in terms of those of the this new basis it is also common to use an atomic orbital basis to expand which together with is needed to evaluate the exchangecorrelation functionals contribution to the current iterations density is used in the ks equations to determine the hamiltonian whose new eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are found by solving the ks equations these new are used to compute a new density
