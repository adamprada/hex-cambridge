of pairs of states and subsequently subtracting them various energy differences can be so computed differences between two electronic states of the same molecule ie electronic excitation energies differences between energy states of a molecule and the cation or anion formed by removing or adding an electron ie ionization potentials ips and electron affinities eas in the early s the author developed one such tool for computing eas j simons and w d smith theory of electron affinities of small molecules j chem phys and he called this the equations of motion eom method throughout much of the s and
