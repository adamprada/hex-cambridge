earlier these methods are now rather routinely used when ip or ea information is sought the basic ideas underlying most if not all of the energydifference methods are one forms a reference wave function this can be of the scf mpn ci cc dft etc variety the energy differences are computed relative to the energy of this function one expresses the finalstate wave function ie that describing the excited cation or anion state in terms of an operator acting on the reference clearly the operator must be one that removes or adds an electron when one is attempting to compute
