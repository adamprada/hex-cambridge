configurations whose amplitudes have been determined from a ci or mpn calculation and express in terms of operators that cause single double etc level excitations for the ip ea cases is given in terms of operators that remove add remove and singly excite add and singly excite etc electrons substituting the expansions for and for into the equation of motion eom and then projecting the resulting equation on the left against a set of functions eg gives a matrix eigenvalueeigenvector equation to be solved for the operator coefficients and the excitation or ip or ea energies such are the working
