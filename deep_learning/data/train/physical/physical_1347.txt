this text for the radial motion of the electron in the hydrogenlike atoms except that the reduced mass m replaces the electron mass m and the potential is not the coulomb potential if the vibrational potential is approximated as a quadratic function of the bond displacement expanded about the equilibrium bond length where has its minimum the resulting harmonicoscillator equation can be solved exactly because the potential grows without bound as approaches or only boundstate solutions exist for this model problem that is the motion is confined by the nature of the potential so no continuum states exist in which
