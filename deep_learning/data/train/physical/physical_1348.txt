where the are coefficients to be determined substituting this expression into the full radial equation generates a set of recursion equations for the amplitudes as in the solution of the hydrogenlike radial equation the series described by these coefficients is divergent unless the energy happens to equal specific values it is this requirement that the wave function not diverge so it can be normalized that yields energy quantization the energies of the states that arise by imposing this nondivergence condition are given by and the eigenfunctions are given in terms of the socalled hermite polynomials as follows where within this
