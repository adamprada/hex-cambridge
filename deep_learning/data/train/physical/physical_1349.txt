the symmetry of the harmonic potential with respect to reflection through the origin along the axis ie changing to throughout this text many symmetries arise in each case symmetry properties of the potential cause the solutions of the schrödinger equation to be decomposed into various symmetry groupings such symmetry decompositions are of great use because they provide additional quantum numbers ie symmetry labels by which the wave functions and energies can be labeled the basic idea underlying how such symmetries split the solutions of the schrödinger equation into different classes relates to the fact that a symmetry operator eg the
