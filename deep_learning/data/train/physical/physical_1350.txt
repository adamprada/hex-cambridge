comprise the simplest reasonable model for vibrational motion vibrations of a polyatomic molecule are often characterized in terms of individual bondstretching and anglebending motions each of which is in turn approximated harmonically this results in a total vibrational wave function that is written as a product of functions one for each of the vibrational coordinates two of the most severe limitations of the harmonic oscillator model the lack of anharmonicity ie nonuniform energy level spacings and lack of bond dissociation result from the quadratic nature of its potential by introducing model potentials that allow for proper bond dissociation ie that
