constant that characterizes the steepness of the potential and thus affects the vibrational frequencies the advantage of using the morse potential to improve upon harmonicoscillatorlevel predictions is that its energy levels and wave functions are also known exactly the energies are given in terms of the parameters of the potential as follows where the force constant is given in terms of the morse potentials parameters by the morse potential supports both bound states those lying below the dissociation threshold for which vibration is confined by an outer turning point and continuum states lying above the dissociation threshold for which there
