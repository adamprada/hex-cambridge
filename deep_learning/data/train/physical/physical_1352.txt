becomes too small ie in the morse model the potential may not be deep enough to support any bound levels it is true that some attractive potentials do not have a large enough value to have any bound states and this is important to keep in mind so bound states are to be expected when there is a potential well and thus the possibility of inner and outer turning points for the classical motion within this well but only if this well is deep enough the eigenfunctions of the harmonic and morse potentials display nodal character analogous to what we
