are similar and are large near the outer turning point where the classical velocity is low they also have large amplitudes near the inner turning point but this amplitude is rather narrow because the morse potential drops off strongly to the right of this turning point in contrast to the left of the outer turning point the potential decreases more slowly so the large amplitudes persist over longer ranges near this turning point contributors and attributions jack simons henry eyring scientist and professor of chemistry u utah telluride schools on theoretical chemistry integrated by tomoyuki hayashi uc davis virial equations
