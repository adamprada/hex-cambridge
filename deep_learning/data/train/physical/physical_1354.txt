like an ideal gas experimental values of z will tend toward unity under conditions in which the density of the real gas becomes low and its behavior approaches that of an ideal gas at a given temperature we can conveniently ensure that this condition is met by fitting the z values to a polynomial in p or a polynomial in the coefficients are functions of temperature if the data are fit to a polynomial in the pressure the equation is for a polynomial in the equation is these empirical equations are called virial equations as indicated the parameters are functions
