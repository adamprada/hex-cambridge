used but how does one derive an expression for the partial derivative in equation refeq this is a fairly straight forward process that begins with the definition of differentiating and using the chain rule to evaluate yields now it is convenient to use the combined first and second laws which assumes a reversible change and only work is being done substituting equation refeq into equation refeq yields canceling the terms gives the important result da pdv sdt labeleq the natural variables of are therefore and so the total differential of is conveniently expressed as da left dfracpartial apartial v rightt
