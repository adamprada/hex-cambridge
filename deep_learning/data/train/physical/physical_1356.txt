for the isothermal expansion of mol of an ideal gas from l to l at k solution for an ideal gas so left dfracpartial apartial v rightt p becomes left dfracpartial apartial v rightt dfracnrtv and so equation refeq delta a intvv left dfracpartial apartial v rightt dv becomes or substituting the values from the problem but further it is easy to show that the maxwell relation that arises from the simplified expression for the total differential of is left dfracpartial ppartial t rightv left dfracpartial spartial v rightt this particular maxwell relation is exceedingly useful since one of the
