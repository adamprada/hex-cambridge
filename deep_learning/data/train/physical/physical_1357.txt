attributions the science of chemistry deals with molecules including the radicals cations and anions they produce when fragmented or ionized chemists study isolated molecules eg as occur in the atmosphere and in astronomical environments solutions of molecules or ions dissolved in solvents as well as solid liquid and plastic materials comprised of molecules all such forms of molecular matter are what chemistry is about chemical science includes how to make molecules synthesis how to detect and quantitate them analysis how to probe their properties and the changes they undergo as reactions occur physical molecular structure bonding shapes electronic structures one
