blue also connected to the acarbon atom are a chain of three methylene groups a group then a carbon atom attached both by a double bond to an imine group and to an amino group figure the arginine molecule in its nonzwitterion form with dotted hydrogen bond the connectivity among the atoms in arginine is dictated by the well known valence preferences displayed by h c o and n atoms the internal bond angles are to a large extent also determined by the valences of the constituent atoms ie the or nature of the bonding orbitals however there are other
