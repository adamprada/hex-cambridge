active sites in neighboring molecules or nearby materials it will bind a molecules shape eg rod like flat globular etc is one of the first things a chemist thinks of when trying to predict where at another molecule or on a surface or at a cell membrane the molecule will fit and be able to bind and perhaps react the presence of lone pairs of electrons which act as lewis base sites of orbitals which can act as electron donor and electron acceptor sites and of highly polar or ionic groups guide the chemist further in determining where on the
