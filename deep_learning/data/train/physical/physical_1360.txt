orbitals can be determined for any location of the nuclei if the schr√∂dinger equation governing the movements of the electrons can be solved if you have not had a good class on how quantum mechanics is used within chemistry i urge you to take the time needed to master part in those pages i introduce the central concepts of quantum mechanics and i show how they apply to several very important cases including electrons moving in and dimensions and how these models relate to electronic structures of polyenes and to electronic bands in solids the classical and quantum probability densities
