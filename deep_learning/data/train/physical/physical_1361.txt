that we know the energy at various locations of the nuclei in some cases we denote this energy and in others we use because within the bornoppenheimer approximation the electronic energy serves as the potential v for the molecules vibrational motions as discussed in part one can then perform a search for the lowest energy structure eg by finding where the gradient vector vanishes and where the second derivative or hessian matrix has no negative eigenvalues by finding such a localminimum in the energy landscape theory is able to determine a stable structure of such a molecule the word stable
