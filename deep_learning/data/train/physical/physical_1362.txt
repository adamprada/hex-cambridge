along such a direction one can move to a new geometry that is lower in energy if not only the gradients but also the second derivatives are known at some geometry one can make a more intelligent step toward a geometry of lower energy for additional details about how such geometry optimization searches are performed within modern computational chemistry software see chapter where this subject was treated in greater detail it often turns out that a molecule has more than one stable structure isomer for a given electronic state moreover the geometries that pertain to stable structures of excited electronic
