electronic schr√∂dinger equation while placing the constituent nuclei in the locations described in the two figures figure another stable structure for the arginine molecule if the arginine molecule is excited to another electronic state for example by promoting a nonbonding electron on its co oxygen atom into the neighboring co orbital its stable structures will not be the same as in the ground electronic state in particular the corresponding co distance will be longer than in the ground state but other internal geometrical parameters may also be modified albeit probably less so than the co distance moreover the chemical reactivity
