a geometry optimization process include all of the interatomic distances and internal angles needed to specify the equilibrium geometry and the total electronic energy at this particular geometry it is also possible to extract much more information from these calculations for example by multiplying elements of the hessian matrix by the inverse square roots of the atomic masses of the atoms labeled a and b one forms the massweighted hessian whose nonzero eigenvalues give the harmonic vibrational frequencies of the molecule the eigenvectors of the massweighted hessian matrix give the relative displacements in coordinates that accompany vibration in the normal
