excitation do not but electronic excitation ionization and electron attachment do as illustrated in figure where a bimolecular reaction is displayed chemical reactions involve breaking some bonds and forming others and thus involve rearrangement of the electrons among various molecular orbitals figure two bimolecular reactions a and b show an atom combining with a diatomic c and d show an atom abstracting an atom from a diatomic in this example in part a the green atom collides with the brown diatomic molecule and forms the bound triatomic molecule b alternatively in c and d a pink atom collides with a
