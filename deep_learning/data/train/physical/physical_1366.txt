a carboxylate anion group with the ion now bonded to the terminal imine group thus converting it to an amino group and placing the net positive charge on the adjacent carbon atom the unimolecular tautomerization reaction in which the two forms of arginine are interconverted involves breaking an bond forming a bond and changing a carbonnitrogen double bond into a carbonnitrogen single bond in such a process the electronic structure is significantly altered and as a result the two isomers can display very different chemical reactivities toward other reagents notice that once again the ultimate structure of the zwitterion tautomer
