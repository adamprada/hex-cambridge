such reactions external energy must to provided to the reacting molecules to allow the reaction to occur exothermic reactions are those for which the bonds in the products exceed in strength those of the reactants for exothermic reactions no net energy input is needed to allow the reaction to take place instead excess energy is generated and liberated when such reactions take place in the former endothermic case the energy needed by the reaction usually comes from the kinetic energy of the reacting molecules or molecules that surround them that is thermal energy from the environment provides the needed energy
