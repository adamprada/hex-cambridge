to an antibonding orbital one speaks of inducing reaction by photochemical means conservation of orbital symmetry the woodwardhoffmann rules an example of how important it is to understand the changes in bonding that accompany a chemical reaction let us consider a reaction in which butadiene is converted via ringclosure to form cyclobutene specifically focus on the four orbitals of butadiene as the molecule undergoes socalled disrotatory closing along which the plane of symmetry which bisects and is perpendicular to the bond is preserved the orbitals of the reactant and product can be labeled as being evene or oddo under reflection
