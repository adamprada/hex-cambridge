plane see the orbitals in figure the and and and orbitals of the product cyclobutane which evolve from the four orbitals of the butadiene are of the following symmetry and energy order the woodwardhoffmann rules instruct us to arrange the reactant and product orbitals in order of increasing energy and to then connect these orbitals by symmetry starting with the lowest energy orbital and going through the highest energy orbital this process gives the following socalled orbital correlation diagram figure the orbital correlation diagram for the butadiene to cyclobutene reaction we then need to consider how the electronic configurations in
