these lowest two orbitals of butadiene to produce cyclobutene if the reactants could be prepared for example by photolysis in an excited state having orbital occupancy then reaction along the path considered would not have any symmetryimposed barrier because this singly excited configuration correlates to a singlyexcited configuration of the products the fact that the reactant and product configurations are of equivalent excitation level causes there to be no symmetry constraints on the photochemically induced reaction of butadiene to produce cyclobutene in contrast the thermal reaction considered first above has a symmetryimposed barrier because the orbital occupancy is forced to
