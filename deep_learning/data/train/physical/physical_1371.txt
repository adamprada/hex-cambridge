nothing to do with the thermodynamic energy differences of such reactions what the above woodwardhoffmann symmetry treatment addresses is whether there will be symmetryimposed barriers above and beyond any thermodynamic energy differences the enthalpies of formation of reactants and products contain the information about the reactions overall energy balance and need to be considered independently of the kind of orbital symmetry analysis just introduced as the above example illustrates whether a chemical reaction occurs on the ground or an excitedstate electronic surface is important to be aware of this example shows that one might want to photoexcite the reactant molecules
