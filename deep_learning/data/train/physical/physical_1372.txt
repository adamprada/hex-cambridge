they produce light luminescence by way of a chemical reaction rates of change rates of reactions play crucial roles in many aspects of our lives rates of various biological reactions determine how fast we metabolize food and rates at which fuels burn in air determine whether an explosion or a calm flame will result chemists view the rate of any reaction among molecules and perhaps photons or electrons if they are used to induce excitation in reactant molecules to be related to the frequency with which the reacting species encounter one another and the probability that a set of such
