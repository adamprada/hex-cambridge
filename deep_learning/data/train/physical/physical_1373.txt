can be altered by changing the concentrations of the reacting species by changing the temperature or by adding a catalyst concentrations and temperature control the collision rates among molecules and temperature also controls the energy available to surmount barriers catalysts are molecules that are not consumed during the reaction but which cause the rate of the reaction to be increased species that slow the rate of a reaction are called inhibitors most catalysts act by providing orbitals of their own that interact with the reacting molecules orbitals to cause the energies of the latter to be lowered as the reaction
