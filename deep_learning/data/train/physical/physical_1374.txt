the electronic orbital occupancies change as the system evolves from reactants to products in a sense understanding the mechanism of a reaction in detail amounts to having a mental moving picture of how the atoms and electrons move as the reaction is occurring the issue of how fast reactions occur relates to the rates of chemical reactions in most cases reaction rates are determined by the frequency with which the reacting molecules access a critical geometry called the transition state or activated complex near which bond breaking and bond forming takes place the reacting molecules potential energy along the path
