such rates depend upon geometrical energetic and vibrational properties of the reacting molecules the frequencies with which the transition state is accessed are determined by the amount of energy termed the activation energy needed to access this critical geometry for systems at or near thermal equilibrium the probability of the molecule gaining energy is shown for three temperatures in figure figure distributions of energies at various temperatures for such cases chemical reaction rates usually display a temperature dependence characterized by linear plots of vs of course not all reactions involve molecules that have been prepared at or near thermal equilibrium
