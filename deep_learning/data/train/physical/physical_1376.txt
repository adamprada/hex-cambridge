important in surmounting reaction barriers we convert this cartesian velocity component distribution to one in terms of the collision speed this is done by changing from cartesian to polar coordinates in which the radial variable is v itself and gives after integrating over the two angular coordinates it is the factor in this speed distribution that causes the maxwellboltzmann distribution to vanish at low speeds in the above plot another kind of experiment in which nonthermal conditions are used to extract information about activation energies occurs within the realm of ionmolecule reactions where one uses collisioninduced dissociation cid to break
