i show in figure figure reaction crosssection as a function of collision energy on the vertical axis is plotted a quantity proportional to the rate at which ions are formed on the horizontal axis is plotted the collision energy in two formats the laboratory kinetic energy is simply the mass of the complex multiplied by the square of the speed of these ion complexes measured with respect to a laboratoryfixed coordinate frame the centerofmass cm kinetic energy is the amount of energy available between the complex and the xe atom and is given by erm cm dfrac dfracmrm complex mxemrm
