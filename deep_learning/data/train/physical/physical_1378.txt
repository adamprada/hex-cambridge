are greatly in excess of what can be realized by simply heating the sample statistical mechanics treating large numbers of molecules in close contact when one has a large number of molecules that undergo frequent collisions thereby exchanging energy momentum and angular momentum the behavior of this collection of molecules can often be described in a simple way at first glance it seems unlikely that the treatment of a large number of molecules could require far less effort than that required to describe one or a few such molecules to see the essence of what i am suggesting consider a
