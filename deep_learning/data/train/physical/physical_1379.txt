the speed of this single water molecule over a very long time scale ie much longer than the average time between collisions one obtains an average square of the speed that is related to the temperature of the sample via dfrac mv dfrac kt this relationship holds because the sample is at equilibrium at temperature an example of the kind of behavior i describe above is shown in figure figure the energy possessed by a ion as a function of time in this figure on the vertical axis is plotted the log of the energy kinetic plus potential of a
