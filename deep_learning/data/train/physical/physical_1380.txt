and others to collisions that given energy to the ion on longer time scales eg over ps we also see a gradual drop off in the energy content of the ion which illustrates the slow loss of its excess energy on the longer time scale now lets consider what happens if we monitor a large number of molecules rather than a single molecule within the cm sample of mentioned earlier if we imagine drawing a sphere of radius and monitoring the average speed of all water molecules within this sphere we obtain a qualitatively different picture if the sphere is
