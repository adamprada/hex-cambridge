its behavior over time scales lasting for many many collisions for the collection of many molecules the same average value is achieved at any instant of time because the number of molecules within the sphere which is proportional to is so much larger than the number near the surface of the sphere proportional to that the molecules interior to the sphere are essentially at equilibrium for all times another way to say the same thing is to note that the fluctuations in the energy content of a single molecule are very large ie the molecule undergoes frequent large jerks but
