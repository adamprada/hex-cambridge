instead one can focus on the average properties of the entire collection of molecules what this means for a person interested in theoretical simulations of such condensedmedia problems is that there is no need to carry out a newtonian molecular dynamics simulation of the system or a quantum simulation if it is at equilibrium because the longtime averages of whatever is calculated can be found another way how one achieves this is through the magic of statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics one of the most powerful of the devices of statistical mechanics is the socalled montecarlo simulation algorithm such theoretical
