and in ice are shown in figure figure radial oo distribution functions at three temperatures such properties represent averages over long times or over a large collection of molecules of some property that is not changing with time except on a very fast time scale corresponding to individual collisions in contrast dynamical properties of molecular collections include the folding and unfolding processes that proteins and other polymers undergo the migrations of protons from water molecule to water molecule in liquid water and along chains within ion channels and the self assembly of molecular monolayers on solid surfaces as the concentration
