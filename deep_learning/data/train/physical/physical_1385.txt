expansion from to at followed by an isochoric temperature increase from to at pathway an isochoric temperature increase from to at followed by and isothermal expansion from to at and since has the good sense to be a state variable the pathway connecting the initial and final states is unimportant we are free to choose any path that is convenient to calculate the change example nonisothermal gas expansion calculate the entropy change for mol of a monatomic ideal gas cv r expanding from l at k to l at k solution if one considers entropy to be a function of
