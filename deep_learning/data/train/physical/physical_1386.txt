functions can be specified as functions of the same two variables in general terms and so an important question that can be answered is what happens to if is held constant but is changed to explore this consider the total differential of but can also be considered a function of and this implies that the total differential can also be written as and these two total differentials must be equal to one another if we constrain the system to a change in which remains constant the last term will vanish since but also since is a function and the total
