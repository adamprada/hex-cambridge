left dfracpartial wpartial x righty labelfinal as with partial derivative transformation types i and ii this result can be achieved in a formal albeit less mathematically rigorous method consider this allows us to write the total differential for now divide by and constrain to constant noting that and converting the other ratios to partial derivatives yields left dfracpartial zpartial x righty left dfracpartial zpartial x rightw left dfracpartial zpartial w rightx left dfracpartial wpartial x righty labelfinal which agrees with the previous result equation reffinal again the method is not mathematically rigorous but it works so long as and are
