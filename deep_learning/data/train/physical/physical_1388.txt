nonintuitive so much so that this equation often causes great irritation let us see how this equation comes about suppose that we have a distribution whose mean is and variance is suppose that we draw values of the random variable from the distribution we want to think about the expected value of let us write as squaring this gives from our definition of expected value we can write from our discussion above we can recognize each of these expected values the expected value of is the variance of the original distribution which is since this is a definition it is
