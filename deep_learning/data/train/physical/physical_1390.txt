of quantum mechanics this is why quantum mechanics has to be mastered as part of learning theoretical chemistry we know that all molecules are made of atoms that in turn contain nuclei and electrons as i discuss in this chapter the equations that govern the motions of electrons and of nuclei are not the familiar newton equations but a new set of equations called schr√∂dinger equations when scientists first studied the behavior of electrons and nuclei they tried to interpret their experimental findings in terms of classical newtonian motions but such attempts eventually failed they found that such small light
