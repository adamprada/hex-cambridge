of atoms or ions in crystals it was known that peaks in the intensity of diffracted xrays having wavelength l would occur at scattering angles q determined by the famous bragg equation n lambda d sintheta tag where d is the spacing between neighboring planes of atoms or ions these quantities are illustrated in figure shown below there are may such diffraction peaks each labeled by a different value of the integer the bragg formula can be derived by considering when two photons one scattering from the second plane in the figure and the second scattering from the third plane
