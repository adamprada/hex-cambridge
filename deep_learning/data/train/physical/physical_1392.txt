peaks at angles that obeyed a bragglike equation the startling thing about this observation is that electrons are particles yet the bragg equation is based on the properties of waves an important observation derived from the davissongermer experiments was that the scattering angles observed for electrons of kinetic energy could be fit to the bragg equation if a wavelength were ascribed to these electrons that was defined by where is the mass of the electron and h is the constant introduced by max planck and albert einstein in the early s to relate a photons energy to its frequency via
