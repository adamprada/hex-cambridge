a wavelength to the scattering particle according to where is the mass of the scattered particle and is plancks constant x erg sec the observation that electrons and other small light particles display wave like behavior was important because these particles are what all atoms and molecules are made of so if we want to fully understand the motions and behavior of molecules we must be sure that we can adequately describe such properties for their constituents because the classical newtonian equations do not contain factors that suggest wave properties for electrons or nuclei moving freely in space the above
