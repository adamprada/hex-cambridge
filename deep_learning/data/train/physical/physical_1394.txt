of the lines emitted with their wave lengths indicated in nanometers the other panels show how these lines have been analyzed by scientists whose names are associated into patterns that relate to the specific energy levels between which transitions occur to emit the corresponding photons in the early attempts to rationalize such spectra in terms of electronic motions one described an electron as moving about the atomic nuclei in circular orbits such as shown in figure figure characterization of small and large stable orbits for an electron moving around a nucleus a circular orbit was thought to be stable when
