faster as it moves closer to the nucleus since however nowhere in this model is a concept that relates to the experimental fact that each atom emits only certain kinds of photons it was believed that photon emission occurred when an electron moving in a larger circular orbit lost energy and moved to a smaller circular orbit however the newtonian dynamics that produced the above equation would allow orbits of any radius and hence any energy to be followed thus it would appear that the electron should be able to emit photons of any energy as it moved from orbit
