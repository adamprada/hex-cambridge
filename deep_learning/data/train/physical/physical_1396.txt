nucleus thus the bohr relationship that is analogous to the bragg equation that determines at what angles constructive interference can occur is both this equation and the analogous bragg equation are illustrations of what we call boundary conditions they are extra conditions placed on the wavelength to produce some desired character in the resultant wave in these cases constructive interference of course there remains the question of why one must impose these extra conditions when the newton dynamics do not require them the resolution of this paradox is one of the things that quantum mechanics does returning to the above
