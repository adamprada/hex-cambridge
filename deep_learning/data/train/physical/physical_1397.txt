energies nb the reference zero of energy corresponds to the electron at and with so it is the result that only certain orbits are allowed that causes only certain energies to occur and thus only certain energies to be observed in the emitted photons it turned out that the bohr formula for the energy levels labeled by of an electron moving about a nucleus could be used to explain the discrete line emission spectra of all oneelectron atoms and ions ie etc sometimes called hydrogenic species to very high precision in such an interpretation of the experimental data one claims
