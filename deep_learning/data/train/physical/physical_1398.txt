transitions involving only the single s valence electron moreover it can be greatly improved if one introduces a modification designed to treat the penetration of the na atoms s and higher orbitals within the regions of space occupied by the s s and p orbitals such a modification to the bohr model is achieved by introducing the idea of a socalled quantum defect d into the principal quantum number so that the expression for the dependence of the orbitals changes to example for example choosing equal to or for li na k rb and cs respectively in this socalled rydberg
