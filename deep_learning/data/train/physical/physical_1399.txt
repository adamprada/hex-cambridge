on side chains of amino acids an electron can be attached into a socalled rydberg orbital to form corresponding neutral radicals such as or for example in the electron bound to an underlying cation core the lowestenergy state of this rydberg species is often labeled s because is isoelectronic with the na cation which binds an electron in its s orbital in its ground state as in the cases of alkali atoms these rydberg molecules also possess excited electronic states for example the nh radical has states labeled p d s p d f etc by making an appropriate choice
