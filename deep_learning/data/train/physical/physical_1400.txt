and unlike atomic rydberg orbitals the three five seven etc orbitals are not degenerate instead they are split in energy in a manner reflecting the symmetry of the underlying cations symmetry for example for the three orbitals are degenerate and belong to symmetry in the point group the five orbitals are split into three degenerate and two degenerate e orbitals so the bohr model works well for oneelectron atoms or ions and the quantum defectmodified bohr equation describes reasonably well some states of alkali atoms and of rydberg molecules the primary reason for the breakdown of the bohr formula is
