were discrete in summary two experimental observations on the behavior of electrons that were crucial to the abandonment of newtonian dynamics were the observations of electron diffraction and of discrete emission spectra both of these findings seem to suggest that electrons have some wave characteristics and that these waves have only certain allowed ie quantized wavelengths so now we have some idea about why newtons equations fail to account for the dynamical motions of light and small particles such as electrons and nuclei we see that extra conditions eg the bragg condition or constraints on the de broglie wavelength could
