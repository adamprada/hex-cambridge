postulated it some idea of how the scientists of that era dreamed up the schr√∂dinger equation can be had by examining the time and spatial dependence that characterizes socalled traveling waves it should be noted that the people who worked on these problems knew a great deal about waves eg sound waves and water waves and the equations they obeyed moreover they knew that waves could sometimes display the characteristic of quantized wavelengths or frequencies eg fundamentals and overtones in sound waves they knew for example that waves in one dimension that are constrained at two points eg a violin
