at and at so the wavelengths belonging to the two waves shown are and if the violin string were not clamped at the waves could have any value of however because the string is attached at the allowed wavelengths are quantized to obey where the equation that such waves obey called the wave equation reads where is the speed at which the wave travels this speed depends on the composition of the material from which the violin string is made stiff string material produces waves with higher speeds than for softer material using the earlier expressions for the and dependences
