as at and for all times it is important to note in closing this discussion of waves on strings and surfaces that it is not being a solution to the schr√∂dinger equation that results in quantization of the wavelengths instead it is the condition that the wave vanish at the boundaries that generates the quantization you will see this trend time and again throughout this text when a wave function is subject to specific constraints at its inner or outer boundary or both quantization will result if these boundary conditions are not present quantization will not occur let us now
