try to remind them that this is not how theory works instead one uses experimental observation to postulate a rule or equation or theory and one then tests the theory by making predictions that can be tested by further experiments if the theory fails it must be refined and this process continues until one has a better and better theory in this sense quantum mechanics with all of its unusual mathematical constructs and rules should be viewed as arising from the imaginations of scientists who tried to invent a theory that was consistent with experimental data and which could be
