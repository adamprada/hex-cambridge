molecule the additional energy could go directly into any of these modes however before the molecule can react enough energy must find its way into some rather particular mode if for example the reaction involves the breaking of a chemical bond and the collision puts excess kinetic energy into the molecules translational modes the reaction can occur only after some part of the excess translational energy has been converted to excess vibrational energy in the breaking bond this intramolecular transfer of energy among the molecules various internal modes is timedependent from this perspective the probability that an excited molecule will
