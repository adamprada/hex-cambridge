a particle can be expressed as where is the mass of the particle and is the magnitude of its velocity or speed equation reftranske describes the kinetic energy associated with translation other expressions exist for different motions eg rotation or vibration an example of a system in which energy is converted between kinetic energy and potential energy is a hookes law oscillator according to hookes law the force acting on an object is proportional in magnitude to the displacement of the object from an equilibrium position and opposite in sign in this equation is the force is the displacement from
