a harmonic oscillator as the object is displaced in the along the xaxis in the case shown in figure this would be accomplished by stretching or compressing the spring the potential energy increases the force acting on the object will also increase as the object is displaced and will be directed opposite of the direction of displacement equation refhook according to newtonian physics the potential energy is given by the negative integral of the force with respect to position u x int fx dx labelenergy substituting equation refhook in equation refenergy yields with the proper choice of coordinate system and
