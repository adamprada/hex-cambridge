the resisting force perhaps due to friction and also sufficient to cause motion along the entire path figure the work of displacement the energy expended as work in this case if the force is independent of the position of the object being moved is given by where f is the magnitude of the resisting force and dx is the displacement of the object the negative sign is necessary since the force is acting in the opposite direction of the motion a more general expression and one that can be used if the force is not constant over the entire motion
