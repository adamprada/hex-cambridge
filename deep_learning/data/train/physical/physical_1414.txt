the concepts of energy and work are inexorably intertwined they will be central to the study of thermodynamics the work of a reversible expansion an important case of limiting ideal behavior is that of the reversible expansion for a change to be reversible there can be no net force pushing the change in one direction or the other in order for this to be the case the internal pressure that of the system and external pressure that of the surroundings must be the same in this case the work of expansion can be calculated by integrating the expression for dw
