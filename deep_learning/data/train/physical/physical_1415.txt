constant external pressure equal to the final pressure you have calculated reversibly solution first lets calculate the final pressure via equation refigl p dfracnrtv dfracmole atmlmol kk l atm this may be a relationship you remember from general chemistry that mole of an idea gas occupies l at oc okay now for the irreversible expansion against a constant external pressure so but what the heck is an atm l it is actually a fairly simply thing to convert from units of atm l to j by using the ideal gas law constant note that the negative sign indicated that the
