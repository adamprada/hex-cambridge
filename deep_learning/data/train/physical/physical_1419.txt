of the system directly the amount of heat energy transferred in a process can be measured using a change in temperature of the soundings this concept will be used later in the discussion of calorimetry an infinitesimal amount of heat flow into or out of a system can be related to a change in temperature by where c is the heat capacity and has the definition heat capacities generally have units of j mol k and magnitudes equal to the number of j needed to raise the temperature of mol of substance by k similar to a heat capacity is
