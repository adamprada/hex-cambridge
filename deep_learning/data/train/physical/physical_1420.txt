derivative is defined for a function by because it measures how much a function changes for a change in a given dependent variable infinitesimal changes in the in the function can be described by so that each contribution to the total change in the function can be considered separately for simplicity consider an ideal gas the pressure can be calculated for the gas using the ideal gas law in this expression pressure is a function of temperature and molar volume the partial derivatives of p can be expressed in terms of t and v as well and so that the
