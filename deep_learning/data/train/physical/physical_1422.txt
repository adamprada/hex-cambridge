changing in the system table changes to the system type of work displacement resistance dw expansion dv volume pext pressure pextdv electrical dq charge w resistence w dq extension dl length t tension t dl stretching da s surf tens sda the pattern followed is always an infinitesimal displacement multiplied by a resisting force the total work can then be determined by integrating along the pathway the change follows example work from a gas expansion what is the work done by mol an ideal gas expanding from a volume of l to a volume of l against a constant external
