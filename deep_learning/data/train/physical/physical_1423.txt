of the maximum work in the case of or non pv work in the case of that is available from a process to show this consider the total differentials first consider the differential of substituting the combined first and second laws for but expressing the work term as yields and cancelling the terms gives or at constant temperature since the only assumption made here was that the change is reversible allowing for the substitution of for and for a reversible change is the maximum amount of work it follows that gives the maximum work that can be produced from a
