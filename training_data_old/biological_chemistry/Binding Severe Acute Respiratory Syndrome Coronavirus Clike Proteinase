No headers Topic hierarchy This page contains assessmentexam questions using data figures and graphs from research journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry which allow their use or from journals such as from PLOS that are completely open access The papers and topics chosen were selected to assess student understanding of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ASBMB foundational concepts and learning objectives as well as MCAT foundational concepts and objectives These two sets of standards broadly overlap Both ASBMB and the MCAT strongly emphasis scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are perhaps best assessed by openended questions derived from the literature in which students must employ higher level Bloom skills of application and analysis These questions can also be used by students who seek more opportunities to practice interpreting research literature results The ability to apply analyze and evaluate information and concepts are at the heart of scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are central to the new ASBMB and MCAT competency standards The questions in this learning module are designed to assess these competencies using openended responses instead of multiplechoice questions Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Clike Proteinase N Terminus Is Indispensable for Proteolytic Activity but Not for Enzyme Dimerization Biochemical and Thermodynamic Investigation in Conjunction with Molecular Dynamics Simulations Shuai Chen Lili Chen Jinzhi Tan Jing Chen Li Du Tao Sun Jianhua Shen Kaixian Chen Hualiang Jiang and Xu Shen J Biol Chem Vol Issue January Background from paper SARS coronavirusSARSCoV has a replicase gene with a sequence motifs of papainlikeproteinase and Clike proteinase CLpro SARS CLpro is fullyconserved among all released SARS coronavirus genome sequences Because of its functional indispensability in the coronaviruslife cycle SARS CLpro S has become an attractive target in discoveringnew antiSARS agentsThe crystal structures of CL proteinases from human coronavirus has been determined The reported crystal structures of SARS CLpro and its complexwith an inhibitor revealed substantially pHdependent conformationalchanges and an unexpected model for inhibitor binding It contains the following three domainsdomains I and II residues have an antiparallelβbarrel structure forming a chymotrypsinfold the substratebindingsite is located in a cleft between these two domains whereasresidues form a third compact αhelical domaindomain III connecting to domain II by a long loop residues As the crystal structures of CL proteinases in different coronavirusesgive similar dimeric structures and nearly all side chainsof CLpro involved in the formation of the dimer are conservedit has been proposed that the dimer might be the biological functional form of CLpro From the dimeric structures of coronavirus CLpros it has been also predicted that domainIII might play a role in substrate recognition and be responsiblefor positioning the N terminus of one protomer monomer to interact with the active site of the other protomerThe critical role of domain III in dimerization and enzymaticactivity of SARS CLpro has been shown In addition Lai and coworkers reported that SARS CLpro exists as a monomerdimer mixture at a relatively highprotein concentration approx mgml and is exclusively monomer ata lower protein concentration approx mgml in solution and onlythe dimer was the active form of the proteinase Based on the crystal structures and biochemical studies of several coronavirus CLpros one hypothesis was proposed that the Nterminalresidues might play an important role in both dimerization and enzymatic activity of SARS CLpro However other studies showned that the N terminus was not necessaryfor the dimer formation of SARS CLpro ie the Nterminal deleted SARS CLpro may possibly form a dimer with a new statedifferent from the fulllength proteinase Biochemical and biophysicalstudies of the dimerization and proteolytic activities of thefulllength

CLpros a farUV CD spectra of the fulllength and Nterminal deleted SARS CLpros at ï½C b thermal induced unfolding monitored at nm with a temperature range from to oC for the fulllength and Nterminal deleted SARS CLpros Protein concentrations used in CD experiments were uM and all protein samples were prepared in mM sodium phosphate pH mM NaCl The enzymatic activity of the two proteins was studied using a novel fluorescent substrate reactant EDANSVN_STLQSGLRKDabcylM which is totally hydrolyzed by papainlike protases This is a short peptide with an amino terminus dansyl fluorophore and a C terminus Dabcyl group which does not fluoresce but can be excited by the excited state dansyl fluorophore which can transfer energy to the Dabcyl group in a nonradiative process but only if it is very close in space to the dansyl group A graph of enzyme activity is shown below Figure Representative fluorescence profiles of hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate by SARS CLpros The fluorogenic substrate at a concentration of uM was incubated with uM fulllength or Nterminal deleted SARS CLpro in mM sodium phosphate pH mM NaCl mM DTT mM EDTA at o C Increase of emission fluorescence intensity at nm wavelength was recorded at min intervals EX nm The emission spectrum was recorded for more than h The initial reaction velocity was determined from the linear portion of the progress curve which corresponded to between and hydrolysis of the substrate The activity of the fulllength SARS CLpro was taken as a Give a molecular explanation of why the fluorescence increases on S cleavage of the substrate b What conclusions can you draw concerning the different activity of S and SN towards the substrate One way to determine if a protein can dimerize is to introduce covalent bonds between adjacent proteins subunits in potential dimer or multimer One such crosslinking reagent is glutaraldehye which is shown below a Draw a mechanism to show how it could react with Lys residues on two adjacent proteins to crosslink them SDSPAGE gels were run for both S and SN and are shown below Fig SDSPAGE acrylamide profiles of glutaraldehyde crosslinked SARS CLpros a crosslinking analyses of the
