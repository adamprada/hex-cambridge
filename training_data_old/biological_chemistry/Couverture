Couverture Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions The usual term for top quality chocolate iscouverture Couverture chocolate is a very highquality chocolate that contains extra cocoa butter The higher percentage of cocoa butter combined with proper tempering gives the chocolate more sheen firmer snap when broken and a creamy mellow flavor Dark milk and white chocolate can all be made as couvertures The total percentage cited on many brands of chocolate is based on some combination of cocoa butter in relation to cocoa liquor In order to be labelled as couverture by European Union regulations the product must contain not less than total dry cocoa solids including not less than cocoa butter and not less than of dry nonfat cocoa solids Couverture is used by professionals for dipping coating moulding and garnishing What the percentages dont tell you is the proportion of cocoa butter to cocoa solids You can however refer to the nutrition label or company information to find the amounts of each All things being equal the chocolate with the higher fat content will be the one with more cocoa butter which contributes to both flavor and mouthfeel This will also typically be the more expensive chocolate because cocoa butter is more valuable than cocoa liquor But keep in mind that just because two chocolates from different manufacturers have the same percentages they are not necessarily equal They could have dramatically differing amounts of cocoa butter and liquor and dissimilar flavors and substituting one for the other can have negative effects for your recipe Determining the amounts of cocoa butter and cocoa liquor will allow you to make informed decisions on chocolate choices Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
