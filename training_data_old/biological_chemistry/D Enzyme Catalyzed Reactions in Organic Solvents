Water Recent ReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objectives explain from a thermodynamic and kinetic framework how enzymes retain activity in nonpolar solvents write chemical equations for transesterification reactions and explain their utility in the study of enzyme activity in nonpolar solvents explain changes in substrate and inhibitor specificity stereo regio and chemo of an enzyme in a nonpolar solvent compared to water In the previous chapter I showed how you could obtain information about the enzyme by changing the substrate pH and the enzyme Why not change the solvent Attempts have been made to do this for the last years First water miscible solvents like ethanol and acetone were added If the water concentration was high enough activity remained Biphasic mixtures were made in which an aqueous solution of an enzyme was emulsified in a water immiscible solvent like chloroform or ethylacetate The substrate would partition into both phases while the product hopefully would end up into the organic phase Nearly nonaqueous solvents were used with a few water at less than the solubility limits of water Finally anhydrous organic solvents water were used It is this later case that is most astonishing since at first glance it is hard to believe that enzymatic activity was retained It is important to realize that in this last case the enzyme is not in solution It is rather in suspension and acts as a heterogeneous catalyst much like palladium acts as a heterogeneous catalyst in the hydrogenation of alkenes The suspension must be mixed vigorously and then sonicated to produce small suspended particles so diffusion of reactants into the enzyme and out is not rate limiting Lets explore the activity of chymotrypsin in a nonpolar solvent Consider the following questions Why arent the enzymes inactive Surely it must seem ridiculous that they arent since as we learned earlier proteins are not that stable A amino acid protein on average is stabilized only about kcalmol over the denatured state or the equivalent of a few H bonds Surely the hydrophobic effect one of the dominant contributors to protein folding and stability would not stabilize the native structure of enzymes in nonpolar organic solvents and the protein would denature It doesnt however Maybe the real question should be not whether water is necessary but rather how much water is necessary The enzyme cant see more than a monolayer or so of water around it The data suggests that the nature of the organic solvent is very important The most hydrophobic solvents are best in terms of their ability to maintain active enzymes Chymotrypsin retains more activity in octane than pyridine see below which is more hydrophilic than octane The more polar the solvent the more it can strip bound water away from the protein If you add water to acetone the bound water increases from to and the activity of chymotrypsin increases fold Chymotrypsin Activity in Organic Solvents Solvent Structure kcatKm Mmin relative ratio kcatKm HO bound to enzyme ww Octane x Toluene x Tetrahydrofuran x Acetone x Pyridine x How active are enzymes in nonpolar solvents Enzymes are often studied in model transesterification reactions Typical reaction conditions are enzyme at mgml with one substrate an ester such as NacteylLPheethyl esterat mM and the other substrate an alcohol such as npropanol instead of being water as in a typical hydrolysis reaction at M The more concentrated alcohol replaces the alcohol ethanol esterified in the ester MichaelisMenten kinetics are followed with biomolecular rate constants of than without the enzyme How much water do the enzymes need molecule of chymotrypsin in octane has molecules of water associated and can demonstrate activity To form a monolayer requires about water molecules Water can be added which presumably leads to more bound water and higher activity How stable are the enzymes Denaturation requires conformational flexibility which apparently requires water The halflife of chymotrypsin in water at C is minutes but in octane at C it is hours At oC the halflife in water is a few days but in octane it is months Remember two things contribute to stability The protein can denature at high temperatures Also since chymotrypsin is a protease it can cleave itself in a autoproteolytic reaction HalfLife of Chymotrypsin Activity in Water and Octane Solvent oC oC oC water minutes few days octane hours months Is the enzyme specificity changed The net binding energy is a function of the binding energy of the substrate the binding energy of the water since water must be displaced from the active site on binding In an anhydrous solvent specificity changes must be expected For chymotyrpsin the driving force for binding of substrates in water is mostly hydrophobic In water the kcatKm for the reaction of NacteylLSeresters is reduced x compared to the Phe ester However in octane chymotrypsin is three times more active toward Ser esters than Phe esters Chymotrypsin Specificity Changes in Water and Octane Substrate solvent HO solvent Octane NacetylLSerester x x NacetylLPheester x x Now consider competitive inhibitors Napthalene binds times more tightly than napthoic acid but in octane the chymotrypsin binds napthoic acid times as tightly Likewise the ratio of kcatKm L isomerkcatKm D isomer of NacetylD or NacetylLAlachloroethyl esters is in water but less than in octane Chymotrypsin Inhibition Constants in Water and Octane Inhibitor Inhibition Constant Ki nM In water In Octane Benzene Benzoic acid Toluene Phenylacetic acid Naphthalene Naphthoic acid Can new reactions be carried out in nonpolar solvents The quick answers is yes since reactions in aqueous solutions can be unfavorable due to low Keqs side reactions or insolubility of reactants Consider lipases which cleave fatty acid esters by hydrolysis in aqueous solutions In nonaqueous solutions reactions such as transesterification or ammonolysis can be performed Enzymes are clearly active in organic solvents which appears to contradict our central concepts of protein stability Two reasons could could explain this stability It is possible that from a thermodynamic view the enzyme is stable in organic solvents However as was discussed above this is inconceivable given the delicate balance of noncovalent and hydrophobic interactions required for protein stability The second reason must win the day the protein is unable to unfold from a kinetic point of view Conformational flexibility is required for denaturation This must require water as the solvent A specific example helps illustrate the effects of different solvents on chymotrypsin activity Dry chymotrypsin can be dissolved in DMSO a water miscible solvent In this solvent it is completely and irreversibly denatured If it is now diluted X with acetone with water no activity is observed In the final dilution the concentrations of solvents are acetone water and DMSO However if dry chymotrypsin was added to a mixture of acetone water and DMSO the enzyme is very active We end up with the same final solvent state but in the first case the enzyme has no activity while in the second case it retains activity Dry enzymes added to a concentrated watermiscible organic solvent like DMSO will dissolve and surely denature but will retain activity when added to a concentrated waterimmiscible solvent like octane in which the enzyme will not dissolve but stay in suspension It appears the enzymes have very restricted conformational mobility in nonpolar solvents By lyophilizing freezedrying the enzyme against a specific ligand a given conformation of a protein can be trapped or literally imprinted onto the enzyme For example if the enzyme is dialyzed against a competitive inhibitor which can be extracted by the organic solvent freezedried to remove water and then added to a nonpolar solvent the enzyme activity of the imprinted enzyme in nonpolar solvents is as much as x as great as when no inhibitor was present during the dialysis If chymotrypsin is lyophilized from solutions of different pHs the resulting curve of VKm for ester hydrolysis in octane is bellshaped with the initial rise in activity reaching halfmaximum activity at a pH of around and a fall in activity reaching halfmaximum at pH of approximately Use of enzymes in organic solvent allows new routes to organic synthesis Enzymes which are so useful in synthetic reactions are stereoselective can differentiate between enantiomers and between prochiral substrates regioselective can differentiate between identical functional groups in a single substrate chemoselective can differentiate between different functional groups in a substrate such as between a hydroxyl group and an amine for an acylation reaction Enzyme in anhydrous organic solvents are useful from a synthetic point not only since new types of reactions can be catalyzed such as transesterification ammonolysis thiolysis but also because the stereoselectivity regioselectivity and chemoselectivity of the enzyme often changes from activities of the enzyme in water Organic Reactions in Water Organic reactions are usually conducted in organic solvents since many organic molecules react with water and the reagents and products are usually not soluble in water In a manner analogous to using an enzyme as a heterogeneous catalyst in nonpolar solvent Sharpless is pioneering a technique to conduct organic reactions in water They Narayan et al have shown that many unimolecular and bimolecular reactions occur faster in water than in organic solvents As in enzyme catalysis in nonpolar solvent the reactions must be mixed vigorously to disperse reactants in microdrops a suspension in water greatly increasing the surface area that might allow water to act on transition states or intermediates to stabilize them through hydrogen bonding They called these reactions on water reactions since reactants usually float on water They have performed cycloadditions alkene reactions Claisen rearrangments and nucleophilic substitution reactions using this process One cycloaddition reaction went to completion in ten minutes at room temperature compared to hours in methanol and in toluene Adding nonpolar solvent at certain times greatly increased the rate of the reaction Recent References Klijn J and Engberts J Organic chemistry Fast reactions on water Nature June doia Narayan S et al Angew Chem Intl Edn Klibanov Improving enzymes by using them in organic
