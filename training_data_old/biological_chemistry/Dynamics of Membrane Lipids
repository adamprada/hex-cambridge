Dynamics of Membrane Lipids Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Henry JakubowskiProfessor Chemistry at College of St BenedictSt Johns University Contributors and Attributions Learning Objectives state the different kinds of dynamical motions of double chain amphiphiles in lipid bilayers differentiating between motion of entire molecules and motion within a molecule describe experiments that could be used to study lateral and flipflop diffusion in vitro and in vivo explain the use of exogenous labels fluorescent radioactive electron spin resonance that allow laboratory determination of lipid location and movement explain similarities and differences in measurement and explanations of phase transitions in water and in lipid vesicle explain the biological effects and necessities of membrane dynamics C Dynamics of MembranesMolecules are not static but rather are dynamic This also applies to molecular aggregates In the first part of the section we will discuss the rigid movement of whole lipid molecules in a bilayer within a leaftlet and between leaflets In the second part and the following supplement we will consider the movement of atoms within a molecule The movements include motions like bond bending bond stretching and torsion angle changes like we saw in the previous chapter section on the conformatiC Lipid Distribution in CellsC Lipid RaftsCertain lipids often cluster within a leaftlet to form lipid rafts which can be considered to result from a lateral phase separation of the lipids within one leaflet of the bilayer Rafts also appear to be enriched in cholesterol and lipids with saturated fatty acids especially sphingolipids which would lead to regions of enhanced packing and reduced fluidity Cholesterol would stabilize packing in spaces created with lipids with large head groupsC Lipid Conformational TransitionsC Membrane PermeabilityC General Links and ReferencesMolecular Mechanics and DynamicsA Introduction to Molecular Mechanics and Molecular DynamicsB Energy E Force F and MotionC Molecular MechanicsD Bonded Interaction EnergyE NonBonded Interaction EnergyF Summary InteractionsG Molecular DynamicsH Links and ReferenceThermodynamics ReviewA Reactions and Energy ChangesB Equilibrium ConstantsC Change in Free Energy GD The System Surroundings and the Universe Laws of ThermodynamicsE Summary Contributors and Attributions Prof Henry Jakubowski College of St BenedictSt Johns University
