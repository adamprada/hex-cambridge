Egg Products Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions A number of egg products besides whole shell eggs are used in the baking and food service industry By law all egg products other than shell eggs are pasteurized to protect them against salmonella and the low temperature at which they are kept inhibits bacterial activity although under certain conditions they may spoil very rapidly The chief categories of egg products available are Liquid eggs whole eggs and whole eggs with additional yolks Frozen eggs whole eggs egg whites and egg yolks Dried and powdered eggs whole eggs egg whites and meringue powder Liquid and Frozen Eggs Liquid and frozen whole eggs are preferred in large bakeries where cracking and emptying of shells is not economical They are also one of the most economical ways of purchasing eggs Liquid and frozen whole eggs are sometimes fortified by the addition of egg yolks Some bakers feel that liquid or frozen eggs dont yield the same volume in sponge cakes as fresh eggs and there is a certain bias in favor of shell eggs If stored in the freezer at C F or lower liquid and frozen eggs will keep for long periods with minimum loss of quality Thawing should take place in the refrigerator or under cold water without submerging the container Leaving frozen eggs at room temperature to thaw is a bad practice because the outside layers of egg can reach a temperature favorable to bacteria while the centre is still frozen Heat should never be used to defrost eggs Unused portions must be refrigerated and used within hours Frozen egg yolks consist of egg yolks and sugar to prevent the yolk from gelling and to avoid separation of the fat SprayDried Whole Eggs and Egg Whites Dried eggs are used by some bakers as a convenience and cost saver As with frozen eggs some bakers doubt their performance in products such as sponge cakes But dried eggs produce satisfactory results because of the addition of a carbohydrate to the egg before the drying process usually corn syrup which results in foaming comparable to fresh eggs Dried whole eggs should be stored unopened in a cool place not over C F preferably in the refrigerator They are reconstituted by blending kg lb of powdered whole egg with kg lb of cold water The water is added slowly while mixing Once reconstituted dried eggs should be used immediately or refrigerated promptly and used within an hour In mixes such as muffins and cake doughnuts dried eggs can be mixed in with the other dry ingredients and do not have to be reconstituted In layer cake formulas dried eggs are blended with the other dry ingredients before the fat and some water are added followed by the balance of liquid in two stages Spraydried egg whites are reconstituted by mixing kg lb of powdered egg white with kg lb of cold water letting it stand for minutes and then adding kg lb of cold water When used in cake mixes the powdered egg white is blended with the other dry ingredients but only L qt of cold water is used for every kg lb of powdered egg white Chemistry of Cooking Dry Egg Substitutes or Replacements Egg substitutes are made from sweet cheese whey egg whites dextrose modified tapioca starch sodium caseinate and artificial color and flavor They are costcutters and can be used alone or in combination with fresh or dried eggs in cakes cookies and fillings One kg lb of powder is mixed with kg lb of water to replace powdered eggs Meringue Powder While it is not a pure dehydrated egg white meringue powder is widely used by bakers to make baked Alaska royal icing and toppings It contains vegetable gums and starches to absorb moisture and make it whip better Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
