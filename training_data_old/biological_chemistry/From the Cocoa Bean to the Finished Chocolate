From the Cocoa Bean to the Finished Chocolate Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions In North America chocolate manufacturing started in Massachusetts in Today in the factory the beans get cleaned and magnets take out metallic parts and then sand dust and other impurities are removed Some starch will be changed into dextrins in the roasting process to improve flavor Machines break the beans and grind them fine until a flowing liquid is produced called chocolate liquor Through hydraulic pressure cocoa butter is reduced from to approximately to or less and the residue forms a solid mass called press cake The press cake is then broken pulverized cooled and sifted to produce commercial cocoa powder The baking industry uses primarily cocoa powders with a low fat content At the factory chocolate is also subject to an additional refining step calcleodnching Conching has a smoothing effect The temperature range in this process is between C and C F and F Sugar interacts with protein to form amino sugars and the paste losesacids and moisture and becomes smoother This video explains the chemical reactions related to heat melting point and formation of crystal structures in sciencegovobjvideodstrychocolate Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
