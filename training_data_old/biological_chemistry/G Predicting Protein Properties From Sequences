G Predicting Protein Properties From Sequences Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Henry JakubowskiProfessor Chemistry at College of St BenedictSt Johns University Contributors and Attributions Learning Objectives find web based proteomics protein to analyze protein sequences and structures describe the basis for methods used to predict the secondary structure and hydrophobic structures of proteins analyze secondary structure and hydropathy plots from webbased proteomics programs describe differences between integral and peripheral membranes proteins and how each could be purified explain how hydropathy and secondary structure plots can be used to predict membrane spanning sequences of proteins describe in general the theoretical and empirically based methods to predict protein tertiary structure from a primary sequence describe possible early intermediates in protein folding as determined by theoretical methods Topic hierarchy Thumbnail Structure of human hemoglobin The proteins α and β subunits are in red and blue and the ironcontaining heme groups in green From PDB GZX GNU Proteopedia Hemoglobin Contributors and Attributions Prof Henry Jakubowski College of St BenedictSt Johns University
