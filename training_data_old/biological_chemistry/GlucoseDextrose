GlucoseDextrose Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions The sugar known as glucose has two origins In a natural form in most fruits In a processed form from corn corn syrup In baking we usually refer to industrially made glucose It is made from corn and the resulting product a thick syrup is then adjusted to a uniform viscosity or consistency The particular form of the syrup is defined by what is known as the dextrose equivalent or DE for short Corn syrup is the most familiar form of glucose In plant baking highfructose corn syrup HFCS is the major sweetening agent in bread and buns It consists of roughly half fructose and half dextrose Dextrose chemically identical to glucose is available in crystalline form and has certain advantages over sucrose It is easily fermentable It contributes to browning in bread and bun making In crystalline form it is often used in doughnut sugars as it is more inclined to stay dry and non greasy It is hygroscopic and valued as a moistureretaining ingredient It retards crystallization in syrups candies and fondant Corn syrup is made from the starch of maize corn and contains varying amounts of glucose and maltose depending on the processing methods Corn syrup is used in foods to soften texture add volume prevent crystallization of sugar and enhance flavor Glucosedextrose has a sweetening level of approximately threequarters that of sugar Table shows the amount of corn syrup or HFCS needed to replace sugar in a formula Table Replacement factor for Corn Syrup and HighFructose Corn Syrup Type of Sugar Solids Replacement Factor Granulated sugar Regular corn syrup Highfructose corn syrup Glucose HFCS and corn syrup are not appropriate substitutions for sucrose in all bakery products Certain types of cakes such as white layer cakes will brown too much if glucose or HFCS is used in place of sugar Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
