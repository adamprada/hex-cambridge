No headers This page contains assessmentexam questions using data figures and graphs from research journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry which allow their use or from journals such as from PLOS that are completely open access The papers and topics chosen were selected to assess student understanding of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ASBMB foundational concepts and learning objectives as well as MCAT foundational concepts and objectives These two sets of standards broadly overlap Both ASBMB and the MCAT strongly emphasis scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are perhaps best assessed by openended questions derived from the literature in which students must employ higher level Bloom skills of application and analysis These questions can also be used by students who seek more opportunities to practice interpreting research literature results The ability to apply analyze and evaluate information and concepts are at the heart of scientific inquiry and reasoning skills which are central to the new ASBMB and MCAT competency standards The questions in this learning module are designed to assess these competencies using openended responses instead of multiplechoice questions Answers can be found at the link at the bottom of this page Research Paper A Novel Speciesspecific Class of Uncompetitive Inhibitors of gammaGlutamyl Transpeptidase Jarrod B King Matthew B West Paul F Cook and Marie H Hanigan J Biol Chem NO pp April From Abstract Expression of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase GGT in tumors contributes to resistance to radiation and chemotherapy GGT is inhibited by glutamine analogues that compete with the sub strate for the gamma glutamyl binding site However the glutamine analogues that have been evaluated in clinical trials are too toxic for use in humans We have used high throughput screening to evaluate small molecules for their ability to inhibit GGT and have identified a novel class of inhibitors that are not glutamine analogues The enzyme γglutamyl transpeptidase GGT which is localized to the cell surface cleaves the γglutamyl amide bond of extracellular glutathione right and transfers the γglutamyl group to an acceptor substrate a A compound OU was discovered that inhibited the enzyme Shown are the structure of OU left and substrate velocity curves right for the inhibition of human kidney GGT by μm and various concentration of OU μm next curve down then μm μm and μm in the presence of mm glygly From inspection of the graph do you think the inhibition is competitive Explain b b For the reaction of Lglutamic acid γnitroanilide HCl GpNA and mm glycylglycine glygly acceptor draw the products of the reaction c What wavelength would you choose to monitor the course of the reaction _______ nm d The mechanism seems to involve a covalent intermediate of the substrate with the enzyme through an N terminal Thr This threonine is conserved in human rat mouse and pig Draw a mechanism showing the initial reaction of glutathione abbreviated structure shown below with the N terminal Thr and then in the subsequent reaction with the acceptor GlyGly represented in your diagram as RNH e Sitedirected mutagenesis of human GGT has identified four additional amino acids that are essential to GGT activity Arg Asp Ser and Ser All four of these amino acids are identical in human rat mouse and pig Which amino acid might likely be found at a _____ Which amino acid might likely be found at b _____ What type of catalytic mechanism best describes the role of Thr _____ What type of catalytic mechanism best describes the role of Ser and f Complete the Cleland diagram below to show the likely kinetic mechanism based on your answers from above A GPNA B GlyGly What are P and Q g g Kinetic analyses of GGT inhibition by OU are shown in the graphs to the right Shown are double reciprocal plots of the initial velocities of human kidney GGT at varying GpNA A and GlyGly B in the presence of mm glygly left or mm GpNA right with the following different fixed amounts of inhibitor OU μm μm μm μm and μm What types of inhibition are show in Graph A Graph B Kinetic Analysis of GGT inhibition by OU AD double reciprocal plots of the initial velocities of human kidney GGT A and B in the presence of mm glygly A or mm GpNA B with μm μm μm μm and μm OU curves move upward with increasing inhibitor Data shown are average of triplicate values SD For many points the error bars are smaller than the symbol h In multisubstrate reaction the following effects of deadend inhibitors I are observed Slope changes when I and S bind to the same form of the enzyme OR I binds to a form of E on the horizontal line which is connected to the form that S binds and I binds first for example I binds to E and then S binds Y Intercept changes when I and S bind to different forms of the enzyme unless I binds first and the binding of I and S are in rapid equilibrium Complete the following with the word same or different based on your previous answers and knowledge OU binds to a the ____________ form of enzyme as GpNA OU binds to a the ____________ form of enzyme as GlyGly i Under what conditions do uncompetitive inhibitors lead to more inhibition in vivo than competitive inhibition one phrase j The plain old amino acid serine was added to the enzyme What type of inhibitor might it be ________ Show this by positioning Ser into the active site cartoon cartoon diagram below k A Serborate complex right is a much more effective inhibitor From your knowledge of how enzymes catalyze chemical reactions explain why in a single phrase k Site specific mutagenesis was performed to see how changing specific serines S would affect activity WT wildtype unmutated control The following mutants denoted as SX where X is the new amino acid blacked out in the table below were made Which amino acid would the investigators choose to replace Ser in the mutants ________ m Only one kinetic parameter is significantly changed think of the changes on the parameters What step in catalysis is affected in the mutants Answers Literature Learning Module Transpeptidase
