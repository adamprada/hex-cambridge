DH and DS at a given temperature for the N to D transition HOW TO CALCULATE DGO FOR FROM PROTEIN DENATURATION CURVES Multiple methods can be used to investigate the denaturation of a protein These include UV fluorescence CD and viscosity measurement In all these methods the dependent variable y is measured as a function of the independent variable which is often temperature for thermal denaturation curves or denaturant such as urea guanidine hydrochloride concentration From these curves we would like to calculate the standard free energy of unfolding DGO for the protein for the reaction The denaturation curves usually show a sigmoidal cooperative transition from the native to the denatured state The dependent variable can also be normalized to show fractional denaturation fD An idealized example of an experimental denaturation curve is shown in the figure below Figure DENATURATION CURVE FOR PROTEINS A more realistic denaturation curve might show a linear change in the values of the dependent variable fluorescence intensity for example for values of temperature or denaturant concentration well below that at which the protein starts to unfold or above that at which it is unfolded In these cases the mathematical analysis presented below is a bit more complicated For each curve the value of y either A Fluorescence intensity viscosity etc can be thought of as the sum contributed by the native state and from the denatured state which are present in different fractional concentrations from Hence the following equation should be reasonably intuitive where fN is the fraction native and yN is the contribution to the dependent variable y from the native state and fD is the fraction denatured and yD is the contribution to the dependent variable y from the denatured state Conservation give equation Substituting into gives Rearranging this equation gives Notice the right hand side of the equations contains variables that are easily measured By substituting and into the expression for the equilibrium constant for the reaction we get or and Remember that DGOand hence Keq depends only on the intrinsic stability of the native vs denatured state for a given set of conditions They vary as a function of temperature and solvent conditions At low temperature and low ureaguanidine HCl concentration the native state is favored and for the transition DGO ie denaturation is NOT favored At high temperature and ureaguanidine HCl concentration the denatured state is favored and DGO At some value of temperature or ureaguanidine concentration both the native and denatured state would be equally favored At this point Keq and DGO If temperature is the denaturing agent the temperature at this point is called the melting point Tm of the protein which is analogous to the Tm in the heat capacity vs temperature graphs for the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles Figure gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles Figure gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of phospholipid vesicles Ordinarily at a temperature much below the Tm for the protein or at a low urea concentration so little of the protein would be in the D state that it would be extremely difficult to determine the concentration of the protein in the D state Hence it would be difficult to determine the Keq or DGo for the reaction However in the range where the protein denatures either with urea or increasing temperature it is possible to measure fDfNand hence D Go at each urea or temperature Denaturation with chemical perturbants such as urea Calculation of DGo for in the absence of urea A plot of DGo vs urea is linear and given by the following equation which should be evident from the beginning figure in this section b DGD DGDwo urea murea Although it is nice to know the Keq and DG for the transition in the presence of various urea concentrations it would be even more useful to determine those parameters in the absence of urea that is under physiological conditions A comparison of the calculated values of DG in the absence of urea for a series of similar proteins such as those varying by a single amino acid prepared by sitespecific mutagenesis of the normal or wildtype gene would indicate how the mutants were stabilized or destabilized compared to the wildtype protein In experimental cases in which the denaturant is a substance such as urea or guanidine HCl the DGD for the protein in the absence of denaturant ie in water can be determined by extrapolating the straight line to urea Admittedly this is a long extrapolation but with high quality data and a high correlation coefficient for the linear regression analysis of the bestfit line reasonable values can be obtained Denaturation with heat Calculation of DHo and DSo for at room temperature Keq values can be calculated from thermal denaturation curves in the same way as described above using urea as a denaturant by monitoring change in an observable spectra signal for example vs temperature Knowing Keq denoted KD below since at the moment my program wont allow me to change it and DH DS can be calculated from equation below as a semilog plot of lnKeq vs T is a straight line with a slope of DHR and a y intercept of DSR or Hence from Equations and is should be evident that all the major thermodynamics constants DG DH and DS for the transition can be calculated from thermal denaturation curves Equation shows that the derivative of equation with respect to T ie the slope of equation plotted as lnKD vs T is indeed DHR Equation is the van t Hoff equation and the calculated value of the enthalpy change is termed the van t Hoff enthalpy DHvHoff Equation calculates the derivative of lnKeq with respect to T instead of T This method assumes that the denaturation is cooperative no intermediates and that DH is independent of temperature over the narrow range of temperature in which the protein cooperatively unfolds This equation will be useful later when we compare the enthalpies calculated using the van t Hoff equation with those determined directly using differential scanning calorimetry by analyzing a plot of Cp vs T Note that the area under the Cp vs T curve as the protein transitions to the unfolded state has units of kcal The DH for the unfolding is inversely proportional to the width of the curve In contrast to the long extrapolation of the DG vs urea to urea to get DG the y intercept in the absence of urea which has some physical meaning extrapolation of the straight line from the van t Hoff plot from equation to get DSR the y intercept has little meaning since the T value at the y intercept is which occurs when T approaches infinity DS can be calculated at any reasonable temperature from the the calculated value of DG at that temperature and the calculated DHvHoff Thumbnail Structure of human hemoglobin The proteins α and β
