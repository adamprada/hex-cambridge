Milk Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Homogenized milkis fresh milk in which the fat particles are so finely divided and emulsified mechanically that the milk fat cannot separate on standing The milk fat is forced into tiny droplets As soon as the droplets form milk proteins and emulsifiers form a protective film around each one preventing the fat from reuniting The tiny droplets stay suspended indefinitely and milk fat no longer separates and rises to the top as a cream layer In other words homogenized dairy products are stable emulsions of fat droplets suspended in milk It is also said that homogenized milk is more readily digestible Pasteurization of milk was developed in by the French chemist Louis Pasteur One method of pasteurization is to heat milk to above C F maintain it at this temperature for a set time then cool it immediately to C F or lower This kills all harmful bacteria that carry the potential threat of bovine tuberculosis and fever from cows to humans The two main types of pasteurization used today are hightemperature shorttime HTST also known as flash and higherheat shorter time HHST Ultrahightemperature UHT processing is also used Hightemperature shorttime HTST pasteurization is done by heating milk to C F for seconds Milk simply labelled pasteurized is usually treated with the HTST method Higherheat shorter time HHST milk and milk products are pasteurized by applying heat continuously generally above C F for such time to extend the shelf life of the product under refrigerated conditions This type of heat process can be used to produce dairy products with extended shelf life ESL Ultrahightemperature UHT processing holds the milk at a temperature of C F for four seconds During UHT processing milk is sterilized rather than pasteurized This process allows milk or juice to be stored several months without refrigeration The process is achieved by spraying the milk or juice through a nozzle into a chamber that is filled with hightemperature steam under pressure After the temperature reaches C F the fluid is cooled instantly in a vacuum chamber and packed in a presterilized airtight container Milk labelled UHT has been treated in this way For more information on pasteurization visit the International Dairy Foods Association Attribution Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
