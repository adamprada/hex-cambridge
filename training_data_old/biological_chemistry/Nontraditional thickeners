new ways to thicken sauces and to change the texture of liquids Some of these thickening agents work without heating and are simply blended with the cold liquid such as modiﬁed starch or xanthan gum These allow the creation of sauces and other liquids with a fresh uncooked taste Foams froths and bubbles Liquids can be stabilized with gelatin lecithin and other ingredients and then used to create foams by whipping or using a special dispenser charged with nitrogen gas A wellmade foam adds an additional ﬂavor dimension to the dish without adding bulk and an interesting texture as the foamdissolves in the mouth Figure Figure Dinner in the Dark Dessert by Esther Little is licensed under CC BY SA Espuma Espuma is the Spanish term for froth or foam and it is created with the use of a siphon ISO bottle This is a speciﬁc term since culinary foams may be attained through other means Espuma from a siphon creates foam without the use of an emulsifying agent such as egg As a result it oﬀers an unadulterated ﬂavor of the ingredients used It also introduces much more air into a preparation compared to other culinary aerating processes Espuma is created mainly with liquid that has air incorporated in it to create froth But solid ingredients can be used too these can be liqueﬁed by cooking puréeing and extracting natural juices It should be noted though that the best ﬂavors to work with are those that are naturally diluted Otherwise the espuma tends to lose its ﬂavor as air is introduced into it Stabilizers may be used alongside the liquids to help retain their shape longer however this is not always necessary Prepared liquids can also be stored in a siphon bottle and kept for use The pressure from the bottle will push out the aerated liquid producing the espuma Foam Foam is created by trapping air within a solid or liquid substance Although culinary foams are most recently associated with molecular gastronomy they are part of many culinary preparations that date back to even earlier times Mousse souﬄé whipped cream and froth in cappuccino are just some examples of common foams Common examples of set foams are bread pancakes and muﬃns Foam does not rely on pressure to encase air bubbles into a substance Like espuma foam may also be created with the help of a surfactant and gelling or thickening agents to help it hold shape The production of a culinary foam starts with a liquid or a solid that has been puréed The thickening or gelling agent is then diluted into this to form a solution Once dissolved the solution is whipped to introduce air into it The process of whipping is done until the foam has reached the desired stiﬀness Note that certain ingredients may break down if they are whipped for too long especially without the presence of a stabilizing agent Gels Turning a liquid such as a vegetable juice or raspberry purée into a solid not only gives it a diﬀerent texture but also allows the food to be cut into many shapes enabling diﬀerent visual presentations Figure Regular gelatin can be used as well as other gelling agents such as agar agar which is derived from red algae Figure Papayagelee by hedonistin is licensed under CC BY NC Brittle gels Gelling agents are often associated with jellylike textures which may range from soft to ﬁrm However certain gels produced by speciﬁc agents may not ﬁt this description Rather than forming an elastic or pliable substance brittle gels may also be formed These are gels that are ﬁrm in nature yet fragile at the same time This characteristic is caused by the formation of a gel network that is weak and susceptible to breaking This property allows brittle gels to crumble in the mouth and create a meltinthemouth feeling As a result new sensations and textures are experienced while dining At the same time tastes within a dish are also enhanced due to the ﬂavour release caused by the gel breakdownBrittle gels are made by diluting the gelling agent into a liquid substance such as water milk or a stock This mixture is left to set to attain a gelled end product It should be noted that the concentration of gelling agents used as well as the amount of liquid both aﬀect gelation Agar agar is a common agent used to create brittle gels However when combined with sugar it tends to create a more elastic substance Lowacyl gellan gum locust bean gum and carrageenan also create brittle gels Fluid gels A ﬂuid gel is a cross between a sauce gel and purée It is a controlled liquid that has properties of all three preparations A ﬂuid gel displays viscosity and ﬂuidity at the same time being thick yet still spreadable Fluid gels behave as solids when undisturbed and ﬂow when exposed to suﬃcient agitation They are used in many culinary dishes where ﬂuids need to be controlled and they provide a rich creamy texture A ﬂuid gel is created using a base liquid that can come from many diﬀerent sources The base liquid is commonly extracted from fruits and vegetables taken from stocks or even puréed from certain ingredients The longer the substance is exposed to stress and the more intense the outside stress the more ﬂuidity is gained More ﬂuidity causes a ﬁner consistency in the gel Fluid gels can be served either hot or cold as many of the gelling agents used for such preparations are stable at high temperatures Drying and powdering Drying a food intensiﬁes its ﬂavour and of course changes its texture Eating a piece of apple that has been cooked and then dehydrated until crisp is very diﬀerent from eating a fresh fruit slice If the dehydrated food is powdered it becomes yet another ﬂavour and texture experience When maltodextrin or tapioca maltodextrin is mixed with fat it changes to a powder Because maltodextrin dissolves in water peanut butter or olive oil that has been changed to a powder changes back to an oil in the mouth Freezing In molecular gastronomy liquid nitrogen is often used to freeze products or to create a frozen item without the use of a freezer Liquid nitrogen is the element nitrogen in a liqueﬁed state It is a clear colourless liquid with a temperature of C F It is classiﬁed as a cryogenic ﬂuid which causes rapid freezing when it comes into contact with living tissues The extremely cold temperatures provided by this liqueﬁed gas are most often used in modern cuisine to produce frozen foams and ice cream After freezing food nitrogen boils away creating a thick nitrogen fog that may also add to the aesthetic features of a dish Given the extreme temperature of liquid nitrogen it must be handled with care Mishandling may cause serious burns to the skin Nitrogen must be stored in special ﬂasks and handled only by trained people Aprons gloves and other specially designed safety gear should be used when handling liquid nitrogen Used mainly in the form of a coolant for molecular gastronomy liquid nitrogen is not ingested It is poured directly onto the food that needs to be cooled causing it to freeze Any remaining nitrogen evaporates although suﬃcient time must be provided to allow the liqueﬁed gas to be eliminated and for the dish to warm up to the point that it will not cause damage during consumption Spheriﬁcation Spheriﬁcation is a modern cuisine technique that involves creating semisolid spheres with thin membranes out of liquids Spheres can be made in various sizes and of various ﬁrmnesses such as the caviar shown in Figure The result is a burstinthemouth eﬀect achieved with the liquid Both ﬂavour and texture are enhanced with this culinary technique There are two versions of the spheriﬁcation process direct and reverse In direct spheriﬁcation a ﬂavoured liquid containing either sodium alginate gellan gum or carrageenan is dripped into a water bath that is mixed with calcium either calcium chloride or calcium lactate The outer layer is induced by calcium to form a thin gel layer leaving a liquid centre In this version the spheres are easily breakable and should be consumed immediately Calcium chloride and sodium alginate are the two basic components used for this technique Calcium chloride is a type of salt used in cheese making and sodium alginate is taken from seaweed The sodium alginate is used to gel the chosen liquid by dissolving it directly into the ﬂuid This causes the liquid to become sticky and proper dissolving must be done by mixing The liquid is then left to set to eliminate any bubbles Once ready a bath is prepared with calcium chloride and water The liquid is then dripped into the bath using a spoon or syringe depending on the desired sphere size The gel forms a membrane encasing the liquid when it comes into contact with the calcium chloride Once set the spheres are then removed and rinsed with water to remove any excess calcium chloride In reverse spheriﬁcation a calciumcontaining liquid or ingredients mixed with a soluble calcium salt is dripped into a setting bath containing sodium alginate Surface tension causes the drop to become spherical A skin of calcium alginate immediately forms around the top Unlike in the direct version the gelling stops and does not continue into the liquid orb This results in thicker shells so the products do not have to be consumed immediately Figure White chocolate spaghetti with raspberry sauce and chocolate martini caviar by ayngelina is licensed under CC BY NCND Videos on spheriﬁcation Direct httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvBeRMBvgLk Reverse httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvJPNoUyI Specialty ingredients used in molecular gastronomy There are a number of diﬀerent ingredients used in molecular gastronomy as gelling thickening or emulsifying agents Many of these are available in specialty food stores or can be ordered online Algin Another name for sodium alginate algin is a natural gelling agent taken from the cell walls of certain brown seaweed species Calcium chloride Calcium chloride also known as CaCl is a compound of chlorine and calcium that is a byproduct of sodium bicarbonate baking soda manufacturing At room temperature it is a solid salt which is easily dissolved in water This is very salty and is often used for preservation pickling cheese production and adding taste without increasing the amount of sodium It is also used in molecular gastronomy in the spheriﬁcation technique see above for the production of ravioli spheres pearls and caviar Figure Calcium lactate Calcium lactate is a calcium salt resulting from the fermentation of lactic acid and calcium It is a white crystalline power when solid and is highly soluble in cold liquids It is commonly used as a calcium fortiﬁer in various food products including beverages and supplements Calcium lactate is also used to regulate acidity levels in cheese and baking powder as a food thickener and as a preservative for fresh fruits In molecular gastronomy it is most commonly used for basic spheriﬁcation and reverse spheriﬁcation due to the lack of bitterness in the ﬁnished products Like calcium chloride calcium lactate is used alongside sodium alginate In regular spheriﬁcation it is used in the bath It is also used as a thickener in reverse spheriﬁcation Carob bean gum Carob bean gum is another name for locust bean gum It is often used to stabilize texturize thicken and gel liquids in the area of modern cuisine although it has been a popular thickener and stabilizer for many years Carrageenan Carrageenan refers to any linear sulfated polysaccharide taken from the extracts of red algae This seaweed derivative is classiﬁed mainly as iota kappa and lambda It is a common ingredient in many foods There are a number of purposes that it serves including binding thickening stabilizing gelling and emulsifying Carrageenan can be found in ice cream salad dressings cheese puddings and many more foods It is often used with dairy products because of its good interaction with milk proteins Carrageenan also works well with other common kitchen ingredients and oﬀers a smooth texture and taste that blends well and does not aﬀect ﬂavour More often than not carrageenan is found in powder form which is hydrated in liquid before being used For best results carrageenan powder should be sprinkled in cold liquid and blended well to dissolve although it may also be melted directly in hot liquids Citric acid Classiﬁed as a weak organic acid citric acid is a naturally occurring preservative that can be found in citrus fruits Produced as a result of the fermentation of sugar it has a tart to bitter taste and is usually in powder form when sold commercially It is used mainly as a preservative and acidulent and it is a common food additive in a wide range of foods such as candies and soda Other than extending shelf life by adjusting the acidity or pH of food it can also help enhance ﬂavours It works especially well with other fruits providing a fresh taste In modern cooking citric acid is often used as an emulsiﬁer to keep fats and liquids from separating It is also a common component in spheriﬁcation where it may be used as an acid buﬀer Gellan gum Gellan gum is a watersoluble highmolecularweight polysaccharide gum that is produced through the fermentation of carbohydrates in algae by the bacterium Pseudomonas elodea This fermented carbohydrate is puriﬁed with isopropyl alcohol then dried and milled to produce a powder Gellan gum is used as a stabilizer emulsiﬁer thickener and gelling agent in cooking Aspics and terrines are only some of the dishes that use gellan It comes in both highacyl and lowacyl forms Highacyl gellan gum produces a ﬂexible elastic gel while lowacyl gellan gum will give way to a more brittle gel Like many other hydrocolloids gellan gum is used with liquids The powder is normally dispersed in the chosen liquid to dissolve it Once dissolved the solution is then heated to facilitate liquid absorption and gelling by the hydrocolloid A temperature between C and C F and F will start the dissolution process Gelling will begin upon cooling around C and C F and F Gellan gum creates a thermoirreversible gel and can withstand high heat without reversing in form This makes it ideal for the creation of warm gels Guar gum Guar gum or guaran is a carbohydrate This galactomannan is taken from the seeds of the guar plant by dehusking milling and screening The end product is a pale oﬀwhite loose powder It is most commonly used as a thickening agent and stabilizer for sauces and dressings in the food industry Baked goods such as bread may also use guar gum to increase the amount of soluble ﬁbre At the same time it also aids with moisture retention in bread and other baked items Being a derivative of a legume guar gum is considered to be vegan and a good alternative to starches In modern cuisine guar gum is used for the creation of foams from acidic liquids for ﬂuid gels and for stabilizing foams Guar gum must ﬁrst be dissolved in cold liquid The higher the percentage of guar gum used the more viscous the liquid will become Dosage may also vary according to the ingredients used as well as desired results and temperature Iota carrageenan Iota carrageenan is a hydrocolloid taken from red seaweed Eucheuma denticulatum It is one of three varieties of carrageenan and is used mainly as a thickening or gelling agent Gels produced from iota carrageenan are soft and ﬂexible especially when used with calcium salts It produces a clear gel that exhibits little syneresis Iota is a fastsetting gel that is thermoreversible and remains stable through freezing and thawing In modern cuisine it is used to create hot foams as well as custards and jellies with a creamy texture Like most other hydrocolloids iota carrageenan must ﬁrst be dispersed and hydrated in liquid before use Unlike lambda carrageenan it is best dispersed in cold liquid Once hydrated the solution must be heated to about C F with shear to facilitate dissolution Gelling will happen between C and C F and F depending on the number of calcium ions present Kappa carrageenan Kappa carrageenan is another type of red seaweed extract taken speciﬁcally from Kappaphycus alvarezii Like other types of carrageenan it is used as a gelling thickening and stabilizing agent When mixed with water kappa carrageenan creates a strong and ﬁrm solid gel that may be brittle in texture This particular variety of carrageenan blends well with milk and other dairy products Since it is taken from seaweed it is considered to be vegan and is an alternative to traditional gelling agents such as gelatin Kappa carrageenan is used in various cooking preparations including hot and cold gels jelly toppings cakes breads and pastries When used in molecular gastronomy preparations and other dishes kappa carrageenan should be dissolved in cold liquid Once dispersed the solution must be heated between C and C F and F Gelling will begin between C and C F and F Kappa carrageenan is a thermoreversible gel and will stay stable up to C F Temperatures beyond this will cause the gel to melt and become liquid once again Locust bean gum Locust bean gum also known as LBG and carob bean gum is a vegetable gum derived from Mediterraneanregion carob tree seeds This hydrocolloid is used to stabilize texturize thicken and gel liquids in modern cuisine although it has been a popular thickener and stabilizer for many years It has a neutral taste that does not aﬀect the ﬂavour of food that it is combined with It also provides a creamy mouth feel and has reduced syneresis when used alongside pectin or carrageenan for dairy and fruit applications The neutral behaviour of this hydrocolloid makes it ideal for use with a wide range of ingredients To use locust bean gum it must be dissolved in liquid It is soluble with both hot and cold liquids Maltodextrin Maltodextrin is a sweet polysaccharide that is produced from starch corn wheat tapioca or potato through partial hydrolysis and spray drying This modiﬁed food starch is a white powder that has the capacity to absorb and hold water as well as oil It is an ideal additive since it has fewer calories than sugar and is easily absorbed and digested by the body in the form of glucose Coming from a natural source it ranges from nearly ﬂavourless to fairly sweet without any odour Maltodextrin is a common ingredient in processed foods such as soda and candies In molecular gastronomy it can be used both as a thickener and a stabilizer for sauces and dressings for encapsulation and as a sweetener In many cases it is also used as an aroma carrier due to its capacity to absorb oil It is also often used to make powders or pastes out of fat Sodium alginate Sodium alginate which is also called algin is a natural gelling agent taken from the cell walls of certain brown seaweed species This salt is obtained by drying the seaweed followed by cleaning boiling gelling and pulverizing it A light yellow powder is produced from the process When dissolved in liquids sodium alginate acts as a thickener creating a viscous ﬂuid Conversely when it is used with calcium it forms a gel through a cold process In molecular gastronomy sodium alginate is most commonly used as a texturizing agent Foams and sauces may be created with it It is also used in spheriﬁcation for the creation of pearls raviolis mock caviar marbles and spheres Sodium alginate can be used directly by dissolving it into the liquid that needs to be gelled as in the case of basic spheriﬁcation It may also be used inversely by adding it directly to a bath as in the case of reverse spheriﬁcation This versatile product is soluble in both hot and cold liquids and gels made with it will set at any temperature Soy lecithin Soy lecithin also called just lecithin is a natural emulsiﬁer that comes from fatty substances found in plant tissues It is derived from soybeans either mechanically or chemically and is a byproduct of soybean oil creation The end product is a light brown powder that has low water solubility As an emulsiﬁer it works to blend immiscible ingredients together such as oil and water giving way to stable preparations It can be whisked directly into the liquid of choice Soy lecithin is also used in creating foams airs mousses and other aerated dishes that are long lasting and full of ﬂavour It is used in pastries confections and chocolate to enhance dough and increase moisture tolerance As with most ingredients dosage and concentration for soy lecithin will depend on the ingredients used speciﬁc properties desired in the resulting preparation as well as other conditions Tapioca maltodextrin Tapioca maltodextrin is a form of maltodextrin made from tapioca starch It is a common ingredient in molecular gastronomy because it can be used both as a thickener and stabilizer for sauces and dressings for encapsulation and as a sweetener In many cases it is also used as an aroma carrier due to its capacity to absorb oil It is often used to make powders or pastes out of fat Xanthan gum Xanthan gum is a food additive used as a thickening agent It is produced through the fermentation of glucose As a glutenfree additive it can be used as a substitute in cooking and baking As a thickener when used in low dosages xanthan gum produces a weak gel with high viscosity that is shear reversible with a high pourability It also displays excellent stabilizing abilities that allow for particle suspension Moreover xanthan gum mixes well with other ﬂavours without masking them and provides an improved mouth feel to preparations The presence of bubbles within the thickened liquids often makes way for light and creamy textures It is used in the production of emulsions suspensions raviolis and foams Being a hydrocolloid xanthan gum must be hydrated before use High versatility allows it to be dissolved over a wide range of temperatures acid and alcohol levels Once set xanthan gum may lose some of its eﬀectiveness when exposed to heat Contributors and Attributions Sorangel
