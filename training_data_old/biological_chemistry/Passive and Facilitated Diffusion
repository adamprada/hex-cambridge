Passive and Facilitated Diffusion Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Henry JakubowskiProfessor Chemistry at College of St BenedictSt Johns University Contributors and Attributions Learning Objectives define flux J of solute A across a membrane write mathematical relationship that show how flux J depends on the concentration gradient of solute across the membrane dAdx and also on the difference of solute concentration across the membrane Î”A for passive diffusion differentiate between passive diffusion facilitated diffusion mediated by a receptor transporter and active transport write chemical equations which show the physical steps in the process of passive and facilitated diffusion derive a mathematical equation and graphs which shows the dependencies of flux J as a function of Aout and AR for facilitated diffusion assuming rapid equilibrium binding of differentiate between carrier proteins permeases or transport proteins on one hand and channels on the other This chapter will discuss diffusion processes First diffusion equations will be derived for cases not involving a binding receptor The equation will show the rate of diffusion of a solute across a membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration is a linear function of across the membrane Next we will derive equations for receptormediated diffusion across a membrane facilitated diffusion We will deal with the situation when the solute must be transported up a concentration gradient which requires ATP as an exogenous source of energy a process called active transport Topic hierarchy Contributors and Attributions Prof Henry Jakubowski College of St BenedictSt Johns University
