The History of Wheat Flour Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Contributors and Attributions Archaeologists who did excavations in the region of the lake dwellers of Switzerland found grains of wheat millet and rye years old The Romans perfected the rotary mill for turning wheat into flour By the time of Christ Rome had more than bakeries and Roman legions introduced wheat throughout their empire Improved milling processes were needed because even when wheat was milled twice and bolted sifted through silk gauze the result was still a yellowish flour of uneven texture and flecked with germ and bran In the second half of the th century there were great changes in the flour milling process An American inventor Edmund LaCroix improved the process with a purifier to separate the middlings bran germand other coarse particles from the particles that form smoothtextured white flour In recent years the demand for whole grain milling has increased because whole grain food products have proved to be more nutritious than products made from white flour More information on whole grain and artisan milling is provided later in this section In Canada largescale wheat growing didnt occur until after the Prairies were settled in the s Hard wheat such as Red Fife Marquis and Selkirk earned Canada a position as the granary for Britain and many other European countries Today most of the wheat grown in Western Canada is the hard Red Spring variety Soft wheats such as soft red and soft white are primarily grown in Quebec and Ontario Many of the original wheat growers have passed on their farms to the next generations while others branched out to organic farming and milling One of these farms Nunweilers has a heritage that goes back to the early s when the original wheat in Canada Red Fife and Marquis was grown on this farm Today the major wheat growing areas of North America are in the central part of the continent in the Great Plains of the United States and the Canadian Prairies From Nebraska south winter wheat can be grown while to the north through Saskatchewan spring wheat dominates Many American states and some Canadian provinces grow both kinds In fact there are very few states that dont grow some wheat Kansas the site of the American Institute of Baking could be said to be at the heart of the US wheat growing area while Saskatchewan is the Canadian counterpart Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
