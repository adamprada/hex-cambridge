agent used in the industry It is mixed with water or juice and boiled to make ﬁllings and to give a glossy semiclear ﬁnish to products Commercial cornstarch is made by soaking maize in water containing sulphur dioxide The soaking softens the corn and the sulphur dioxide prevents possible fermentation It is then crushed and passed to water tanks where the germ ﬂoats oﬀ The mass is then ground ﬁne and still in a semiﬂuid state passed through silk screens to remove the skin particles After ﬁltration the product which is almost starch is dried Cornstarch in cold water is insoluble granular and will settle out if left standing However when cornstarch is cooked in water the starch granules absorb water swell and rupture forming a translucent thickened mixture This phenomenon is called gelatinization Gelatinization usually begins at about C F reaching completion at the boiling point The commonly used ingredients in a starch recipe aﬀect the rate of gelatinization of the starch Sugar added in a high ratio to the starch will inhibit the granular swelling The starch gelatinization will not be completed even after prolonged cooking at normal temperature The result is a ﬁlling of thin consistency dull color and a cereal taste Withhold some of the sugar from the cooking step in such cases and add it after gelatinization of the starch has been completed Other ingredients such as egg fat and dry milk solids have a similar eﬀect Fruits with high acidity such as rhubarb will also inhibit starch setting Cook the starch paste ﬁrst and add the fruit afterward In cooking a ﬁlling about kg lb of sugar should be cooked with the water or juice for every g oz of starch used as a thickener Approximately g oz of starch is used to thicken L of water or fruit juice The higher the acidity of the fruit juice the more thickener required to hold the gel Regular cornstarch thickens well but makes a cloudy solution Another kind of cornstarch waxy maize starch makes a more ﬂuid mix of great clarity Pregelatinized Starches Pregelatinized starches are mixed with sugar and then added to the water or juice They thicken the ﬁlling in the presence of sugar and water without heating This is due to the starch being precooked and not requiring heat to enable it to absorb and gelatinize There are several brands of these starches on the market eg Clear Jel and they all vary in absorption properties For best results follow the manufacturers guidelines Do not put pregelatinized starch directly into water as it will form lumps immediately Note If fruit ﬁllings are made with these precooked starches there is a potential for breakdown if the ﬁllings are kept Enzymes in the uncooked fruit may attack the starch and destroy some of the gelatinized structure For example if you are making a weeks supply of pie ﬁlling from fresh rhubarb use a regular cooked formula Arrowroot Arrowroot is a highly nutritious farinaceous starch obtained from the roots and tubers of various West Indian plants It is used in the preparation of delicate soups sauces puddings and custards AgarAgar Agaragar is a jellylike substance extracted from red seaweed found oﬀ the coasts of Japan California and Sri Lanka It is available in strips or slabs and in powder form Agaragar only dissolves in hot water and is colorless Use it at to make a ﬁrm gel It has a melting point much higher than gelatin and its jellying power is eight times greater It is used in pie ﬁllings and to some extent in the stiﬀening of jams It is a permitted ingredient in some dairy products including ice cream at One of its largest uses is in the production of materials such as piping jelly and marshmallow Algin Sodium Alginate Extracted from kelp this gum dissolves in cold water and a concentration to give a ﬁrm gel It has the disadvantage of not working well in the presence of acidic fruits It is popular in uncooked icings because it works well in the cold state and holds a lot of moisture It reduces stickiness and prevents recrystallization Carrageenan or Irish Moss Carrageenan is another marine gum extracted from red seaweed It is used as a thickening agent in various products from icing stabilizers to whipping cream at an allowable rate of to Gelatin Gelatin is a glutinous substance made from the bones connective tissues and skins of animals The calcium is removed and the remaining substance is soaked in cold water Then it is heated to C to C F F The partially evaporated liquid is defatted and coagulated on glass plates and then poured into moulds When solid the blocks of gelatin are cut into thin layers and dried on wire netting Gelatin is available in sheets of leaf gelatin powders granules or ﬂakes Use it at a ratio Like some of the other gelling agents acidity adversely aﬀects its gelling capacity The quality of gelatin often varies because of diﬀerent methods of processing and manufacturing For this reason many bakers prefer leaf gelatin because of its reliable strength Gum Arabic or Acacin This gum is obtained from various kinds of trees and is soluble in hot or cold water Solutions of gum arabic are used in the bakery for glazing various kinds of goods particularly marzipan fruits Gum Tragacanth This gum is obtained from several species of Astragalus lowgrowing shrubs found in Western Asia It can be purchased in ﬂakes or powdered form Gum tragacanth was once used to make gum paste and gum paste wedding ornaments but due to high labour costs and a prohibitive price for the product its use nowadays is uncommon Pectin Pectin is a mucilaginous substance gummy substance extracted from plants occurring naturally in pears apples quince oranges and other citrus fruits It is used as the gelling agent in traditional jams and jellies Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons
