Viscosity Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Chips Chunks and Other Baking ProductsContributors and Attributions Viscous means sticky and the term viscosity refers to the way in which the chocolate ﬂows Chocolate comes in various viscosities and the confectioner chooses the one that is most appropriate to his or her needs The amount of cocoa butter in the chocolate is largely responsible for the viscosity level Emulsiﬁers like lecithin can help thin out melted chocolate so it ﬂows evenly and smoothly Because it is less expensive than cocoa butter at thinning chocolate it can be used to help lower the cost of chocolate Molded pieces such as Easter eggs require a chocolate of less viscosity That is the chocolate should be somewhat runny so it is easier to ﬂow into the moulds This is also the case for coating cookies and most cakes where a thin attractive and protective coating is all that is needed A somewhat thicker chocolate is advisable for things such as ganache and ﬂavoring of creams and ﬁllings Where enrobers machines to dip chocolate centers are used the chocolate may also be thinner to ensure that there is an adequate coat of couverture Viscosity varies between manufacturers and a given type of chocolate made by one manufacturer may be available in more than one viscosity Bakers sometimes alter the viscosity depending on the product A vegetable oil is sometimes used to thin chocolate for coating certain squares This makes it easier to cut afterwards Chips Chunks and Other Baking Products Content and quality of chocolate chips and chunks vary from one manufacturer to another This chocolate is developed to be more heat stable for use in cookies and other baking where you want the chips and chunks to stay whole Ratios of chocolate liquor sugar and cocoa butter diﬀer All these variables aﬀect the ﬂavor Chips and chunks may be pure chocolate or have another fat substituted for the cocoa butter Some high quality chips have up to chocolate liquor but in practice liquor content over tends to smear in baking so high ratios defeat the purpose Many manufacturers package their chips or chunks by count ct size This refers to how many pieces there are in kg of the product As the count size number increases the size of the chip gets smaller With this information you can choose the best size of chip for the product you are producing Other chocolate products available are chocolate sprinkles or hail used as a decoration chocolate curls rolls or decorative shapes for use on cakes and pastries and chocolate sticks or batons which are often baked inside croissants Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
