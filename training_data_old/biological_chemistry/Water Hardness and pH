Water Hardness and pH Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquezProfessorial Lecturer Chemistry at American University Effects on BakingContributors and Attributions Effects on Baking Most municipal supplies of water contain chlorine which is used to ensure the purity of the water Some cities add fluoride to their water supply to stop tooth decay Neither chlorine nor fluoride is present in large enough quantities to affect dough in any way In addition most municipal water is treated to reduce excessive acidity since this could be corrosive for the water lines It is therefore unlikely that bakers using municipal water need to be concerned about extremely acidic water Soft water is another matter as it can lead to sticky dough An addition of yeast food or a reduction in dough water will help Alkaline water tends to tighten the dough and retard fermentation since enzymes work best in slightly acidic dough If there is a possibility of water problems a sample should be forwarded to a laboratory for a complete analysis Contributors and Attributions Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez American University Chemistry of Cooking by Sorangel RodriguezVelazquez is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial ShareAlike International License except where otherwise noted
