Arrhenius acids and bases Although the term proton is often used for H this should really be reserved for H protium not D deuterium or T tritium The more general term hydron covers all isotopes of hydrogen The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions H in An Arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of H ions in the water Note that chemists often write Haq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acidbase reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus does not exist alone in water it exists in a hydrated form which for simplicity is often written as the hydronium hydroxonium ion HO Thus an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation selfionization of water into hydronium and hydroxide OH ions Kw is defined as HOH and the value of Kw varies with temperature as shown in the table below where at C Kw is approximately ie pKw Water temperature Kw pKw C C C C C In pure water the majority of molecules are HO but the molecules are constantly dissociating and reassociating and at any time a small number of the molecules about in are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide Because the numbers are equal pure water is neutral not acidic or basic and has an electrical conductivity of microSiemen μS m For comparison sea waters conductivity is about one million times higher S m An Arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium ions Note To qualify as an Arrhenius acid upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise an increase in the aqueous hydronium concentration or a decrease in the aqueous hydroxide concentration Conversely to qualify as an Arrhenius base upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise a decrease in the aqueous hydronium concentration or an increase in the aqueous hydroxide concentration The definition is expressed in terms of an equilibrium expression acid base conjugate base conjugate acid With an acid HA the equation can be written symbolically as The equilibrium sign is used because the reaction can occur in both forward and backward directions The acid HA can lose a hydron to become its conjugate base A The base B can accept a hydron to become its conjugate acid HB Most acidbase reactions are fast so that the components of the reaction are usually in dynamic equilibrium with each other BrønstedLowry Acids and Bases While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it has limitations In chemists Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry independently recognized that acidbase reactions involve the transfer of a hydron A BrønstedLowry acid or simply Brønsted acid is a species that donates a hydron to a BrønstedLowry base The BrønstedLowry acidbase theory has several advantages over the Arrhenius theory Consider the following reactions of acetic acid CHCOOH Both theories easily describe the first reaction CHCOOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of HO when dissolved in water and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a hydron to water In the second example CHCOOH undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a hydron to ammonia NH but it cannot be described using the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium ions Lewis Acids and Bases A third concept was proposed in by Gilbert N Lewis which includes reactions with acidbase characteristics that do not involve a hydron transfer A Lewis acid is a species that reacts with a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct The Lewis acid accepts a pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor Brønsted acidbase reactions involve hydron transfer reactions while Lewis acidbase reactions involve electron pair transfers All Brønsted acids are Lewis acids but not all Lewis acids are Brønsted acids BF F BF NH H NH In the first example BF is a Lewis acid since it accepts an electron pair from the fluoride ion This reaction cannot be described in terms of the Brønsted theory because there is no hydron transfer The second reaction can be described using either theory A hydron is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia a Brønsted base alternatively ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion Other Definitions LuxFlood acidbase definition This acidbase theory was a revival of the oxygen theory of acids and bases proposed by German chemist Hermann Lux in and further improved by Håkon Flood circa It is still used in modern geochemistry and for the electrochemistry of molten salts This definition describes an acid as an oxide ion O acceptor and a base as an oxide ion donor For example MgO base CO acid MgCO CaO base SiO acid CaSiO NO base SO acid NO SO Usanovich acidbase definition Mikhail Usanovich developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogencontaining compounds and his approach published in was even more general than the Lewis theory Usanovichs theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species anions or electrons or donates positive ones cations and a base as the reverse This definition could even be applied to the concept of redox reactions oxidationreduction as a special case of acidbase reactions Some examples of Usanovich acidbase reactions include NaO base SO acid Na SO species exchanged anion O NHS base SbS acid NH SbS species exchanged anion S Na base Cl acid Na Cl species exchanged electron A comparison of the above definitions of Acids and Bases shows that the Usanovich concept encompasses all of the others but some feel that because of this it is too general to be useful A A Historical Overview Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers A Amphoteric Behavior Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Oxides and Hydroxides Oxides and Hydroxides An early classification of substances arose from the differences observed in their solubility in acidic and basic solutions This led to the classification of oxides and hydroxides as being either acidic or basic Acidic oxides or hydroxides either reacted with water to produce an acidic solution or were soluble in aqueous base Basic oxides and hydroxides either reacted with water to produce a basic solution or readily dissolved in aqueous acids The diagram below shows there is strong correlation between the acidic or basic character of oxides ExOy and the position of the element E in the periodic table Oxides of metallic elements are generally basic oxides and oxides of nonmetallic elements acidic oxides Take for example the reactions with water of calcium oxide a metallic oxide and carbon dioxide a nonmetallic oxide CaOs HOl CaOH COg HOl HCOaq Calcium oxide reacts with water to produce a basic solution of calcium hydroxide whereas carbon dioxide reacts with water to produce a solution of carbonic acid There is a gradual transition from basic oxides to acidic oxides from the lower left to the upper right in the periodic table Basicity of the oxides increase with increasing atomic number down a group BeO MgO CaO SrO BaO Note as well that acidity increases with increasing oxidation state of the element MnO MnO MnO MnO in keeping with the increase in covalency Oxides of intermediate character called amphoteric oxides are located along the diagonal line between the two extremes Amphoteric species are molecules or ions that can react as an acid as well as a base The word has Greek origins amphoteroi άμφότεροι meaning both Many metals such as copper zinc tin lead aluminium and beryllium form amphoteric oxides or hydroxides Amphoterism depends on the oxidation state of the oxide For example zinc oxide ZnO reacts with both acids and with bases In acid ZnO H Zn HO In base ZnO OH HO ZnOH This reactivity can be used to separate different cations such as zincII which dissolves in base from manganeseII which does not dissolve in base Aluminium hydroxide is another amphoteric species As a base neutralizing an acid AlOH

acidity functionc Lewis acid and baseHard and soft acids and basesAcidbase and oxidationreduction The definition of acid and base has changed over the course of time This is not a problem of the orthodoxy of one definition but of the convenience of applying the concept to a particular chemical problem Therefore ranking the strength of acids and base also depends on the definition of acid and base used a Arrheniuss acid and base In Arrhenius defined that an acid is a substance that gives H and a base one that gives OH Namely if an acid is HA and a base BOH then HA H A and BOH B OH Therefore when an acid and a base react water is formed b BrønstedLowrys acid and base In a new theory submitted in independently by Brønsted and Lowry an acid is defined as a molecule or an ion which gives H and a molecule or ion that receives H from a partner is a base A base is not only a molecule or an ion which gives OH but anything which receives H Since the acid HA gives H to water in an aqueous solution and generates an oxonium ion HO water is also a kind of base according to this definition Here HO is called a conjugate acid and A a conjugate base However since water gives H to ammonia and generates NH it is also an acid as is shown below That is water can be an acid or a base dependent on the coreactant Although the definition of BrønstedLowry is not much different from that of Arrhenius for aqueous solutions it is more useful because the theory was extended to nonaqueous acids and bases Exercise Write the molecular formulae of nitric acid perchloric acid sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid as oxo acids together with the formal oxidation number of the central atom Answer Nitric acid HONO Perchloric acid HOClO Sulfuric acid HOSO and Phosphoric acid HOPO Acid strength A protonic acid gives H to water and generates the oxonium ion HO The strength of an acid in a dilute aqueous solution is estimated from the equilibrium constant Ka for the dissociation equilibrium but it is more convenient to use An acid with pKa is classified as a strong acid and one with pKa a weak acid The conjugate base of a strong acid is a weak base The pKa values of typical acids at C are shown in Table Table Acidity constants for aqueous solutions of acids at C Acid pKa HF HCl HBr HI HCO HClO HNO HPO HPO HSO CHCOOH CHCOOH NH CHNH Estimated value Since a solvent also works as an acid or a base the acidity and its range depend on the solvent dissolving the acid Full dissociation of an acid stronger than HO gives H to water forming HO in an aqueous solution For example both HBr and HI dissociate completely to become HO and their acidities are similar This kind of phenomenon is called the leveling effect and all acidities become equal to that of HO In measuring the relative acidity of strong acids it is necessary to use a solvent whose H affinity is smaller than that of water such as acetic acid or ethanol Binary halo acids HX except for HF are very strong acids Although the HO concentration itself is also high in an aqueous solution of HF the stronger hydrogen bond of F compared with that of other halide anions decreases the thermodynamic activity of HO The acidity of oxo acids such as phosphoric acid sulfuric acid nitric acid and perchloric acid is related to the formal oxidation number of P S N and Cl Namely if the oxo acid HnXOm is denoted by HOnXOmn the positive charge on X becomes positive m n and the acidity is higher for larger value of this number The number parallels the ease of dissociation of OH to give a proton Acidity is higher in the following order perchloric acid HOClO sulfuric acid HOSO nitric acid HONO phosphoric acid HOPO Although phosphoric acid can be written as HOPO phosphorous acid is not HOP but HOHPO and has an acid strength comparable to phosphoric acid Hammett acidity function Hydrogen ion concentration and pH are meaningful only in dilute aqueous solutions of acids The acidity in nonaqueous and concentrated solutions is measured using the Hammett acidity function This function makes it possible to measure the acidities of various acids in a nonaqueous solvent or of an acid in various nonaqueous solvents The Hammett acidity function in the equilibrium is defined by In a very dilute solution and An acid with H over is called a superacid This is an acid that is times stronger than a molar solution of a strong acid H for pure sulfuric acid is for a solution of HF in SbF and for the combination of HSOF and SbF Superacids have the ability to remove H from a hydrocarbon and perform HD exchange and CC bond scission etc c Lewis acid and base Whereas the concept of Brønsted acid and base is limited to the transfer of protons a Lewis acid A is generally defined as an acceptor and a Lewis base B a donor of an electron pair An acid A and a base B bind together to form an adduct AB For example a Lewis acid BF and a Lewis base OEt diethylether form an adduct FBOEt The stability increases by the completion of an octet around boron when such an adduct forms The stability of an adduct is expressed by the equilibrium constant of the reaction Therefore the Lewis acidities of a series of acids are measured by comparing Kf against a common base B Since a proton is also an electron acceptor Brønsted acids are the special case of the more general Lewis definition of acids According to this definition a coordinate bond in a transition metal complex is also an acidbase reaction of a ligand Lewis base with a metal center Lewis acid V Gutmann proposed the negative enthalpy of formation kcal mol unit of the adduct ClSbSol of Sol solvent with a standard acid SbCl in dichloroethane as a measure of the Lewis basicity of a solvent This is called the donor number DN of a solvent On the other hand the P NMR chemical shift of EtP in a solvent is defined as the measure of the Lewis acidity of the solvent and is called the acceptor number AN Hard and soft acids and bases R G Pearson classified Lewis acids and bases according to their hardness and softness This classification is an extension of the original theory of S Ahrland J Chatt and N R Davies who proposed that metal cations were classified in the order of the stability constants Kf of the formation of the complexes of the metal cations with halide anions Namely the order of Kf is I Br Cl F toward metal ions belonging to class a and F Cl Br I toward those of class b The class a type metal cations are hard acids and class b type ones are soft acids The metal cations which are not much dependent on the kind of halogens have borderline character What should be noticed here is that Kf tends to become large for the combination of a hard acid and a hard base or a soft acid and a soft base If the concept is extended from simple metal cations and halide anions to general Lewis acids and bases they can similarly be classified in terms of the hard and soft acidbase affinity Typical hard acids and bases and soft acids and bases are shown in Table Table The classification of Lewis acids and bases Hard Borderline Soft Acids H Li Na K Be Mg Ca Al Ti Cr Fe BF Cl Fe Co NiCu Zn Sn Pb Sb Bi Cu Ag Au Tl Cd Hg Hg PdPtPt Bases NHHORO FOHO NOSOPO NNNO Br SO HCNR I PRSRCO The qualitative expression softness is a chemical paraphrasing of the ease of polarization and the larger contribution of covalency than ionicity in bonding The cations of alkali and alkaline earth metals as well as aluminum are hard and the cations of mercury copper silver and gold etc are soft Whereas oxides are hard sulfides and phosphorus compounds are soft In the minerals of the Earths crust aluminum which is hard and oxophilic is found as an oxide and cadmium which is soft and chalcophilic is found as a sulfide Exercise Applying the concept of hard and soft acids for ferric and ferrous ions what kind of minerals are expected in iron ores Answer Fe is a hard acid and Fe is a borderline acid Therefore it is likely that the main iron ores are oxide minerals Although the main ores are actually the oxides hematite FeO or magnetite FeO a Fe sulfide pyrite FeS is also widely distributed Acidbase and oxidationreduction Some people confuse acidbase and redox reactions This confusion may be caused firstly by the similar terms originating from oxygen and secondly by misunderstanding about electron transfer Historically A L Lavoisier who was one of the great founders of modern chemistry in the th century considered that oxygen was the basis of all acids He also defined oxidation as the formation of oxides from an element and oxygen It then took a long time before the present definitions of acidbase and redox reactions were proposed and the old definitions were no longer satisfactory Furthermore the Lewis acid accepts an electron pair from a base forming a Lewis acidbase complex and the oxidizing agent accepts electrons from a reducing agent and is reduced The fact that acids and oxidizing agents are electron acceptors and that bases and reducing agents are electron donors is one of the causes of this confusion Problems The Latimer diagram of oxygen is shown below Write the oxidation number of oxygen in each compound Calculate the reduction potential of the reaction which converts an oxygen molecule to water and judge whether this reaction is a spontaneous reaction Which is the stronger base ammonia or pyridine The order of the Lewis acidity of boron halides is BF BCl BBr Is this order reasonable from the standpoint of the electronegativities of halogens AcidBase Behaviour in

disintegration of radioactive elements into stable isotopes is of fundamental importance in nuclear chemistry If the amount of a radionuclide which exists at a certain time is N the amount of disintegration in unit time is proportional to N Therefore radioactivity is integration of the equation leads to where N is the number of atoms at zero time and the time during which the radioactivity becomes half of N is the half life Exercise How does a nuclide change with α disintegration and disintegration Answer Because an atomic nucleus of helium atom He is emitted by disintegration of a nuclide its atomic number Z becomes Z and its mass number A changes to A In disintegration an electron is emitted and Z becomes a nuclide Z Isolation of thulium Thulium is a rare earth element with the least abundance except promethium and there were remarkable difficulties in isolating it as a pure metal P T Cleve discovered the element in but it was only when the isolation of the metal of almost satisfying purity was reported C James of the United States tried many minerals and found that three ores ytterspar euzenite and columbite produced from an island in the northern Norway were the best source In order to obtain a purer metal of thulium chromates of the mixed rareearth metals obtained by the treatment of a large amount of the ores by sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid oxalic acid and barium chromate were recrystallized repeatedly from water and wateralcohol In those days identification of an element by spectroscopy was already possible and recrystallizations were repeated times over several months proving that it was not possible to obtain purer metal Chemists are requested to repeat monotonous operations even now but it is not likely that patience of this sort still exists This may hinder the progress of our understanding of the chemistry of rare earth elements Although actinoids are similar to lanthanoids in that their electrons fill the f orbitals in order their chemical properties are not uniform and each element has characteristic properties Promotion of f d electrons does not require a large amount of energy and examples of compounds with acid ligands are known in which all the f d s and p orbitals participate in bonding Trivalent compounds are the most common but other oxidation states are not uncommon Especially thorium protactinium uranium and neptunium tend to assume the or higher oxidation state Because their radioactivity level is low thorium and uranium which are found as minerals can be handled legally in a normal laboratory Compounds such as ThO ThCl UO UCl UCl UCl UF etc find frequent use Especially uranium hexafluoride UF is sublimable and suitable for gas diffusion and undergoes a gas centrifuge process for the separation of U Thorium is an oxophilic element similar to the lanthanoids problems What is the reason for the relatively easy separation of cerium and europium among the lanthanoids which were difficult to isolate Calculate the radioactivity after a period of times as long as the halflife of a given material Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a

electricity flows electrical resistivity measures how much a material resists the flow of electricity Electrical Transport Properties Simply put electricity is the movement of electrons through a material As electrons move through a material it comes into contact with atoms in the material Collisions slow the electrons down Each collision increases the resistivity of the material The easier the electrons continue through a material the fewer collisions that take place and the higher the conductivity When temperature increases the conductivity of metals usually decreases while the conductivity of semiconductors increases This of course assumes that the material is homogenous which is not always the case You can calculate resistivity using the following equation As you already read ρ is the symbol for resistivity is the electric field and has units of Volts per meter Vm J is the current density and has units of amps per meter squared Am The electric field is calculated by dividing the Voltage by the length l that voltage is applied The current density is calculated by the equation below I is the current and is divided by the cross sectional area A over which the current flows Resistivity vs Resistance Resistivity and resistance are two different things Resistivity does not depend on size or shape Resistance however does You can calculate resistance with the

Exclusion PrincipleEnergies of the OrbitalsReferencesProblemsSolutionsContributors Introduction There are four quantum numbers No two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum numbers Each quantum number describes a different aspect of the electron and its orbital These numbers are obtained from the solution of the Schrödinger Equation for atoms in spherical coordinates n the principal quantum number tells you about the size of the orbital It is related to how far the electron is from the atom It is also related to the energy of the electron can be any positive integer number An orbital has radial nodes as well which describe a radius at which the probability of finding the electron is l azimuthal quantum number lt tells you about the angular momentum of the electron in the orbital It defines the shape of the orbital lt can be any integer between and including and Each orbital has planar nodes Some examples of orbitals with different is an s orbital with no planar nodes gives a p orbital which has one planar node ml magnetic quantum number tells you about the angular momentum projected on to the z axis It tells you of the orientation of the orbital It can be any integer between and has different but degenerate possible values or ms spin projection quantum number tells you about the spin of the electron An electron is a fermion a type of quantum particle which is only allowed to have equal to or Pauli Exclusion Principle The Pauli Exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions can share the same quantum state simultaneously An electron being a fermion obeys this principle so no two electrons in the same atom can have the same quantum numbers Each orbital has space for electrons with values with opposite sign These electrons

temperatures at which a metal is stable and the temperatures at which it will spontaneously oxidize For temperatures at which the free energy of formation of the oxide is positive the reverse reaction is favored and the oxide will spontaneously decompose to the metal From evaluation of the thermodynamic data presented in this figure it can be seen that at oC Al will oxidize in an environment that has an oxygen partial pressure of atm or greater while chromium will oxidize in an oxygen partial pressure of atm or higher In general a vacuum environment will be oxidizing to these elements unless a reducing species such as hydrogen is present If inadequate oxygen is present a nonprotective oxide film may be formed which could promote alloy depletion and loss of strength Page ID No headers

PrincipleHunds RulePauli Exclusion PrinciplePeriodic TrendHow to Write Ground State Electron ConfigurationsBasicsShorthandReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors Ground state electron configurations are the foundation for understanding molecular bonding properties and structures From the electrons in an atom to the differing orbitals and hybridization the ground state electron configuration sheds light on many different atomic properties Fundamentally understanding electron configuration leads to an understanding of the periodic table Introduction In Niels Bohr proposed that electrons could orbit an atom at a certain distance without collapsing into the atom and that each orbit distance had its own energy level He proposed that each orbitals angular momentum M was equal to a multiple n of Planks constant h divided by π This gives the equation M nħ where ħ hπ and n This model proposed the Bohr atom which shows circular orbits surrounding the nucleus Orbitals In addition to having different energy levels orbitals also have different shapes and orientations and each can be occupied by two electrons For each principal quantum number n there is one s orbital three p orbitals five d orbitals and seven f orbitals Therefore an s orbital can hold two electrons a p orbital can hold six electrons a d orbital can hold ten electrons and an f orbital can hold electrons Ground State Electron Configuration Quantum numbers There are four quantum numbers n l ml and ms The principal quantum number n is a positive integer and it represents the energy of the orbital The angular momentum quantum number l is from to n The l values of and correspond to the s p d and f orbitals respectively The magnetic quantum number ml ranges from l to l This quantum number dictates the orbital orientation such as px py or pz The quantum spin number ms is either or and it dictates the electron spin Aufbau Principle The Aufbau principle states that electrons must fill lowest energy shells first Following the model electrons fill the s orbital with two electrons then the s with two electrons then the p with six electrons then the s with two electrons etc There are some exceptions to the Aufbau Principle This occurs mainly with electrons in the d orbital where extra stability is obtained from a half filled or fully filled d orbital Therefore if there are electrons or electrons in the d orbital it will move one electron from the s orbital below it to fill the extra space Example Chromium Crs electron configuration following the model would be s s p s p sd but instead it is s s p s p sd because there is extra stability gained from the halffilled d orbital Hunds Rule Hunds rule states that when filled sublevels other than s orbital electrons must not be spin paired in the orbitals until each orbital contains one electron and no orbital can have two electrons with the same spin ms Pauli Exclusion Principle Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons can have the same quantum numbers An orbital can only hold or electrons They must have opposite spins if there are electrons in the orbittal Periodic Trend Valence electron shells in the periodic table follow a trend This can be referred to as the s block the p block the d block and the f block lanthanides and actinides meaning that in its ground state an element in a certain block will have its valence electrons in the s p d or f orbitals depending How to Write Ground State Electron Configurations Basics Electron configurations are written using the principal quantum number n followed by the orbital s p d or f with the total number of electrons written as a superscript Example s For writing ground state electron configurations a few main steps should be followed Find the amount of electrons in the atom Example Na e Na e Fill orbitals following the model until all electrons have been accounted for Example Na e s s p s or Na s s p After that it is important to check for a nearly halffilled or filled d orbital d or d and adjust accordingly by removing an electron from the s orbital beneath it Example Chromium Cr s s p s psd half filled orbital s orbital beneath it s s p s p sd Shorthand Because writing the entire electron configuration can become cumbersome there is a shorthand option It is done by using the symbol of the noble gas in the period above the element

calculation on a closed shell molecule the electronic Hamiltonian is used with a single determinant wavefunction This wavefunction is constructed from molecular orbitals that are written as linear combinations of contracted Gaussian basis functions The contracted Gaussian functions are composed from primitive Gaussian functions to match Slatertype orbitals STOs The exponential parameters in the STOs are optimized by calculations on small molecules using the nonlinear variational method and then those values are used with other molecules The problem is to calculate the electronic energy from and find the optimum coefficients for each molecular orbital in Equation by using the Self Consistent Field Method and the Linear Variational Method to minimize the energy as was described in the previous chapter for the case of atoms To obtain the total energy of the molecule we need to add the internuclear repulsion to the electronic energy calculated by this procedure The total energy of the molecule can be calculated for different geometries ie bond lengths and angles to find the minimum energy configuration Also the total energies of possible transition states can be calculated to find the lowest energy pathway to products in chemical reactions Exercise For a molecule with three nuclei show that the sums in Equation correctly include all the pairwise potential energy terms without including any twice As we improve the basis set used in calculations by adding more and better functions we expect to get better and better energies The variational principle says an approximate energy is an upper bound to the exact energy so the lowest energy that we calculate is the most accurate At some point the improvements in the energy will be very slight This limiting energy is the lowest that can be obtained with a single determinant wavefunction This limit is called the HartreeFock limit the energy is the HartreeFock energy the molecular orbitals producing this limit are called HartreeFock orbitals and the determinant is the HartreeFock wavefunction Exercise Write a onesentence definition of the HartreeFock wavefunction that captures all the essential features of this function Restricted vs Unrestricted HartreeFock You may encounter the terms restricted and unrestricted HartreeFock The above discussion pertains to a restricted HF calculation In a restricted HF calculation electrons with spin are restricted or constrained to occupy the same spatial orbitals as electrons with spin This constraint is removed in an unrestricted calculation For example the spin orbital for electron could be and the spin orbital for electron in a molecule could be where both the spatial molecular orbital and the spin function differ for the two electrons Such spin orbitals are called unrestricted If both electrons are constrained to have the same spatial orbital eg and then the spin orbital is said to be restricted While unrestricted spin orbitals can provide a better description of the electrons twice as many spatial orbitals are needed so the demands of the calculation are much higher Using unrestricted orbitals is particular beneficial when a molecule contains an odd number of electrons because there are more electrons in one spin state than in the other Carbon Dioxide Now consider the results of a selfconsistent field calculation for carbon monoxide It is well known that carbon monoxide is a poison that acts by binding to the iron in hemoglobin and preventing oxygen from binding As a result oxygen is not transported by the blood to cells Which end of carbon monoxide carbon or oxygen do you think binds to iron by donating electrons We all know that oxygen is more electronrich than carbon vs electrons and more electronegative A reasonable answer to this question therefore is oxygen but experimentally it is carbon that binds to iron A quantum mechanical calculation done by Winifred M Huo published in J Chem Phys provides an explanation for this counterintuitive result The basis set used in the calculation consisted of functions the ls s px py and pz atomic orbitals of C and O Ten molecular orbitals mos were defined as linear combinations of the ten atomic orbitals which are written as where identifies the mo and identifies the atomic orbital basis function The ground state wavefunction is written as the Slater Determinant of the five lowest energy molecular orbitals Equation gives the energy of the ground state where the denominator accounts for the normalization requirement The coefficients in the linear combination are determined by the variational method to minimize the energy The solution of this problem gives the following equations for the molecular orbitals Only the largest terms have been retained here These functions are listed and discussed in order of increasing energy The says this is the first orbital The says it is symmetric with respect to reflection in the plane of the molecule The large coefficient means this is essentially the s atomic orbital of oxygen The oxygen s orbital should have a lower energy than that of carbon because the positive charge on the oxygen nucleus is greater This orbital is essentially the s atomic orbital of carbon Both the and are nonbonding orbitals since they are localized on a particular atom and do not directly determine the charge density between atoms This orbital is a bonding molecular orbital because the electrons are delocalized over C and O in a way that enhances the charge density between the atoms The means this is the third orbital This orbital also illustrates the concept of hybridization One can say the s and p orbitals on each atom are hybridized and the molecular orbital is formed from these hybrids although the calculation just obtains the linear combination of the four orbitals directly without the à priori introduction of hybridization In other words hybridization just falls out of the calculation The hybridization in this bonding LCAO increases the amplitude of the function in the region of space between the two atoms and decreases it in the region of space outside of the bonding region of the atoms This molecular orbital also can be thought of as being a hybrid formed from atomic orbitals The hybridization of oxygen atomic orbitals because of the negative coefficient with sO decreases the electron density between the nuclei and enhances electron density on the side of oxygen facing away from the carbon atom If we follow how this function varies along the internuclear axis we see that near carbon the function is positive whereas near oxygen it is negative or possibly small and positive This change means there must be a node between the two nuclei or at the oxygen nucleus Because of the node the electron density between the two nuclei is low so the electrons in this orbital do not serve to shield the two positive nuclei from each other This orbital therefore is called an antibonding mo and the electrons assigned to it are called antibonding electrons This orbital is the antibonding partner to the orbital These two orbitals are degenerate and correspond to bonding orbitals made up from the px and py atomic orbitals from each atom These orbitals are degenerate because the x and y directions are equivalent in this molecule tells us that these orbitals are antisymmetric with respect to reflection in a plane containing the nuclei This orbital is the sp hybrid of the carbon atomic orbitals The negative coefficient for pC puts the largest amplitude on the side of carbon away from oxygen There is no node between the atoms We conclude this is a nonbonding orbital with the nonbonding electrons on carbon This is not a bonding orbital because the electron density between the nuclei is lowered by hybridization It also is not an antibonding orbital because there is no node between the nuclei When carbon monoxide binds to Fe in hemoglobin the bond is made between the C and the Fe This bond involves the donation of the nonbonding electrons on C to empty d orbitals on Fe Thus mo theory allows us to understand why the C end of the molecule is involved in this electron donation when we might naively expect O to be more electronrich and capable of donating electrons to iron Exercise Summarize how Quantum Mechanics is used to describe bonding and the electronic structure of molecules Exercise Construct an energy level diagram for CO that shows both the atomic orbitals and the molecular orbitals Show which atomic orbitals contribute to each molecular orbital by drawing lines to connect the mos to the aos Label the molecular orbitals in a way that reveals their symmetry Use this energy level diagram to explain why it is the carbon end of the molecule that binds to hemoglobin rather than the oxygen end Contributors and Attributions David M Hanson Erica Harvey Robert Sweeney Theresa Julia Zielinski Quantum States of Atoms and Molecules

LinksProblemsAnswers When Valence Bond Theory is applied to the multiple bonding in polyatomic molecules there are two types of bonds that can form homonuclear and heteronuclear Homonuclear bonds occur between multiples of the same element and heteronuclear bonds occur between different elements Homonuclear bonds can occur on a diatomic scale all the way up to large polymers made completely of carbon atoms However most polyatomic atoms involve heteronuclear bonds When considering bonding in polyatomic molecules for VB theory it is easiest to use a mixture of Lewis structures and Atomic Orbital Hybridization to explain Bonding In MoleculesExample EthyneReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswers Bonding In Molecules When trying to figure out the bonding of a molecule it is a good idea to look at the electronic configuration of the atoms Housecroft This allows you to know how many valence electrons you have to work with Then the number of bonds attached to each atom should be determined using the lewis structure of the molecule After the lewis structure has been determined find the hybridization of each atom in the molecule With the determined hybridization a picture of the molecule should be easy to create Example Ethyne Ethyne or acetylene as it is commonly referred to as has a lewis structure that shows that there is a triple bond between the two carbon atoms Using valence orbital hybridization sp hybridization is determined for triple bonded molecules which means that carbon has two free p orbitals that form pi bonds Using this info you would draw the two carbon atoms with sp bonds connecting them and the two pi orbitals from each atom bonding with each other Each hydrogen atom has its s orbital is overlapped with each carbon atoms second sp bond The

measure of the size of the atoms ion When formed ionic atoms change in size with respect to their orginal atom Cation radii will decrease and the anion radii will increase in size compared to their neutral atoms Questions such as What methodology is used by chemists to measure ionic radii and Are there any nonexperimental ways to estimate the size of ionic radii will be answered in this module Accordingly there are many ways to determine ionic radii IntroductionHardSphere modelPeriodic TrendsReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswers Introduction In the past after an atom is ionized Xray diffraction is used to measure how much the radius of the atom increased or decreased However scientists wanted to use another technique due to the fact that Xray diffraction is difficult to distinguish a boundary between two ions As a result the hard sphere model can be used HardSphere model The HardSphere model are impenetrable spheres that do not overlap in space The HardSphere model has been tested by wellknown scientists Lande Pauling and Goldsmidt The ion radii measured under crystal state of ionic compound which cations and anions are stacking in pattern as shown below Figure Schematic of the hardsphere model The HardSphere model can be applied to metallic and ionic compounds such as NaCl which is shown below Figure D hard sphere model of Sodium Chloride taken with

diffraction Internuclear distance d rcation ranion To calculate ion radii Lande used ionic compound under solid state ex NaCl This will minize the distribution of electrons Find the radii of anion r atom Find internuclear distance d between anion and cation Use Internuclear distance formula to find the r Figure The Hard sphere model can roughly determine the ion radii Periodic Trends As described earlier cations are smaller in size compared to their neutral atoms while anions are larger in sizeCations are smaller than its neutral atoms because the positive nuclear charge which holds the electrons in closer exceeds the negative charge when a metal atom loses an electron On the contrary anions are larger because the electrons are not held as tightly repulsions of electrons increase and the electrons spread out more due to nonmetal atoms gaining an electron Refer to the outside link to learn more about the periodic trends for ionic radii httpabulafiamticacukshannonptablephp

salts containing Na and e anions These compounds are known as alkalides and electrides respectively Most of these compounds have been discovered by Prof James Dye at Michigan State University The alkali metals have one electron in their valence shell For example the electronic configurations of Na and K are Ars and Krs respectively Although we are accustomed to seeing these very electropositive elements give up their electrons when they make compounds with electronegative elements they can also gain an electron to achieve a noble gasns configuration This is possible with strong electron donors such as alkali metals especially when the cation that is formed is stabilized by coordination to a crown ether Typically these compounds are synthesized by combining the alkali metal and the appropriate crown ether in liquid ammonia and then evaporating the ammonia Cavities and channels in an electride Electride salts are formed under similar conditions except in this case the anion is simply an electron that exists in an anion cavity in the crystal The crystal structures are clearly saltlike with the cations alkali cations stabilized by crown or cryptand ligands alternating in the structure with electrons Alkalide Salt ceNa NH_ NaNH eNH C NaC Na Electride Salt Complexing Na K Rb Cs with crown ether ligands stabilizes the M form of the metal salt form Because the metal cation with its ligand shell is rather large the lattice energy of these salts is rather low Crown a crown ether that strongly complexes Na cations Solutions of electride salts are powerful reducing agents as demonstrated by their use in the Birch reduction in which aromatic compounds are hydrogenated to produce dienes Electrides are also useful for reducing metal ions to metals Evaporation of blue electride solutions in anhydrous ammonia affords a mirror of Na Such solutions slowly lose their color as the electrons reduce ammonia to the amide anion It is interesting to consider in the context of lattice energies and BornHaber cycles what might happen without these ligands present That is we can ask the question of whether sodium metal would prefer to exist in the metallic form as Nas or to form the sodide salt NaNa or the electride salt Na e Of course we already know the answer to this question Elemental sodium is clearly a metal it is shiny conducts electricity and has a bcc crystal structure and has never been observed in either of the salt forms But how far away are these forms energetically We can calculate the energetics by assuming that the Na ion is about the same size as Br and that the e anion is about the same size as Cl Then the lattice energies in the cycles become the same as those of NaBr and NaCl The rather surprising result from these calculations is that sodium would be marginally stable as a sodide salt and very stable by kJ as an electride All the terms in these simple cycles are known precisely But we must be doing something wrong here because Nas is clearly metallic The key subtle point here is that BornHaber cycles consider only the potential energy rather than the total energy of the substances in the cycle Normally we can ignore the kinetic energy part of the total energy but in this case we cannot because of the quantum mechanical effect of resonance Alloys and Intermetallic Compounds Last updated Save

updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers When a solid salt melts it forms a solution of the cations and anions For example KOH melts at temperatures above C and dissociates into K and OH ions which can act as a solvent for chemical reactions Because of the autodissociation of the OH solvent water is always present in a molten KOH flux according to the acidbase equilibrium It follows that in this very basic solvent water the conjugate acid of the solvent is the strongest acid that can exist The conjugate base of the solvent O is the strongest base This autodissociation equilibrium allows for the acidity of a flux to be easily tuned through the addition or boiling off of water A wet flux is more acidic and can dissolve metal oxides that contain the basic O anion Conversely a dry flux is more basic and will cause oxides to precipitate Molten hydroxide fluxes can thus be used in the synthesis of oxide crystals such as the perovskite superconductor KXBaXBiO Eutectic mixtures of NaOH and KOH are relatively low melting C and can be used as solvents for crystallizing a variety of basic oxides Amorphous Alloys Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Alloys of metals with more complex

interaction of atomic orbitals ReferencesOutside LinksProblems picture Factors affect the strength of orbital interaction There are several factors that contribute to the overlap of two atomic orbitals as a consequence they affect the strength of the orbital interaction the symmetry of the orbitals the energy difference between them their orbital sizes and distance between the orbitalsFigure shows a delta bond forming from the overlap of two d orbitals In the delta bond interaction lobes are perpendicular to the axis lie between atoms Comparing to the sigma and pi bond interaction the delta bond has the weakest interaction figure The difference between energies of two atomic orbitals also takes a significant contribution to the strength of orbital interaction The relative energies of atomic orbitals of X and Y will dictate whether an interaction will lead to efficient overlap or not Housecroft page The more similar in energy of two atomic orbitals will result in the stronger interaction in the formation of new molecular orbital The homonuclear diatomics such as O N Cl have the same atomic orbital energies so the orbital interaction between them is very strong On the other hand in the heteronuclear diatomic CO HF the atomic orbitals lie at different energy the orbital interaction depends on how close their energy difference is Orbital size is another factor that affects the strength of orbital interactions due to the overlap region of orbitals The orbitals with different sizes have weaker interactions than the same size orbitals the result of a weaker bond can be explained by the weaker overlap between orbitals This is shown in figure figure The last factor that affects the orbital interaction is the distance between orbitals The sigma bonding interaction and the pi bonding interaction have strong interaction due to their much closed orbitals The delta bonding interaction will possess the weakest interaction because their orbitals are far from each other Show in figure figure The wave interaction of atomic orbitals Depending on the phase relationship there are two different ways that the two orbital overlap The phase of an orbital has the same properties of the wavelike of electrons Light waves interaction have two different ways one is inphase increasing the intensity of the light and other one is outofphase decreasing the intensity of the light Similarly electron waves interaction has two types inphase and outofphase Inphase interaction increases the intensity of negative charge On the other hand decreasing the intensity of the negative charge results from the out of phase interaction The orbital phase is presented by a plus or minus sign When the two same sign orbitals overlap to form a molecular orbital the electron density will occupy at the region between two nuclei This negative charge intensity of electrons will increase in the inphase interaction The increasing negative charge increases attractions between electrons and nucleiThe molecular orbital resulting from inphase interaction is defined as the bonding orbital which has lower energy than the original atomic orbital The out of phase interaction between two atomic orbitals doesnt result in electron density between the two atomic nuclei The negative charge intensity of electrons will decrease in the out of phase interaction The decreasing negative charge decreases attractions between electrons and nuclei As a consequence the out of phase interaction forms the anti bonding molecular orbital with the higher energy than the initial atomic orbital The diagram shows the bonding and antibonding between two s orbitals diagram The bonding and anti bonding between two p orbitals are showed in diagram diagram References Jean

between two atoms In the simple reaction we assume that sodium transfers an electron to chlorine creating the sodium ion and the chloride ion We can write the two steps of this reaction as and The first of these steps involves the loss of an electron and is called an oxidation reaction while the second step involves the gain of an electron and is called a reduction reaction The simple nemonic Leo goes Ger or Loss of electrons oxidation Gain of electrons reduction has been used by several generations of students to remember these definitions OK This is Simba my apologies to Lion King aficionados Oxidation and reduction reactions usually called redox reactions are important in biochemistry and important families of enzymes are called reductases or oxidases based on their reduction or oxidation catalysis We recognize ethanol as common drinking alcohol but most people dont realize that ethanol is generated by fermentation reactions that naturally take place in the intestines The body always has a small amount of ethanol being transported across the intestine walls As a result the body has an enzyme to metabolize ethanol called ethanol oxidase You might want to think about this The body didnt invent ethanol to compensate for the consumption of fermented beverages like beer and wine since there are relatively recent on an evolutionary time scale Ethanol oxidase is present in the body because it had to be there to compensate for the background ethanol I would suspect that all mammals have this enzyme not just people Other things that are ingested by people for their psychotropic effects do not necessarily have enzymes for their detoxification thus they stay in the tissues longer and have a greater potential for doing damage If you follow my dictum of not consuming anything for which you dont have an enzyme youll be relatively safe Redox chemistry also forms the basis of corrosion chemistry and battery chemistry electrochemistry Simple electrochemical reactions If we take a piece of zinc metal and put it into a beaker of HCl we will quickly notice the formation of bubbles on the surface of the zinc Were we to leave the zinc in the acid for several minutes wed easily observe that the zinc is being dissolved while a gas is being liberated This process is illustrated below The reaction taking place here is obviously In this reaction the hydrogen ions are being reduced while the zinc is being oxidized A similar reaction may be observed if we place a zinc bar into a solution containing copper sulfate Here the reaction is Again the zinc is being oxidized while the copper is being reduced Unlike the case of zinc in acid the reaction will only continue until the copper has formed a film on the surface of the zinc at which point the reaction stops since zinc ions are no longer able to escape to the solution Rules for assigning oxidation numbers The oxidation number of a free element The oxidation number of a monatomic ion charge on the ion The oxidation number of hydrogen and rarely The oxidation number of oxygen and in peroxides The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion charge on the ion Elements in group and aluminum are always as indicated on the periodic table A Pauling Electronegativity Values Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Pauling ElectronegativityReferencesProblemsContributors and Attributions Linus Pauling described electronegativity as the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself Basically the electronegativity of an atom is a relative value of that atoms ability to attract election density toward itself when it bonds to another atom The higher the electronegativity of an element the more that atom will attempt to pull electrons towards itself and away from any atom it bonds to The main properties of an atom dictate its electronegativity are its atomic number as well as its atomic radius The trend for electronegativity is to increase as you move from left to right and bottom to top across the periodic table This means that the most electronegative atom is Fluorine and the least electronegative is Francium There are a few different types of electronegativity which differ only in their definitions and the system by which they assign values for electronegativity For example there is Mulliken electronegativity which is defined as the average of the ionization energy and electron affinity of an atom which as we will see differs slightly from Paulings definition of electronegativity Pauling Electronegativity Linus Pauling was the original scientist to describe the phenomena of electronegativity The best way to describe his method is to look at a hypothetical molecule that we will call XY By comparing the measured XY bond energy with the theoretical XY bond energy computed as the average of the XX bond energy and the YY bond energy we can describe the relative affinities of these two atoms with respect to each other Δ Bond Energies XYmeasured XYexpected If the electonegativities of X and y are the same then we would expect the measured bond energy to equal the theoretical expected bond energy and therefore the Δ bond energies would be zero If the electronegativities of these atoms are not the same we would see a polar molecule where one atom would start to pull electron density toward itself causing it to become partially negative By doing some careful experiments and calculations Pauling came up with a slightly more sophisticated equation for the relative electronegativities of two atoms in a molecule ENX ENY Δ In that equation the factor is simply a conversion factor between kJ and eV to keep the units consistent with bond energies By assigning a value of to Fluorine the most electronegative element Pauling was able to set up relative values for all of the elements This was when he first noticed the trend that the electronegativity of an atom was determined by its position on the periodic table and that the electronegativity tended to increase as you moved left to right and bottom to top along the table The range of values for Paulings scale of electronegativity ranges from Fluorine most electronegative to Francium least electronegative Furthermore if the electronegativity difference between two atoms is very large then the bond type tends to be more ionic however if the difference in electronegativity is small then it is a nonpolar covalent bond References Zumdahl Steven S Chemical Principles th Edition Houghton Mifflin Company Chapter Electronegativity pgs Housecroft Catherine E

Save as PDF Page ID Kinetic vs Thermodynamic Stability Polymorphism is when a solid material can exist in more than one form or crystal structure Polymorphism is very similar to Allotropy but they should not be confused polymorphism describes molecules while Allotropy is used to describe atoms Polymorphism has many uses whether it was in pharmaceutical explosives or even food This process was discovered by Eilhard Mitscherlich in Kinetic vs Thermodynamic Stability When discussing the concept of Stability it is necessary to distinguish between thermodynamic and kinetic stability Here B is at lower energy than A so that ΔG is negative The reaction should therefore proceed spontaneously and B is the more thermodynamically stable species The reaction as shown though has a barrier to the progress of the reaction called the Activation Barrier Ea and so the reaction may proceed very slowly The thermodynamics describes only the starting and ending position of the reaction and not the intermediate or transition state If the kinetics is slow A is described as being inert while if it proceeds quickly then A is described as being labile The conditions that distinguish them are if the reaction takes longer than minute under the conditions of concentration M temperature C then it is INERT if under the same conditions the reaction time minute then it is LABILE In the lecture on isomerism we depend on the samples being kinetically stable ie inert In the lecture on Chelation and Stability we concentrate on thermodynamic stability and look at the changes in free energy enthalpy and entropy during the reaction When we consider thermodynamic stability we need to be familiar with formulae ΔG RT lnK or alternatively ΔG RT logK ΔG ΔH TΔS The first relates the free energy to the stability constant and the second shows the breakdown into the component enthalpy and entropy terms Application of Lattice Energies Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Topic hierarchy

PDF Page ID IntroductionPoint DefectsSchottky defects for and ReferencesProblemsAnswers Lattice structures are not perfect in fact most of the time they experience defects Lattice structures or crystals are prone to defects especially when their temperature is greater than K One of these defects is known as the Schottky defect which occurs when oppositely charged ions vacant their sites Introduction Like the human body lattice structures most commonly known as crystals are far from perfection Our body works hard to keep things proportional but occasionally our right foot is bigger than our left similarly crystals may try to arrange its ions under a strict layout but occasionally an ion slips to another spot or simply goes missing Realistically speaking it should be expected that crystals will depart itself from order not surprising considering defects occurs at temperature greater than K There are many ways a crystal can depart itself from order thus experiences defects these defects can be grouped in different categories such as Point Defects Line Defects Planar Defects or Volume or Bulk Defects We will focus on Point Defects specifically the defect that occurs in ionic crystal structures ie NaCl called the Schottky Defect Point Defects Lattice structures or crystals undergoing point defects experience one of two types atoms or ions leaving their spot thus creating vacancies atoms or ions slipping into the little gaps in between other atoms or ions those little gaps are known as interstitialssince atoms or ions in the crystals are occupying interstitials they inherently become create interstitials By the simplest definition the Schottky defect is defined by type one while type two defects are known as the Frenkel defect The Schottky defect is often visually demonstrated using the following layout of anions and cations vacant vacant Figure The positive symbols represents cations ie Na and the negative symbol represents anions ie Cl In addition this layout is applicable only for ionic crystal compounds of the formula MXlayout for ionic crystals with formula MX and MX will be discussed laterwhere M is metal and X is nonmetal Notice the figure has exactly one cation and one anion vacating their sites that is what defines a one Schottky Defect for a crystal of MX formulafor every cation that vacant its site the same number of anion will follow suit essentially the vacant sites come in pairs This also means the crystal will neither be too positive or too negative because the crystal will always be in equilibrium in respect to the number of anions and cations It is possible to approximate the number of Schottky defects ns in a MX ionic crystal compound by using the equation where is the enthalpy of defect formation is the gas constant is the absolute temperature in K and N can be calculated by From Equation it is also possible to calculate the fraction of vacant sites by using the equation Schottky defects for and As mentioned earlier a Schottky defect will always result a crystal structure in equilibriumwhere no crystal is going to be too positive or too negative thus in the case of MX one Schottky defect equals one cation and two anion vacancy MX one Schottky defect equals two cation and three anion vacancy References Housecroft Catherine Inorganic Chemistry Pearson Prentice Hall

cation vacant its site and occupies a space between other anions and cations is it still a Schottky defect Answers For a MX compound one anion and one cation vacant their sites so the overall charge will remain balanced This is the same for MX and MX because appropriate numbers of anions and cations vacant their site thus leaving the overall charge neutral MX compound one Schottky defect is when one anion and one cation leave their sites MX compound one Schottky defect is when one anion and two cations leave their sites MX is when two anions and three cations leave their sites Page ID No

and ions There are four types of site unique central position face site edge sites and corner site which are used to determine the number of Na ions and Cl ions in the unit cell of NaCl When counting

by other unit cell and for an edge site the ion is shared by other unit cells is a face centered cubic unit cell which has four cations and four anions This can be shown by counting the number of ions

BondingSummaryReferencesProblemsSolutions When a molten metal is mixed with another substance there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form atom exchange or interstitial mechanism The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur When the atoms are relatively similar in size the atom exchange method usually happens where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent This is called a substitutional alloy Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms Figure Different atomic mechanisms of alloy formation showing pure metal substitutional and interstitial structures CCO Hbf via Wikipedia Why Substitutional Alloys Occur Bonding The bonding between two metals is best described as a combination of metallic electron sharing and covalent bonding one cant occur without the other and the proportion of one to the other changes depending on the constituents involved Metals share there electrons throughout there structure this flow of electrons is the reason behind many of the characteristics associated with metals including their ability to act as conductors The different amount and strength of covalent bonds can change depending on the different specific metals involved and how they are mixed The covalent bonding is what is responsible for the crystal structure as well as the melting point and various other physical properties Figure Examples of Substitutional Metal Alloys Depending on the specific type of substitutional alloy they can have multiple crystal structures Two of the possible structures include Face Center Cubic left and Cubic Center Cubic right The structure of the metal alloy is not limited to these two structures but combined they represent a large portion of the common alloys As the similarities between the electron structure of the metals involved in the alloy increase the metallic characteristics of the alloy decrease Pure metals are useful but their applications are often limited to each individual metals properties Alloys allow metal mixtures that have increased resistance to oxidation increased strength conductivity and melting point Essentially any property can be manipulated by adjusting alloy concentrations An example could be Brass Door fixtures they are strong and resist corrosion better then pure zinc or copper the two major metals that constitute a brass alloy The combination also has a low melting point allowing it to be easily cast into many different shapes and sizes There are many other aspects of substitutional alloys that could be explored in depth but the basic concept is the idea that each individual metal in an alloy give the final product its chemical and physical properties Substitutional alloys played an important role in the development of human society and culture as we know it today The Bronze age itself is named after the Substitutional alloy consisting of tin in a metallic solution of copper Ancient bronzes are very impure or even mislabeled containing large amounts of zinc and arsenic as well as lots of impurities These many substitutional alloys allowed for stronger tools and weapons they allowed for increased productivity in the workshop as well as on the battlefield The need for raw materials like tin and copper for the production of bronze also spurred an increase in trade since their ores are rarely found together The current chemical understanding of substitutional alloys would not be so in depth if it werent for the usefulness of the alloys to humans Summary An alloy is a mixture of metals that has bulk metallic properties different from those of its constituent elements Alloys can be formed by substituting one metal atom for another of similar size in the lattice substitutional alloys by inserting smaller atoms into holes in the metal lattice interstitial alloys or by a combination of both Although the elemental composition of most alloys can vary over wide ranges certain metals combine in only fixed proportions to form intermetallic compo References Smallman R E Ngan A H W Smallman R E Physical metallurgy and advanced materials Amsterdam Butterworth Heinemann Wang F E Bonding theory for metals

recoil energy associated with absorption or emission of a photon can be described by the conservation of momentumIn it we find that the recoil energy depends inversely on the mass of the system For a gas the mass of the single nucleus is small compared to a solidThe solid or crystal absorbs the energy as phonons quantized vibration states of the solid but there is a probability that no phonons are created and the whole lattice acts as the mass resulting in a recoilles emission of the gamma ray The new radiation is at the proper energy to excite the next ground state nucleus The probability of recoilles events increases with decreasing transition energy Doppler Effect The Doppler shift describes the change in frequency due to a moving source and a moving observer is the frequency measured at the observer is the velocity of the wave so for our case this is the speed of light is the velocity of the observer is the velocity of the source which is positive when heading away from the observer and is the initial frequency In the case where the source is moving toward a stationary observer the perceived frequency is higherFor the opposite situation where the source travels away from the observer frequencies recorded at the observer will be of lower compared to the initial wave The energy of a photon is related to the product of Plancks constant and the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation Thus for increasing frequencies the corresponding energy also increase and the same is true in the reverse case where frequencies decrease and therefore energy decreases The energy differences between hyperfine states are minimal fractions of an eV and the energy variation is achieved by the moving the source toward and away from the sample in an oscillating manner commonly at a velocity of a few mmsThe transmittance is then plotted against the velocity of the source and a peak is seen at the energy corresponding to the resonance energy In the above spectrum the emission and absorption are both estimated by the Lorentzian distribution Mössbauer Isotopes By far the most common isotopes studied using Mössbauer spectroscopy is Fe but many other isotopes have also displayed a Mössbauer spectrum Two criteria for functionality are The excited state is of very low energy resulting in a small change in energy between ground and excited state This is because gamma rays at higher energy are not absorbed in a recoil free manner meaning resonance only occurs for gamma rays of low energy The resolution of Mössbauer spectroscopy depends upon the lifetime of the excited state The longer the excited state lasts the better the image Both conditions are met by Fe and it is thus used extensively in Mössbauer spectroscopy In the figure to the right the red colored boxes of the periodic table of elements indicate all elements that have isotopes visible using the Mössbauer technique Hyperfine Interactions Mössbauer spectroscopy allows the researcher to probe structural elements of the nucleus in several ways termed isomer shift quadrupole interactions and magnetic splitting These are each explained by the following sections as individual graphs but in practice Mössbauer spectrum are likely to contain a combination of all effects Isomer Shift An isomeric shift occurs when non identical atoms play the role of source and absorber thus the radius of the source Rs is different that of the absorber Ra and the same holds that the electron density of each species is different The Coulombic interactions affects the ground and excited state differently leading to a energy difference that is not the same for the two speciesThis is best illustrated with the equation Where delta represents the change in energy necessary to excite the absorber which is seen as a shift from the Doppler speed to V The isomer shift depends directly on the selectrons and can be influenced by the shielding pdf electronsFrom the measured delta shift there is information about the valance state of the absorbing atom The energy level diagram for shift shows the change in source velocity due to different sources used The shift may be either positive or negative Quadrupole Interaction The Hamiltonian for quadrupole interaction using nuclear excited state is given by where the nuclear excited states are split into two degenerate doublets in the absence of magnetic interactions For the asymmetry parameter doublets are labeled with magnetic quantum numbers and where the doublet has the higher energy The energy difference between the doublets is thus The energy diagram and corresponding spectrum can be seen as Magnetic Splitting Magnetic splitting of seen in Mössbauer spectroscopy can be seen because the nuclear spin moment undergoes dipolar interactions with the magnetic field where is the nuclear gfactor and is the nuclear magneton In the absence of quadrupole interactions the Hamiltonian splits into equally spaced energy levels of The allowed gamma stimulated transitions of nuclear excitation follows the magnetic dipole transition selection rule is the magnetic quantum number and the direction of defines the nuclear quantization axis If we assume and are isotropic direction independent where and B is actually a combination of the applied and internal magnetic fields The electronic Zeeman term is far larger then the nuclear Zeeman term meaning the electronic term dominates the equation so is approximated by and and Pulling out a followed by leaves Substituting the internal magnetic field with results in a combined magnetic field term involving both the applied magnetic field and the internal magnetic field which is simplified by using the effective magnetic field References Gütlich P Link R Trautwein A

metal alloysFilling of the d and sp bands The MO picture we developed in Section helps us rationalize the electrical conductivity of Na s but what about Mg which as an atom in the gas phase has a s electronic configuration The two valence electrons are spinpaired in atomic Mg as they are in the helium atom s When the s orbitals of Mg combine to form a band we would expect the band to be completely filled since Mg has two electrons per orbital By this reasoning solid Mg should be an insulator But Mg has all the properties of a metal high electrical and thermal conductivity metallic luster malleability etc In this case the s and p bands are sufficiently broad because of strong orbital overlap between Mg atoms that they form a continuous band This band which contains a total of four orbitals one s and three p per atom is only partially filled by the two valence electrons Mg crystals Another way to think about this is to consider the hybridization of the s and p electrons in Mg Hybridization requires promotion from the sp ground state of an Mg atom to a sp excited state The promotion energy kJmol is more than offset by the bonding energy kJmol the energy released when gaseous atoms in the excited state condense to form the metallic solid The heat of vaporization or the cohesive energy of a metal is the difference between the bonding energy and the promotion energy Experimentally we can measure the vaporization energy kJmol and the promotion energy and use them to calculate the bonding energy From this we learn that each s or p electron is worth about kJmol in bonding energy The concepts of promotion energy and bonding energy are very useful in rationalizing periodic trends in the bond strengths and magnetic properties of metals which are described below The cohesive energy of Mg metal is the difference between the bonding and promotion energies The ground state of a gas phase Mg atom is Ars but it can be promoted to the Arsp state which is kJmol above the ground state Mg uses two electrons per atom to make bonds and the sublimation energy of the metal is kJmol Periodic trends in delectron bonding While electrons in s and p orbitals tend to form strong bonds delectron bonds can be strong or weak There are two important periodic trends that are related to orbital size and orbital overlap As we move across the periodic table Sc Ti V Cr Fe the d orbitals contract because of increasing nuclear charge Moving down the periodic table V Nb Ta the d orbitals expand because of the increase in principal quantum number These trends explain the distinct behavior of the d elements relative to those in the d and d series In the d series the contraction of orbitals affects the ability of the d electrons to contribute to bonding Past V in the first row of the transition metals the d electrons become much less effective in bonding because they overlap weakly with their neighbors Weak overlap of d orbitals gives narrow dbands and results in the emergence of magnetic properties as discussed below Schematic representation of the sizes of different orbitals of Cr and W In the first transition series shielding of the d orbitals is poor Therefore the s and p orbitals are more effective in bonding than the d In the third transition series the situation is reversed The increased nuclear charge is felt most strongly by the s which takes on the character of an inert electron pair The d orbitals are well shielded by the complete n shell so they have good orbital overlap with neighboring atoms In the d and d series a plot of cohesive energy vs number of valence electrons below left has a volcano shape that is peaked at the elements Mo and W sd and sd respectively The number of bonding electrons and therefore the bonding energy increases steadily going from Rb to Mo in the d series and from Cs to W in the d series Mo and W have the most bonding energy because they can use all six of their valence electrons in bonding without promotion Elements past Mo and W have more d electrons but some of them are spin paired and so some promotion energy is needed to prepare these electrons for bonding For example Pt metal must be promoted from the sd atomic ground state to sdp in order to make six bonds per atom and the energy cost of promoting electrons from the d to the p orbitals is reflected in the net bonding energy Because of their strong bonding energy elements in the middle of the d and d series have very high melting points We do not see magnetism in the d or d metals or their alloys because orbital overlap is strong and the bonding energy exceeds the electron pairing energy The heat of vaporization the cohesive energy of metals in the d and d series measured at the melting point of the metal The d elements Sc through Zn are distinctly different from the d and d elements in their bonding and consequently in their magnetic properties In the d series we see the expected increase in cohesive energy going from Ca s to Sc sd to Ti sd to V sd but then something very odd happens The d series has a crater in the cohesive energy plot where there was a peak in the d series The cohesive energy actually decreases going from V to Mn even though the number of valence electrons is increasing We can explain this effect by remembering that the d orbitals are progressively contracting as more protons are added to the nucleus For elements beyond V the orbital overlap is so poor that the d electrons are no longer effective in bonding and the valence electrons begin to unpair At this point the elements become magnetic Depending on the way the spins order metals and alloys in this part of the periodic table can be ferromagnetic spins on neighboring atoms aligned parallel as in the case of Fe or Ni or antiferromagnetic spins on neighboring atoms antiparallel as in the case of Mn We have seen the tradeoff between orbital overlap and magnetism before in Chapter in the context of paramagnetic transition metal complexes It is worth recalling that this behavior is predicted in the energy vs distance diagram of the hydrogen atom from Chapter At short interatomic distances or with strong overlap between atomic orbitals the spins of the electrons pair and a bond is formed Unpairing the electrons becomes favorable at larger interatomic distances where the overlap between orbitals is poor With strong overlap between orbitals of neighboring atoms the bonding energy exceeds the pairing energy and electrons spinpair With weaker overlap bonding is weak and spins unpair resulting in magnetic behavior Interestingly many alloys of the f elements the lanthanides are also magnetic because the f orbitals like the d orbitals are poorly shielded from the nuclear charge and are ineffective in bonding Strong permanent magnets often contain alloys of Nd Sm or Y usually with magnetic d elements such as Fe and Co Because the f orbitals are contracted and not very effective in bonding other physical properties of the lanthanides can also be affected For example it has been proposed that oxides of the f elements have weak surface interactions with polar molecules such as water because of forbital contraction Experimentally CeO ErO and HoO are observed to be hydrophobic whereas main group and early transition metal oxides eg AlO SiO TiO are quite hydrophilic Late transition metal alloys Although the bonding in the d series follows a normal volcano plot the situation is a bit more complex for alloys of Re Os Ir Pt and Au There is strong overlap between the d orbitals but because these elements contain more than five delectrons per atom they cannot make as many bonds as d or d elements with halffilled dshells such as Mo or W This progressive filling of the dband explains the steady decrease in bonding energy going from Os to Au Pt and Au are both soft metals with relatively low heats of vaporization However these metals especially Ir Pt and Au can combine with early transition metals to form stable alloys with very negative heats of formation and high melting points For example ZrC and Pt react to form a number of stable alloys ZrPt ZrPt ZrPt ZrPt plus carbon This reactivity is unusual because we normally think of Pt as a noble ie unreactive metal and because ZrC is a very stable refractory metal carbide The favorable combination of early and late transition metals has been interpreted as arising from a delectron acidbase interaction For example in HfPt Hf is the acid with an electron configuration of sd while Pt is the base with the electron configuration of sd They combine to create a stable salt product with a filled d electron configuration without promoting any electrons to higher orbitals The implication is that Pt donates delectrons to the dacid Zr or Hf However electronic structure calculations on model compounds show that much of the bonding energy in ZrPt and ZrPt arises from electron transfer from Zr to Pt not the other way around and the polarity of the resulting metalmetal bonds Regardless of the source of their stability some earlylate transition metal alloys are of particular interest for use in catalysis For example the alloy ScPt is a good catalyst for oxygen reduction in fuel cells Even though Sc is an active metal that is easily oxidized it is stabilized in the aqueous acid environment of the fuel cell by its strong interaction with Pt Filling of the d and sp bands In the d series we see magnetic behavior for elements and alloys between Cr and Ni Past Ni the elements Cu Zn Ga are no longer magnetic and they are very good electrical conductors implying that their valence electrons are highly delocalized We can understand this behavior by considering the overlap of s p and d orbitals all of which are close in energy The s and p have strong overlap and form a broad continuous band On the other hand the d electrons are contracted and form a relatively narrow band Progressing from the early d elements Sc Ti V we begin to fill the d orbitals which are not yet so contracted that they cannot contribute to bonding Thus the valence electrons in Sc Ti and V are all spinpaired except for a small number near the Fermi level that give rise to a weak Pauli paramagnetism Moving across the d series to the magnetic elements Fe Co Ni the dorbitals are now so contracted that their electrons unpair and we see cooperative ordering of spins ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism Referring to the band diagram at the right the d band is only partially filled and the Fermi level cuts through it For Cu Zn and Ga the d orbitals are even more contracted and the d band is thus more narrow but now it is completely filled and the Fermi level is in the sp band The strong orbital overlap in these bands results in spin pairing and a high degree of electron delocalization Consequently metals in this part of the periodic table Cu Ag are diamagnetic and are among the best electrical conductors at room temperature Finally at Ge the sp band is completely filled and the solid is a semiconductor Progressive filling of the d and sp bands going across the periodic table from Sc to Ge Materials are classified as diamagnetic if they contain no unpaired electrons Diamagnetic substances are very weakly repelled from an inhomogeneous magnetic field As we learned in Chapter molecules or ions that have unpaired spins are paramagnetic and are attracted to a magnet ie they move towards the high field region of an inhomogeneous field This attractive force results from the alignment of spins with the field but in the case of paramagnetism each molecule acts independently In metals alloys oxides and other solid state compounds the unpaired spins interact strongly with each other and can order spontaneously resulting in the cooperative magnetic phenomena described below A Uses of the term Homonuclear Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry

httpsstatuslibretextsorg A Vibrational Spectroscopy Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionVibrational ModesInfrared SpectroscopyRaman SpectroscopyReferencesOutside LinksProblems All molecules are constantly vibrating and can absorb energy from an incoming photon to increase their vibrations The two types of vibrational spectroscopy are infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy Vibrational spectroscopy is the science of measuring exactly which wavelengths of light are absorbed by a molecule This technique could be used identify an unknown molecule by comparing its absorption to that of other molecules Or vibrational spectroscopy could be used to gain further understanding of the physical properties of a known molecule Introduction Molecular vibration can be modeled by balls attached by springs Displacing an atom from its most stable position requires energy proportional to the displacement IR spectroscopy can be used to characterize a molecule is the energy of its vibrations falls in the infrared range Alternatively higher energy light can be absorbed the reemitted at a different wavelength andor in a different direction this leads to Raman spectroscopy So a molecule can absorb radiation to change bond lengths or positions with respect to the other atoms in the molecule From the number frequency and intensity of these absorptions or emissions we can gain insight into the composition of the sample being measured The number of different absorptions is indicative of the number of different atoms and shape of the molecule The frequency or wavelength absorbed is indicative of the energy of the bonds and vibrations And the intensity of the absorptions is related to the concentration of the analyte Vibrational Modes The different possible vibrations are called vibrational modes Vibrational modes are determined by all the different ways the atoms in the molecule can move with respect to eachother called the vibrational degrees of freedom Vibrational degrees of freedom differ from the total degrees of freedom in that translation movement through space and rotation do not contribute to the vibrational degrees of freedom To find the number of vibrational modes one must first know the point group of the molecule From there the point groups character table will list all of the possible symmetry operations for the molecule Each symmetry operation will leave some atoms in the molecule in place andor move other atoms in the molecule Count up the number of atoms that do not move for each symmetry operation and multiply that number by the symmetry operations contribution This gives the total representation of atomic motion From there the vibrational modes can be found by reducing the total representation according to the equation nhΣXRXIN where n is the number of modes with that symmetry h is the total number of symmetry operations XI is the number of irreducible representations the value calculated above XR is the number of reducible representations the entry in the character table and N is the number of identical symmetry operations Finally subtracting the rotational modes and translational modes from the reduced representation gives the number of vibrational modes Three of the vibrational modes for the CV point group Used with permission from httpenwikipediaorgwikiInfrared_spectroscopy Infrared Spectroscopy A vibrational mode will be observed in an infrared spectrum if it leads to a change in the molecular dipole moment Compared to Raman spectroscopy the infrared photon is completely absorbed and its energy is transfered to the vibration of the molecule not reemitted Different bonds have different energies associated with them and require different amounts of energy to stretch or bend In general the stronger the bond the more energy required to deform it So very weak bonds will only be deformed by low energy radiation and strong bonds will only be deformed by high energy radiation This leads to characteristic frequencies where only certain vibrations are absorbed For example CH bonds are typically the only bonds observed in the range from cm So if an absorption is present at that frequency it can be assumed that it is due to a CH bond Raman Spectroscopy A vibrational mode will be observed in Raman spectroscopy if it leads to a change in the polarizability of the electron cloud of a molecule If a photon has energy that is significantly higher than the energy of the vibrational states it may either be deflected without any change in energy or it may interact with the molecule and either take energy from it or give energy to it When the photon is absorbed and reemitted in a different direction it is called Rayleigh scattering and this is strongly dependent on the wavelength of the incoming light When there is a change in the energy of the photon it is called Stokes scattering or antiStokes scattering depending on whether energy is absorbed or lost by the molecule This change in the behavior of the incoming photons can be measured and will provide information about the concentration and chemical properties of the analyte Diagram used with

PDF Page ID BackgroundWaveNature of MatterOn WavesReferences All matter has intrinsic wave properties These are described mathematically by the Schrodinger Equations and its solutions The wavenature of electrons and other fundamental principles eg charge and momentum together produce the wave mechanics of electron The effects of electron wave mechanics are far reaching responsible for such phenomena as electricity emission and absorption and bonding and hybridization Background WaveNature of Matter Accurate explanations of atomic natural physical chemical phenomena are dependent on energy quantization The realization of this fundamental characteristic of matter was developed through treatment of a couple well known experiments notably Max Plancks explanation of black body radiation and Einsteins explanation of the photoelectric effect The conclusions of energy quantization were consolidated by Louis De Broglie as and by rearrangement On Waves Quantum mechanically an electron can be described by a wave function oscillating in space and time that has mean values equal to the expectation values of observables corresponding to given operators According to the Born interpretation of quantum mechanics the complex conjugate of this wavefunction icorrelates to the electrons positional probability density Electrons are fermions They are charged particles When they are confined by a potential to a limited space they display harmonics analogous to those of other wavelike phenomena This occurs most notable in atoms and molecules The hydrogen atom proves the most simple atomic example The three dimensional harmonics of an electron bound within the potential energy well of a proton results in what are conventionally called orbitals Orbitals are commonly depicted as contours of some percent of the complex conjugate of the electrons approximate wave function though realistically without external potentials they diffuse infinitely A bound electron occupies higher harmonics of the bound state with increasing energy Energy can only be increased in specific quanta as demanded for the wave function to exist The discrete energy levels of higher harmonics correspond to higher orbitals Electrons can gain energy to exist in a higher orbital When this process occurs via interaction with electromagnetic radiation it is referred to as absorption Similarly the regression of an electron into a lower energy orbital results in the release of electromagnetic radiation and is referred to as emission Because of the quantized energy levels demanded by a bound system electrons in a molecule or atom can only absorb or emit light at specific frequencies which depend on the properties of the system Certain materials have energy level spacing such that excitation by an energy source can produce a greater number of electrons in an excited state than in the ground state This is known as population inversion When this happens for a transition which releases light upon relaxation light of a specific nature is produced that has great practical importance This light is monochromatic and can be channelled back and forh through the medium gain medium and allowed only to disperse through a very narrow slit to produce monochromatic directional coherent light source The apparatus is called a LASER which is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation The inherent charge of electron incites movement of the particle in accordance to the forces described by coulombs law Rotational motion of a charged particle produces an electric field The potential of an electron attraction to positive charge can be used to store energy in chemical form The motion of electrons by batteries or other sources through conductive media such as copper wire can be facilitated to do work Computer Light Electronic absorption and emission within roughly to nm produces radiation that is in the visible spectrum the sky is blue because of the interaction of light from the sun with electrons in atoms in the atmosphere in whats known as scattering Scattering of this type occurs to the inverse cube of wavelength so light with shorter wavelength blue in the visible is scattered much more than other wavelengths The other light passes through the atmosphere or something maybe i have this backwards electrons can tunnel due to ther wavenature quantum mechanical tunneling is where a particle goes somewhere that is classically impossible meaning that it simpley did not have enough energy to to past a potential barrier ut it did We experts in science call this quantum weirdness There are a lot of electrons but perhaps not more than there are stupid people in the world This page needs revision Most basic wave to satisfy boundary conditions which are is The superposition principle allows for the fourier theorem which allows an infinite number of such waves to be combined to form any any curve that obeys the requirements of a

electrochemical reactions Simple redox reactions for example H I HI can be balanced by inspection but for more complex reactions it is helpful to have a foolproof systematic method The ionelectron method allows one to balance redox reactions regardless of their complexity We illustrate this method with two examples Example I is oxidized to IO by MnO which is reduced to Mn How can this reaction be balanced In the ionelectron method we follow a series of four steps Step A Write out the unbalanced reaction and identify the elements that are undergoing redox MnO I IO Mn The elements undergoing redox are Mn and I Step B Separate the reaction into two half reactions balancing the element undergoing redox in each MnO Mn I IO Step A Balance the oxygen atoms by adding water to one side of each half reaction MnO Mn HO HO I IO Step B Balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H ions H MnO Mn HO The left side has a net charge of and the right side has a net charge of HO I IO H The left side has a net charge of and the right side has a net charge of Step C Balance the overall charge by adding electrons H e MnO Mn HO The left side has a charge of while the right side has a charge of They are balanced HO I IO H e The left side has a charge of while the right side has a charge of They are balanced Note We did not need to explicitly determine the oxidation states of Mn or I to arrive at the correct number of electrons in each half reaction Step Combine the half reactions so that there are equal numbers of electrons on the left and right sides H e MnO Mn HO HO I IO H e H e HO MnO I IO Mn HO e H Cancel the H electrons and water H e HO MnO I IO Mn HO e H The overall balanced reaction is therefore H MnO I IO Mn HO Check your work by making sure that all elements and charges are balanced Step If the reaction occurs under basic conditions we add OH to each side to cancel H H OH MnO I IO Mn HO OH The H OH will become HO so the overall balanced reaction is HO MnO I IO Mn OH Again it is a good idea to check and make sure that all of the elements are balanced and that the charge is the same on both sides If this is not the case you need to find the error in one of the earlier steps Example Redox reaction of SO and HO SO HO SO HO Which elements are undergoing redox S and O Step Write out half reactions balancing the element undergoing redox SO SO HO HO Step A Balance oxygen already balanced Step B Balance hydrogen SO SO HO H HO Step C Balance charge by adding electrons SO SO e HO H e HO Step Combine the half reactions so that there are equal numbers of electrons on the left and right sides already equal Overall balanced reaction SO HO H SO HO Note that again we did not need to know the formal oxidation states of S or O in the reactants and products in order to balance the reaction In this case assigning the oxidation states would be rather complex because SO and SO both contain sulfur in more than one oxidation state Page ID No headers Welcome to the

century Modern atomic absorption spectroscopy has its beginnings in as a result of the independent work of A C Walsh and C T J Alkemade Commercial instruments were in place by the early s and the importance of atomic absorption as an analytical technique was soon evident Instrumentation Atomic absorption spectrophotometers use the same singlebeam or doublebeam optics described earlier for molecular absorption spectrophotometers see Figure and Figure There is however an important additional need in atomic absorption spectroscopywe must covert the analyte into free atoms In most cases our analyte is in solution form If our sample is a solid then we must bring it into solution before the analysis When analyzing a lake sediment for Cu Zn and Fe for example we bring the analytes into solution as Cu Zn and Fe by extracting them with a suitable reagent For this reason only the introduction of solution samples is considered in this text What reagent we choose to use depends on our research goals If we need to know the total amount of metal in the sediment then we might use a microwave digestion using a mixture of concentrated acids such as HNO HCl and HF This destroys the sediments matrix and brings everything into solution On the other hand if our interest is biologically available metals we might extract the sample under milder conditions such as a dilute solution of HCl or CHCOOH at room temperature Atomization The process of converting an analyte to a free gaseous atom is called atomization Converting an aqueous analyte into a free atom requires that we strip away the solvent volatilize the analytes and if necessary dissociate the analyte into free atoms Desolvating an aqueous solution of CuCl for example leaves us with solid particulates of CuCl Converting the particulate CuCl to gas phases atoms of Cu and Cl requires thermal energy There are two common atomization methods flame atomization and electrothermal atomization although a few elements are atomized using other methods Flame Atomizer Figure shows a typical flame atomization assembly with closeup views of several key components In the unit shown here the aqueous sample is drawn into the assembly by passing a highpressure stream of compressed air past the end of a capillary tube immersed in the sample When the sample exits the nebulizer it strikes a glass impact bead converting it into a fine aerosol mist within the spray chamber The aerosol mist is swept through the spray chamber by the combustion gasescompressed air and acetylene in this caseto the burner head where the flames thermal energy desolvates the aerosol mist to a dry aerosol of small solid particles The flames thermal energy then volatilizes the particles producing a vapor consisting of molecular species ionic species and free atoms Compressed air is one of the two gases whose combustion produces the flame Figure Flame atomization assembly with expanded views of a the burner head showing the burner slot where the flame is located b the nebulizers impact bead and c the interior of the spray chamber Although the unit shown here is from an older instrument the basic components of a modern flame AA spectrometer are the same Burner The slot burner in Figure a provides a long optical pathlength and a stable flame Because absorbance increases linearly with the path length a long path length provides greater sensitivity A stable flame minimizes uncertainty due to fluctuations in the flame The burner is mounted on an adjustable stage that allows the entire assembly to move horizontally and vertically Horizontal adjustments ensure that the flame is aligned with the instruments optical path Vertical adjustments adjust the height within the flame from which absorbance is monitored This is important because two competing processes affect the concentration of free atoms in the flame The more time the analyte spends in the flame the greater the atomization efficiency thus the production of free atoms increases with height On the other hand a longer residence time allows more opportunity for the free atoms to combine with oxygen to form a molecular oxide For an easily oxidized metal such as Cr the concentration of free atoms is greatest just above the burner head For metals such as Ag which are difficult to oxidize the concentration of free atoms increases steadily with height Figure Other atoms show concentration profiles that maximize at a characteristic height Figure Absorbance versus height profiles for Ag and Cr in flame atomic absorption spectroscopy Flame The flames temperature which affects the efficiency of atomization depends on the fueloxidant mixture several examples of which are listed in Table Of these the airacetylene and the nitrous oxideacetylene flames are the most popular Normally the fuel and oxidant are mixed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio however a fuelrich mixture may be necessary for easily oxidized analytes Table Fuels and Oxidants Used for Flame Combustion fuel oxidant temperature range oC natural gas air hydrogen air acetylene air acetylene nitrous oxide acetylene oxygen Figure shows a crosssection through the flame looking down the source radiations optical path The primary combustion zone is usually rich in gas combustion products that emit radiation limiting is usefulness for atomic absorption The interzonal region generally is rich in free atoms and provides the best location for measuring atomic absorption The hottest part of the flame is typically cm above the primary combustion zone As atoms approach the flames secondary combustion zone the decrease in temperature allows for formation of stable molecular species Figure Profile of typical flame using a slot burner The relative size of each zone depends on many factors including the choice of fuel and oxidant and their relative proportions Sample Introduction The most common means for introducing samples into a flame atomizer is a continuous aspiration in which the sample flows through the burner while we monitor the absorbance Continuous aspiration is sample intensive typically requiring from mL of sample Flame microsampling allows us to introduce a discrete sample of fixed volume and is useful when we have a limited amount of sample or when the samples matrix is incompatible with the flame atomizer For example continuously aspirating a sample that has a high concentration of dissolved solidssea water for example comes to mindmay buildup a solid deposit on the burner head that obstructs the flame and that lowers the absorbance Flame microsampling is accomplished using a micropipet to place μL of sample in a Teflon funnel connected to the nebulizer or by dipping the nebulizer tubing into the sample for a short time Dip sampling is usually accomplished with an automatic sampler The signal for flame microsampling is a transitory peak whose height or area is proportional to the amount of analyte that is injected Advantages and Disadvantages of Flame Atomization The principal advantage of flame atomization is the reproducibility with which the sample is introduced into the spectrophotometer A significant disadvantage to flame atomizers is that the efficiency of atomization may be quite poor There are two reasons for poor atomization efficiency First the majority of the aerosol droplets produced during nebulization are too large to be carried to the flame by the combustion gases Consequently as much as of the sample never reaches the flame A second reason for poor atomization efficiency is that the large volume of combustion gases significantly dilutes the sample Together these contributions to the efficiency of atomization reduce sensitivity because the analytes concentration in the flame may be a factor of less than that in solution This is the reason for the waste line shown at the bottom of the spray chamber in Figure Electrothermal Atomizers A significant improvement in sensitivity is achieved by using the resistive heating of a graphite tube in place of a flame A typical electrothermal atomizer also known as a graphite furnace consists of a cylindrical graphite tube approximately cm in length and mm in diameter As shown in Figure the graphite tube is housed in an sealed assembly that has optically transparent windows at each end A continuous stream of an inert gas is passed through the furnace protecting the graphite tube from oxidation and removing the gaseous products produced during atomization A power supply is used to pass a current through the graphite tube resulting in resistive heating Figure Diagram showing a crosssection of an electrothermal analyzer Samples of between μL are injected into the graphite tube through a small hole at the top of the tube Atomization is achieved in three stages In the first stage the sample is dried to a solid residue using a current that raises the temperature of the graphite tube to about oC In the second stage which is called ashing the temperature is increased to between oC At these temperatures any organic material in the sample is converted to CO and HO and volatile inorganic materials are vaporized These gases are removed by the inert gas flow In the final stage the sample is atomized by rapidly increasing the temperature to between oC The result is a transient absorbance peak whose height or area is proportional to the absolute amount of analyte injected into the graphite tube Together the three stages take approximately s with most of this time used for drying and ashing the sample Electrothermal atomization provides a significant improvement in sensitivity by trapping the gaseous analyte in the small volume within the graphite tube The analytes concentration in the resulting vapor phase may be as much as greater than in a flame atomization This improvement in sensitivityand the resulting improvement in detection limitsis offset by a significant decrease in precision Atomization efficiency is strongly influenced by the samples contact with the graphite tube which is difficult to control reproducibly Miscellaneous Atomization Methods A few elements may be atomized by a chemical reaction that produces a volatile product Elements such as As Se Sb Bi Ge Sn Te and Pb for example form volatile hydrides when reacted with NaBH in acid An inert gas carries the volatile hydrides to either a flame or to a heated quartz observation tube situated in the optical path Mercury is determined by the coldvapor method in which it is reduced to elemental mercury with SnCl The volatile Hg is carried by an inert gas to an unheated observation tube situated in the instruments optical path Quantitative Applications Atomic absorption is widely used for the analysis of trace metals in a variety of sample matrices Using Zn as an example atomic absorption methods have been developed for its determination in samples as diverse as water and wastewater air blood urine muscle tissue hair milk breakfast cereals shampoos alloys industrial plating baths gasoline oil sediments and rocks Developing a quantitative atomic absorption method requires several considerations including choosing a method of atomization selecting the wavelength and slit width preparing the sample for analysis minimizing spectral and chemical interferences and selecting a method of standardization Each of these topics is considered in this section Developing a Quantitative Method Flame or Electrothermal Atomization The most important factor in choosing a method of atomization is the analytes concentration Because of its greater sensitivity it takes less analyte to achieve a given absorbance when using electrothermal atomization Table which compares the amount of analyte needed to achieve an absorbance of when using flame atomization and electrothermal atomization is useful when selecting an atomization method For example flame atomization is the method of choice if our samples contain mg ZnL but electrothermal atomization is the best choice for samples containing μg ZnL Table Concentration of Analyte Yielding an

Pro b As mgL by hydride vaporization Hg mgL by coldvapor and Sn mgL by hydride vaporization Selecting the Wavelength and Slit Width The source for atomic absorption is a hollow cathode lamp consisting of a cathode and anode enclosed within a glass tube filled with a low pressure of Ne or Ar Figure Applying a potential across the electrodes ionizes the filler gas The positively charged gas ions collide with the negatively charged cathode sputtering atoms from the cathodes surface Some of the sputtered atoms are in the excited state and emit radiation characteristic of the metals from which the cathode was manufactured By fashioning the cathode from the metallic analyte a hollow cathode lamp provides emission lines that correspond to the analytes absorption spectrum Because atomic absorption lines are narrow we need to use a line source instead of a continuum source compare for example Figure with Figure The effective bandwidth when using a continuum source is roughly larger than an atomic absorption line thus PT P T and A Because a hollow cathode lamp is a line source PT and P have different values giving a T and A Figure Photo of a typical multielemental hollow cathode lamp The cathode in this lamp is fashioned from an alloy containing Co Cr Cu Fe Mn and Ni and is surrounded by a glass shield to isolate it from the anode The lamp is filled with Ne gas Also shown is the process leading to atomic emission See the text for an explanation Each element in a hollow cathode lamp provides several atomic emission lines that we can use for atomic absorption Usually the wavelength that provides the best sensitivity is the one we choose to use although a less sensitive wavelength may be more appropriate for a larger concentration of analyte For the Cr hollow cathode lamp in Table for example the best sensitivity is obtained using a wavelength of nm Another consideration is the intensity of the emission line If several emission lines meet our need for sensitivity we may wish to use the emission line with the largest relative P because there is less uncertainty in measuring P and PT When analyzing samples containing mg CrL for example the first three wavelengths in Table provide an appropriate sensitivity The wavelengths of nm and nm however have a greater P and will provide less uncertainty in the measured absorbance Table Atomic Emission Lines for a Cr Hollow Cathode Lamp wavelength nm slit width nm mg CrL giving A P relative The emission spectrum from a hollow cathode lamp includes besides emission lines for the analyte additional emission lines for impurities present in the metallic cathode and from the filler gas These additional lines are a source of stray radiation that leads to an instrumental deviation from Beers law The monochromators slit width is set as wide as possible improving the throughput of radiation while at the same time being narrow enough to eliminate the stray radiation Preparing the Sample Flame and electrothermal atomization require that the sample be in solution Solid samples are brought into solution by dissolving in an appropriate solvent If the sample is not soluble it may be digested either on a hotplate or by microwave using HNO HSO or HClO Alternatively we can extract the analyte using a Soxhlet extractor Liquid samples may be analyzed directly or extracted if the matrix is incompatible with the method of atomization A serum sample for instance is difficult to aspirate when using flame atomization and may produce an unacceptably high background absorbance when using electrothermal atomization A liquidliquid extraction using an organic solvent and a chelating agent is frequently used to concentrate analytes Dilute solutions of Cd Co Cu Fe Pb Ni and Zn for example can be concentrated by extracting with a solution of ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate in methyl isobutyl ketoneSee Chapter to review different methods for preparing samples for analysis Minimizing Spectral Interference A spectral interference occurs when an analytes absorption line overlaps with an interferents absorption line or band Because they are so narrow the overlap of two atomic absorption lines is seldom a problem On the other hand a molecules broad absorption band or the scattering of source radiation is a potentially serious spectral interference An important consideration when using a flame as an atomization source is its effect on the measured absorbance Among the products of combustion are molecular species that exhibit broad absorption bands and particulates that scatter radiation from the source If we fail to compensate for these spectral interference then the intensity of transmitted radiation decreases The result is an apparent increase in the samples absorbance Fortunately absorption and scattering of radiation by the flame are corrected by analyzing a blank Spectral interferences also occur when components of the samples matrix other than the analyte react to form molecular species such as oxides and hydroxides The resulting absorption and scattering constitutes the samples background and may present a significant problem particularly at wavelengths below nm where the scattering of radiation becomes more important If we know the composition of the samples matrix then we can prepare our samples using an identical matrix In this case the background absorption is the same for both the samples and standards Alternatively if the background is due to a known matrix component then we can add that component in excess to all samples and standards so that the contribution of the naturally occurring interferent is insignificant Finally many interferences due to the samples matrix can be eliminated by increasing the atomization temperature For example by switching to a higher temperature flame it may be possible to prevent the formation of interfering oxides and hydroxides If the identity of the matrix interference is unknown or if it is not possible to adjust the flame or furnace conditions to eliminate the interference then we must find another method to compensate for the background interference Several methods have been developed to compensate for matrix interferences and most atomic absorption spectrophotometers include one or more of these methods One of the most common methods for background correction is to use a continuum source such as a D lamp Because a D lamp is a continuum source absorbance of its radiation by the analytes narrow absorption line is negligible Only the background therefore absorbs radiation from the D lamp Both the analyte and the background on the other hand absorb the hollow cathodes radiation Subtracting the absorbance for the D lamp from that for the hollow cathode lamp gives a corrected absorbance that compensates for the background interference Although this method of background correction may be quite effective it does assume that the background absorbance is constant over the range of wavelengths passed by the monochromator If this is not true subtracting the two absorbances may underestimate or overestimate the background Other methods of background correction have been developed including Zeeman effect background correction and SmithHieftje background correction both of which are included in some commercially available atomic absorption spectrophotometers Consult the chapters additional resources for additional information Minimizing Chemical Interferences The quantitative analysis of some elements is complicated by chemical interferences occurring during atomization The two most common chemical interferences are the formation of nonvolatile compounds containing the analyte and ionization of the analyte One example of the formation of nonvolatile compounds is the effect of PO or Al on the flame atomic absorption analysis of Ca In one study for example adding ppm Al to a solution of ppm Ca decreased the calcium ions absorbance from to while adding ppm PO to a similar solution of Ca decreased the absorbance from to These interferences were attributed to the formation of nonvolatile particles of CaPO and an AlCaO oxide When using flame atomization we can minimize the formation of nonvolatile compounds by increasing the flames temperature either by changing the fueltooxidant ratio or by switching to a different combination of fuel and oxidant Another approach is to add a releasing agent or a protecting agent to the samples A releasing agent is a species that reacts with the interferent releasing the analyte during atomization Adding Sr or La to solutions of Ca for example minimizes the effect of PO and Al by reacting in place of the analyte Thus adding ppm SrCl to the CaPO and CaAl mixtures described in the previous paragraph increased the absorbance to A protecting agent reacts with the analyte to form a stable volatile complex Adding ww EDTA to the CaPO solution described in the previous paragraph increased the absorbance to Ionization interferences occur when thermal energy from the flame or the electrothermal atomizer is sufficient to ionize the analyte where M is the analyte Because the absorption spectra for M and M are different the position of the equilibrium in reaction affects absorbance at wavelengths where M absorbs To limit ionization we add a high concentration of an ionization suppressor which is simply a species that ionizes more easily than the analyte If the concentration of the ionization suppressor is sufficient then the increased concentration of electrons in the flame pushes reaction to the left preventing the analytes ionization Potassium and cesium are frequently used as an ionization suppressor because of their low ionization energy Standardizing the Method Because Beers law also applies to atomic absorption we might expect atomic absorption calibration curves to be linear In practice however most atomic absorption calibration curves are nonlinear or linear for only a limited range of concentrations Nonlinearity in atomic absorption is a consequence of instrumental limitations including stray radiation from the hollow cathode lamp and the variation in molar absorptivity across the absorption line Accurate quantitative work therefore often requires a suitable means for computing the calibration curve from a set of standards Most instruments include several different algorithms for computing the calibration curve The instrument in my lab for example includes five algorithms Three of the algorithms fit absorbance data using linear quadratic or cubic polynomial functions of the analytes concentration It also includes two algorithms that fit the concentrations of the standards to quadratic functions of the absorbance When possible a quantitative analysis is best conducted using external standards Unfortunately matrix interferences are a frequent problem particularly when using electrothermal atomization For this reason the method of standard additions is often used One limitation to this method of standardization however is the requirement that there be a linear relationship between absorbance and concentration The best way to appreciate the theoretical and practical details discussed in this section is to carefully examine a typical analytical method Although each method is unique the following description of the determination of Cu and Zn in biological tissues provides an instructive example of a typical procedure The description here is based on Bhattacharya S K Goodwin T G Crawford A J Anal Lett and Crawford A J Bhattacharya S K Varian Instruments at Work Number AA April Representative Method Determination of Cu and Zn in Tissue Samples Description of Method Copper and zinc are isolated from tissue samples by digesting the sample with HNO after first removing any fatty tissue The concentration of copper and zinc in the supernatant are determined by atomic absorption using an airacetylene flame Procedure Tissue samples are obtained by a muscle needle biopsy and dried for h at oC to remove all traces of moisture The fatty tissue in the dried samples is removed by extracting overnight with anhydrous ether After removing the ether the sample is dried to obtain the fatfree dry tissue weight FFDT The sample is digested at oC for h using mL of M HNO After centrifuging at rpm for minutes the supernatant is transferred to a mL volumetric flask The digestion is repeated two more times for hours each using mL aliquots of M HNO These supernatants are added to the mL volumetric flask which is diluted to volume with M HNO The concentrations of Cu and Zn in the diluted supernatant are determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy using an airacetylene flame and external standards Copper is analyzed at a wavelength of nm with a slit width of nm and zinc is analyzed at nm with a slit width of nm Background correction using a D lamp is necessary for zinc Results are reported as mg of Cu or Zn per gram of FFDT Questions Describe the appropriate matrix for the external standards and for the blank The matrix for the standards and the blank should match the matrix of the samples thus an appropriate matrix is M HNO Any interferences from other components of the sample matrix are minimized by background correction Why is a background correction necessary for the analysis of Zn but not for the analysis of Cu Background correction compensates for background absorption and scattering due to interferents in the sample Such interferences are most severe when using a wavelength less than nm This is the case for Zn but not for Cu A Cu hollow cathode lamp has several emission lines Explain why this method uses the line at nm wavelength nm slit width nm mg CuL for A P relative With mg CuL giving an absorbance of the emission line at nm has the best sensitivity In addition it is the most intense emission line which decreases the uncertainty in the measured absorbance Example To evaluate the method described in Representative Method a series of external standard is prepared and analyzed providing the results shown here μg CumL absorbance μg CumL absorbance A bovine liver standard reference material was used to evaluate the methods accuracy After drying and extracting the sample a mg FFDT tissue sample gives an absorbance of Report the amount of copper in the sample as μg Cug FFDT Solution Linear regression of absorbance versus the concentration of Cu in the standards gives a calibration curve with the following equation Substituting the samples absorbance into the calibration equation gives the concentration of copper as μgmL The concentration of copper in the tissue sample therefore is Evaluation of Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy Scale of Operation Atomic absorption spectroscopy is ideally suited for the analysis of trace and ultratrace analytes particularly when using electrothermal atomization For minor and major analyte sample can be diluted before the analysis Most analyses use a macro or a meso sample The small volume requirement for electrothermal atomization or flame microsampling however makes practical the analysis micro and ultramicro samples See Figure to review the meaning of macro and meso for describing samples and the meaning of major minor and ultratrace for describing analytes Accuracy If spectral and chemical interferences are minimized an accuracy of is routinely attainable When the calibration curve is nonlinear accuracy may be improved by using a pair of standards whose absorbances closely bracket the samples absorbance and assuming that the change in absorbance is linear over this limited concentration range Determinate errors for electrothermal atomization are often greater than that obtained with flame atomization due to more serious matrix interferences Precision For absorbance values greater than the relative standard deviation for atomic absorption is for flame atomization and for electrothermal atomization The principle limitation is the variation in the concentration of free analyte atoms resulting from variations in the rate of aspiration nebulization and atomization when using a flame atomizer and the consistency of injecting samples when using electrothermal atomization Sensitivity The sensitivity of a flame atomic absorption analysis is influenced strongly by the flames composition and by the position in the flame from which we monitor the absorbance Normally the sensitivity of an analysis is optimized by aspirating a standard solution of the analyte and adjusting operating conditions such as the fueltooxidant ratio the nebulizer flow rate and the height of the burner to give the greatest absorbance With electrothermal atomization sensitivity is influenced by the drying and ashing stages that precede atomization The temperature and time used for each stage must be optimized for each type of sample See Chapter for several strategies for optimizing experiments Sensitivity is also influenced by the samples matrix We have already noted for example that sensitivity can be decreased by chemical interferences An increase in sensitivity may be realized by adding a low molecular weight alcohol ester or ketone to the solution or by using an organic solvent Selectivity Due to the narrow width of absorption lines atomic absorption provides excellent selectivity Atomic absorption can be used for the analysis of over elements at concentrations at or below the level of μgL Time Cost and Equipment The analysis time when using flame atomization is short with sample throughputs of determinations per hour when using a fully automated system Electrothermal atomization requires substantially more time per analysis with maximum sample throughputs of determinations per hour The cost of a new instrument ranges from between for flame atomization and from for electrothermal atomization The more expensive instruments in each price range include doublebeam optics automatic samplers and can be programmed for multielemental analysis by allowing the wavelength and hollow cathode lamp to be changed automatically

revolution in science In Felix Bloch had the idea to take the quantum theory and apply it to solids In Walter Heitler and Fritz London discovered bands very closely spaced orbitals with not much difference in energy In this image orbitals are represented by the black horizontal lines and they are being filled with an increasing number of electrons as their amount increases Eventually as more orbitals are added the space in between them decreases to hardly anything and as a result a band is formed where the orbitals have been filled Different metals will produce different combinations of filled and half filled bands Sodiums bands are shown with the rectangles Filled bands are colored in blue As you can see bands may overlap each other the bands are shown askew to be able to tell the difference between different bands The lowest unoccupied band is called the conduction band and the highest occupied band is called the valence band Bands will follow a trend as you go across a period In Na the s band is full In Mg the s band is full In Al the s band is full and the p ban is full and so on The probability of finding an electron in the conduction band is shown by the equation The E in the equation stands for the change in energy or energy gap t stands for the temperature and R is a bonding constant That equation and this table below show how the bigger difference in energy is or gap between the valence band and the conduction band the less likely electrons are to be found in the conduction band This is because they cannot be excited enough to make the jump up to the

large that electrons cannot make the energy jump from the valence band to the conduction band C Semiconductors Semiconductors have a small energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band Electrons can make the jump up to the conduction band but not with the same ease as they do in conductors There are two different kinds of semiconductors intrinsic and extrinsic i Intrinsic Semiconductors An intrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor in its pure state For every electron that jumps into the conduction band the missing electron will generate a hole that can move freely in the valence band The number of holes will equal the number of electrons that have jumped ii Extrinsic Semiconductors In extrinsic semiconductors the band gap is controlled by purposefully adding small impurities to the material This process is called doping Doping or adding impurities to the lattice can change the electrical conductivity of the lattice and therefore vary the efficiency of the semiconductor In extrinsic semiconductors the number of holes will not equal the number of electrons jumped There are two different kinds of extrinsic semiconductors ptype positive charge doped and

anions Figure The Frenkel defect within the NaCl structure CC BYSA VladVD via Wikipedia The number of Frenkel Defects can be calculated using the equation where is the number of normally occupied positions is the number of available positions for the moving ion the of formation is the enthalpy formation of one Frenkel defect and is the gas constant Frenkel defects are intrinsic defects because the existence causes the Gibbs energy of a crystal to decrease which means it is favorable to occur Solids Found with a Frenkel Defect The crystal lattices are relatively open and the coordination

requirements are needed in order for the Frenkel defect to occur in an atom What are the differences between the Schottky defect and the Frenkel defect Answers A low coordination number as well as having the crystal lattices open for the molecule The Frenkel defect causes an cation to leave its own lattice and go to another while Sckhotty defect depicts that an equal number of cations and

structure the radius of Fluorine is about equivalent to that of Hydrogen This rotation occurs about a central axis midway between the two distal atoms of the molecule creating two equal radii from the middle of the HH or FF bond to the outer boundary of each H or F atom This rotation occurs in the x y and z directions of the central axis as well as all manner of combinations of these three variables The rotation of the molecule in all directions creates what can be though of as a spherical shell the boundary of which is created by the distal atoms Some common uses for solid hydrogen

These compounds are important industrially for example some transition metal carbides and nitrides Figure B Different atomic mechanisms of alloy formation showing pure metal substitutional and interstitial structures Image used with permission from Wikipedia With the interstitial mechanism one atom is usually much smaller than the other so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix called the interstices This is referred to as an interstitial alloy Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix Stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub

ions There are also metals recognized as essential elements although their roles in living organisms are not clear Bioinorganic chemistry the study of the functions of metals in biological systems using the knowledge and methods of inorganic chemistry has progressed remarkably in recent years The following list shows typical bioactive substances containing metals Electron carriers Fe cytochrome ironsulfur protein Cu blue copper protein Metal storage compound Fe ferritin transferrin Zn metallothionein Oxygen transportation agent Fe hemoglobin myoglobin Cu hemocyanin Photosynthesis Mg

metalloenzymes are Coordinative activation coordination form electronic donating steric effect Redox metal oxidation state Information communication and in many cases reaction environments are regulated by biopolymers such as proteins and selective reactions are performed Examples of actions of metals other than by metalloenzymes include Mg MgATP energy transfer NaK ion pumping Ca transfer of hormone functions muscle contraction nerve transfer blood coagulation are some of the important roles of metals a Oxidation Oxidation reactions in living systems are fundamental to life and many studies of these systems have been performed In particular the mechanisms of oxygen gas transportation by hemoglobin and monooxygen oxidation by the iron porphyrin compounds named P have been studied at length Oxygen gas transportation which has been studied for many years is described below Iron porphyrins hemoglobin and myoglobin and the copper compound hemocyanin are involved in the transportation of oxygen gas in air to cells in living organisms The basis of this function is reversible bonding and dissociation of dioxygen to iron or copper ions In order to perform these functions metals must be in oxidation states and coordination environments suitable for the reversible coordination of dioxygen The iron porphyrin compound hemoglobin is found in red bloods of human beings and other animals Hemoglobin has the structure of heme iron with four iron porphyrin units combined with a globin protein Dioxygen is transported in blood by being coordinated to ferrous ions in the hem iron unit The Fe II ion is pentacoordinate with four nitrogen atoms of porphyrin and a nitrogen atom of the polypeptide histidine and becomes hexacoordinate when a dioxygen coordinates to it The spin state of Fe II changes from high spin to low spin upon the coordination of dioxygen The high spin FeII is above the plane of porphyrin because it is too large to fit in the available space When the FeII ion becomes low spin upon dioxygen coordination the size of the iron ion decreases and it just fits into the hole of the porphyrin molecule This molecularlevel movement has attracted interest as an allosteric effect because it affects the whole protein through the histidine coordinate bond and governs the specific bond of a dioxygen molecule Oxidation of the FeII ion of a hem molecule is prevented by a macromolecular protein and if the hem iron is taken out of the prote in FeII ion is oxidized to FeIII and two porphyrin rings are bridged by a peroxide O which finally changes to a bridging Ostructure When the hem is in this state it loses the ability to coordinate to the dioxygen molecule Based on this phenomenon a synthetic porphyrin that is able reversibly to coordinate to a dioxygen by suppressing dimerization of the iron porphyrin has been developed and was named the picket fence porphyrin after its three dimensional form b Nitrogen fixation The reaction which converts the nitrogen in air into ammonia is basic to all life Nitrogen fixation the reaction to fix atmospheric nitrogen to form ammonia is carried out by Rhizobium in the roots of legumes or by bacteria in algae in an anaerobic atmosphere All animals and plants including mankind were depended on biological nitrogen fixation as a source of nitrogen for protein and other compounds containing nitrogen before the invention of the HarberBosch process An enzyme named nitrogenase catalyzes this reaction Nitrogenase contains ironsulfur and ironmolybdenum sulfur proteins and reduces dinitrogen by coordination and cooperative proton and electron transfers while using MgATP as an energy source Because of the importance of this reaction attempts to clarify the structure of nitrogenase and to develop artificial catalysts for nitrogen fixation have continued for many years Recently the structure of an active center in nitrogenase called ironmolybdenum cofactor was clarified by single crystal Xray analysis Figure According to this analysis its structure has FeMoS and FeS clusters connected through S Figure Structure of FeMo cofactor in nitrogenase It is believed that dinitrogen is activated by coordination between the two clusters On the other hand the portion called P cluster consists of two FeS clusters The roles and reaction mechanism of both parts are not yet clear c Photosynthesis The formation of glucose and dioxygen by the reaction of carbon dioxide and water is a skillful reaction using photoenergy and in which chlorophyll Figure which is a magnesium porphyrin and a manganese cluster complex plays the central role A chloroplast contains photosystem I PSI and photosystem II PSII which use light energy to reduce carbon dioxide and to oxidize water Chlorophyll is a fundamental component of PSI Chlorophyll is a porphyrin complex of magnesium and is responsible for the green colors of leaves It plays an important role in receiving light energy and transferring it to redox reaction systems Chlorophyll is excited from the singlet ground state to the singlet excited state by light the energy of the excited state is transferred to an acceptor within ps and the resultant energy reduces an ironsulfur complex and is finally used for reduction of carbon dioxide in subsequent dark reactions Since charge separation by photochemical excitation is the most important first stage studies on photoinduced electron transfer are have been actively performed using various kinds of porphyrin compounds as models of chlorophylls PSI which obtains oxidizing energy by electron transfer converts ADP to ATP Figure Chlorophyll a On the other hand the oxidized form of PSII oxidizes water through a chain of redox reactions of oxo cluster complexes of manganese and generates oxygen Since four electrons shift in the reduction of MnIV to Mn II in this reaction at least two manganese species are involved Probably a cluster complex which contains two MnII and two MnIV species mediates the electron transfer via four step reactions However the details of this reaction are as yet unclear because it is very difficult to isolate this cluster and to analyze its structure The electron transfer stage is being studied at present by using various manganese complexes as model systems Photosynthesis is a very interesting research theme in bioinorganic chemistry as it involves a few metal ions a porphyrin sulfide and oxide clusters that constitute a cycle of subtle electron transfer and redox reactions and generate oxygen gas by photolysis of water and produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide by reductive dark reactions Recently the reaction center of a photosynthetic bacteria was crystallized and J Deisenhofer and his

structures of Charged MoleculesMultiple Bonds in Lewis StruturesProblemsAnswersReferencesOutside LinksContributors Lewis Structures are very similar to electron dot diagrams except for the fact that shared electrons between atoms are shown as lines Lone pairs of electrons themselves are usually represented by dots around the atoms These diagrams are helpful because they allow us to predict the shape of the molecule and see the positions of each atom relative to the others Introduction In Gilbert Lewis Newton introduced a way to show the bonding of atoms in a molecule though diagrams Creating Lewis Structures is rather simple and only requires a small series of steps and little bit of math Basic Steps for Simple Structures Lewis Structure are very simple to construct and only take a few short steps Make sure to have a paper and pencil handy because you will be drawing these molecules as well as doing some simple math For this module we will use Boron trifluoride as our example First you write the the formula using atomic symbols BF The next step requires you to pick the least electronegative atom to be your central atom In this case boron B will be our central atom Next you must sum of the total amount of valence electrons in the outer most orbital of each atom Boron contains valence electrons while the fluorine atoms contain valence electrons each The total amount of electrons we have to work with is electrons In some cases there may be a charge on the molecule you are working on If this charge is negative then you add the value of that charge to the amount of electrons you totaled up Whereas if the charge is positive then you subtract that value from the amount that you totaled up In this case we do not have a charge on our molecule so we will stick to using electrons The next step requires some drawing Draw out your central atom and place the three fluorine atoms a small distance away from it The fluorine molecules should be an equal distance away from each other Next you must draw a short line connecting the boron atom to each of the fluorine atom These short lines each represent electrons that are being shared between the two bonded atoms Because we have lines in this diagram it means that we have used up of our original electrons leaving us with electrons left These electrons will be used to fill the octets of the atoms surrounding the central atom These electrons will be known as the lone pairs because they are not bonded to another atom You will represent these electrons by using dots around the atom each dot represents one electrons Because each fluorine requires another electrons each to fill their octets this means that we have used up all of our remaining electrons Boron does not fill its octet because it is one of the few exceptions to the rule It is perfectly fine only forming bonds The final structure can be seen in a diagram below Because there are three bonded atoms to a central atom with no lone pairs on it be can also conclude that BF has a trigonal planar geometry with sp hybridization BF is only one of the many simple Lewis Structures There are others that require a little bit more time in creating because they contain a little bit more criteria to complete it Some of the more complex structures may contain charges as well as double or triple bonds There are also many molecules that break the octet rule and can form a total of or bonds to the central atom Formal Charges When drawing Lewis Structures you need to check the structures formal charge Unless a charge is preferred you want the overall charge of the molecule to be Formal Charge of valence electrons of unpaired electrons of paired electrons So the formal charges are FCBoron FCFluorine FCTotal FCBoron FCFluorine If a formal charge is preferred then the final answer should be in brackets with the charge outside of the bracket Lewis structures of Charged Molecules In the case of Triiodide I you notice that there is a negative charge That means that instead of the valence electrons for each I you add one more electron to make it You will then create the structure though the steps that were given above The only additional step required is to put your final structure in brackets with the charge of the molecule outside of the brackets Triiodide can be seen below Multiple Bonds in Lewis Strutures In the case of CO when it comes time to create a lewis structure it seems as though you don not have enough electrons to complete the octets of all the atoms When you run into this problem it usually means that the molecule will contain a double or triple bond There are valence electrons in a CO molecule If you go about the steps that were given to you above you will notice that the octets of the oxygen atoms have been filled but the carbon still needs more electrons What you need to do it move one pair of electrons from each oxygen atom and turn it into a double bond on each side of the carbon The final structure for CO can be seen below Problems Complete the following problems to to evaluate your understanding of this module Draw the Lewis structure for the following molecules NO CH SF Find the

over elements are constituted as electrons are successively accommodated into s s p s p s and d orbitals one by one from lower to higher energy levels When elements with similar properties are arranged in columns the periodic table of the elements is constructed The modern periodic table of the elements is based on one published by D I Mendeleev in and a variety of tables have since been devised The long periodic table recommended by IUPAC is the current standard and it has the group numbers arranged from Group alkali metals through Group rare gas elements Table Based on the composition of electron orbitals hydrogen helium and Group elements are classified as sblock elements Group through Group elements pblock elements Group through Group elements dblock elements and lanthanoid and actinoid elements fblock elements Figure sBlock pblock and Group elements are called main group elements and dblock elements other than Group and fblock elements are called transition elements The characteristic properties of the elements that belong to these four blocks are described in Chapter and thereafter Incidentally periodic tables that denote the groups of sblock and pblock elements with Roman numerals I II VIII are still used but they will be unified into the IUPAC system in the near future Since inorganic chemistry covers the chemistry of all the elements it is important to understand the features of each element through reference to the periodic table Figure Block classification of elements in the periodic table Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry

AttributionsContributors and AttributionsContributors and AttributionsContributors and AttributionsContributors and AttributionsContributors and Attributions Molecular geometry and coordinates Consider a diatomic molecule AB Imagine fixing this molecule at a very specific spatial location as shown below Figure To locate the molecule so specifically we would need to give the and coordinates of each of its atoms ie which is a total of numbers However we note that the molecule looks the same no matter where in space it is located This is called translational invariance and it implies that we can give only the coordinates of one of the atoms relative to the other which is equivalent to giving the vector difference between and or viceversa which we will call the vector which is only numbers This is the same as arbitrarily placing atom A at the origin of our coordinate system We also note that the spatial orientation of the molecule is arbitrary since the molecule looks the same at any viewing angle For a diatomic its orientation can be specified by giving two angles the angle it makes with the zaxis and the angle of its projection onto the plane with the xaxis The choice of these angles is arbitrary This leaves only number left which is the distance between A and B called the molecules bond length This is an internal degree of freedom and is the only important number we need to give in order to convey the geometry of the diatomic In spite of this simplification it is often necessary to specify all of the coordinates of the atoms in a molecule Molecular modeling packages which are becoming increasingly important in chemical research require a full set of coordinates for each atom as input Similarly molecular data banks such as the protein data bank PDB will give molecular structures as files of and coordinates Thus being able to determine a set of coordinates given only bond lengths and bond angles and conversely being able to determine bond lengths and angles from a set of coordinates is an extremely important skill A few examples of how to do this will be illustrated below Example The diatomic How do we determine a set of coordinates for given only its bond length Since its absolute location in space and its orientation are arbitrary any set of coordinates that reproduces the correct bond length will suffice Thus since a diatomic is linear we may place it along one of the axes of our coordinate system with one of the atoms at the origin Figure Now we see that the coordinates of atom will simply be and the coordinates of atom since lies on the xaxis a distance away from will be Clearly this set of coordinates reproduces the correct bond length Thus for the molecule whose bond length is r stackrelcircA a set of coordinates could be in This is just one possibility We could have chosen either atom to be at the origin or anywhere else in space for that matter and chosen the bond to lie along any axis or not along any particular axis as we choose so long as the correct bond length is reproduced Example Water The geometry of water is bent we will see how to determine this later with a bond angle of and an bond length of approximately To determine a set of coordinates for we note that the molecule is planar so we may choose it to lie in the plane We will place the oxygen at the origin with the hydrogens as shown below Figure The coordinates of the oxygen can be written down immediately For each of the hydrogens note that the yaxis bisects the angle giving two right triangles An bond forms the hypotenuse of one of these triangles so that the and coordinates will be determined from the sine and cosine of the angle as can be shown using simple trigonometry To verify that the bond lengths are correctly reproduced we compute the magnitudes of the vector differences and In order to verify that the bond angle is correct we note that the angle between two vectors and is given by the formula where is the dot product of and defined to be Thus the angle is given by Periodic trends in bond lengths and bond energies Within a group of the periodic table bond lengths tend to increase with increasing atomic number Consider the Group elements which corresponds to an increased valence shell size hence increased electronelectron repulsion An important result from experiment which has been corroborated by theory is that bond lengths tend not to vary much from molecule to molecule Thus a bond will have roughly the same value in methane as it will in aspirin Bond dissociation energies were discussed in the last lecture in the context of ionic bonds There we used the symbol measured in This measures the energy required to break a mole of a particular kind of bond A similar periodic trend exists for bond dissociation energies Consider the hydrogen halides Thus as bond lengths increase with increasing there is a corresponding decrease in the bond dissociation energy bonds are an exception to the the rule of constancy of bond lengths across different molecules Because bonds can be single double or triple bonds some differences can occur For example consider the bond in the molecules ethane ethylene and acetylene The greater the bond order ie number of shared electron pairs the greater the dissociation energy The same will be true for any kind of bond that can come in such different flavors eg bonds bonds bonds bonds etc Polar covalent bonds Most real chemical bonds in nature are neither truly covalent nor truly ionic Only homonuclear bonds are truly covalent and nearly perfect ionic bonds can form between group I and group VII elements for example KF Generally however bonds are partially covalent and partially ionic meaning that there is partial transfer of electrons between atoms and partial sharing of electrons In order to quantify how much ionic character and how much covalent character a bond possesses electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bond can be used We have already seen one method for estimating atomic electronegativities the Mulliken method In Linus Pauling came up with another method that forms the basis of our understanding of electronegativity today Paulings method Recall the Mullikens method was based on the arithmetic average of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity Both of these energies are properties of individual atoms hence this method is appealing in its simplicity However there is no information about bonding in the Mulliken method Paulings method includes such information and hence is a more effective approach To see how the Pauling method works consider a diatomic which is polar covalent Let and be the dissociation energies of the diatomics and respectively Since and are purely covalent bonds these two dissociation energies can be used to estimate the pure covalent contribution to the bond Pauling proposed the geometric mean of and this being more sensitive to large differences between these energies than the arithmetic average If is the true bond dissociation energy then the difference is a measure of the ionic contribution Let us define this difference to be Then Pauling defined the electronegativity difference between atoms and to be where is measured in and the constant has units so that the electronegativity difference is dimensionless Thus with some extra input information he was able to generate a table of atomic electronegativities that are still used today Table A To use the electronegativities to estimate degree of ionic character simply compute the absolute value of the difference for the two atoms in the bond As an example consider again the hydrogen halides As the electronegativity difference decreases so does the ionic character of the bond Hence its covalent character increases Electric dipole moment In a nearly perfect ionic bond such as where electron transfer is almost complete representing the molecule as is a very good approximation since the charge on the potassium will be approximately and the charge on the fluorine will be approximately For a polar covalent bond such as in which only partial charge transfer occurs a more accurate representation would be where expressed in units of is known as a partial charge It suggests that a fraction of an electron is transferred although the reality is that there is simply a little more electron density on the more electronegative atom and a little less on the electropositive atom How much charge is actually transferred can be quantified by studying the electric dipole moment of the bond which is a quantity that can be measured experimentally The electric dipole moment of an assembly of charges having positions is defined to be Thus for a diatomic with charges and on atoms and respectively the dipole moment according to the definition would be Hence the magnitude of the dipole moment is where is the bond length As an example consider which has a partial charge on of which means and a bond length of Thus the magnitude of the dipole moment is Thus the units of the dipole moment are Coulomb meters However as this example makes clear this is a very large unit and awkward to work with for molecules A more convenient unit is the Debye defined to be is actually the dipole moment of two charges and separated by a distance of Thus for a diatomic with partial charges and the dipole moment in is given by and the percent ionic character is defined in terms of the partial charge by As an example consider again for which The bond length is Thus its dipole moment will be and its percent ionic character is Experimental importance of the dipole moment The electric dipole moment lies at the heart of a widely used experimental method for probing the vibrational dynamics of a system If a system is exposed to a monochromatic electromagnetic field from a laser then the electric dipole moment couples to the electric field component in such a way that the energy is In general the electric field is a function of space and time having the general wave form where is the frequency of the field with the speed of light and the wavelength and is called the wave vector and the direction of is the direction of wave propagation this will be covered in more detail next semester In most experiments the wavelength is long enough compared to the size of the system studied that one can take the electric field to be spatially constant and consider only the time dependence In this case Thus the electric field varies as a simple cosine function at a single frequency The importance of the coupling between the dipole moment and the timedependent electric field is that the frequency of the field can be varied over a range of natural frequencies in a given chemical system Thus chemical bonds vibrate at a particular natural frequency threeatom bending modes have their characteristic frequency etc What one seeks in this experiment is a report of the natural frequencies in the system since from such a report one can often tell one local chemical environment from another By sweeping through a range of frequencies the coupling of the field to the dipole moment suggests that the local charge distribution will respond to the oscillations of the field at the field frequency Thus if the field frequency is tuned to be that of a bond stretch the charge distribution in the bond will be stimulated and report on the frequency of the bond etc At each frequency the intensity of the response can be measured and a plot of vs is produced Such a plot is called an infrared spectrum The figure below shows the infrared spectrum for liquid water left and for M blue and M red KOH solutions right In the left panel the solid curve is the water spectrum obtained from a computer simulation while the dashed curve is the experimentally obtained spectrum On the right the red and blue curves are from computer simulations while the inset at the upper right is the experimentally measured spectrum The peaks in the spectra occur at particular vibrational frequencies in the system The water spectrum shows very distinct bands while the spectrum of the KOH solutions shows both bands and continuum regions The latter arise from the fact that protons can be transferred from water to hydroxide As the proton moves across a hydrogen bond between water and the hydroxide ion the vibrations in the bond sweep through a range of frequencies as the proton is transferred giving rise to the continuum This feature in the infrared spectra of solutions of strong acids and bases is known as Zundel polarization More information on how we compute these spectra and how the computer simulation are performed can be found in the following research papers H S Lee and

Electronegativity Values Last updated Save as PDF Page ID SignificanceReferences A method for estimating electronegativity was developed by Robert Mulliken Nobel Prize in Chemistry who noticed that elements with large first ionization energies tend to have very negative electron affinities and gain electrons in chemical reactions Conversely elements with small first ionization energies tend to have slightly negative or even positive electron affinities and lose electrons in chemical reactions Mulliken recognized that an atoms tendency to gain or lose electrons could therefore be described quantitatively by the average of the values of its first ionization energy and the absolute value of its electron affinity Robert S Mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity should be a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons As this definition is not dependent on an arbitrary relative scale it has also been termed absolute electronegativity Using our definition of electron affinity we can write Mullikens original expression for electronegativity as followsMullikens definition used the magnitude of the ionization energy and the electron affinity By definition the magnitude of a quantity is a positive number Our definition of electron affinity produces negative values for the electron affinity for most elements so vertical lines indicating absolute value are needed in Equation to make sure that we are adding two positive numbers in the numerator Elements with a large first ionization energy and a very negative electron affinity have a large positive value in the numerator of Equation so their electronegativity is high Elements with a small first ionization energy and a small electron affinity have a small positive value for the numerator in Equation so they have a low electronegativity Inserting the appropriate data into Equation gives a Mulliken electronegativity value for fluorine of kJmol To compare Mullikens electronegativity values with those obtained by Pauling Mullikens values are divided by kJmol which gives Paulings value However it is more usual to use a linear transformation to transform these absolute values into values that resemble the more familiar Pauling values For ionization energies and electron affinities in electronvolts and for energies in kJmol The Mulliken electronegativity can only be calculated for an element for which the electron affinity is known fiftyseven elements as of The Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is sometimes said to be the negative of the chemical potential By inserting the energetic definitions of the ionization potential and electron affinity into the Mulliken electronegativity it is possible to show that the Mulliken chemical potential is a finite difference approximation of the electronic energy with respect to the number of electrons ie All electronegativity scales give essentially the same results for one element relative to another Even though the Mulliken scale is based on the properties of individual atoms and the Pauling scale is based on the properties of atoms in molecules they both apparently measure the same basic property of an element In the following discussion we will focus on the relationship between electronegativity and the tendency of atoms to form positive or negative ions We will therefore be implicitly using the Mulliken definition of electronegativity Because of the parallels between the Mulliken and Pauling definitions however the conclusions are likely to apply to atoms in molecules as well Significance Despite being developed from a very different set of principles than Pauling Electronegativity which is based on bond dissociation energies there is a good correlation between Mullikin and Pauling Electronegativities for the atoms as shown in the plot below Although Pauling electronegativities are usually what are found in textbooks the Mullikin electronegativity more intuitively corresponds to the ability of an atom to draw electrons toward itself in bonding and is probably a better indicator of that property However because of the good correlation between the two scales using the Pauling scale is sufficient for most purposes References Mulliken R S A New Electroaffinity Scale Together with Data on Valence States and on Valence

LinksProblemsAnswersContributors In inorganic chemistry an octahedron is classified by its molecular geometry in which its distict shape is described as having six atoms groups of atoms or electron pairs symmetrically arranged around one central atom defining the vertices of an octahedron The prefix octa which means eight comes from the fact that the molecule has eight symmetrical faces All atoms are degrees apart from one another and degrees apart from the atom directly across and opposite from it In regards to identifying each species we will be looking at three separate unique shapes with different numbers of bond pairs and lone pairs This allows us to distinguish and classifiy the octahedrals based on the following shapes octahedral square pyramidal and square planar IntroductionHeading ReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswersContributors Introduction To be able to understand and distinguish the difference between the three types of octahedral species and how they differ from one molecule to the next it is essential to try to visualize shapes geometrically and in D A simple comprehension of geometry is required to be able to imagine molecules in D as well as having basic background knowledge of the concept of bonding pairs and lone pairs This allows one to recognize and see the difference in the molecular design for each individual molecule We will begin by describing the design of an octahedral and then continue on to the next two molecules An octahedral is best described as a central atom symmetrically arranged by six other atoms What makes this molecule different from other species is the fact that it is surrounded by six either the same or different atoms There are six bonding pairs in this molecule and no lone electron pairs The molecule below has no lone pairs of electrons surrounding it thus allowing it to have a distinct shape In a three dimensional sense we may think of a x y and z coordinate plane having both its positive and negative coordinate systems Another way of looking at it would be in the sense that all the faces of the molecule are present through this reference it resembles what would be a three dimensional prism All the atoms are spread apart degrees from each other and from the atom directly across and opposite from it The reson for the spacing is due to the molecule arranging itself in the most stable form possible limiting the bondpair to bondpair interaction Here is basic but clear example of what an octahedral looks like Octahedral bond pairs and electron pairs The next molecule that we will examine is known as a square pyramidal This molecule has a lot of the same characteristics as that of an octahedral in the sense it consist of a central atom that is still symmetrically surrounded by six other atoms What makes this molecule different from the previous molecule is the fact that this molecule does not consist of only bondpair atoms surrounding it There is one pair of electrons that has taken the place of one of the atoms and because these electrons are now present it gives the molecule a distict new look There are five bonding pairs and one electron pair The atoms have to arrange themselves in the most stable form possible not only limiting the bondpair to bondpair interaction but also limiting the bondpair to electronpair interaction The easiest way to visualize what this molecule looks like to visualize the x y and z coordinate plane again but this time remove what would be considered the negative y coordinate axis and put a pair of lone pair electrons in its place The molecule is still considered apart of the octahedral species because it still satisfies the atom requirement but in terms of its shape the electrons effect the shape This allows it to have its new shape If you actually exclude those electrons and lay the molecule on the surface you can see that it looks like a three dimensional pyramid with a square base Again all the atoms and electron pair are degrees apart from each other and from the atom directly across and opposite from it Here is what a square pyramidal would look like Square Pyramidal bond pairs and electron pair The last of the octahedral species is known as a square planar This molecule resembles both of the previous molecules but more similarly resembles a square pyramidal It still has many of the characteristics of a square pyramidal but what makes it different is that rather than having only one pair of electrons replacing the position of an atom there are two pairs of electrons that are replacing the position of two atoms To visualize what this molecule looks like we refer back to the x y and z coordinate system the only difference is this time we are taking away the entire y coordinate and replacing it with electrons on what would be the positive y coordinate axis as well as placing a pair of electrons in what would be considered the negative y coordinate axis The reason for this arrangement goes back to having the molecule arrange itself in the most stable form possible limiting interactions between bondpair to bondpair bondpair to electronpair and electronpair to electronpair If you try visualizing what this would look like it almost resembles a threedimensional X with two pairs of lone electrons Because the lone pairs of electrons are still present that allows this molecule to still be considered an octahedral due to the fact that it still meets the requirements of being surrounded by atoms or groups In regards to its shape the electron pairs cause repulsion thus allowing it to have its new shape The atoms and electrons are still degrees apart from eachother and degrees from the atom directly across and opposite from it Here is what a square planar would look like Square Planar

electronpair stand at degrees apart from eachother Why Give one example of a molecules that would fall into the category of a octehedral square pyramidal and square planar Answers The molecules take the arrangment they do due to trying to arrange themselves in the most stable structure possible limiting the interaction between bondpair and electronpair interaction As long as these conditions can be met it is possible for the structure to not only exist but remain stable This again goes back to satisfying the conditions of keeping the molecule as stable as possible by limiting lonepair to lone pair interaction as well as same sign interaction Because electrons hold the same kind of charge they can not be near eachother due to same charge repulsion and so they need to be as far away as possible from eachother so that the molecule may be stable Molecules that would fall into the category of triganol planar based on their molecular geometry would be SF a molecule that falls into the category of a square pyramidal would be BrF and one molecule that would fall into a category of a square planar would be AuCl Contributors Name here if anonymous you can avoid this with university affiliation Bonding in Metals Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Nearly free electron modelElectron wavelength and wavenumber Energies of orbitals in a metallic crystal Density of States DOS Metals semiconductors and insulators The electron pair description of chemical bonds which was the basis of the octet rule for pblock compounds breaks down for metals This is illustrated well by Na metal the structure of which is shown at the left Na has too few valence electrons to make electron pair bonds between each pair of atoms We could think of the Na unit cell as having eight nobond resonance structures in which only one NaNa bond per cell contains a pair of electrons Sodium metal crystallizes in the bodycentered cubic structure in which each atom has eight nearest neighbors Since the electronic configuration of Na is Ars there are only two valence electrons per unit cell that are shared among eight NaNa bonds This means that the NaNa bond order is in Na metal A more realistic way to describe the bonding in metals is through band theory The evolution of energy bands in solids from simple MO theory Chapter is illustrated at the right for a chain of six Na atoms each of which has one s valence orbital and contributes one valence electron In general n atomic orbitals in this case the six Na s orbitals will generate n molecular orbitals with n possible nodes In Chapter we showed that the energy versus internuclear distance graph for a two hydrogen atom system has a low energy level and a high energy level corresponding to the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals respectively These two energy levels were well separated from each other and the two electrons in H energetically prefer the lower energy level If more atoms are introduced to the system there will be a number of additional levels between the lowest and highest energy levels MO picture for a linear chain of six Na atoms Three of the six MOs can accommodate all six valence electrons Adding more atoms to the chain makes more molecular orbitals of intermediate energy which eventually merge into a continuous band of orbitals For Na the s band is always halffilled because each MO can accommodate two electrons In band theory the atom chain is extrapolated to a very large number on the order of atoms in a crystal so that the different combinations of bonding and antibonding orbitals create bands of possible energy states for the metal In the language of physics this approach of building the bands from discrete atomic orbitals is called the tightbinding approximation The number of atoms is so large that the energies can be thought of as a continuum rather than a series of distinct levels A metal will only partially fill this band as there are fewer valence electrons than there are energy states to fill In the case of Na metal this results in a halffilled s band Nearly free electron model In metals the valence electrons are delocalized over many atoms The total energy of each electron is given by the sum of its kinetic and potential energy E KE PE E pm V where p is the momentum of the electron a vector quantity m is its mass and V is an average potential that the electron feels from the positive cores of the atoms This potential holds the valence electrons in the crystal but in the free electron model is essentially uniform across the crystal Electron wavelength and wavenumber What are the consequences of this model for band theory For a hypothetical infinite chain ie a D crystal of Na atoms the molecular orbitals at the bottom of the s band are fully bonding and the wavelength of electrons x the distance between nodes in these orbitals is very long At the top of the band the highest orbital is fully antibonding and the wavelength is times the distance between atoms a since there is one node per atom Remember that the wavelength of an electron λ is inversely proportional to its momentum p according to the de Broglie relation λ hp For a nearly free electron the kinetic energy can be expressed in terms of its wavelength using KE pm and the de Broglie relation We can think of the wavelength of an electron in a molecular orbital as twice the distance between nodes If there are N atoms in a linear chain the wavelength of the nth orbital is given by λ Nan where a is the distance between atoms At this point it is convenient to define the wavenumber of the electron as k which has units of inverse length and is inversely proportional to λ k is also directly proportional to the momentum p Like p k is a vector quantity In a D crystal k can be either positive or negative corresponding to an electron moving to the left or right along the chain The most important property of k is that it is directly proportional to the number of nodes n in a molecular orbital within the band For a D crystal of sodium atoms that contains N unit cells each separated by a distance a a molecular orbital with n nodes has a wavelength λ Nan and the wavenumber k πnNa We can see from this definition that k at the bottom of the band where λ is infinite and k πa at the top of the band where the MO contains N nodes and λ a Energies of orbitals in a metallic crystal Electrons with long wavelengths do not feel the individual atoms in the lattice and so they behave as if they are nearly free but confined to the crystal Near the bottom of the band the electron energy increases parabolically with the number of nodes KE n since the momentum p is directly proportional to n Because p is also directly proportional to k we can write This parabolic relationship is followed as long as the electron wavelength is long compared to the distance between atoms Near the top of the band the wavelength becomes shorter and the electrons start to feel the positively charged atomic cores In particular the electrons prefer to have the maxima in their wavefunctions line up with the atomic cores which is the most electrostatically favorable situation The electronatom attraction lowers the energy and causes the E vs k curve to deviate from the parabolic behavior of a free electron as shown in the figure below Density of States DOS The density of states is defined as the number of orbitals per unit of energy within a band Because of the parabolic relation between E and k the density of states for a D metallic crystal is highest near the bottom and top of the energy band where the slope of the E vs k curve is closest to zero The shape of the DOS curve is different in crystals of higher dimensionality as shown in the figure in the left because statistically there are more ways to make an orbital with N nodes than there are with zero or N nodes The situtation is analogous to the numbers you can make by rolling dice With one die the numbers have equal probability However with two dice there is only one way to make a two snake eyes or a twelve boxcars but many ways to make a seven a winner Electrons in metals follow a parabolic dispersion curve where the energy increases with the square of the wavenumber k Near the top of the band the dispersion curve deviates from the parabolic dotted line Because there is one MO for each value of k the number of orbitals per unit energy the density of states DOS is highest at the bottom and top of the band for a D chain of atoms The density of states is constant with energy for a D crystal and has a maximum in the middle of the band for a D crystal At low temperature all the MOs below the Fermi level EF are occupied and all the MOs above it are empty While most of the time we will talk about D crystals that have their maximum DOS near the middle of the energy band there are examples of quasiD systems such as carbon nanotubes Metallic carbon nanotubes have strong optical absorption bands that correspond to transitions between the two regions of high DOS the van Hove singularities near the bottom and top of the bands Singlewalled carbon nanotubes with armchair chirality are metallic and have characteristic sharp absorption bands in the infrared Prof Millie Dresselhaus below did foundational research on the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes and other lowdimensional conductors Metals semiconductors and insulators The degree to which bands fill determines whether a crystalline solid is a metal semiconductor or insulator If the highest occupied molecular orbitals lie within a band ie if the Fermi level EF cuts through a band of orbitals then the electrons are free to change their speed and direction in an electric field and the solid is metallic However if the solid contains just enough electrons to completely fill a band and the next highest set of molecular orbitals is empty then it is a semiconductor or insulator In this case there is an energy gap between the filled and empty bands which are called the valence and conduction bands respectively Although the distinction is somewhat arbitrary materials with a large gap eV are called insulators and those with smaller gaps are called semiconductors We will learn more about the properties of semiconductors in Chapter Why dont insulators conduct electricity The energy vs DOS diagram below shows what happens when an electric field is applied to a metal or an insulator In this case we have changed the diagram to show explicitly the energies of electrons moving left and right These energies are the same in the absence of an electric field Once we apply a field eg by putting a voltage across a metal wire the electrons moving in the direction of the field have lower energy than those moving in the opposite direction In the case of the metal the populations of electrons moving with and against the electric field are different and there is a net flow of current Note that this can happen only when the Fermi level cuts through a partially filled band With a semiconductor or insulator the valence band is filled and the conduction band is empty Applying an electric field changes the energies of electrons traveling with and against the field but because the band is filled the same number are going in both directions and there is no net current flow E vs DOS diagrams comparing the behavior of metals and insulators in an applied electric field Note that in this picture all the molecular orbitals extend over the entire crystal The valence electrons are delocalized even in the case of a semiconductor or insulator However there can be no net movement of electrons unless the band is partially filled Bonding in Metals and Semicondoctors Last updated

layered dichalcogenides such as TiS and ZrS have the CdI structure In these compounds as we have noted above the metal ions are octahedrally coordinated by S Interestingly the structures of MoS and WS while they are also layered are different In these cases the metal is surrounded by a trigonal prism of sulfur atoms NbS TaS MoSe MoTe and WSe also have the trigonal prismatic molybdenite structure

are close contacts between the chalcogenide ions which are eclipsed in the stacking sequence AbABaBAbABaB where indicates the van der Waals gap between layers What stabilizes this structure The molybdenite structure occurs most commonly in MX compounds with a d or d electron count The figure below compares the splitting of dorbital energies in the octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments The trigonal prismatic structure is stabilized in MoS by filling the lowest energy band the dz The dz orbital which points vertically through the triangular top and bottom faces of the trigonal prism has the least interaction with the sulfide ligands and therefore the lowest energy The dxz and dyz orbitals which point at the ligands have the highest energy The dz orbital is lower in energy in this structure than the tg orbitals are in the octahedral structure of TiS dorbital splittings and energy bands in TiS and MoS MoS is a semiconductor with a eV gap between its filled and empty bands Because it has an unfilled tg band TiS is relatively easy to reduce by intercalation with Li For this reason LiTiS was one of the first intercalation compounds studied by Stanley Whittingham who developed the concept of the nonaqueous lithium ion battery in the early s Because it has a filled dz band MoS is harder to reduce but it can be intercalated by reaction with the powerful reducing agent nbutyllithium to make LixMoS x Atoms in the van der Waals planes of these compounds are relatively unreactive which gives MoS its good oxidative stability and enables its application as a high temperature lubricant Atoms at the edges of the crystals are however more reactive and in fact are catalytic High surface area MoS which has a high density of exposed edge planes is used as a hydrodesulfurization catalyst and is also of increasing interest as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of water to hydrogen Layered metal dichalcogenides including MoS WS and SnS can form closed nanostructures that take the shape of multiwalled onions and multiwalled tubes These materials were discovered by the group of Reshef Tenne in shortly after the discovery of carbon nanotubes Since then nanotubes have been synthesized from many other materials including vanadium and manganese oxides The pyrite FeS crystal structure The structure is related to NaCl with Fe and S ions occupying the cation and anion sites Although early TiS and late PtS transition metal disulfides have layered structures a number of MS compounds in the middle of the transition series such as MnS FeS and RuS have threedimensionally bonded structures For example FeS has the pyrite structure which is related to the NaCl structure The reason is that FeS is not FeS but is actually FeS where S is the disulfide anion which contains a single bond like the peroxide anion O S is too strong a reducing agent to exist in the same compound with Fe which is a strong oxidizing agent Because FeS is

by through the use of automatic diffractometers This progress has resulted in rapid development of new areas of inorganic chemistry that were previously inaccessible Research on higher dimensional compounds such as multinuclear complexes cluster compounds and solidstate inorganic compounds in which many metal atoms and ligands are bonded in a complex manner is becoming much easier In this

gaseous carbon dioxide CO liquid sulfuric acid HSO or solid phosphorus pentoxide PO satisfy the valence requirements of the component atoms and form discrete molecules which are not bonded together The compounds of main group metals such as liquid tin tetrachloride SnCl and solid aluminum trichloride AlCl have definite molecular weights and do not form infinite polymers Most of the molecular compounds of transition metals are metal complexes and organometallic compounds in which ligands are coordinated to metals These molecular compounds include not only mononuclear complexes with a metal center but also multinuclear complexes containing several metals or cluster complexes having metalmetal bonds The number of new compounds with a variety of bonding and structure types is increasing very rapidly and they represent a major field of study in today inorganic chemistry see Chapter Solidstate compounds Although solidstate inorganic compounds are huge molecules it is preferable to define them as being composed of an infinite sequence of dimensional chain dimensional layer or dimensional arrays of elements and as having no definite molecular weight The component elements of an inorganic solid bond together by means of ionic covalent or metallic bonds to form a solid structure An ionic bond is one between electronically positive alkali metals etc and negative elements halogen etc and a covalent bond forms between elements with close electronegativities However in many compounds there is contribution from both ionic and covalent bonds see Section about bondings Exercise Give examples of solidstate inorganic compounds Answer Sodium chloride NaCl Silicon dioxide SiO Molybdenum disulfide MoS The first step in the identification of a compound is to know its elemental composition Unlike an organic compound it is sometimes difficult to decide the empirical formula of a solidstate inorganic compound from elemental analyses and to determine its structure by combining information from spectra Compounds with similar compositions may have different coordination numbers around a central element and different structural dimensions For example in the case of binary consisting of two kinds of elements metal iodides gold iodide AuI has a chainlike structure copper iodide CuI a zinc blende type structure sodium iodide NaI has a sodium chloride structure and cesium iodide CsI has a cesium chloride structure refer to Section e and the metal atoms are bonded to or iodine atoms respectively The minimum repeat unit of a solid structure is called a unit lattice and is the most fundamental information in the structural chemistry of crystals Xray and neutron diffraction are the most powerful experimental methods for determining a crystal structure and the bonds between atoms can only be elucidated by using them Polymorphism is the phenomenon in which different kinds of crystals of a solidstate compound are obtained in which the atomic arrangements are not the same Changes between different polymorphous phases with variations in temperature andor pressure or phase transitions are an interesting and important problem in solidstate chemistry or physics We should keep in mind that in solidstate inorganic chemistry the elemental composition of a compound are not necessarily integers There are extensive groups of compounds called nonstoichiometric compounds in which the ratios of elements are nonintegers and these nonstoichiometric compounds characteristically display conductivity magnetism catalytic nature color and other unique solidstate properties Therefore even if an inorganic compound exhibits nonintegral stoichiometry unlike an organic compound the compound may be a thermodynamically stable orthodox compound This kind of compound is called a nonstoichiometric compound or Berthollide compound whereas a stoichiometric compound is referred to as a Daltonide compound The law of constant composition has enjoyed so much success that there is a tendency to neglect nonstoichiometric compounds We should point out that groups of compounds in which there are slight and continuous changes of the composition of elements are not rare Problem Express the isotopes of hydrogen carbon and oxygen using the symbols of the elements with atomic and mass numbers and write the number of protons neutrons and electrons in parenthesis Superheavy elements The last element in the ordinary periodic table is an actinoid element lawrencium Lr Z However elements Z have already been synthesized in heavy ion reactions using nuclear accelerators These are d elements which come under the d transition elements from hafnium Hf to iridium Ir and it is likely that their electronic structures and chemical properties are similar As a matter of fact only the existence of nuclides with very short lives has been confirmed The trouble of naming the super heavy elements is that the countries of their discoverers the United States Russia and Germany have proposed different names The tentative names of these elements are unnilquadium Une Z unnilpentium Unp Z unnilhexium Unh Z unnilseptium Unq Z unniloctium Uno Z and unnilennium Une Z It has recently been settled that they be named Rutherfordium Rf Dubnium Db Seaborgium Sg Bohrium Bh Hassium Hs and Meitnerium Mt Synthesis of the element Z which should come under platinum was considered the technical limit but there is a recent report that even the element Z was synthesized In any case the superheavy elements will run out shortly It is natural that complications are caused by naming of a new element a scientist to have a new element named after him or her Bond Polarity and Bond Strength Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Linus Pauling introduced the concept of electronegativity in order to explain the extra stability of molecules with polar bonds The electronegativity of an atom represented by the Greek letter χ can be defined as the tendency of an atom to draw electrons to itself in a chemical bond On the Pauling scale the electronegativity difference between two atoms A and B was defined in terms of the dissociation energies Ed of the AA BB and AB bonds where the energies are expressed in electron volts Figure A water molecule a commonly used example of polarity The two charges are present with a negative charge in the middle red and a positive charge at the ends blue This definition while directly relevant to the strength of chemical bonds requires thermochemical input data from many compounds some of which were not available at the time Mulliken and later Pearson developed a scale of electronegativities based on the average of the electron affinity and ionization energy of the free A and B atoms which they correlated with thermochemical data and the Pauling scale On the Pauling scale the least electronegative elements are the alkali metals χ and the most electronegative are oxygen and fluorine at the upper right of the periodic table Carbon and hydrogen have intermediate electronegativities and on the Pauling scale respectively The general trend see table below is that electronegativities increase going up and to the right in the periodic table There are some interesting exceptions to this behavior most notably two islands of high electronegatvity at the bottom of the transition series peaking at tungsten χ and gold χ The first of these can be explained by the very high metalmetal bond energy of elements such as Mo and W which can use all six of their valence electrons in bonding as we will discuss in Chapter The second however occurs with more weakly bonded noble metals such as Pt and Au and is responsible for their low position in the activity series as well as their extraordinary properties as catalysts Table of Pauling electronegativities The polarity of bonds is determined by electronegativity differences As a guideline we define bonds as ionic if Δχ polar if Δχ nonpolar if Δχ The polarity of bonds helps us understand noncovalent forces between molecules such as hydrogen bonding and dipoledipole interactions It also helps us interpret the reactivity of molecules For example the SiH bond χSi χH is more hydridelike than the CH bond χC χH Therefore silanes react with acids to make H whereas phosphines χP and hydrocarbons do not Similarly electrophilic substitution reactions occur more readily on SiH and PH compounds than they do on CH compounds There is also a correlation between the strength of a chemical bond and the bond length longer bonds being weaker because of weaker orbital overlap Pauling introduced an empirical formula relating bond length to bond strength For a given pair of atoms for example two carbon atoms where Dn represents the bond length in Å and n is the bond order D in this case would be the length of a CC single bond which we can obtain from the average bond length in alkanes Å Using this formula we can predict that the bond lengths in ethylene CC double bond and acetylene CC triple bond should be and Å respectively which are close to the experimental values of and Å In a related form the Pauling formula can be used to calculate bond lengths when the single bond length D is not available Here n and m represent two different bond orders between the same kinds of atoms This tells for example that the difference in length between a triple and double bond DD should be log Å Some bond lengths and bond energies are anomalous For example the FF bond length in F is Å which is Å longer than twice the covalent radius of the F atom Å The FF bond is also quite weak bond dissociation energy kJmol relative to the ClCl bond kJmol By putting the extra bond length into the Pauling formula we calculate that the bond order in the F molecule is only ie substantially weaker than a FF single bond The physical reason for this is that the FF bond is stretched by repulsion of the lone pairs on the F atoms This crowding is caused by the fact that the He s core orbital as well as the valence orbitals of the fluorine atoms are contracted by the high nuclear charge The Cl atom with its larger Ne ssp core in contrast has a normal single bond length Å that is twice the covalent radius of the Cl atom Å A similar lone pair repulsion effect explains the anomalously long and weak NN and OO single bonds in hydrazine HNNH and hydrogen peroxide HOOH which are both highly reactive molecules Trends in covalent radii for pblock elements The covalent radius of F has been difficult to determine because of electron pair repulsion effects Early reports Shomaker and Stevenson Pauling overestimated the size of the F atomAccurate quantum chemical calculations place the F singlebond covalent radius at about Å The important roles of electronegativity differences and lone pair repulsion are evident when comparing trends in bond strengths The table below shows the average singlebond enthalpies of pblock elements with H and F H makes stronger bonds with nd row elements C N O F than with third row elements Si P S Cl because the p valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and thus make stronger bonds than electrons in p orbitals The bonds to H also follow the expected trend of increasing bond strength with increasing electronegativity difference Bonds between second row elements C N O F and F are however anomalously weak because of lone pair repulsion For this reason the SiF bond is substantially stronger than the CF bond whereas the CH bond is much stronger than the SiH bond The strong SiF bond is the reason that HF etches glass to produce the SiF anion and the strong CH bond is an important factor in the stability of hydrocarbons and other organic molecules Average EH and EF bond enthalpies kJmol CH NH OH HF SiH PH SH HCl CF NF OF FF SiF PF SF ClF The anomalously weak bond in F is responsible for the high electronegativity of fluorine as well as the legendary reactivity of elemental fluorine gas which reacts explosively with hydrogen and powdered metals Because of the instability of elemental fluorine and the polar nature of its bonds with more electropositive elements fluorine compounds tend to be very stable For example the noble gases Xe and Kr react with fluorine to make covalent compounds whereas other halogens do not react Fluorocarbon compounds contain strong CF bonds and have high thermal and chemical stability Perfluorocarbons such as Teflon polytetrafluoroethylene CFCFn PTFE are also highly hydrophobic The extraordinary hydrophobicity of perfluorocarbons arises from the fact that CF and CF groups are fatter than CH and CH groups dissolving them in water is therefore more disruptive to the hydrogen bonding network than is dissolving a hydrocarbon Fabric treated with fluorosurfactant BornHaber Cycles for NaCl and Silver Halides Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Silver Halides Now that we have an equation for the lattice energy of an ionic crystal we can ask the question of how accurate it is Remember we made several approximations in arriving at this formula We assumed that the lattice was completely ionic we ignored the van der Waals attractive energy of the ions and we assumed that there was no covalent contribution to the bonding Lets consider the lattice energy of table salt NaCl To calculate the lattice energy we lump together the physical constants where ro is expressed in Å Now we can calculate the lattice energy for NaCl using ro Å as We can alternatively construct a BornHaber cycle for the formation of NaCl from the elements and calculate the lattice energy as the missing term in the cycle S Sublimation energy of Nas IP Ionization potential of Nag D Bond dissocation energy of Clg EA Electron affinity of Clg ELLattice energy of NaCl R Gas constant T Absolute temperature From Hess Law Here we have to subtract RT to convert our cycle of energies to a cycle of enthalpies because we are compressing two moles of gas in making NaCls and PΔV ΔnRT where Δn Experimentally ΔHf for NaCl is kJmol Because all the other numbers in the cycle are known accurately the error in our calculation is only about kJ about of EL The result is promising because we neglected the van der Waals term Buthow did we get away with neglecting the van der Waals term This is because we used energy minimization to obtain the repulsion energy in the BornMayer equation If we underestimate the attractive energy of the crystal lattice the energy minimization criterion ensures that the repulsion energy is underestimated as well The two errors partially compensate so the overall error in the calculation is small We can do better by explicitly including the shortrange van der Waals attractive energy between ions The table below shows results of more detailed lattice energy calculations for ionic fluorides in which the van der Waals term is explicitly included The errors in this case are only about of EL Compound Calculated Lattice Energy kJmol Experimental EL from BornHaber Cycle MgF rutile structure CaF fluorite structure BaF fluorite structure Silver Halides It is interesting to repeat this exercise for the silver halides which have either the NaCl structure AgF AgCl AgBr or zincblende structure AgI Silver Halide Calculated Cycle Difference kJmol AgF AgCl AgBr AgI Looking at the table we see that the error is small for AgF and becomes progressively larger for the heavier silver halides However we are still obtaining answers within about error even for AgI Should we interpret the good agreement with values calculated from the ionic model to mean that these compounds are ionic Clearly this description is inappropriate for AgI where the electronegativity difference Δχ is only compare this value to for a CH bond which we typically view as nonpolar A drop of siver nitrate solution when added to a dilute hydrochloric acid solution results in the immediate formation of a white silver chloride precipitate This reaction is used as a qualitative test for the presence of halide ions in solutions The covalent bonding contribution to the lattice energies of AgCl AgBr and AgI makes these salts sparingly soluble in water Again we can interpret the fortuitous agreement between the calculated and experimentally obtained energies in terms of compensating errors Our lattice energy calculation overestimates the ionic contribution in the case of the heavier silver halides but underestimates the covalent contribution Of these compounds only AgF is soluble in water and should be thought of as an ionic compound The others are progressively more insoluble in water Ksp is and for AgCl AgBr and AgI reflecting increasing covalency as Δχ decreases The moral of the story is that simple lattice energy calculations based on the ionic model work well but they do not necessarily imply that the compounds are ionic B Oxidation States Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Rules for assigning oxidation numbers

as PDF Page ID No headers Crystal lattices can be classified by their translational and rotational symmetry In threedimensional crytals these symmetry operations yield distinct lattice types which are called Bravais lattices In these lattice diagrams shown below the dots represent lattice points which are places where the whole structure repeats by translation For example in the bodycentered cubic bcc structure of sodium metal which is discussed below we put one atom at the corner lattice points and another in the center of the unit cell In the NaCl structure which is discussed in Chapter we place one NaCl formula unit on each lattice point in the facecentered cubic fcc lattice That is one atom Na or Cl would be placed on the lattice point and the other one would be placed halfway between Similarly in the cubic diamond structure we place one C unit around each lattice point in the fcc lattice The fourteen Bravais lattices fall into seven crystal systems that are defined by their rotational symmetry In the lowest symmetry system triclinic there is no rotational symmetry This results in a unit cell in which none of the edges are constrained to have equal lengths and none of the angles are º In the monoclinic system there is one twofold rotation axis by convention the baxis which constrains two of the angles to be º In the orthorhombic system there are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes along the three unit cell directions Orthorhombic unit cells have three unequal unit cell edges that are mutually perpendicular Tetragonal unit cells have a fourfold rotation axis which constrains all the angles to be º and makes the a and b axes equivalent The rhombohedral system has a threefold axis which constrains all the unit cell edges and angles to be equal and the hexagonal system has a sixfold axis which constrains the a and b lattice dimensions to be equal and the angle between them to be º The cubic system has a threefold axis along the body diagonal of the cube as well as twofold axes along the three perpendicular unit cell directions In the cubic system all unit cell edges are equal and the angles between them are º The translational symmetry of the Bravais lattices the lattice centerings are classified as follows Primitive P lattice points on the cell corners only sometimes called simple BodyCentered I lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of the cell FaceCentered F lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each of the faces of the cell BaseCentered A B or C lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each face of one pair of parallel faces of the cell sometimes called endcentered Not all combinations of the crystal systems and lattice centerings are unique There are in total combinations but it can be shown that several of these are in fact equivalent to each other For example the monoclinic I lattice can be described by a monoclinic C lattice by different choice of crystal axes Similarly all A or Bcentred lattices can be described either by a C or Pcentering This reduces the number of combinations to conventional Bravais lattices shown in the table below When the fourteen Bravais lattices are combined with the crystallographic point groups we obtain the space groups These space groups describe all the combinations of symmetry operations that can exist in unit cells in three dimensions For twodimensional lattices there are only possible plane groups which are also known as wallpaper groups Crystal

for standard atomsCalculating relative atomic mass of an element with isotopesRelative Atomic Mass of some common atomsReferencesOutside LinksProblemsSolutions The actual mass of an atom basically depends on the numbers of protons and neutrons in its nucleus Since the rest mass of proton and neutrons are too small to regard to calculate the actual mass of an atom seems inconvenient for scientists In order to solve this problem relative atomic mass Ar which unit is defined as th of the mass of carbon atom is introduced Introduction The calculated relative atomic mass is not the mass of exact atom It is a ratio of actual mass respect to the th of the mass of carbon atom Relative atomic mass has unit of according to the equation since kg at the top cancels with the bottom one The introduction of using relative mass to a great extend makes scientists calculate mass of large molecules much more convenient Way to calculate Relative atomic mass Ar for standard atoms In order to calculate Ar first of all is to calculate the of carbon xx Kg then compare this value with any other atom which needs to be calculated and the obtained ratio is relative atomic mass for that atom For example for the oxygen atom its rest mass is x divide it by x xx and the answer will approximately be that is the relative atomic mass for oxygen The contribution of this value is to make calculation much easier Calculating relative atomic mass of an element with isotopes Most of the elements in the world have isotopes therefore relative atomic mass for one element is expanded to the average mass of the naturally occurring isotopes of the element This quantity takes into account the percentage abundance of all the isotopes of an element which exist For example there are two naturally occurring isotopes of chlorine Cl and Cl hence the Ar for Cl should be the average of value of each isotopes mass times its percentage abundance Relative Atomic Mass of some common atoms H C N O F Na Mg Al Si P

fuel Topic hierarchy Brønsted and Lewis Acids and Bases Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Three theories of acids and basesConjugate acids and basesStrong and weak acids and basesConjugate acids and basesAmphoteric compoundsSolvent levelingNonaqueous solutionsAcidbase equilibria in molten saltsLewis Acids and BasesDetermining the strength of metal ion Lewis acidsLewis bases stabilize high oxidation states Three theories of acids and bases There are three major classifications of substances known as acids or bases The Arrhenius definition states that an acid produces H in solution and a base produces OH This theory was developed by Svante Arrhenius in Later two more sophisticated and general theories were proposed These are the BrønstedLowry and the Lewis definitions of acids and bases The relationship between these theories is illustrated in the figure below Illustration of the hierarchy of acidbase theories Arrhenius acids and bases are a subclass of Brønsted acids and bases which are themselves a subclass of Lewis acids and bases The Arrhenius theory which is the simplest and least general description of acids and bases includes acids such as HClO and bases such as NaOH or MgOH This theory successfully describes how acids and bases react with each other to make water and salts However it does not explain why some substances that do not contain hydroxide ions for example F and NO can make basic solutions in water The BrønstedLowry definition of acids and bases addresses this problem In this theory an acid is a substance that can release a proton like in the Arrhenius theory and a base is a substance that can accept a proton A basic salt such as NaF generates OH ions in water by taking protons from water itself to make HF When a Brønsted acid dissociates it increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution H conversely Brønsted bases dissociate by taking a proton from the solvent water to generate OH Acid Dissociation Base dissociation Conjugate acids and bases One important consequence of these equilibria is that every acid HA has a conjugate base A and viceversa In the base dissociation equilibrium above the conjugate acid of base B is HB For a given acid or base these equilibria are linked by the water dissociation equilibrium for which the equilibrium constant Kw is x at C It can be easily shown that the product of the acid and base dissociation constants Ka and Kb is Kw Strong and weak acids and bases Acids and bases that dissociate completely are said to be strong Here the righthanded arrow implies that the reaction goes to completion That is a M solution of HClO in water actually contains M Haq and M ClOaq and very little undissociated HClO Conversely weak acids such as acetic acid CHCOOH and weak bases such as ammonia NH dissociate only slightly in water typically a few percent depending on their concentration and the values of Ka and Kb and exist mostly as the undissociated molecules Antacid tablets typically contain calcium salts of the bicarbonate ion HCO a weak base Its conjugate acid carbonic acid HCO is a weak acid The acidbase equilibrium between carbonic acid and bicarbonate is important in maintaining blood pH Example Household ammonia is a solution of NH in water that ranges from about by weight Lets calculate the percent ionization and the pH of the solution Solution For a solution that is ammonia by weight assuming that the density is about the same as that of liquid water the analytical concentration of ammonia is gL gmol M The other thing we need to know to solve this problem is the base dissociation constant We can solve this problem rigorously by invoking both charge balance H NH OH and mass balance M NH NH and using HOH But because the algebra becomes complicated with that method leading to a cubic equation that is hard to solve well invoke two simplifying assumptions which is a reasonable assumption for a basic solution and also reasonable if the percent ionization is small Now we can write The percent ionization is This example illustrates that it is technically incorrect to label a bottle of aqueous ammonia as ammonium hydroxide since only about of one percent of the weak base exists in that form Conjugate acids and bases A common misconception is that strong acids have weak conjugate bases and that weak acids have strong conjugate bases It is easy to see that this is incorrect by remembering that KaKb Kw Our definition of a strong acid or base is that K ie that the substance dissociates completely Our definition of a weak acid or base is K Kw It follows that if Ka strong then Kb cannot be Kw weak In fact strong acids such as HCl dissociate to produce spectator ions such as Cl as conjugate bases whereas weak acids produce weak conjugate bases This is illustrated below for acetic acid and its conjugate base the acetate anion Acetic acid is a weak acid Ka x and acetate is a weak base The strength of a conjugate acidbase varies inversely with the strength or weakness of its parent acid or base Any acid or base is technically a conjugate acid or conjugate base also these terms are simply used to identify species in solution ie acetic acid is the conjugate acid of the acetate anion a base while acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid an acid Neutral oxyacids HSO HPO HNO HClO etc can be classified as strong or weak following a simple rule first noted by Linus Pauling If the number of oxygen atoms exceeds the number of hydrogen atoms by two or more then the acid is strong otherwise it is weak For example HClO and HClO where the difference is and respectively are both strong acids HNO and HClO are both weak because the difference is in both cases For weak acids the relative strength depends on this difference ie HClO is a stronger weak acid than HOCl and on the electronegativity of the central atom HOCl is stronger than HOI Acids that can donate more than one proton are called polyprotic acids For example sulfuric acid HSO is a strong acid that has a conjugate base that actually happens to be a weak acid itself This means that every mole of HSO in aqueous solution donates more than mole of protons Carbonic acid HCO and phosphoric acid HPO are weak polyprotic acids Typically the sequential pKas of polyprotic acid are separated by about pH units because it becomes progressively more difficult to remove protons as the ion becomes more negatively charged For example the three pKas of phosphoric acid are and Amphoteric compounds Some substances can act either as an acid and as a base An example is water HO molecules may either donate a hydrogen ion or accept one This property makes water an amphoteric solvent In the situation where an acid dissociates in solution water is acting as a base Conversely water acts as an acid when bases dissociate The strongest acid we can make in HO is H aq and the strongest base we can make in HO is OH aq Other examples of amphoteric compounds are oxides and hydroxides of elements that lie on the border between the metallic and nonmetallic elements in the periodic table For example aluminum hydroxide AlOH is insoluble at neutral pH but can accept protons in acid to make AlHO or accept an OH ion in base to form AlOH ions Consequently aluminum oxide is soluble in acid and in base but not neutral water Other examples of amphoteric oxides are BeO ZnO GaO SbO and PbO Increasing the oxidation state of a metal increases the acidity of its oxide by withdrawing electron density from the oxygen atoms Thus SbO is acidic but SbO is amphoteric Periodic table showing basic blue amphoteric green and acidic red oxides The metalnonmetal boundary is indicated by the gray staircase line Solvent leveling Solvent leveling is an effect that occurs when a strong acid is placed in a solvent such as but not limited to HO Because strong acids donate their protons to the solvent the strongest possible acid that can exist is the conjugate acid of the solvent In aqueous solution this is HO This means that the strength of acids such as HCl and HBr cannot be differentiated in water as they both are dissociated to HO In the context of our discussion of conjugate bases above we would say that both Cl and Br are spectator ions in water neither one is a strong enough base to accept a proton from HO In order to differentiate the acidities of strong acids such as HClO and HCl or the basicities of strong bases such as CHO and NH we must typically work in nonaqueous solvents as explained below Nonaqueous solutions The Brønsted theory encompasses any type of solvent that can donate and accept H ions not just aqueous solutions The strength of an acid or a base varies depending on the solvent Nonaqueous acidbase chemistry follows similar rules to those developed for acids and bases in water For example in liquid ammonia the solvent autodissociates in the reaction This equilibrium is analogous to the autodissociation of water but has a smaller equilibrium constant K It follows by analogy to water that NH is the strongest acid and NH is the strongest base that can exist in liquid ammonia Because ammonia is a basic solvent it enhances the acidity and suppresses the basicity of substances dissolved in it For example the ammonium ion NH is a weak acid in water Ka x but it is a strong acid in ammonia Similarly acetic acid is weak in water but strong in ammonia Solvent leveling in fact makes HCl CHCOOH and NHCl all strong acids in ammonia where they have equivalent acid strength Strong acids that are leveled in water have different acid strengths in acidic solvents such as HF or anhydrous acetic acid For example acid dissociation of HX in acetic acid CHCOOH involves protonating the solvent to make its conjugate acid CHCOOH and the X anion Because CHCOOH is a stronger acid that HO the anion X which is a spectator in water can become a weak base in CHCOOH It follows that acidic solvents magnify the Brønsted basicities of substances that cannot accept protons in water Conversely basic solvents magnify the acidity of substances that cannot donate a proton to OH The acidity and basicity of nonaqueous solvents is difficult to quantify precisely but one good relative measure is the Hammett acidity function Ho Ho is defined analogously to pH according to the HendersonHasselbach equation For nonaqueous solvents or for acidic or basic compounds in dissolved in solvents that do not themselves dissociate Ho is a rough measure of the pH of the solvent or compound in question Anhydrous HF and HSO have Ho values of approximately and respectively Superacids and superbases The term superacid was originally coined by James Bryant Conant in to describe acids that were stronger than conventional mineral acids George A Olah prepared the socalled magic acid sonamed for its ability to attack hydrocarbons by mixing antimony pentafluoride SbF and fluorosulfonic acid FSOH The name was coined after a candle was placed in a sample of magic acid The candle dissolved showing the ability of the acid to protonate hydrocarbons which under aqueous acidic conditions cannot be protonated Magic acid is made by mixing FSOH and SbF Their reaction generates the HSOF cation which can protonate hydrocarbons At C FSOHSbF converts methane into the tertiarybutyl carbocation a reaction that begins with the protonation of methane Fluoroantimonic acid HSbF can produce solutions with H down to Fluoroantimonic acid is made by combining HF and SbF In this system HF releases its proton H concomitant with the binding of F by antimony pentafluoride which as described below is a Lewis acid The resulting anion SbF is both a weak nucleophile and an extraordinarily weak base Superacids are useful in reactions such as the isomerization of alkanes Industrially anhydrous acidexchanged zeolites which are superacid catalysts are used on a massive scale to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil to gasoline Superbases such as lithium diethylamide LiNEt alkyllithium compounds RLi and Grignard reagents RMgX useful in a broad range of organic reactions LiNEt deprotonates CH bonds to generate reactive carbanions RLi and RMgX are powerful nucleophiles The use of superbases in nonaqueous media allows us to rank the acidities and measure the pKas of different classes of molecules This ranking is particularly important in understanding the reactions of organic molecules Note that the order of acidities for hydrocarbons is alkynes alkenes aromatics alkanes This ordering has to do with the hybridization of the carbon atom that forms the carbanion The negatively charged lone pair of the carbanion is stabilized in orbitals that have high s character eg sp vs sp or sp This is because s orbitals have finite probability density at the nucleus and feel the positive nuclear charge thereby stabilizing the extra negative charge on carbon more than p orbitals Resonance effects also stabilize carbanions Thus cyclopentadiene is more acidic than even an alkyne because the negative charge is delocalized over the entire aromatic CH ring when the CH is deprotonated name formula structural formula pKa Methane CH Propene CH Benzene CH Acetylene CH Cyclopentadiene CH Table Carbon acid acidities in pKa in DMSO Acidbase equilibria in molten salts When a solid salt melts it forms a solution of the cations and anions For example KOH melts at temperatures above C and dissociates into K and OH ions which can act as a solvent for chemical reactions Because of the autodissociation of the OH solvent water is always present in a molten KOH flux according to the acidbase equilibrium It follows that in this very basic solvent water the conjugate acid of the solvent is the strongest acid that can exist The conjugate base of the solvent O is the strongest base This autodissociation equilibrium allows for the acidity of a flux to be easily tuned through the addition or boiling off of water A wet flux is more acidic and can dissolve metal oxides that contain the basic O anion Conversely a dry flux is more basic and will cause oxides to precipitate Molten hydroxide fluxes can thus be used in the synthesis of oxide crystals such as the perovskite superconductor KXBaXBiO Eutectic mixtures of NaOH and KOH are relatively low melting C and can be used as solvents for crystallizing a variety of basic oxides Lewis Acids and Bases The Lewis classification of acids and bases is broader than the BrønstedLowry definition and encompasses many more substances Whereas the BrønstedLowry and the Arrhenius classifications are based on transfer of protons Lewis acidity and basicity are based on the sharing of an electron pair Lewis acids can accept an electron pair while Lewis bases can donate an electron pair This definition encompasses the BrønstedLowry definition in that H is an electron pair acceptor when interacting with a base and a base is an electron pair donor in its interaction with H This is illustrated below for the protonation of ammonia Boron trifluoride BF acts as a Lewis acid when it combines with a basic ion or molecule that can donate an electron pair Such a reaction is shown below ceBF F BF Here the acid is BF and the base is F This acidbase reaction allows boron which is electrondeficient in BF to complete its octet Similarly AlCl is a Lewis acid that can react with Cl a Lewis base to make the Lewis salt AlCl Note that in water Cl is a spectator ion a weaker base than the solvent in Brønsted acidbase reactions Additional examples of Lewis acid base reactions In each try to identify the acid the base and the salt based on the concept that the base is the molecule or ion that donates an electron pair In cases where you are not sure it may help to draw the VSEPR structures of the molecules In other Lewis acid base reactions both acid and base are molecules and the product is referred to as an adduct Lewis acidity is the basis for coordination chemistry a topic we will discuss in more detail in Chapter This is because coordination chemistry involves metal ions that are Lewis acids which bond to ligands that are Lewis bases Determining the strength of metal ion Lewis acids There are three determining factors in the Lewis acid strength of a metal ion The higher positive charge on the metal the more acidic it is For example Al and Fe are good Lewis acids and their salts make acidic solutions in water but Kand Na are not The smaller the atomic radius of the metal ion the more acidic it is Going down the periodic table the Lewis acidity of metal ions decreases eg Al Ga In because the ionic radius increases For transition metal ions more electronegative metals tend to make stronger Lewis acids The electronegativity has maxima at W and Au in the d series so metal ions near in that part of the periodic table are good Lewis acids Molecules with five coordinate geometries eg PCl AsF SbF are typically strong Lewis acids because when accepting another pair of electrons from a base they form an octahedral molecule or anion Neither of the common fivecoordinate geometries trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal is efficient in terms of packing The Lewis acidbase reaction forms an additional bond with a relatively small energetic penalty of stretching the existing bonds Because F is a good Lewis base and also a small anion it can form stable octahedral anions with both main group elements and transition metals For this reason TiO and SiO dissolve in HF but are unreactive with aqueous HCl and other strong acids Lewis bases stabilize high oxidation states An interesting example of using Lewis acidbase chemstry to drive reactions is the chemical synthesis of fluorine gas which was devised by Karl O Christe in Christe at the time was organizing a symposium to commemorate the th anniversary of the isolation of elemental fluorine by Henri Moissan which Moissan did in by electrolyzing a solution of anhydrous HF years later there was still no direct nonelectrochemical synthesis of F Christes reaction scheme followed two steps The first was the known synthesis of KMnF from KMnO The second step involved reacting KMnF with the powerful Lewis acid SbF to make metastable MnF which decomposes spontaneously to MnF and fluorine gas This reaction teaches us something interesting and important about the connection between acidbase and redox chemistry Acids tend to stabilize low oxidation states and bases stabilize high oxidation states We will see this again soon in Chapter in the context of Pourbaix diagrams Mn is stable in the oxidation state in KMnF where it is surrounded by six basic F anions However the highest stable neutral fluoride of Mn is MnF and MnF transiently formed from KMnF spontaneously decomposes to generate fluorine Oxide is a better base than fluoride Interestingly Mn can lose all its valence electrons to form Mn in the permanganate ion MnO Here the oxidation state is stabilized electrostatically by coordination to four O ions and by the overall charge on the MnO anion Because of its charge O is a stronger base and a better ion for stabilizing high oxidation states than F This is a general trend among transition metals the highest oxidation state is usually reached in the oxide not in the fluoride despite the fact that F is a more electronegative element than O For example Cr is stable in the CrO and CrO anions but not in any neutral fluoride or fluoroanion The oxidation state occurs in RuO and OsO but not in any fluoride of Ru or Os B SelfIonization of Ammonia Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Selfionization of ammonia is much weaker than water with K Since ammonia is better proton acceptor than water the ionization of acids is relatively enhanced in liquid ammonia For example acetic acid is a strong acid in liquid ammonia Liquid ammonia will therefore tolerate very strong bases such as that would otherwise be hydrolyzed in water Ammonia is kinetically stabilized to reduction but easily oxidized by many reagents eg the reaction and is very favorable but slow in the absence of a catalyst such as

PrincipleOrbitals and HybridizationReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors The geometrical shape and the inherent physicalchemical properties seen in molecules can be attributed to atomic and molecular orbitals Features of molecular structure can be explained by taking into consideration how orbitals interact within a single atom to form hybrid atomic orbitals and how atomic orbitals between different atoms interact giving rise to molecular orbitals This module will serve as a reminder of the fundamental concepts of bonding as they relate to molecular structure as well as an investigation into the complexities of hybridized atomic orbitals The Localized Electron Bonding ModelThe Heisenberg Uncertainty PrincipleOrbitals and HybridizationReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors The Localized Electron Bonding Model What is a chemical bond The most elementary way to understand the bonding between two or more atoms is to make use of Lewis dot structures a structure drawn where each valence electron surrounding an atom is symbolized by a dot and each bonding electron is symbolized by a pair of dots or a dash Wade p In accordance with the observations of G N Lewis atoms having or sharing valence electrons will tend to be in an arrangement of lowest energy ACS p A more sophisticated approach to understanding bonding is to consider how atomic orbitals within individual atoms interact with one another forming molecular orbitals and subsequent covalent bonding A complete understanding of the subject involves knowledge of quantum mechanics wave functions and molecular symmetry This module will focus on how atomic orbitals on an individual atom can give rise to hybrid atomic orbitals which define the geometry of the bond and how hybrid atomic atoms of different atoms come together to form molecular orbitals which define the geometry of the molecule Why do chemical bonds form The stability of a covalent bond the bond formed when atomic orbitals of separate atoms interact to form molecular orbitals results from there being a large amount of electron density in the region of space between the two nuclei Wade p This region is known as the bonding region and here the electrons are close to both nuclei subsequently lowering the overall energy The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle rationalizes the inability of chemists and physicists alike to simultaneously determine both the position and momentum of an atomic particle in space In lieu of this theoretical chemists had to develop methods of calculating the position of an electron in terms of probabilities rather than assigning electrons fixed location about a nucleus Barret p These calculations are collectively known as quantum mechanics with the Schrodinger wave equation ĤΨ iħ ddtΨ being the quantum mechanic calculation of greatest interest to orbital symmetry Solving the Schrodinger wave equation gives the shapes of atomic orbitals represented graphically as the probability of finding an electron residing in a region of space about an atom Orbitals and Hybridization Valence Bond theory describes the formation of a chemical bond in terms of overlapping between atomic orbitals The s orbital of hydrogen for example can overlap inphase and combine constructively to form a molecular orbital called a sigma bond Furthermore a s orbital is analogous to the fundamental vibration of a guitar string The wave function is seemingly positive and negative simultaneously The effect of squaring the wave function gives the distribution of electron density which can be used to graphically represent the spherical symmetry of an s orbital Atomic orbitals can interact to form new molecular orbitals but let us first consider that orbitals within an individual atom can interact amongst themselves giving rise to hybridized atomic orbitals Yielding a sp hybrid orbital with an electron density predominately concentrated toward one side of the atom Molecular orbital theory dictates that the number of hybrid orbitals produced must equal the sum of the orbitals that underwent hybridization and be it that we started with one s orbital and one p orbital for a total of two orbitals we must finish with a total of two hybrid sp orbitals The final result of this hybridization is a pair of directional sp hybrid orbitals pointed in opposite directions providing enough electron density in the bonding regions to provoke a sigma bond to both the left and the right of the atom These sp hybrid orbitals generate a bond angle of creating a bond formation with linear geometry Lastly the degree of orbital hybridization is governed by the number of attachments ligands found on a central atom lone pairs of electrons included Table provides a summary of orbital hybridization wherein the number of ligands attached to a central molecule correlates to the molecules geometry Table Summary of hybridization of attachments Hybridization Geometry angles sp Linear sp Trigonal planar sp Tetrahedral spd Trigonal bipyramidal and spd Octahedral sp Hybridization As discussed molecular orbitals form as a result of constructive destructive wave overlap of atomic orbitals between different atoms as well as the potential for atomic orbitals contained within an atom can combine amongst themselves giving rise to hybrid atomic orbitals It becomes prudent then to consider the spatial orientation of atomic orbitals during the interaction of orbitals on different atoms in the formation of chemical bonds The chemical bonding of compounds with triple bonds such as alkynes can be expounded by sp hybridization Inspection of the electron configuration of carbon reveals that the electrons in the s orbital mix with only one of the three available p orbitals This results in two hybrid sp orbitals and two unaltered p orbitals CH for instance is held together then by the overlap of adjacentapproaching spsp hybrid orbitals on each carbon atom The bond that ultimately forms is a sigma bond complemented by additional pi bonds formed by pp orbital overlap triple bonds are actually composed of two different types of bonds sigma and pi Each carbon also bonds to a hydrogen by means of a sigma bond formed this time by ssp orbital overlap References Wade LG Organic Chemistry th

solid with a mass of gmol Cesium Chloride is a type of unit cell that is commonly mistaken as BodyCentered Cubic This misconception is easy to make since there is a center atom in the unit cell but CsCl is really a nonclosed packed structure type Introduction CsCl has a boiling point of degrees Celsius a melting point of degrees Celsius and is very soluble in water For the most part this molecule is stable but is not compatible with strong oxidizing agents and strong acids Although it is not hazardous one should not prolong their exposure to CsCl CsCl is an ionic compound that can be prepared by the reaction Figure Coordination Cubes Public Domain Solid State via Wikipedia CsCl crystallize in a primitive cubic lattice which means the cubic unit cell has nodes only at its corners The structure of CsCl can be seen as two interpenetrating cubes one of Cs and one of Cl The ions are not touching one another Touching would cause repulsion between the anion and cation Some may mistake the structure type of CsCl with NaCl but really the two are different CsCl is more stable than NaCl for it produces a more stable crystal and more energy is released Figure Unit Cell of CsCl httpenwikipediaorgwikiCaesium_chloride Anions and cations have similar sizes Each Cs is surrounded by Cl at the corners of its cube and each Cl is also surrounded by Cs at the corners of its cube The cations are located at the center of the anions cube and the anions are located at the center of the cations cube There is one atom in CsCl To determine this the following equation is given Corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell atom Applications Cesium chloride is used in centrifugation a process that uses the centrifugal force to separate mixtures based on their molecular density

in aqueous solution The simplest hydrated form of the hydrogen cation the hydronium hydroxonium ion HO aq is a key object of Arrhenius definition of acid Other simple hydrated forms include the Zundel cation HO which is formed from a hydron and two water molecules and the Eigen cation HO formed from a hydronium ion and three water molecules The hydron itself is crucial in the more general BrønstedLowry acidbase theory which extends the concept of acidbase chemistry beyond aqueous solutions Both of these complexes represent ideal structures in a more general hydrogen bonded network

structures are quite large the HOHO magic ion number structure called magic because of its increased stability with respect to hydration structures involving a comparable number of water molecules Structure from Lancaster site In Theodor Grotthuss proposed a theory of water conductivity He envisioned the electrolytic reaction as a sort of bucket line where each oxygen atom simultaneously passes and receives a single hydrogen atom It was an astonishing theory to propose at the time since the water molecule was thought to be OH not HO and the existence of ions was not fully understood The theory became known as the Grotthuss mechanism The transport mechanism is now thought to involve the interconversion between the Eigen and Zundel solvation structures Eigen to Zundel to Eigen EZE

IntroductionSimple Cubic Unit Cells Bodycentered Cubic Unit CellsFacecentered Cubic Unit CellsReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswersContributors The Unit Cell refers to a part of a simple crystal lattice a repetitive unit of solid bricklike structures with opposite faces and equivalent edge points In Auguste Bravais proved that crystals could be split into fourteen unit cells Although there are several types of unit cells found in cubic lattices we will be discussing the basic ones Simple Cubic Bodycentered Cubic and Facecentered Cubic If any atom recrystalizes it will eventually become the original lattice Crystallization refers the purification processes of molecular or structures Introduction The Unit Cell contains seven crystal systems and fourteen crystal lattices These unit cells are given types and titles of symmetries but we will be focusing on cubic unit cells One of the most commonly known unit cells is rock salt NaCl Sodium Chloride an octahedral geometric unit cell The whole lattice can be reproduced when the unit cell is duplicated in a three dimensional structure These unit cells are imperative for quite a few metals and ionic solids crystallize into these cubic structures Calculating with unit cells is a simple task because edgelengths of the cell are equal along with all ⁰ angles Simple Cubic Unit Cells Simple Cubic unit cells indicate when lattice points are only at the corners They are the simplest hence the title repetitive unit cell The lattice points at the corners make it easier for metals ions or molecules to be found within the crystalline structure This phenomena is rare due to the low packing of density but the closed packed directions give the cube shape Since the edges of each unit cell are equidistant each unit cell is identical In order to be labeled as a Simple Cubic unit cell each eight cornered same particle must at each of the eight corners This unit cell only contains one atom Its packing efficiency is about To packing efficiency we multiply eight corners by oneeighth for only oneeighth of the atom is part of each unit cell giving us one atom Corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell atom To calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows r An example of a Simple Cubic unit cell is Polonium Bodycentered Cubic Unit Cells Bodycentered Cubic BCC unit cells indicate where the lattice points appear not only at the corners but in the center of the unit cell as well The atoms touch one another along the cubes diagonal crossing but the atoms dont touch the edge of the cube All atoms are identical This type of unit cell is more common than that of the Simple Cubic unit cell due to tightly packed atoms Its packing efficiency is about compared to the Simple Cubic unit cells This unit cells contains two atoms To determine this we multiply the previous eight corners by oneeighth and add one for the additional lattice point in the center Corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell additional lattice point atoms To calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows Some examples of BCCs are Iron Chromium and Potassium It is a common mistake for CsCl to be considered bcc but it is not Instead it is nonclosed packed Facecentered Cubic Unit Cells Facecentered Cubic FCC unit cells indicate where the lattice points are at both corners and on each face of the cell This is a more common type of unit cell since the atoms are more tightly packed than that of a Simple Cubic unit cell Like the BCC the atoms dont touch the edge of the cube but rather the atoms touch diagonal to each face Its packing efficiency is the highest with a percentage of Atoms touch one another along the face diagonals All atoms are identical This unit cell contains four atoms To determine this we take the equation from the aforementioned Simple Cubic unit cell and add to the parenthesized six faces of the unit cell multiplied by onehalf due to the lattice points on each face of the cubic cell corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell faces x contribution atoms To calculate edge length in terms of r the equation is as follows Some examples of FCCs

Electronic Effect Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Quantum EffectsContributors and Attributions Magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles This property is demonstrated on a macroscopic scale by making an electromagnet from a coil of wire and a battery Electrons moving through the coil produce a magnetic field Figure which can be thought of as originating from a magnetic dipole or a bar magnet Figure Faradays apparatus for demonstrating that a magnetic field can produce a current A change in the field produced by the top coil induces an emf and hence a current in the bottom coil When the switch is opened and closed the galvanometer registers currents in opposite directions No current flows through the galvanometer when the switch remains closed or open CC BY OpenStax Magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles Electrons in atoms also are moving charges with angular momentum so they too produce a magnetic dipole which is why some materials are magnetic A magnetic dipole interacts with an applied magnetic field and the energy of this interaction is given by the scalar product of the magnetic dipole moment and the magnetic field Magnets are acted on by forces and torques when placed within an external applied magnetic field Figure In a uniform external field a magnet experiences no net force but a net torque The torque tries to align the magnetic moment of the magnet with the external field The magnetic moment of a magnet points from its south pole to its north pole Figure A magnet will feel a force to realign in an external field ie go from a higher energy to a lower energy The energy of this system is determined by Equation ref and classical can vary since the angle between and can vary continuously from low energy to high energy In a nonuniform magnetic field a current loop and therefore a magnet experiences a net force which tries to pull an aligned dipole into regions where the magnitude of the magnetic field is larger and push an antialigned dipole into regions where magnitude the magnetic field is smaller Quantum Effects As expected the quantum picture is different Pieter Zeeman was one of the first to observe the splittings of spectral lines in a magnetic field caused by this interaction Consequently such splittings are known as the Zeeman effect Lets now use our current knowledge to predict what the Zeeman effect for the p to s transition in hydrogen would look like and then compare this prediction with a more complete theory To understand the Zeeman effect which uses a magnetic field to remove the degeneracy of different angular momentum states we need to examine how an electron in a hydrogen atom interacts with an external magnetic field Since magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles we should look for a relationship between the angular momentum and the magnetic dipole moment The relationship between the magnetic dipole moment also referred to simply as the magnetic moment and the angular momentum of a particle with mass m and charge is given by For an electron this equation becomes where the specific charge and mass of the electron have been substituted for and The magnetic moment for the electron is a vector pointing in the direction opposite to both of which classically are perpendicular to the plane of the rotational motion Exercise Will an electron in the ground state of hydrogen have a magnetic moment Why or why not The relationship between the angular momentum of a particle and its magnetic moment is commonly expressed as a ratio called the gyromagnetic ratio Gyro is Greek for turn so gyromagnetic simply relates turning angular momentum to magnetism Now you also know why the Greek sandwiches made with meat cut from a spit turning over a fire are called gyros In the specific case of an electron Exercise Calculate the magnitude of the gyromagnetic ratio for an electron To determine the energy of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field we need to include the operator form of the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian The Hamiltonian always consists of all the energy terms that are relevant to the problem at hand where is the Hamiltonian operator in the absence of the field and is written using the operator forms of Equations and The scalar product simplifies if the zaxis is defined as the direction of the external field because then and are automatically and Equation ref becomes where is the magnitude of the magnetic field which is along the zaxis We now can ask What is the effect of a magnetic field on the energy of the hydrogen atom orbitals To answer this question we will not solve the Schrödinger equation again we simply calculate the expectation value of the energy using the existing hydrogen atom wavefunctions and the new Hamiltonian operator where and Exercise Show that the expectation value The expectation value approach provides an exact result in this case because the hydrogen atom wavefunctions are eigenfunctions of both and If the wavefunctions were not eigenfunctions of the operator associated with the magnetic field then this approach would provide a firstorder estimate of the energy First and higher order estimates of the energy are part of a general approach to developing approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation This approach called perturbation theory is discussed in the next chapter The expectation value calculated for the total energy in this case is the sum of the energy in the absence of the field plus the Zeeman energy The factor defines the constant called the Bohr magneton which is taken to be the fundamental magnetic moment It has units of ergGauss or JouleTesla This factor will help you to relate magnetic fields measured in Gauss or Tesla to energies measured in ergs or Joules for any particle with a charge and mass the same as an electron Equation ref shows that the quantum number degeneracy of the hydrogen atom is removed by the magnetic field For example the three states and which are degenerate in zero field have different energies in a magnetic field as shown in Figure Figure The Zeeman effect Emission when an electron switches from a p orbital to a s orbital occurs at only one energy in the absence of a magnetic field but can occur at three different energies in the presence of a magnetic field The state for which the component of angular momentum and hence also the magnetic moment in the external field direction is zero experiences no interaction with the magnetic field The state for which the angular momentum in the zdirection is ħ and the magnetic moment is in the opposite direction against the field experiences a raising of energy in the presence of a field Maintaining the magnetic dipole against the external field direction is like holding a small bar magnet with its poles aligned exactly opposite to the poles of a large magnet Figure It is a higher energy situation than when the magnetic moments are aligned with each other Figure The effect of an external magnetic field on the energy of a magnetic dipole oriented a with and b against the applied magnetic field Exercise Carry out the steps going from Equation to Equation Exercise Consider the effect of changing the magnetic field on the magnitude of the Zeeman splitting Sketch a diagram where the magnetic field strength is on the xaxis and the energy of the three p orbitals is on the yaxis to show the trend in splitting magnitudes with increasing magnetic field Be quantitative calculate and plot the exact numerical values using a

for NHP molecule and P ion MO diagram for NH We can now attempt the MO diagram for NH building on the result we obtained with triangular H Notes on the MO diagram for ammonia Viewed endon a porbital or an spx hybrid orbital looks just like an sorbital Hence we can use the solutions we developed with sorbitals for H to set up the σ bonding and antibonding combinations of nitrogen sp orbitals with the H s orbitals We now construct the sp hybrid orbitals of the nitrogen atom and orient them so that one is up and the other three form the triangular base of the tetrahedron The latter three by analogy to the H ion transform as one totally symmetric orbital a and an esymmetry pair The hybrid orbital at the top of the tetrahedron also has a symmetry The three hydrogen s orbitals also make one a and one doubly degenerate e combination We make bonding and antibonding combinations with the nitrogen orbitals of the same symmetry The remaining a orbital on N is nonbonding The dotted lines show the correlation between the basis orbitals of a and e symmetry and the molecular orbitals The result in the electron NH molecule is three NH bonds and one lone pair localized on N the same as the valence bond picture but much more work P molecule and P ion By analogy to NH we can construct the MO picture for one vertex of the P tetrahedron and then multiply the result by to get the bonding picture for the molecule An important difference is that there is relatively little sp hybridization in P so the lone pair orbitals have more scharacter and are lower in energy than the bonding orbitals which are primarily pσ Take away electrons to make P Highest occupied MO is a bonding orbital break one bond bonds left Square form relieves ring strain B Valence and Core Electrons Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Relationship with Chemical ReactivityReferences The electrons of an atom are typically divided into two categories valence and core electrons Valence electrons occupy the outermost shell or highest energy level of an atom while core electrons are those occupying the innermost shell or lowest energy levels This difference greatly influences the role of the two types of electrons in a chemical reaction Generally valence electrons can participate in the formation of chemical bonding but core electrons cannot While core electrons are not involved in bonding they influence the chemical reactivity of an atom The electron configuration of a oxygen atom is which may be shorted where the stands for the configuration of helium Similarly the configuration of calcium with electrons can be written where the stands for the configuration of argon Electronic configurations that are the same as noble gases are very stable since they have a full octet except helium with a full s orbital The electrons in oxygen do not participate in bonding ie chemistry and are called core electrons The valence electrons ie the part are valence electrons which do participate in the making and breaking of bonds Similarly in calcium Equation the electrons in the argonlike closed shell are the core electrons and the the two electrons in the s orbital are valence electrons Example Cobalt What are the core and valence electrons in cobalt Solution Start by writing the electron configuration of cobalt with electrons However argon has the electronic structure so we can rewrite the configuration as The two electrons in the orbital and the seven electrons in the are the valence electrons all others are core electrons The periodicity of valance electrons can be seen in the Periodic Table Basically the periodicity is only applied to the main group elements while in transition metals rules are complex The core electrons remain the same in the increase of group numbers in the main group elements On the other hand the valance electrons increase by one from left to right of a main period and remain the same down the column of a main group This evolution gives periodical change in property of a period and similar chemical property of a group which is called periodical trend The number of valence electrons in a main period is the same as its group number The table below shows this rule clearly Under construction Figure A A are metals A to A are nonmetals However this periodicity cannot be applied to the transition group which is more complicated than that of the main group Although the outermost electrons can be easily determined the apparent valence electrons considered in chemical reactivity are complex and fluctuated Electrons going into d sublevel can play either a role of valence electrons or shielding electrons So there is not always a certain number of apparent valence electrons The number of apparent valence electrons for the first transition metal period is shown in the table below Under construction Figure Valence electrons for transition metals Relationship with Chemical Reactivity The chemical reactivity of an atom is mainly determined by valence electrons Atoms which have a complete shell of valence electrons tend to be chemically inert Atoms with one or two valence electrons are highly reactive This phenomenon can be explained by Hunds rule which states that orbitals that are empty halffull or full are more stable than those that are not For example Ne is chemically inert because it has two valence electrons that fill its outermost shell which makes it stable compared to atoms such as Al which has three valence electrons but its valence electrons does not fill its outermost shell Although core electrons do not take part in chemical bonding they play a role in determining the chemical reactivity of an atom This influence is generally due to the effect it has on valence electrons The effect can be observed from the gradual change of chemical reactivity in a group As you go down a group more shells are occupied by electrons which increases the size of the atom The more core electron shells an atom has the larger the size of the atom and the farther the valence electrons are from the nucleus thus the valence electrons will experience less effective nuclear charge and will be easily lost For example and can both react with water but K has a more radical reaction because it has more shells of core electrons which makes the valence electron in its outermost orbital much easier to lose than the valence electron of Na References Miessler Gary L and Donald A Tarr Inorganic Chemistry Upper Saddle River NJ Pearson Prentice Hall Print Brown Ian David The Chemical Bond in Inorganic Chemistry the Bond

Us Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Bioinorganic chemistryContributors Among the drawbacks of the technique are the limited number of gamma ray sources and the requirement that samples be solid in order to eliminate the recoil of the nucleus Mössbauer spectroscopy is unique in its sensitivity to subtle changes in the chemical environment of the nucleus including oxidation state changes the effect of different ligands on a particular atom and the magnetic environment of the sample As an analytical tool Mössbauer spectroscopy has been especially useful in the field of geology for identifying the composition of ironcontaining specimens including meteors and moon rocks In situ data collection of Mössbauer spectra has also been carried out on iron rich rocks on Mars In another application Mössbauer spectroscopy is used to characterize phase transformations in iron catalysts eg those used for FischerTropsch synthesis While initially consisting of hematite FeO these catalysts transform into a mixture of magnetite FeO and several iron carbides The formation of carbides appears to improve catalytic activity however it can also lead to the mechanical breakup and attrition of the catalyst particles which can cause difficulties in the final separation of catalyst from reaction products Mössbauer spectroscopy has also been used to determine the relative concentration change in the oxidation state of antimony Sb during the selective oxidation of olefins During calcination all the Sb ions in an antimonycontaining tin dioxide catalyst transform into the oxidation state Following the catalytic reaction almost all Sb ions revert from the to the oxidation state A significant change in the chemical environment surrounding the antimony nucleus occurs during the oxidation state change which can easily be monitored as an isomer shift in the Mössbauer spectrum This technique has also been used to observe the secondorder transverse Doppler effect predicted by the theory of relativity because of very high energy resolution Bioinorganic chemistry Mossbauer spectroscopy has been widely applied to bioinorganic chemistry especially for the study of ironcontaining proteins and enzymes Often the technique is used to determine the oxidation state of iron Examples of prominent ironcontaining biomolecules are ironsulfur proteins ferritin hemes including the cytochromes These studies are often supplemented by analysis of related model complexes An area of particular interest is the characterization of intermediates involved in oxygen activation by iron proteins Vibrational spectra of iron enrched biomolecules can be acquired using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopyNRVS in which the sample is scanned through a range of synchrotrongenerated Xrays centered at the Mossbauer absorbance frequency Stokes and antistokes peaks in the spectrum correspond to low frequency vibrational many below cm with some below cm Contributors Wikipedia Page ID No

Values Last updated Save as PDF Page ID ElectronegativitySlaters rulesAllredRochow ElectronegativityReferencesProblemsContributors and Attributions AllredRochow Electronegativity is a measure that determines the values of the electrostatic force exerted by the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons The value of the effective nuclear charges is estimated from Slaters rules The higher charge the more likely it will attract electrons Although Slaters rule are partly empirical So the AllredRochow electronegativity is no more rigid than the Pauling Electronegativity Electronegativity Pauling established Electronegativity as the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electron to itself It is a measure of the atoms ability to attract electron to itself while the electron is still attached to another atom The higher the values the more likely that atom can pull electron from another atom and into itself Electronegativity correlates with bond polarity ionization energy electron affinity effective nuclear charge and atomic size Table Pauling Electronegativity Values H Li Be B C N O F Na Mg Al Si P S Cl K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo Te Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Cs Ba La Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Po At The periodic trend for electronegativity generally increases from left to right and decreases as it go down the group The exception are Hydrogen and the noble gases because the noble gases are content with their filled outermost shells and hydrogen cannot bear to lose a valence electron unlike the rest of the group metals The elements in the halogen group usually have the highest electronegativity values because they only need to attract one valence electron to complete the octet in their outer shell Whereas the group elements except for Hydrogen are willing to give up their only valence electron so they can fulfill having a complete filled outer shell Slaters rules Slaters rules are rules that provides the values for the effective nuclear charge concept or These rules are based on experimental data for electron promotion and ionization energies and is determined from this equation Where is the nuclear charge is the effective nuclear charge and is the shielding constant Through this equation this tells us that electron may get reduced nuclear charge due to high shielding Allred and Rochow used because it is accurate due to the involvement of shielding that prevents electron to reach its true nuclear charge When an atom with filled sshell attracts electrons those electrons will go to the unfilled porbital Since the electrons have the same negative charge they will not only repel each other but also repel the electrons from the filled sshell This creates a shielding effect where the inner core electrons will shield the outer core electrons from the nucleus Not only would the outer core electrons experience effective nuclear charge but it will make them easily removed from the outer shell Thus It is easier for outer electrons to penetrate the p shell which has little likelihood of being near the nuclear rather than the s shell Consider this each of the outer electron in the ns np group contributes S S in the n shell and S in the n or lower shells Example Slaters Rules Lets consider this example of finding the for s electrons in Ca Since Ca has atomic number of Z Then we find the electron configuration for Ca which is sspsps Now we got that we can use Slaters rules So Ca has a of AllredRochow Electronegativity Allred and Rochow were two chemists who came up with the AllredRochow Electronegativity values by taking the electrostatic force exerted by effective nuclear charge Zeff on the valence electron To do so they came up with an equation At the time the values for the covalent radius were inaccurate Allred and Rochow added certain perimeters so that it would more closely correspond to Paulings electronegativity scale Table AllredRochow Electronegativity

a Homogeneous catalysisCoordination and dissociationOxidative additionInsertion reactionReaction of a coordinated ligandb Solid state catalysis Catalysts reduce the activation energy of reactions and enhance the rate of specific reactions Therefore they are crucially important in chemical industry exhaust gas treatment and other chemical reactions While the chemical essence of catalysis is obscure practical catalysts have been developed based on the accumulation of empirical knowledge However while gradually we have come to understand the mechanisms of homogeneous catalysis through the development of inorganic chemistry our understanding of surface reactions in solid catalysts is also deepening a Homogeneous catalysis The chemistry of catalysts that are soluble in solvents has developed remarkably since the epochmaking discovery of the Wilkinson catalyst RhClPPh This complex is a purplish red compound which forms by heating RhCl HO and PPh under reflux in ethanol When dissolved in an organic solvent this complex is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons by H at ambient temperatures and pressures to form saturated hydrocarbons and hydroformylation reactions of olefins with H and CO to form aldehydes In the past the mechanism of catalytic reactions were generally not very clear Before the Wilkinson catalyst the Reppe process which oligomerize aceylenes or the ZieglerNatta catalysts that polymerize olefins and dienes had been discovered and detailed studies on homogeneous catalysis had been conducted from the viewpoint of the chemistry of complexes Consequently catalytic reactions are now established as a cycle of a combination of a few elementary steps that occur on the metals of catalyst complexes Coordination and dissociation There must be a process in which reactants such as olefins are activated and react with other reactants after being coordinated to the central metal of a complex and they dissociate from the metal as products Oxidative addition Oxidative addition is one among a few key elementary reactions of metal complexes This is a reaction of such compounds as alkali metal halides RX acids HX or dihydrogen H to the metal in a complex which then dissociate into R and X H and X or H and H which are bonded to the metal as two fragment anions If other ligands on the start complex are not removed the coordination number increases by two As alkyl halogen and hydride ligands are more electronegative than the central metal they are regarded as formally anionic ligands after coordination Therefore the oxidation number of the central metal increases after an addition reaction As it is an addition reaction accompanied by oxidation of the central metal it is called oxidative addition For example in the addition reaction of an alkyl halide to a tetracoordinate iridiumI complex IrClCO PPh iridium becomes hexacoordinate and undergoes twoelectron oxidation from to Since a neutral RI molecule is added there must be no change in the charge of the whole complex and if an alkyl and iodine are anions the oxidation number of the central metal should increase by Similar change occur when two hydride ligands are formed as the result of the addition of dihydrogen The reverse reaction is called reductive elimination Both oxidative and reductive reactions are very important as elementary steps in the mechanism of homogeneous catalysis involving hydrocarbons and dihydrogen Exercise How does the oxidation number of rhodium change with reductive elimination of dihydrogen from RhClHPPh Sol Answer It changes to RhI from RhIII Insertion reaction In the reaction of an alkyl or hydride ligand to shift to a carbonyl or olefin ligand coexisting on the central metal the resultant complex appears as if a carbonyl or an olefin has inserted between the MR or MH bond This is called an insertion reaction Reaction of a coordinated ligand This is the process in which a coordinated reactant reacts to form a product By coordinating to a metal the reactants take geometrically and electronically suitable conformations It is the basis of catalyst design to control these reaction conditions Since a reaction is repeated while the complex used as a catalyst remains unchanged by forming a cycle of reactions the reactantscomplex ratio is very small coinciding with the definition of a catalyst The catalytic cycle in hydrogenation of ethylene is illustrated in Figure Figure Catalytic cycle of ethylene hydrogenation by the Wilkinson catalyst L is a ligand and Sol is a solvent molecule If the triphenylphosphine ligand PCH in the Wilkinson catalyst is replaced by an optical active phosphine asymmetric hydrogenation is realized Asymmetrical catalysis equivalent to enzyme reactions have been developed by skillful design of asymetrical ligands In particular the asymmetric induction of binaphtyldiphosphine BINAP has attracted attention b Solid state catalysis A solid catalyst is also called a heterogeneous catalyst and promotes the reaction of reactants in gaseous or liquid phases in contact with a solid material Since adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface is the initial step a large surface area is required for good efficiency of catalysis Polyphase systems which carry active catalysts on materials such as zeolites with small pores of molecular sizes and gamma alumina and silica gel with large surface area are often used Previously solid state catalysis was explained as arising from a mysterious activation of reactants due to adsorption but it has become increasingly clear that catalysis is ascribable to surface chemical reactions Namely the action of solid state catalysts depends on activation of reactants by surface acids or bases and by coordination to the metal surface It is possible to observe these interactions using various spectroscopies infrared spectroscopy EXAFS extended Xray absorption fine structure electronic spectra electron microscopy or STM scanning tunnelling microscopy Since mechanisms of homogeneous catalysis have been clarified considerably solid surface reactions can also be analyzed by introducing concepts such as surface complexes or surface organometallic compounds However unlike homogeneous catalysis in which only one or a few metal centers participate many active sites are involved in solid state catalysis Since surface homogeneity and reproducibility are difficult to maintain major parts of reaction mechanisms are obscure even for such simple reactions as ammonia synthesis During the direct production of ammonia from dinitrogen and dihydrogen reactions occur using iron catalysts containing alkali metal or alkaline earth metal oxides as activators at high temperatures about C and under high pressures about atm Prior to the epochmaking discovery of this process by F Haber all nitrogen compounds came from natural resources The realization of this discovery has had an immeasurable influence upon chemical industries as ammonia is indispensable to the manufacture of fertilizers gunpowder and other inorganic compounds containing nitrogen In recognition of this a Nobel Prize was awarded to F Haber for this invention A huge volume of research on the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of ammonia synthesis has been performed up until the present because the reaction of dinitrogen and dihydrogen on iron catalysts is a good model of solid state catalysis C Born Forces Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionImplications of Born ForcesReferencesProblemsSolutions Born forces are one type of force that acts upon atoms in an ionic lattice In simplest terms because ions have some finite size electronelectron and nucleusnucleus interactions occur and give rise to repulsion forces and electrostatic potential both called Born forces Introduction Lattice energy is the energy released when gaseous cations and anions bond to form a solid ionic compound With the BornLande equation one can calculate the lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound Born and Lande theorized around the turn of the century that lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound could be found by calculating terms of electrostatic potential and a repulsive potential with is the avagadros constant times and is the Madelung Constant The first potential is the force of attraction It is a negative value because it pulls the two atoms closer together and the forming of a bond is energetically favorable The negative value of Avogadros number x times a Madelung Constant varies times the absolute value of the charge of the cation times the absolute value of the charge of the anion times the charge of an electron x C all over four times pi times the emissivity of space times the ion radius with is the repulsion coefficient and is the Born exponent The second equation is the repulsive force It found by multiplying Avogadros number x by a repulsion coefficient and dividing that by the ionic radius raised to the power of a Born exponent some number between and Implications of Born Forces Attractive forces are affected by the charge of the ions and their radii Ions with large charges like Mg or O have greater attractive potential than those with smaller charges like Na or F Smaller ions like Li or Cl also have greater electrostatic potential than larger ions like I or Cs The Madelung constant is dependent on the crystal structure type This value is found in tables online or in a text but in general can be thought of as large with larger cationcation distances and anionanion distances A structure with fluorite geometry has a relatively large A value whereas rock salt crystals have a much lower A value Repulsive forces are mainly determined by the born exponent The Born exponent is dictated by the electronic configuration of the noble gas in the row above it on the periodic table a closed shell Max Born Max Born was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics He also made contributions to solidstate physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of

Ethylene The π system is analogous to σbonding in H Viewed from the top or bottom the ethylene πorbitals look like the H σ orbitals Thus we can map solutions from chains and rings of H atoms onto chains and rings of πorbitals as we did for the threeorbital case of O Chains and rings of four H atoms or πorbitals H or butadiene MO diagram for H or butadiene A few notes about this MO diagram In the linear form of the molecule the combination of AOs makes a ladder of evenly spaced energy levels that alternate g u g u Each successive orbital has one more node This is a general rule for linear chains of σ or π orbitals with even numbers of atoms In the cyclic form of the molecule there is one nondegenerate orbital at the bottom one at the top and a ladder of doubly degenerate orbitals in between This is also a general rule for cyclic molecules with even numbers of atoms This is the origin of the n rule for aromatics H has four valence electrons and by analogy butadiene has four πelectrons These electrons fill the lowest two MOs in the linear form of the molecule corresponding to two conjugated πbonds in butadiene HCCHCHCH In the cyclic form of the molecule the degenerate orbitals are singly occupied The molecule can break the degeneracy and lower its energy by distorting to a puckered rectangle This is a general rule for antiaromatic cyclic molecules n rule Thus cyclobutadiene should be antiaromatic and have two single and two double bonds that are not delocalized by resonance Cyclobutadiene is actually a very unstable molecule because it polymerizes to relieve ring strain Sterically hindered derivatives of the molecule do have the puckered rectangular structure predicted by MO theory Benzene πorbitals How do we get from a atom to atom chain By analogy to the process we used to go from a atom chain to a atom chain we now go from to We start with the orbitals of the atom chain which form a ladder of g and u orbitals Then we make g and u combinations of the two atoms that we are adding at the ends By combining gs with gs and us with us we end up with the solutions for a string of atoms Closing these orbitals into a loop gives us the π molecular orbitals of the benzene molecule The result is three π bonds as we expected Benzene fits the n rule n and is therefore aromatic Here we have used the isolobal analogy to construct MO diagrams for πbonded systems such as ethylene and benzene from combinations of sorbitals It raises the interesting question of whether the aromatic n rule might apply to sorbital systems ie if three molecules of H could get together to form an aromatic Hmolecule In fact recent studies of hydrogen under ultrahigh pressures in a diamond anvil cell show that such structures do form A solid hydrogen phase exists that contains sheets of distorted sixmembered rings analogous to the fully connected D network of sixmembered rings found in graphite or graphene It should now be evident from our construction of MO diagrams for four and sixorbital molecules that we can keep adding atomic orbitals to make chains and rings of atoms In each case the g and u orbitals form a ladder of MOs At the bottom rung of the ladder of an Natom chain there are no nodes in the MO and we add one node for every rung until we get to the top where there are N nodes Another way of saying this is that the wavelength of an electron in orbital x counting from the bottom xN is Nax where a is the distance between atoms We will find in Chapters and that we can learn a great deal about the electronic

Polyatomic chalcogen cations and anionsc Metal sulfidesChevrel phase compounds a Simple substances Sulfur selenium and tellurium are called chalcogens Simple substances and compounds of oxygen and of the elements of this group in the later periods have considerably different properties As a result of having much smaller electronegativities than oxygen they show decreased ionicity and increased bond covalency resulting in a smaller degree of hydrogen bonding Because they have available d orbitals chalcogens have increased flexibility of valence and can easily bond to more than two other atoms Catenation is the bonding between the same chalcogen atoms and both simple substances and ions of chalcogens take a variety of structures The major isotopes of sulfur are S abundance S S and S and there are also six radioactive isotopes Among these S I can be used for NMR Since the isotope ratio of sulfurs from different locations differs the accuracy of the atomic weight is limited to Because the electronegativity of sulfur is much smaller than that of oxygen and sulfur is a soft element the ionicity in the bonds of sulfur compounds is low and hydrogen bonding is not important Elemental sulfur has many allotropes such as S S S S S S S S S S S and S reflecting the catenation ability of sulfur atoms Elemental sulfur is usually a yellow solid with a melting point of C called orthorhombic sulfur sulfur Phasetransition of this polymorph produces monoclinic sulfur sulfur at C It was established in that these are crownlike cyclic molecules Figure Being molecular they dissolve well in organic solvents such as CS Not only membered rings but also S rings are known and the helix polymer of sulfur is an infinitely annular sulfur Diatomic molecular S and triatomic molecular S exist in the gaseous phase When sulfur is heated it liquifies and becomes a rubberlike macromolecule on cooling The diversity of structures of catenated sulfur is also seen in the structures of the polysulfur cations or anions resulting from the redox reactions of the catenated species Figure Structures of S S and S Selenium is believed to have six isotopes Se is the most abundant and Se with nuclear spin I is useful in NMR The accuracy of atomic weight of selenium is limited to two decimal places because of composition change of its isotopes Among many allotropes of selenium socalled red selenium is an Se molecule with a crownlike structure and is soluble in CS Gray metallic selenium is a polymer with a helical structure Black selenium which is a complicated polymer is also abundant Tellurium also has eight stable isotopes and an atomic weight of Te and Te are the most abundant isotopes and Te and Te with I can be used in NMR There is only one crystalline form of tellurium which is a spiral chain polymer that shows electric conductivity b Polyatomic chalcogen cations and anions Although it has long been recognized that solutions of chalcogen elements in sulfuric acid showed beautiful blue red and yellow colors the polycationic species that give rise to these colors S S S S S S or those of other chalcogen atoms have been isolated by the reaction with AsF etc and their structures determined For example unlike neutral S S takes a cyclic structure that has a weak coupling interaction between two transannular sulfur atoms Figure On the other hand alkali metal salts NaS KS and alkaline earth metal salt BaS a transitionmetal salt MoS a complex CpWS etc of polysulfide anions Sx x in which the sulfur atoms are bonded mutually have been synthesized and their structures determined As is evident from the fact that elemental sulfur itself forms S molecules sulfur unlike oxygen tends to catenate Therefore formation of polysulfide ions in which many sulfur atoms are bonded is feasible and a series of polysulfanes HSx x has actually been synthesized c Metal sulfides Stratified disulfides MS are important in transition metal sulfides They show two types of structures One has a metal in a triangular prismatic coordination environment and the other has a metal in an octahedral coordination environment MoS is the most stable black compound among the molybdenum sulfides L Pauling determined the structure of MoS in The structure is constructed by laminating two sulfur layers between which a molybdenum layer is intercalated Figure Alternatively two sulfur layers are stacked and a molybdenum layer is inserted between them Therefore the coordination environment of each molybdenum is a triangular prism of sulfur atoms Since there is no bonding interaction between sulfur layers they can easily slide resulting in graphitelike lubricity MoS is used as a solid lubricant added to gasoline and also as a catalyst for hydrogenation reactions Figure Structure of MoS ZrS TaS etc take the CdItype structure containing metal atoms in an octahedral coordination environment constructed by sulfur atoms Chevrel phase compounds There are superconducting

TheoryDescribe HCN molecular bond by using Valence Bond TheoryReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors HCN hydrogen cyanide is a volatile and poisnous compound with distinguished bitter odor It is linear molecule with a triple bond between C and N atom and has bond angle of degrees It can be found in fruits that have pits due to the fact that they contain small amounts of cyanohydrins which slowly releases hydrogen cyanide Also it can be found in exhaust of vehicles and burning nitrogencontainig plastics Introduction The valence bond theory can be explained by overlapping of atomic orbitals which electrons are localized in the reigion to form chemical bonds However when you utilize this approach to explain chemical structure of the molecule you must aware that there are various atomic orbitals for bonding which will significantly influence the structure of the molecule Definition of Valence Bond Theory The Valence Bond thoery simply explains the bond formation just like lewis dot structure but instead it explains the bonding in terms of covalent bond by quantum mechanics According to this theory bond will form when An orbital of one atom occupy another atoms orbital known as overlap number of electrons in both orbital is adds up to no more than two Just like forming a molecule with lewis dot structure bonds between atoms complete when two electrons share same orbital together Bond strength depends on the the amount of overlap since electrons are attracted to nuclei of both atoms more electrons will pull more nuceli thus increase bond strength However two orbitals can not contian more than two atoms due to the maximum capacity it can hold Also because known atomic geometry can not be able to have effective overlap atomic orbitals combine with each other and reconfigure themselves into a different configuration This process is called hybrdization This formation of new hybrid orbital is possible by combining several types of orbitals spd and etc Describe HCN molecular bond by using Valence Bond Theory In HCN molecule the C atom includes sphybridized orbital since it will combine with only two other atoms to form HCN One of the sphybrid orbitals of carbon atom overlaps with the s orbital of H atom while the other sphybrid orabital mixes with one of the nitrogens atoms three atomic p orbitals which were unhybridized Because px orbital of C and N will form sigma bond this leaves with two N atom porbitals which form two mutually perpendicular pi bonds to the two atomic p orbitals on the C atom HCN thus has one single and one triple bond The latter consists of a sigma bond from the overlap of a C atom sp hybrid orbital with a N atom p orbital and two mutually perpendicular pi bonds are formed from parallel atomic p orbitals of

hybridization Lewis dot structure can be used to get the basic idea of the structure Because of the pi bonds and sigma bond formed by the hybridization of px py and pz between C and N atoms this p overlap makes the bond stronger and shorter therefore the bond between C and N is linear Also based on the property of atoms to be on the position at smallest strichinderance as possible H atom will be as far away from C atom which will result in the linear structure Contributors Chelate and Macrocyclic Effects Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Ligands that contain more than one binding site for a metal ion are called chelating ligands from the Greek word χηλή chēlē meaning claw As the name implies chelating ligands have high affinity for metal ions relative to ligands with only one binding group which are called monodentate single tooth ligands Ethylenediamine en is a bidentate ligand that forms a fivemembered ring in coordinating to a metal ion M Consider the two complexation equilibria in aqueous solution between the cobalt II ion Coaq and ethylenediamine en on the one hand and ammonia NH on the other Electronically the ammonia and en ligands are very similar since both bind through N and since the Lewis base strengths of their nitrogen atoms are similar This means that ΔH must be very similar for the two reactions since six CoN bonds are formed in each case Interestingly however we observe that the equilibrium constant is times larger for the second reaction than it is for the first The big difference between these two reactions is that the second one involves condensation of fewer particles to make the complex This means that the entropy changes for the two reactions are different The first reaction has a ΔS value close to zero because there are the same number of molecules on both sides of the equation The second one has a positive ΔS because four molecules come together but seven molecules are produced The difference between them ΔΔS is about JmolK We can translate this into a ratio of equilibrium constants using KfenKfNH eΔΔGRT eΔΔSR e The bottom line is that the chelate effect is entropydriven It follows that the more binding groups a ligand contains the more positive the ΔS and the higher the Kf will be for complex formation In this regard the hexadentate ligand ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA is an optimal ligand for making octahedral complexes because it has six binding groups In basic solutions where all four of the COOH groups are deprotonated the chelate effect of the EDTA ligand is approximately This means for a given metal ion Kf is times larger for EDTA than it would be for the relevant monodentate ligands at the same concentration EDTAtightly binds essentially any or ion in the periodic table and is a very useful ligand for both analytical applications and separations Ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid acid EDTA a hexadentate ligand The macrocyclic effect follows the same principle as the chelate effect but the effect is further enhanced by the cyclic conformation of the ligand Macrocyclic ligands are not only multidentate but because they are covalently constrained to their cyclic form they allow less conformational freedom The ligand is said to be preorganized for binding and there is little entropy penalty for wrapping it around the metal ion For example heme b is a tetradentate cyclic ligand which is strongly complexes transition metal ions including in biological systems Fe Heme b Some other common chelating and cyclic ligands are shown below Acetylacetonate acac right is an anionic bidentate ligand that coordinates metal ions through two oxygen atoms Acac is a hard base so it prefers hard acid cations With divalent metal ions acac forms neutral volatile complexes such as Cuacac and Moacac that are useful for chemical vapor deposition CVD of metal thin films Bipyridine and related bidentate ligands such as phenanthroline below center left form propellershaped complexes with metals such as Ru The Rubpy complex below left is photoluminescent and can also undergo photoredox reactions making it an interesting compound for both photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis The chiral propellor shapes of metal polypyridyl complexes such as Rubpy coincidentally match the size and helicity of the major groove of DNA This has led to a number of interesting studies of electron transfer reactions along the DNA backbone initiated by photoexcitation of the metal complex Prof Jacqueline Barton Caltech has used metal polypyridyl complexes to study electron transfer reactions that are implicated in the biological sensing and repair of damage in DNA molecules Crown ethers such as crown below center right are cyclic hard bases that can complex alkali metal cations Crowns can selectively bind Li Na or K depending on the number of ethylene oxide units in the ring The chelating properties of crown ethers are mimetic of the natural antibiotic

IntroductionWhat are EnantiomersUsing Symmetry to Determine Chirality Introduction Around the year the French scientist Louis Pasteur provided an explanation for the optical activity of tartaric acid salts when he carried out a particular reaction Pasteur observed that two types of crystals precipitated Patiently and carefully using tweezers Pasteur was able to separate the two types of crystals Pasteur noticed that the types rotated the plane polarized by the same amount but in different directions These two compounds are called enantiomers What are Enantiomers Two compounds are enantiomers if they are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other As was mentioned enantiomers are characterized by their ability to rotate planepolarized light They also have the same physical properties eg melting point etc relative to each other As a result they are also referred to as being optically active When it comes to symmetry there are some general rules of thumb that help determine whether a molecule is chiral or achiral This can be very useful because sometimes molecules can have relatively complicated structures and geometries that knowing whether or not they are chiral becomes a daunting task The goal as a result is to determine the point group of the molecule and the symmetry elements associated with it then inferring the chirality of the molecule Using Symmetry to Determine Chirality For a molecule to be chiral it must lack Center of inversion and a plane of symmetry An improper rotation axis rotationreflection axis However since by definition an improper rotation axis is a rotation about an certain axis followed by reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis and an inversion center is simply the absence of an improper axis requires in most cases that absence of both a plane of symmetry and an inversion center As a result it suffices in most cases to check for improper rotation axes to determine whether a molecule is chiral or not As a result of the previous discussion there are a few classes of point groups that lack an improper axis Those classes are and Cisdichlorobisethylenediaminecobalt III has two enantiomers that are chiral figure but the trans compound is achiral Figure One of the chiral enantiomers of Cisdichlorobisethylenediaminecobalt III C Hückel MO Theory Last updated Save as PDF Page ID EthyleneContributors Learning Objectives Demonstrate how Hückels theory approximates teh full molecular orbital picture of molecules by treating the bonding and bonding networks independently Molecular orbital theory has been very successfully applied to large conjugated systems especially those containing chains of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds An approximation introduced by Hückel in considers only the delocalized p electrons moving in a framework of bonds This is in fact a more sophisticated version of a freeelectron model The simplest hydrocarbon to consider that exhibits bonding is ethylene ethene which is made up of four hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms Experimentally we know that the HCH and HCC angles in ethylene are approximately This angle suggests that the carbon atoms are sp hybridized which means that a singly occupied sp orbital on one carbon overlaps with a singly occupied s orbital on each H and a singly occupied sp lobe on the other C Thus each carbon forms a set of three bonds two CH sp s and one CC sp sp part a of Figure Figure a The σbonded framework is formed by the overlap of two sets of singly occupied carbon sp hybrid orbitals and four singly occupied hydrogen s orbitals to form electronpair bonds This uses of the valence electrons to form a total of five bonds four CH bonds and one CC bond b One singly occupied unhybridized pz orbital remains on each carbon atom to form a carboncarbon bond Note by convention in planar molecules the axis perpendicular to the molecular plane is the zaxis CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The Hückel approximation is used to determine the energies and shapes of the molecular orbitals in conjugated systems Within the Hückel approximation the covalent bonding in these hydrocarbones can be separated into two independent frameworks the bonding framework and the the bonding framework The wavefunctions used to describe the bonding orbitals in each framework results from different combinations of atomic orbitals The method limits itself to addressing conjugated hydrocarbons and specifically only electron molecular orbitals are included because these determine the general properties of these molecules the sigma electrons are ignored This is referred to as sigmapi separability and is justified by the orthogonality of and orbitals in planar molecules For this reason the Hückel method is limited to planar systems Hückel approximation assumes that the electrons in the bonds feel an electrostatic potential due to the entire bonding framework in the molecule ie it focuses only on the formation of bonds given that the bonding framework has already been formed Conjugated Systems A conjugated system has a region of overlapping porbitals bridging the interjacent single bonds that allow a delocalization of electrons across all the adjacent aligned porbitals These electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom but rather to a group of atoms Ethylene Before considering the Hückel treatment for ethylene it is beneficial to review the general bonding picture of the molecule Bonding in ethylene involves the hybridization of the and atomic orbitals on each carbon atom leaving the orbitals untouched Figure Figure Hybridizing of the carbon atomic orbitals to give hybrid orbitals for bonding to hydrogen atoms in ethylene CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The use of hybrid orbitals in the molecular orbital approach describe here is merely a convenience and not invoking valence bond theory directly An identical description can be extracted using exclusively atomic orbitals on carbon but the interpretation of the resulting wavefunctions is less intuitive For example the ith molecular orbital can be described via hybrid orbitals or via atomic orbitals where and are coefficients of the expansion Either describe will work and both are identical approaches since where are coefficients describing the hybridized orbital The bonding occurs via the mixing of the electrons in the hybrid orbitals on carbon and the electrons in the atomic orbitals of the four hydrogen atoms Figure left resulting in the bonding framework The bonding framework results from the unhybridized orbitals Figure right The independence of these two frameworks is demonstrated in the resulting molecular orbital diagram in Figure Hückel theory is concerned only with describing the molecular orbitals and energies of the bonding framework Figure Molecular orbitals demonstrating the sigmapi separability of the bonding framework blue and the bonding frameworks red of ethylene CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Hückel treatment is concerned only with describing the molecular orbitals and energies of the bonding framework Since Hückel theory is a special consideration of molecular orbital theory the molecular orbitals can be described as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals at carbon with their corresponding coefficients This equation is substituted in the Schrödinger equation with the Hamiltonian and the energy corresponding to the molecular orbital to give If Equation is multiplied by and integrated then where are the Hamiltonian matrix elements see note below and are the overlap integrals If Equation is multiplied by and integrated then Both Equations and can better represented in matrix notation or more simply as a product of matrices All diagonal Hamiltonian integrals are called Coulomb integrals and those of type are called resonance integrals Both integrals are negative and the resonance integrals determines the strength of the bonding interactions The equations described by Equation are called the secular equations and will also have the trivial solution of Within linear algebra the secular equations in Equation will also have a nontrivial solution if and only if the secular determinant is zero or in shorthand notation Everything in Equation is a known number except Since the secular determinant for ethylene is a matrix finding requires solving a quadratic equation after expanding the determinant There will be two values of which satisfy this equation and they are the molecular orbital energies For ethylene one will be the bonding energy and the other the antibonding energy for the orbitals formed by the combination of the two carbon orbitals Equation However if more than two atomic orbitals were used eg in a bigger molecule then more energies would be estimated by solving the secular determinant Solving the secular determinant is simplified within Hückel method via the following four assumptions All overlap integrals are set equal to zero This is quite reasonable since the orbitals are directed perpendicular to the direction of their bonds Figure This assumption is often call neglect of differential overlap NDO All resonance integrals between nonneighboring atoms are set equal to zero All resonance integrals between neighboring atoms are equal and set to All coulomb integrals are set equal to These assumptions are mathematically expressed as Assumptions means that the overlap integral between the two atomic orbitals is Matrix Representation of the Hamiltonian The Coulomb integrals and resonance integrals are often described within the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian specifically within the basis or within the Hückel assumptions The Hückel assumptions reduces Equation in two homogeneous equations if Equation is divided by and then a new variable is defined then Equation simplifies to The trivial solution gives both wavefunction coefficients equal to zero and the other nontrivial solution is determined by solving the secular determinant which when expanded is so Knowing that from Equation the energy levels can be found to be or Since is negative the two energies are ordered Figure For For Figure energies of ethylene with occupation CC BYNC Ümit Kaya To extract the coefficients attributed to these energies the corresponding values can be substituted back into the Secular Equations Equation For the lower energy state This gives and the molecular orbitals attributed to this energy is then based off of Equation where is the normalization constant for this molecular orbital this is the bonding molecular orbital For the higher energy molecular orbital and then This gives and the molecular orbitals attributed to this energy is then based off of Equation where is the normalization constant for this molecular orbital this is the antibonding molecular orbital The normalization constants for both molecular orbitals can obtained via the standard normalization approach ie to obtain These molecular orbitals form the bonding framework and since each carbon contributes one electron to this framework only the lowest molecular orbital is occupied Figure in the ground state The corresponding electron configuration is then Figure Schemetic representation of the molecular orbitals framework for ethylene Notice that the antibonding molecular orbital has one more node than the bonding molecular orbital as expected since it is higher in energy CC BYNC Ümit Kaya HOMO and LUMO are acronyms for highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital respectively and are often referred to as frontier orbitals The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is termed the HOMOLUMO gap Ψ ϕ ϕ psi dfrac sqrt phi _phi _ The D calculated molecular orbitals are shown in Figure Figure Calculated molecular orbitals for ethylene left the bonding orbital psi_ rangle and right the antibonding orbital Limitations of Hückel Theory Hückel theory was developed in the s when computers were unavailable and a simple mathematical approaches were very important for understanding experiment Although the assumptions in Hückel theory are drastic they enabled the early calculations of molecular orbitals to be performed with mechanical calculators or by hand Hückel Theory can be extended to address other types of atoms in conjugated molecules eg nitrogen and oxygen Moreover it can be extended to also treat orbitals and this Extended Hückel Theory is still used today Despite the utility of Hückel Theory it is highly qualitative and we should remember the limitations of Hückel Theory Hückel Theory is very approximate Hückel Theory cannot calculate energies accurately electronelectron repulsion is not calculated Hückel Theory typically overestimates predicted dipole moments Hückel Theory is best used to provide simplified models for understanding chemistry and for a detailed understanding modern ab initio molecular methods discussed

B is called a covalent bond and it is written as AB or AB Since two pairs of electrons are involved in a double bond and three pairs in a triple bond they are designated by AB A B or AB or AB respectively The covalent bond is a simple but very useful concept proposed by G N Lewis at the beginning of this century and its representation is called the Lewis structure Unshared pair of valence electrons are called lone pairs and they are expressed by a pair of dots like A Exercise Describe the Lewis structures of the nitrogen molecule N and the oxygen molecule O Answer NN OO Eight electrons are required to fill an s and three p orbitals and when the total number of electrons used for the bonds and lone pairs is eight a stable molecular structure results This is called the octet rule and is useful when qualitatively discussing the molecular structures of main group compounds Of course this rule is not applied to a hydrogen molecule H but is applicable to covalent molecules such as simple twoatomic molecules O or CO and even to complicated organic compounds For the elements after the rd period the number of covalent bonds is sometimes five eg PCl or six eg SF and the central atom of these molecules shows hypervalency In this case because s and p electrons run short to form more than four electron covalent bonds it was once believed that d electrons were partly involved The present view is however that these hypervalent bonds use only s and p orbitals but that the bond orders are lower than those of single bonds The electrostatic bond between cations positive ion and anions negative ion such as in sodium chloride NaCl is called an ionic bond Since the total electrical charge in a compound should be zero the electrical charges of cations and anions are equal There is a partial contribution from covalent bonds even in an ionic compound and the ions are not necessarily bonded only by the electrostatic interaction Paulings electroneutrality principle states that the net electrical charge of each component of a compound is essentially neutral As will be mentioned later the structures of many solid compounds are described as an alternate array of cations and anions and are classified into several representative crystal types Metal atoms are bound together by means of the conduction electrons originating from the valence electrons of metal atoms The bond due to the conduction electrons in a bulk metal is called the metallic bond Generally chemical bonds can be assigned to either of the three kinds mentioned above but new compounds have been synthesized one after another which cannot always be classified by the simple center electron pair covalent bond They include electrondeficient bonds in boron hydrides coordinate bonds in transition metal complexes the metalmetal bonds in metal cluster compounds etc and new concepts have been introduced into bond theory to account for these new kinds of chemical bonds As has already been described a weak bonding interaction called the van der Waals interaction has been recognized in neutral atomic or molecular compounds The potential of this interaction is inversely proportional to the th power of the distance between atoms The adjacent but nonbonded distance between atoms is estimated by the sum of the van der Waals radius assigned to each atom The weak interaction XHY that a hydrogen atom forms with the atoms X Y nitrogen oxygen fluoride etc with larger electronegativity than that of hydrogen is called the hydrogen bond Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in ice the structure of the double helix of DNA deoxyribonucleic acid etc Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub of the LibreTexts project which is a

httpsstatuslibretextsorg Closepacking and Interstitial Sites Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Many common inorganic crystals have structures that are related to cubic close packed facecentered cubic or hexagonal close packed sphere packings These packing lattices contain two types of sites or holes that the interstitial atoms fill and the coordination geometry of these sites is either tetrahedral or octahedral An interstitial atom filling a tetrahedral hole is coordinated to four packing atoms and an atom filling an octahedral hole is coordinated to six packing atoms In both the hexagonal close packed and cubic close packed lattices there is one octahedral hole and two tetrahedral holes per packing atom Question Would anions or cations be better as packing atoms We might expect that anions which are often larger than cations would be better suited to the positions of packing atoms While this is often true there are many examples of structures in which cations are the packing atoms and others in which the distinction is arbitrary The NaCl structure is a good example of the latter One octahedral and one tetrahedral site in a facecentered cubic unit cell Each cell contains four packing atoms gray four octahedral sites pink and eight tetrahedral sites blue In the NaCl structure shown on the right the green spheres are the Cl ions and the gray spheres are the Na ions The octahedral holes in a facecentered cubic lattice can be found at fractional coordinates and There are four of these holes per cell and they are filled by the chloride ions The packing atoms Na have coordinates and Note that each of the Na positions is related to a Cl position by a translation of Another way of stating this is that the structure consists of two interpenetrating fcc lattices which are related to each other by a translation of half the unit cell along any of the three Cartesian axes We could have equivalently placed the Cl ions at the fcc lattice points and the Na ions in the octahedral holes by simply translating the origin of the unit cell by Thus the distinction between packing and interstitial atoms in this case is arbitrary Crystal structure of NaCl Both the Na and Cl ions are octahedrally coordinated NaCl is interesting in that it is a threedimensional checkerboard and thus there are no NaCl molecules that exist in the structure When this structure was originally solved in by using Xray diffraction by W L Bragg his interpretation met resistance by chemists who thought that precise integer stoichiometries were a consequence of the valency of atoms in molecules The German chemist P Pfeiffer noted in that the ordinary notion of valency didnt seem to apply and fourteen years later the influential chemist H E Armstrong still found Braggs proposed structure of sodium chloride more than repugnant to the common sense not chemical cricket Nevertheless Bragg and his father W H Bragg persevered and used the thennew technique of Xray diffraction to determine the structures of a number of other compounds including diamond zincblende calcium fluoride and other alkali halides These experiments gave chemists their first real look at the atomic structure of solids and laid the groundwork for Xray diffraction experiments that later elucidated the structures of DNA proteins and many other compounds For their work on Xray diffraction the Braggs received the Nobel prize in Physics in The lattice dimensions and positions of atoms in crystals such as NaCl are inferred from diffraction patterns Since each type of atom in the NaCl structure forms a facecentered cubic lattice there are four Na and four Cl atoms per NaCl unit cell It is because of this ratio that NaCl has a stoichiometry The shaded green and gray bipyramidal structures in the NaCl lattice show that the Na ions are coordinated to six Cl ions and vice versa The NaCl structure can be alternatively drawn as a stacking of closepacked layer planes AcBaCbAcBa along the body diagonal of the unit cell Here the uppercase letters represent the packing atoms and the lower case letters are the interstitial atoms This layered packing is illustrated below NaCl structure A c B a C b A c B a C b A Note that both the packing atoms and interstitials are stacked in the sequence ABCABC in keeping with the fact that each forms a cubic closepacked lattice The NaCl structure is fairly common among ionic compounds Alkali Halides except CsCl CsBr and CsI Transition Metal Monoxides TiO VO NiO Alkali Earth Oxides and Sulfides MgO CaO BaS except BeO and MgTe Carbides and Nitrides TiC TiN ZrC NbC these are very stable refractory interstitial alloys metallic A number of other inorganic crystal structures are formed at least conceptually by filling octahedral andor tetrahedral holes in closepacked lattices The figure at the right shows some of the most common structures fluorite halite zincblende as well as a rather rare one LiBi that derive from the fcc lattice From the hcp lattice we can make the NiAs and wurzite structures which are the hexagonal relatives of NaCl and zincblende respectively An alternative and very convenient way to represent inorganic crystal structures especially complex structures such as LiBi is to draw the unit cell in slices along one of the unit cell axes This kind of representation is shown at the left for the fcc lattice and the NaCl structure Since all atoms in these structures have zcoordinates of either or only those sections need to be drawn in order to describe the contents of the unit cell It is a useful exercise to draw some of the fcc compound structures above in sections Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub of the LibreTexts project which is a

SolubilityReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objectives Recognize common ions from various salts acids and bases Calculate concentrations involving common ions Calculate ion concentrations involving chemical equilibrium The commonion effect is used to describe the effect on an equilibrium involving a substance that adds an ion that is a part of the equilibrium Introduction The solubility products Ksps are equilibrium constants in hetergeneous equilibria ie between two different phases If several salts are present in a system they all ionize in the solution If the salts contain a common cation or anion these salts contribute to the concentration of the common ion Contributions from all salts must be included in the calculation of concentration of the common ion For example a solution containing sodium chloride and potassium chloride will have the following relationship Consideration of charge balance or mass balance or both leads to the same conclusion Common Ions When and are dissolved in the same solution the ions are common to both salts In a system containing and the ions are common ions For example when is dissolved into a solution already containing actually and ions the ions come from the ionization of both and Thus differs from The following examples show how the concentration of the common ion is calculated Example What are and in a solution containing M each of and Solution Due to the conservation of ions we have but beginalignat ceCl textrm due to NaCl mathrm due to CaCl_ mathrm due to HCl mathrm M endalignat Exercise John poured mL of M mL of M and mL of M solutions together and then he made the total volume to be mL What is in the final solution Le Châteliers Principle states that if an equilibrium becomes unbalanced the reaction will shift to restore the balance If a common ion is added to a weak acid or weak base equilibrium then the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants in this case the weak acid or base Example Consider the leadII ion concentration in this saturated solution of PbCl The balanced reaction is Defining as the concentration of dissolved leadII chloride then These values can be substituted into the solubility product expression which can be solved for The concentration of leadII ions in the solution is x M Consider what happens if sodium chloride is added to this saturated solution Sodium chloride shares an ion with leadII chloride The chloride ion is common to both of them this is the origin of the term common ion effect Look at the original equilibrium expression again What happens to that equilibrium if extra chloride ions are added According to Le Châtelier the position of equilibrium will shift to counter the change in this case by removing the chloride ions by making extra solid leadII chloride Of course the concentration of leadII ions in the solution is so small that only a tiny proportion of the extra chloride ions can be converted into solid leadII chloride The leadII chloride becomes even less soluble and the concentration of leadII ions in the solution decreases This type of response occurs with any sparingly soluble substance it is less soluble in a solution which contains any ion which it has in common This is the common ion effect A Simple Example If an attempt is made to dissolve some leadII chloride in some M sodium chloride solution instead of in water what is the equilibrium concentration of the leadII ions this time As before define s to be the concentration of the leadII ions The calculations are different from before This time the concentration of the chloride ions is governed by the concentration of the sodium chloride solution The number of ions coming from the leadII chloride is going to be tiny compared with the M coming from the sodium chloride solution In calculations like this it can be assumed that the concentration of the common ion is entirely due to the other solution This simplifies the calculation So we assume The rest of the mathematics looks like this beginequation beginsplit K_sp PbCl s times times s times endsplit endequation therefore beginequation beginsplit s dfrac times times textM endsplit label endequation Finally compare that value with the simple saturated solution Original solution Solution in M NaCl solution The concentration of the leadII ions has decreased by a factor of about If more concentrated solutions of sodium chloride are used the solubility decreases further Adding a common ion to a system at equilibrium affects the equilibrium composition but not the ionization constant Common Ion Effect with Weak Acids and Bases Adding a common ion prevents the weak acid or weak base from ionizing as much as it would without the added common ion The common ion effect suppresses the ionization of a weak acid by adding more of an ion that is a product of this equilibrium Example The common ion effect of HO on the ionization of acetic acid The common ion effect suppresses the ionization of a weak base by adding more of an ion that is a product of this equilibrium Example Consider the common ion effect of OH on the ionization of ammonia Adding the common ion of hydroxide shifts the reaction towards the left to decrease the stress in accordance with Le Châteliers Principle forming more reactants This decreases the reaction quotient because the reaction is being pushed towards the left to reach equilibrium The equilibrium constant Kb does not change The reaction is put out of balance or equilibrium At first when more hydroxide is added the quotient is greater than the equilibrium constant The reaction then shifts right causing the denominator to increase decreasing the reaction quotient and pulling towards equilibrium and causing Q to decrease towards K Common Ion Effect on Solubility Adding a common ion decreases solubility as the reaction shifts toward the left to relieve the stress of the excess product Adding a common ion to a dissociation reaction causes the equilibrium to shift left toward the reactants causing precipitation Example Consider the reaction What happens to the solubility of PbCls when M NaCl is added Solution Identify the common ion Cl Notice Qsp Ksp The addition of NaCl has caused the reaction to shift out of equilibrium because there are more dissociated ions Typically solving for the molarities requires the assumption that the solubility of PbCl is equivalent to the concentration of Pb produced because they are in a ratio Because Ksp for the reaction is the overall reaction would be ss Solving the equation for s gives s M The coefficient on Cl is so it is assumed that twice as much Cl is produced as Pb hence the s The solubility equilibrium constant can be used to solve for the molarities of the ions at equilibrium The molarity of Cl added would be M because Na and Cl are in a ration in the ionic salt NaCl Therefore the overall molarity of Cl would be s with s referring to the contribution of the chloride ion from the dissociation of lead chloride Notice that the molarity of Pb is lower when NaCl is added The equilibrium constant remains the same because of the increased concentration of the chloride ion To simplify the reaction it can be assumed that Cl is approximately M since the formation of the chloride ion from the dissociation of lead chloride is so small The reaction quotient for PbCl is greater than the equilibrium constant because of the added Cl This therefore shift the reaction left towards equilibrium causing precipitation and lowering the current solubility of the reaction Overall the solubility of the reaction decreases with the added sodium chloride References Harwood William S F G Herring Jeffry D Madura and Ralph H Petrucci General

In metals the valence electrons are in molecular orbitals that extend over the entire crystal lattice As we will learn in Chapter metals are almost always crystalline and the individual crystal grains are typically micron size This means that the spatial extent of the orbitals is very large compared to the size of the atoms or the unit cell The diagram at the left shows a generic plot of electron energy vs density of states for a metal such as Na Cu or Ag In these cases there are N orbitals for N electrons and each orbital can accommodate two electrons Therefore the Fermi level which corresponds to the energy of the highest occupied MO at zero temperature is somewhere in the middle of the band of orbitals The energy level spacing between orbitals is very small compared to the thermal energy kT so we can think of the orbitals as forming a continuous band Classically if the electrons in this band were free to be thermally excited we would expect them to have a specific heat of R per mole of electrons However experimentally we observe that Cp is only about R per mole This suggests that only about of the electrons in the metal can be thermally excited at room temperature However essentially all of the valence electrons are free to move in the crystal and contribute to electrical conduction To understand this apparent paradox we need to recall that the electrons exist in quantized energy levels Because of quantization electrons in metals have a FermiDirac distribution of energies In this distribution most of the electrons are spinpaired although the individual electrons in these pairs can be quite far apart since the orbitals extend over the entire crystal A relatively small number of electrons at the top of the Fermi sea are unpaired by thermal excitation This is the origin of the Pauli paramagnetism of metals How fast are electrons traveling in a typical metal Because of the bell shape of the E vs DOS curve most of the electrons have E EF At the midpoint energy EF of the band the MOs have one node for every two atoms We can calculate the de Broglie wavelength as twice the distance between nodes and thus λ a at the midpoint of the band where a is the interatomic spacing Since a typical value of a is about Å we obtain the de Broglie wavelength λ Å Using the de Broglie relation p hλ we can write where me is the mass of the electron and vF is the velocity of electrons with energy EF Solving for we obtain Experimental values of vF are x and x ms for Na and Ag respectively so our approximations are pretty good How fast are electrons moving in metals Really really fast meters per second This is about the speed of light and about times the speed of sound in air x ms However the drift velocity of electrons in metals the speed at which electrons move in applied electric field is quite slow on the order of ms or cms You can easily outrun an electron drifting in a metal even if you have been drinking all night and have been personally reduced to a very slow crawl In order to understand the great disparity between the Fermi velocity and the drift velocity of electrons in metals we need to consider a picture for the scattering of electrons and their acceleration in an electric field as shown at the left If we apply a voltage across a metal eg a metal wire the electrons are subjected to an electric field E which is the voltage divided by the length of the wire This electric field exerts a force on the electron causing it to accelerate However the electron is frequently scattered mostly by phonons lattice vibrations Each time the electron is scattered its acceleration starts all over again The time between scattering events is τ and the distance the electrons travel between scattering events is the mean free path λ Note that this is NOT the same λ as the de Broglie wavelength they just unfortunately have the same symbol We can write the force on the electron as In this equation a is the acceleration in the electric field me is the mass and vdrift is the drift velocity of the electron Experimentally the mean free path is typically obtained by measuring the scattering time For an electron in Cu metal at K the scattering time τ is about x s From this we can calculate the mean free path as The mean free path nm Å is quite long compared to the interatomic spacing Å To put it in perspective if the interatomic spacing were scaled to the length of a football m the mean free path would be over half the length of the football field m Thus an electron travels a fairly long way between scattering events and scarcely notices the atomic structure of the metal in which it is traveling To summarize electrons are traveling in metals at the Fermi velocity vF which is very very fast ms but the flux of electrons is the same in all directions That is they are going nowhere fast In an electric field a very small but directional drift velocity is superimposed on this fast random motion of valence electrons For ordinary metals the mean free path of a valence electron λ is quite long relative to the interatomic spacing represented in this analogy as the length of a football We can calculate the drift velocity of electrons as the acceleration in the electric field times the scattering time From F ma we obtain the acceleration a as And thus If we divide both sides of this equation by the magnitude of the electric field E we obtain the mobility μ μ has units of velocityfield cms Vcm cmVs An important consequence of the calculation of vdrift is Ohms Law V iR From the equations above we can see that the drift velocity increases linearly with the applied electric field The drift velocity cms is proportional to the current i couls and the electric field E Vcm is proportional to the voltage V Here n is the density of valence electrons cm and e is the charge of the electron coul Combining these equations with our equation for vdrift we obtain Thus V iR where R is the combination of the two terms in parentheses The first of these is the resistivity and the second is a geometrical factor The conductivity σ of a metal which is the inverse of is proportional to μ which in turn is proportional to τ and λ We can use this equation to work out the conductivity of a specific metal Cu for which n x cm and τ x s Putting in the numbers for me and e we obtain σ x Ω cm for Cu in good agreement with the measured value x Ωcm Constructing Molecular Orbitals from Atomic Orbitals Last updated Save as PDF Page ID NodesNormalizationOverlap integralEnergies of bonding and antibonding MOsHeteronuclear case eg HCl Polar bondsSummary of molecular orbital theory so far Molecular orbital theory involves solving approximately the Schrödinger equation for the electrons in a molecule To review from Chapter this is a differential equation in which the first and second terms on the right represent the kinetic and potential energies While the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically for the hydrogen atom the potential energy function V becomes more complicated and the equation can then only be solved numerically when there are many mutually repulsive electrons in a molecule So as a first approximation we will assume that the s p d f etc orbitals of the atoms that make up the molecule are good solutions to the Schrödinger equation We can then allow these wavefunctions to interfere constructively and destructively as we bring the atoms together to make bonds In this way we use the atomic orbitals AO as our basis for constructing MOs LCAOMO linear combination of atomic orbitals In physics this is called this the tight binding approximation We have actually seen linear combinations of atomic orbitals before when we constructed hybrid orbitals in Chapter The basic rules we developed for hybridization also apply here orbitals are added with scalar coefficients c in such a way that the resulting orbitals are orthogonal and normalized The difference is that in the MO case the atomic orbitals come from different atoms The linear combination of atomic orbitals always gives back the same number of molecular orbitals So if we start with two atomic orbitals eg an s and a pz orbital as shown in Fig we end up with two molecular orbitals When atomic orbitals add in phase we get constructive interference and a lower energy orbital When they add out of phase we get a node and the resulting orbital has higher energy The lower energy MOs are bonding and higher energy MOs are antibonding Figure Sigma bonding and antibonding combinations of an s and p orbital Molecular orbitals are also called wavefunctions ψ because they are solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the molecule The atomic orbitals also called basis functions are labeled as φs for example φs and φpz or simply as φand φ In principle we need to solve the Schrödinger equation for all the orbitals in a molecule and then fill them up with pairs of electrons as we do for the orbitals in atoms In practice we are really interested only in the MOs that derive from the valence orbitals of the constituent atoms because these are the orbitals that are involved in bonding We are especially interested in the frontier orbitals ie the highest occupied molecular orbital the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital the LUMO Filled orbitals that are much lower in energy ie core orbitals do not contribute to bonding and empty orbitals at higher energy likewise do not contribute Those orbitals are however important in photochemistry and spectroscopy which involve electronic transitions from occupied to empty orbitals The fluorescent dyes that stain the cells shown in Fig absorb light by promoting electrons in the HOMO to empty MOs and give off light when the electrons drop back down to their original energy levels Figure Different components of endothelial cells are stained by blue green and red fluorescent dyes For each dye the color of emitted light corresponds to the energy given off when an electron drops from the LUMO to the HOMO of the molecule As an example of the LCAOMO approach we can construct two MOs ψ and ψ of the HCl molecule from two AOs φand φ Fig To make these two linear combinations we write and The coefficients c and c will be equal or nearly so when the two AOs from which they are constructed are the same eg when two hydrogen s orbitals combine to make bonding and antibonding MOs in H They will be unequal when there is an energy difference between the AOs for example when a hydrogen s orbital and a chlorine p orbital combine to make a polar HCl bond Nodes The wavefunctions φ and ψ are amplitudes that are related to the probability of finding the electron at some point in space They have lobes with or signs which we indicate by shading or color Wherever the wavefunction changes sign we have a node As you can see in Fig nodes in MOs result from destructive interference of and wavefunctions Generally the more nodes the higher the energy of the orbital In the example above we have drawn a simplified picture of the Cl pz orbital and the resulting MOs leaving out the radial node Recall that p orbitals have no radial nodes p orbitals have one as illustrated in Fig p orbitals have two radial nodes and so on The MOs we make by combining the AOs have these nodes too Figure Nodal structure of p and p orbitals Normalization We square the wave functions to get probabilities which are always positve or zero So if an electron is in orbital φ the probability of finding it at point xyz is the square of φxyz The total probability does not change when we combine AOs to make MOs so for the simple case of combining φ and φ to make ψand ψ Overlap integral The spatial overlap between two atomic orbitals φ and φ is described by the overlap integral S where the integration is over all space Figure The wavefunctions of atomic orbitals decrease exponentially with distance Orbital overlap is nonzero when two atoms are close together as illustrated for s orbitals in the upper figure The lower figure shows orbitals that are too far away to interact In this case both S and β are close to zero Energies of bonding and antibonding MOs The energies of bonding and antibonding orbitals depend strongly on the distance between atoms This is illustrated in Fig for the hydrogen molecule H At very long distances there is essentially no difference in energy between the inphase and outofphase combinations of H s orbitals As they get closer the inphase bonding combination drops in energy because electrons are shared between the two positively charged nuclei The energy reaches a minimum at the equilibrium bond distance Å and then rises again as the nuclei get closer together The antibonding combination has a node between the nuclei so its energy rises continuously as the atoms are brought together Figure Energy as a function of distance for the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the H molecule At the equilibrium bond distance the energies of the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals ψ ψ are lower and higher respectively than the energies of the atomic basis orbitals φ and φ This is shown in Fig for the MOs of the H molecule Figure Molecular orbital energy diagram for the H molecule The energy of an electron in one of the atomic orbitals is α the Coulomb integral where H is the Hamiltonian operator Essentially α represents the ionization energy of an electron in atomic orbital φ or φ The energy difference between an electron in the AOs and the MOs is determined by the exchange integral β β is an important quantity because it tells us about the bonding energy of the molecule and also the difference in energy between bonding and antibonding orbitals Calculating β is not straightforward for multielectron molecules because we cannot solve the Schrödinger equation analytically for the wavefunctions We can however make some approximations to calculate the energies and wavefunctions numerically In the Hückel approximation which can be used to obtain approximate solutions for π molecular orbitals in organic molecules we simplify the math by taking S and setting H for any porbitals that are not adjacent to each other The extended Hückel method developed by Roald Hoffmann and other semiempirical methods can be used to rapidly obtain relative orbital energies approximate wavefunctions and degeneracies of molecular orbitals for a wide variety of molecules and extended solids More sophisticated ab initio methods are now readily available in software packages and can be used to compute accurate orbital energies for molecules and solids We can get the coefficients c and c for the hydrogen molecule by applying the normalization criterion and In the case where S we can eliminate the S terms and both coefficients become Note that the bonding orbital in the MO diagram of H is stabilized by an energy βS and the antibonding orbital is destabilized by βS That is the antibonding orbital goes up in energy more than the bonding orbital goes down This means that H ψψ is energetically more stable than two H atoms but He with four electrons ψψ is unstable relative to two He atoms Bond order In any MO diagram the bond order can be calculated as ½ of bonding electrons of antibonding electrons For H the bond order is and for Hethe bond order is zero Heteronuclear case eg HCl Polar bonds Here we introduce an electronegativity difference between the two atoms making the chemical bond The energy of an electron in the H s orbital is higher it is easier to ionize than the electron in the chlorine pz orbital This results in a larger energy difference between the resulting molecular orbitals ψ and ψ as shown in Fig The bigger the electronegativity difference between atomic orbitals the larger Δα is the more φ character the bonding orbital has ie the more it resembles the Cl pz orbital in this case This is consistent with the idea that HCl has a polar single bond the two electrons reside in a bonding molecular orbital that is primarily localized on the Cl atom Figure Molecular orbital energy diagram for the HCl molecule The antibonding orbital empty has more Hcharacter The bond order is again because there are two electrons in the bonding orbital and none in the antibonding orbital Extreme case Ionic bonding NaF very large Δα In this case there is not much mixing between the AOs because their energies are far apart Fig The two bonding electrons are localized on the F atom so we can write the molecule as NaF Note that if we were to excite an electron from ψ to ψ using light the resulting electronic configuration would be ψψ and we would have NaF This is called a charge transfer transition Figure Molecular orbital energy diagram illustrating ionic bonding in the NaF molecule Summary of molecular orbital theory so far Add and subtract AO wavefunctions to make MOs Two AOs two MOs More generally the total number of MOs equals the number of AO basis orbitals We showed the simplest case only two basis orbitals More accurate calculations use a much larger basis set more AOs and solve for the matrix of cs that gives the lowest total energy using mathematically friendly approximations of the potential energy function that is part of the Hamiltonian operator H More nodes higher energy MO Bond order ½ of bonding electrons of antibonding electrons Bond polarity emerges in the MO picture as orbital character AOs that are far apart in energy do not interact much when they combine to make MOs Coordination Complexes An Introduction Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Topic hierarchy Counting Electrons in Transition Metal Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The dorbitals are the frontier orbitals the HOMO and LUMO of transition metal complexes Many of the important properties of complexes their shape color magnetism and reactivity depend on the electron occupancy of the metals dorbitals To understand and rationalize these properties it is important to know how to count the delectrons Because transition metals are generally less electronegative than the atoms on the ligands C N O Cl P that form the metalligand bond our convention is to assign both electrons in the bond to the ligand For example in the ferricyanide complex FeCN if the cyanide ligand keeps both of its electrons it is formulated as CN By difference iron must be Fe because the charges must add up to the overall charge on the complex The next step is to determine how many delectrons the Fe ion has The rule is to count all of irons valence electrons as delectrons Iron is in group so group charge d or d Structure of the octahedral ferricyanide anion Because the overall charge of the complex is Fe is in the oxidation state and its electron count is d The same procedure can be applied to any transition metal complex For example consider the complex CuNH Because ammonia is a neutral ligand Cu is in the oxidation state Copper II in group of the periodic table has electrons in its valence shell minus two leaving it with delectrons d In the neutral complex RhOHHO Rh is in the oxidation state and is in group so the electron count is d ZincII in group would have delectrons in ZnNH a full shell and manganese VII has zero delectrons in MnO Nickel carbonyl NiCO contains the neutral CO ligand and Ni in the zero oxidation state Since Ni is in group we count the electrons on Ni as d A frequent source of confusion about electron counting is the fate of the selectrons on the metal For example our electron counting rules predict that Ti is d in the octahedral complex TiHO But the electronic configuration of a free Ti atom according to the Aufbau principle is sd Why is the Ti ion d and not s Similarly why do we assign Mn as d rather than sd The short answer is that the metal s orbitals are higher in energy in a metal complex than they are in the free atom because they have antibonding character We will justify this statement with a MO diagram in Section Covalent Bond Classification CBC Method Although the electron counting rule we have developed above is useful and works reliably for all kinds of complexes the assignment of all the shared electrons in the complex to the ligands does not always represent the true bonding picture This picture would be most accurate in the case of ligands that are much more electronegative than the metal But in fact there all all kinds of ligands including those such as H alkyl cyclopentadienide and others where the metal and ligand have comparable electronegativity In those cases especially with late transition metals that are relatively electropositive we should regard the metalligand bond as covalent The CBC method also referred to as LXZ notation was introduced in by M L H Green in order to better describe the different kinds of metalligand bonds The molecular orbital pictures below summarize the difference between L X and Z ligands Of these L and X are the most common types Ltype ligands are Lewis bases that donate two electrons to the metal center regardless of the electron counting method being used These electrons can come from lone pairs pi or sigma donors The bonds formed between these ligands and the metal are dative covalent bonds which are also known as coordinate bonds Examples of this type of ligand include CO PR NH HO carbenes CRR and alkenes Xtype ligands are those that donate one electron to the metal and accept one electron from the metal when using the neutral ligand method of electron counting or donate two electrons to the metal when using the donor pair method of electron counting Regardless of whether it is considered neutral or anionic these ligands yield normal covalent bonds A few examples of this type of ligand are H CH halogens and NO bent Ztype ligands are those that accept two electrons from the metal center as opposed to the donation occurring with the other two types of ligands However these ligands also form dative covalent bonds like the Ltype This type of ligand is not usually used because in certain situations it can be written in terms of L and X For example if a Z ligand is accompanied by an L type it can be written as X Examples of these ligands are Lewis acids such as BR Cp Ferrocene Some multidentate ligands can act as a combination of ligand types A famous example is the cyclopentadienyl or Cp ligand CH We would classify this neutral ligand as LX with the two L functionalities corresponding to the two olefinic fragments while the X functionality corresponds to the CH radical carbon in the ring The addition of one electron makes the Cp anion which has six pi electrons and is thus planar and aromatic In the ferrocene complex CpFe using the standard donor pair counting method we can regard the two Cp ligands as each possessing six pi electrons and by difference Fe is in the oxidation state The Fe ion is d Thus the iron atom in the complex regardless of the counting method has electrons in its coordination environment which is a particularly stable electron count for transition metal complexes C Penetration and Shielding Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Slaters RulesCalculating SCalculating ZeffSummaryReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective To quantify the shielding effect experienced by atomic electrons We have previously described the concepts of electron shielding orbital penetration and effective nuclear charge but we did so in a qualitative manner In this section we explore one model for quantitatively estimating the impact of electron shielding and then use that to calculate the effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron in an atom The model we will use is known as Slaters Rules JC Slater Phys Rev Slaters Rules The general principle behind Slaters Rule is that the actual charge felt by an electron is equal to what youd expect the charge to be from a certain number of protons but minus a certain amount of charge from other electrons Slaters rules allow you to estimate the effective nuclear charge from the real number of protons in the nucleus and the effective shielding of electrons in each orbital shell eg to compare the effective nuclear charge and shielding d and s in transition metals Slaters rules are fairly simple and produce fairly accurate predictions of things like the electron configurations and ionization energies Slaters Rules Step Write the electron configuration of the atom in the following form s s p s p d s p d f s p Step Identify the electron of interest and ignore all electrons in higher groups to the right in the list from Step These do not shield electrons in lower groups Step Slaters Rules is now broken into two cases the shielding experienced by an s or p electron electrons within same group shield except the s which shield electrons within the n group shield electrons within the n or lower groups shield the shielding experienced by nd or nf valence electrons electrons within same group shield electrons within the lower groups shield These rules are summarized in Figure and Table Figure Graphical depiction of Slaters rules with shielding constants indicated CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Shielding happens when electrons in lower valence shells or the same valence shell provide a repulsive force to valence electrons thereby negating some of the attractive force from the positive nucleus Electrons really close to the atom n or lower pretty much just look like protons so they completely negate As electrons get closer to the electron of interest some more complex interactions happen that reduce this shielding Table Slaters Rules for calculating shieldings Group Other electrons in the same

shielding effects quite difficult which is outside the scope of this Module Calculating S Sum together the contributions as described in the appropriate rule above to obtain an estimate of the shielding constant which is found by totaling the screening by all electrons except the one in question where is the number of electrons in a specific shell and subshell and is the shielding of the

httpsstatuslibretextsorg Crystal Field Stabilization Energy Pairing and Hunds Rule Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Magnetism of transition metal complexesColors and spectra of transition metal complexes The splitting of the dorbitals into different energy levels in transition metal complexes has important consequences for their stability reactivity and magnetic properties Let us first consider the simple case of the octahedral complexes MHO where M Ti V Cr Because the complexes are octahedral they all have the same energy level diagram The Ti V and Cr complexes have one two and three delectrons respectively which fill the degenerate tg orbitals singly The spins align parallel according to Hunds rule which states that the lowest energy state has the highest spin angular momentum For each of these complexes we can calculate a crystal field stabilization energy CFSE which is the energy difference between the complex in its ground state and in a hypothetical state in which all five dorbitals are at the energy barycenter For Ti there is one electron stabilized by ΔO so Similarly CFSE ΔO and ΔO for V and Cr respectively For Cr complexes which have four delectrons the situation is more complicated Now we can have a high spin configuration tgeg or a low spin configuration tgeg in which two of the electrons are paired What are the energies of these two states High spin Low spin where P is the pairing energy Energy difference ΔO P The pairing energy P is the energy penalty for putting two electrons in the same orbital resulting from the electrostatic repulsion between electrons For d elements a typical value of P is about cm The important result here is that a complex will be low spin if ΔO P and high spin if ΔO P Because ΔO depends on both the metals and the ligands it determines the spin state of the complex Rules of thumb d complexes are high spin with weak field ligands and low spin with strong field ligands High valent d complexes eg Co complexes tend to be low spin large ΔO d and d complexes are always low spin large ΔO Note that high and low spin states occur only for d metal complexes with between and delectrons Complexes with to delectrons can accommodate all electrons in individual orbitals in the tg set Complexes with or delectrons will always have completely filled tg orbitals and electrons in the eg set dorbital energy diagrams for high and low spin Co complexes d Examples of high and low spin complexes CoHO contains a d metal ion with a weak field ligand This complex is known to be high spin from magnetic susceptibility measurements which detect three unpaired electrons per molecule Its orbital occupancy is tgeg We can calculate the CFSE as CoCN is also an octahedral d complex but it contains CN a strong field ligand Its orbital occupancy is tgeg and it therefore has one unpaired electron In this case the CFSE is Magnetism of transition metal complexes Compounds with unpaired electrons have an inherent magnetic moment that arises from the electron spin Such compounds interact strongly with applied magnetic fields Their magnetic susceptibility provides a simple way to measure the number of unpaired electrons in a transition metal complex If a transition metal complex has no unpaired electrons it is diamagnetic and is weakly repelled from the high field region of an inhomogeneous magnetic field Complexes with unpaired electrons are typically paramagnetic The spins in paramagnets align independently in an applied magnetic field but do not align spontaneously in the absence of a field Such compounds are attracted to a magnet ie they are drawn into the high field region of an inhomogeneous field The attractive force which can be measured with a Guoy balance or a SQUID magnetometer is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility χ of the complex The effective magnetic moment of an ion µeff in the absence of spinorbit coupling is given by the sum of its spin and orbital moments In octahedral d metal complexes the orbital angular momentum is largely quenched by symmetry so we can approximate We can calculate µs from the number of unpaired electrons n using Here µB is the Bohr magneton ehπme x JT This spinonly formula is a good approximation for firstrow transition metal complexes especially high spin complexes The table below compares calculated and experimentally measured values of µeff for octahedral complexes with unpaired electrons Ion Number of unpaired electrons Spinonly moment μB observed moment μB Ti V Cu V Ni V Cr Co Mn Cr Fe Mn Fe The small deviations from the spinonly formula for these octahedral complexes can result from the neglect of orbital angular momentum or of spinorbit coupling Tetrahedral d d d and d complexes tend to show larger deviations from the spinonly formula than octahedral complexes of the same ion because quenching of the orbital contribution is less effective in the tetrahedral case Summary of rules for high and low spin complexes d complexes Can be high or low spin depending on the ligand d d d d d and d complexes Always low spin because ΔO is large Maximum CFSE is for d and d cases eg Cr Ni with weak field ligands HO O F and for dd with strong field ligands Fe Ru Os Co Rh Ir IrvingWilliams series For M complexes the stability of the complex follows the order Mg Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn This trend represents increasing Lewis acidity as the ions become smaller going left to right in the periodic table as well as the trend in CFSE This same trend is reflected in the hydration enthalpy of gasphase M ions as illustrated in the graph at the right Note that Ca Mn and Zn which are d dhigh spin and d aquo ions respectively all have zero CFSE and fall on the same line Ions that deviate the most from the line such as Ni octahedral d have the highest CFSE Colors and spectra of transition metal complexes Transition metal complexes often have beautiful colors because as noted above their dd transition energies can be in the visible part of the spectrum With octahedral complexes these colors are faint the transitions are weak because they violate the Laporte selection rule According to this rule g g and u u transitions are forbidden in centrosymmetric complexes dorbitals have g gerade symmetry so dd transitions are Laporteforbidden However octahedral complexes can absorb light when they momentarily distort away from centrosymmetry as the molecule vibrates Spin flips are also forbidden in optical transitions by the spin selection rule so the excited state will always have the same spin multiplicity as the ground state The spectra of even the simplest transition metal complexes are rather complicated because of the many possible ways in which the delectrons can fill the tg and eg orbitals For example if we consider a d complex such as Vaq we know that the two electrons can reside in any of the five dorbitals and can either be spinup or spindown There are actually different such arrangements called microstates that do not violate the Pauli exclusion principle for a d complex Usually we are concerned only with the six of lowest energy in which both electrons occupy individual orbitals in the tg set and all their spins are aligned either up or down From left VHO lilac VHO green VOHO blue and VOHO yellow We can see how these microstates play a role in electronic spectra when we consider the dd transitions of the CrNH ion This ion is d so each of the three tg orbitals contains one unpaired electron We expect to see a transition when one of the three electrons in the tg orbitals is excited to an empty eg orbital Interestingly we find not one but two transitions in the visible The reason that we see two transitions is that the electron can come from any one of the tg orbitals and end up in either of the eg orbitals Let us assume for the sake of argument that the electron is initially in the dxy orbital It can be excited to either the dz or the dxy orbital higher energy lower energy The first transition is at higher energy shorter wavelength because in the excited state the configuration is dyzdxzdz All three of the excited state orbitals have some zcomponent so the delectron density is piled up along the zaxis The energy of this transition is thus increased by electronelectron repulsion In the second case the excited state configuration is dyzdxzdxy and the delectrons are more symmetrically distributed around the metal This effect is responsible for a splitting of the dd bands by about cm We can show that all other possible transitions are equivalent to one of these two by symmetry and hence we see only two visible absorption bands for Cr complexes Crystal Field Theory Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Crystal field theory is one of the simplest models for explaining the structures and properties of transition metal complexes The theory is based on the electrostatics of the metalligand interaction and so its results are only approximate in cases where the metalligand bond is substantially covalent But because the model makes effective use of molecular symmetry it can be surprisingly accurate in describing the magnetism colors structure and relative stability of metal complexes Consider a positvely charged metal ion such as Fe in the field of six negatively charged ligands such as CN There are two energetic terms we need to consider The first is the electrostatic attraction between the metal and ligands which is inversely proportional to the distance between them The second term is the repulsion that arises from the Pauli exclusion principle when a third electron is added to a filled orbital There is no place for this third electron to go except to a higher energy antibonding orbital This is the situation when a ligand lone pair approaches an occupied metal dorbital Now let us consider the effect of these attractive and repulsive terms as the metal ion and ligands are brought together We do this in two steps first forming a ligand sphere around the metal and then moving the six ligands to the vertices of an octahedron Initially all five dorbitals are degenerate ie they have the same energy by symmetry In the first step the antibonding interaction drives up the energy of the orbitals but they remain degenerate In the second step the dorbitals split into two symmetry classes a lower energy triplydegenerate set the tg orbitals and a higher energy doubly degenerate set the eg orbitals A Fe ion has five delectrons one in each of the five dorbitals In a spherical ligand field the energy of electrons in these orbitals rises because of the repulsive interaction with the ligand lone pairs The orbitals split into two energy levels when the ligands occupy the vertices of an octahedron but the average energy remains the same The energy difference between the eg and tg orbitals is given the symbol ΔO where the O stands for octahedral We will see that this splitting energy is sensitive to the degree of orbital overlap and thus depends on both the metal and the ligand Relative to the midpoint energy the barycenter the tg orbitals are stabilized by ΔO and the eg orbitals are destabilized by ΔO in an octahedral complex dorbitals and their orientation with relation to ligands in an octahedral complex What causes the dorbitals to split into two sets Recall that the dorbitals have a specific orientation with respect to the Cartesian axes The lobes of the dxy dxz and dyz orbitals the tg orbitals lie in the xy xz and yzplanes respectively These three dorbitals have nodes along the x y and zdirections The orbitals that contain the ligand lone pairs are oriented along these axes and therefore have zero overlap with the metal tg orbitals It is easy to see that these three dorbitals must be degenerate by symmetry On the other hand the lobes of the dz and dxy orbitals the eg orbitals point directly along the bonding axes and have strong overlap with the ligand orbitals While it is less intuitively obvious these orbitals are also degenerate by symmetry and have antibonding character It is informative to compare the results of crystal field theory and molecular orbital theory also called ligand field theory in this context for an octahedral transition metal complex The energy level diagrams below make this comparison for the d octahedral ion TiHO In the MO picture below the frontier orbitals are derived from the metal dorbitals The lower tg set which contains one electron is nonbonding by symmetry and the eg orbitals are antibonding The metal s orbital which has ag symmetry makes a low energy bonding combination that is ligandcentered and an antibonding combination that is metalcentered and above the eg levels This is the reason that our delectron counting rules do not need to consider the metal s orbital The important takehome message is that crystal field theory and MO theory give very similar results for the frontier orbitals of transition metal complexes Crystal field energy diagram for the d octahedral complex TiHO Ligandfield diagram for the octahedral complex TiHO Crystal Structure of Semiconductors

and metallic behavior The Crystalline Nature of Metals All metallic elements except Cs Ga and Hg are crystalline solids at room temperature Like ionic solids metals and alloys have a very strong tendency to crystallize whether they are made by thermal processing or by other techniques such as solution reduction or electroplating Metals crystallize readily and it is difficult to form a glassy metal even with very rapid cooling Molten metals have low viscosity and the identical essentially spherical atoms can pack into a crystal very easily Glassy metals can be made however by rapidly cooling alloys particularly if the constituent atoms have different sizes The different atoms cannot pack in a simple unit cell sometimes making crystallization slow enough to form a glass Bodycentered cubic hcp left and fcc right closepacking of spheres Crystal structures Most metals and alloys crystallize in one of three very common structures bodycentered cubic bcc hexagonal close packed hcp or cubic close packed ccp also called face centered cubic fcc In all three structures the coordination number of the metal atoms ie the number of equidistant nearest neighbors is rather high for bcc and for hcp and ccp We can contrast this with the low coordination numbers ie low valences like for O for N or for C found in nonmetals In the bcc structure the nearest neighbors are at the corners of a cube surrounding the metal atom in the center In the hcp and ccp structures the atoms pack like stacked cannonballs or billiard balls in layers with a sixcoordinate arrangement Each atom also has six more nearest neighbors from layers above and below The stacking sequence is ABCABC in the ccp lattice and ABAB in hcp In both cases it can be shown that the spheres fill of the volume of the lattice This is the highest volume fraction that can be filled with a lattice of equal spheres Atoms in metallic crystals have a tendency to pack in dense arrangments that fill space efficiently The simple square packing above upon which the simple cubic structure is based is inefficient and thus rare among metallic crystal structures Body or facecentered structures fill space more efficiently and more common Periodic trends in structure and metallic behavior Remember where we find the metallic elements in the periodic table everywhere except the upper right corner This means that as we go down a group in the pblock lets say group IVA the carbon group or group VA the nitrogen group the properties of the elements gradually change from nonmetals to metalloids to metals The carbon group nicely illustrates the transition Starting at the top the element carbon has two stable allotropes graphite and diamond In each one the valence of carbon atoms is exactly satisfied by making four electron pair bonds to neighboring atoms In graphite each carbon has three nearest neighbors and so there are two single bonds and one double bond In diamond there are four nearest neighbors situated at the vertices of a tetrahedron and so there is a single bond to each one The two elements right under carbon silicon and germanium in the periodic table also have the diamond structure recall that these elements cannot make double bonds to themselves easily so there is no graphite allotrope for Si or Ge While diamond is a good insulator both silicon and germanium are semiconductors ie metalloids Mechanically they are hard like diamond Like carbon each atom of Si and Ge satisfies its valence of four by making single bonds to four nearest neighbors The next element under germanium is tin Sn Tin has two allotropes one with the diamond structure and one with a slightly distorted bcc structure The latter has metallic properties metallic luster malleability and conductivity about times higher than Si Finally lead Pb the element under Sn has the ccp structure and also is metallic Note the trends in coordination number and conducting properties Element Structure Coord no Conductivity C graphite diamond semimetal insulator Si diamond semiconductor Ge diamond semiconductor Sn diamond distorted bcc semiconductor metal Pb ccp metal The elements C Si and Ge obey the octet rule and we can easily identify the electron pair bonds in their structures Sn and Pb on the other hand adopt structures with high coordination numbers They do not have enough valence electrons to make electron pair bonds to each neighbor this is a common feature of metals What happens in this case is that the valence electrons become smeared out or delocalized over all the atoms in the crystal It is best to think of the bonding in metals as a crystalline arrangement of positively charged cores with a sea of shared valence electrons gluing the structure together Because the electrons are not localized in any particular bond between atoms they can move in an electric field which is why metals conduct electricity well Another way to describe the bonding in metals is nondirectional That is an atoms nearest neighbors surround it in every direction rather than in a few particular directions like at the corners of a tetrahedron as we found for diamond Nonmetals insulators and semiconductors on the other hand have directional bonding Because the bonding is nondirectional and coordination numbers are high it is relatively easy to deform the coordination sphere ie break or stretch bonds than it is in the case of a nonmetal This is why elements like Pb are much more malleable than C Si or Ge Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living

melting pointGroup Alkali metalsGroup Alkali Earth MetalsReferences A metal from Greek μέταλλον métallon mine quarry metal is a material an element compound or alloy that is typically hard opaque shiny and has good electrical and thermal conductivity Metals are generally malleable that is they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible able to be fused or melted and ductile able to be drawn out into a thin wire About of the elements in the periodic table are metals some elements appear in both metallic and nonmetallic forms Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity While this flow of electrons occurs the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud This type of bond is called a metallic bond Cubic and hexagonal close packing Crystalline solids consist of repeating patterns of its components in three dimensions a crystal lattice and can be represented by drawing the structure of the smallest identical units that when stacked together form the crystal This basic repeating unit is called a unit cell Many metals adopt close packed structures ie cubic close packed face centred cubic and hexagonal close packed structures A simple model for both of these is to assume that the metal atoms are spherical and are packed together in the most efficient way close packing or closest packing For closest packing every atom has equidistant nearest neighbours and therefore a coordination number of If the close packed structures are considered as being built of layers of spheres then the difference between hexagonal close packing and cubic close packed is how each layer is positioned relative to others It can be envisaged that for a regular buildup of layers hexagonal close packing has alternate layers positioned directly abovebelow each other ABAB cubic close packed face centered cubic has every third layer directly abovebelow each other ABCABC Body centred cubic This is not a close packed structure Here each metal atom is at the centre of a cube with nearest neighbors however the atoms at the centres of the adjacent cubes are only approximately further away so the coordination number can therefore be considered to be when these are included Note that if the body centered cubic unit cell is compressed along one fold axis the structure becomes cubic close packed face centred cubic Cubic Hexagonal and Bodycentred Packing cubic close packing ccp packing efficiency CN hexagonal close packing hcp packing efficiency CN bodycentred cubic packing bcc packing efficiency CN Trends in melting point Melting points are chosen as a simple measure of the stability or strength of the metallic lattice Some simple trends can be noted The transition metals have generally higher melting points than the others In the alkali metals Group and alkaline earth metals Group the melting point decreases as atomic number increases but in transition metal groups with incomplete dorbital subshells the heavier elements have higher melting points For a given period the melting points reach a maximum at around Group and then fall with increasing atomic number Mercury caesium and gallium have melting points below C whereas all the other metals have sufficiently high melting points to be solids at room temperature The structures of

Alkali metals The alkali metals have their outermost electron in an sorbital and this electronic configuration results in their characteristic properties The alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting wellcharacterized homologous behaviour The alkali metals have very similar properties they are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen Because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally

Hybridization Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionSP hybridized moleculesReferencesProblemsContributors The sp hybridization is the mixing of one s and two p atomic orbitals which involves the promotion of one electron in the s orbital to one of the p atomic orbitals The combination of these atomic orbitals creates three new hybrid orbitals equal in energylevel The hybrid orbitals are higher in energy than the s orbital but lower in energy than the p orbitals but they are closer in energy to the p orbitals The new set of formed hybrid orbitals creates trigonal structures creating a molecular geometry of degrees Introduction The combinaiton of an s orbital and two p orbitals from the same valence shell gives a set of three equivalent sp hybridized orbitals that point in

SpeciesOther Common Shapes for Coordinate MoleculesStereoisomersReferencesOutside LinksProblems Trigonal Bipyramidal Species are those that have a central pblock atom and are attached to other atoms It is classified as a EX molecule where E stands for the central atom and X stands for the atoms that are attached It makes sense then to classify this molecule a coordinate system The VSEPR valence shell electron pair repulsion model is the what helps us identify how a molecule may or may not be trigonal bipyramidal Trigonal Bipyramidal Species The central atom of the triognal bipyramidal species is bonded to separate molecules This means that the central atom must have an extended valence shell in order to all for the bonds to occur The central atom is thus typically a pblock atom There are two different ways to classify the X atoms either as axial or equitorial It is important to understand the difference between the two so that we can reference them in future discussion The axial atoms are the ones above and below the central atom These are the points of the pyramids the molecule makes NOTE Bipyramidal means two pyramids If you look at a picture you should be able to see the pyramids relative to the top half and the bottom half of the central atom The equatorial atoms are the ones that lie in the horizontal plane of the central atom Think of the equator relative to the Earth Let us continue this discussion with the assumption that the EX is composed of just atoms and not lone pairs The bond angles between the equatorial atoms is degrees The bond angles between the axial and equitorial atoms is degrees The bond angles between the two axial atoms is degrees The angles formed by these atoms is the most stable conformation that can be maintained by the trigonal bipyramidal species Other Common Shapes for Coordinate Molecules As we have already discussed when the central atom has bonding pairs of electrons those electrons being shared between two atoms the shape of the molecule is trigonal bipyramidal This section gives a little bit of information about how the shape of a molecule is affected when not all of the pairs of electrons are nonbonding Before that however it is important to discuss how bond angles are affected by lone pairs According to VSEPR electronelectron repulsion decreases in the following manner lone pair lone pair lone pair bonding pair bonding pair bonding pair This means that presence of lone pairs will increase electronelectron repulsion causing a change in the bond angles The first alternate shape for a coordinate molecule then is where one of the bonding pairs of electrons is replaced with a lone pair The best place for the lone pair to be is equatorial to the central atom This allows for the least amount of electronelectron repulsion possible This shape is called Seesaw The next possible shape is where there are two lone pairs on the central atom Once again the best place for these two molecules is equatorial to the central atom for the least amount of electron repulsion to occur This molecule is called Tshaped The last alternate shape for a coordinate system is when there are three lone pairs These are all equatorial to the central atom to establish the lowest energy conformation This molecule is considered to be Linear Stereoisomers Due to the fact that there are two possible types of X atoms axial or equatorial stereoisomers of trigonal bipyramidal species with more than one type of A atom are possible If there are two different X atoms then those atoms have the option of being cis or trans to each other Meaning if one is axial then the other can be equatorial cis or also axial trans Stereoisomers occur when two or more molecules with the same molecular formula have different

are Lone pairLone pair Lone pairBond pair Bond pairBond pair To decide where to place lone pairs on the parent Trigonal Bipyramidal structure we must place lone pairs far away from each other and bond

degree bond angles if placed at the axial position The T shaped structure minimizes the remaining bond pairbond pair angles at degrees and maximizes the lone pairlone pair bond angle at The linear structure does the same by making sure that the lone pairs are kept at a maximum of degree bond angles As a result all are placed in the equatorial position leaving room at the axial postion for the atoms Thus the bond angles of the atoms are degrees from each other Stereoisomers Since there are two types of atoms on a Trigonal Bipyramidal structure axial and equatorial there are different Stereoisomers that could arise depending on the substituents attached For example if there is X atoms and Y atom attached to the central atom Y could either be in an equatorial position or in an axial position If there are X atoms and Y atoms then one Y atom could be placed in a equatorial position and the other in an axial position or both Y atoms could be placed in the same position References

simplest model that explains electron pairing from two separate atoms to form a molecule Valence Bond model of bonding H is the base for understanding the behavior of valence electrons in bonding Valence Bond Theory Overview Valence Bond Theory is a qualitative method for predicting the behavior of electrons in bonding It focuses on the overlap of the outermost orbitals where the valence electrons reside Electrons are thought to be concentrated along the interculear axis causing a density of negatively charged electrons between both atoms Attracted by the nuclei these shared electrons pull together their respective atoms to which the electrons belong and the result is formation of a covalent bond These hydrogens come together because of the electrostatic attraction between the nuclei and the electron desnity between them Based on the the principle of Valence Bond Theory two electrons are required to make a single bond Hydrogen has only one valence outer electron so two hydrogen atoms are needed to make a bond This allows accurate predictions about the shapes of simple molecules In case of H the shape is simply linear Because Valence Bond Theory involves only valence electrons Lewis dot structures are useful in representing a molecule However there are some drawbacks for certain bond predictions such as bond dissociation energy and magnetism Ultimately a different atom which has more valence electrons can pair with other atoms to form a molecule with more than one bond For instance carbon has valence electrons so it can bond with hydrogen atoms resulting a CH molecule Valence Bond Theory is most of the time used in conjuction with the idea of hybridization and VSEPR Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion in other to predict the shape and the bond angles of a molecule Valence Bond Model of Hydrogen The formation of H in Valence Bond Theory In this diagram HA and HB both have one electron that can be accounted for We know that the electron on HA belongs to HA and the electron on HB belongs to HB However When these two hydrogen bond it is impossible to know which electron belongs to HA or HB Also since these two molecules are the same they have equal attraction on the electrons they share This is because their orbitals overlap and they now share the electrons The electrons are allowed to spin in their respective orbitals Draw backs of Valence Bond Theory Although Valence Bond Theory together with hybridization and VSEPR predicts simple structures relatively well it becomes difficult to predict accurate energies of a bond It also fails to predict aspects of magnetism that can be explained by Molecular Orbital Theory References Brown Ian David The Chemical Bond in Inorganic Chemistry the Bond Valence Model Oxford Oxford UP Print Shaik

the bonds between the other two atoms will under certain circumstances also give rise to a linear species When the central atom is surrounded by three or four lone pairs in addition to the two elements already attached will also give rise to a linear molecule Examples include Bent Molecules There are also several ways to give rise to bent molecules using VESPR theory A triatomic molecule

molecular geometry that gives the molecule an overall dipole moment water posesses several unique chemical and physical properties that are unlike any other species of its size Molecular Structure The classic model for the water molecule HO is a central oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms on either side Unlike other triatomic species that have a linear shape the bonds on a water molecule are tilted at a slight angle due to the presence of lonepair electrons on the oxygen atom Through VSEPR theory it is shown that HO has a steric number of with two lone pairs and two bond pairs making its molecular geometry bent As a result the angle between the two oxygenhydrogen bonds are approximately which is slightly smaller than the angle typically found in tetrahadralshaped molecules see above image This is due to the particularly strong repulsions by the lonepair electrons on the oxygen atom which pushes the hydrogens closer together than usual Each of the oxygenhydrogen bonds measure approximately pm in length This bent geometry due to the presence of lone pair electrons makes water different from typical linear triatomic species both on an atomic and a macroscopic level Physical and Chemical Properties Through its combination of bent geometry and polarized bonds HO has unique physical properties that are uncharacteristic of most other small molecules As a result of oxygen being more eletronegative than hydrogen the oxygenhydrogen bonds have an unequal sharing of electrons with a majority of the negative charge going to the oxygen atom and leaving the positive chage to the hydrogens With the bent structure of HO this creates a dipole on the overall molecule with the oxygen end being negatively charged and the hydrogen end being positively charged As a polar molecule with hydrogen atoms HO can undergo hydrogen bonding with neighboring HO atoms in which the oxygen atoms are weakly bonded to hydrogen atoms from other molecules due to the differences in electrical charge see image above This intermolecular attraction makes water a relatively stable substance and gives it physical properties such as a relatively high boiling point C and melting point C Compare this to other molecules of this size but are nonpolar such as methane CH with a boiling point of C and melting point of C References Housecroft Catherine E Sharpe Alan G Inorganic Chemisty rd ed

Contributors and Attributions Band Theory was developed with some help from the knowledge gained during the quantum revolution in science In Felix Bloch had the idea to take the quantum theory and apply it to solids In Walter Heitler and Fritz London discovered bands very closely spaced orbitals with not much difference in energy In this image orbitals are represented by the black horizontal lines and they are being filled with an increasing number of electrons as their amount increases Eventually as more orbitals are added the space in between them decreases to hardly anything and as a result a band is formed where the orbitals have been filled Different metals will produce different combinations of filled and half filled bands Sodiums bands are shown with the rectangles Filled bands are colored in blue As you can see bands may overlap each other the bands are shown askew to be able to tell the difference between different bands The lowest unoccupied band is called the conduction band and the highest occupied band is called the valence band Bands will follow a trend as you go across a period In Na the s band is full In Mg the s band is full In Al the s band is full and the p ban is full and so on The probability of finding an electron in the conduction band is shown by the equation The E in the equation stands for the change in energy or energy gap t stands for the temperature and R is a bonding constant That equation and this table below show how the bigger difference in energy is or gap between the valence band and the conduction band the less likely electrons are to be found in the conduction band This is because they cannot be excited enough to make the jump up to the conduction band ELEMENT EkJmol of energy gap of electronscm in conduction band

these closely spaced orbitals B Insulators In insulators the band gap between the valence band the the conduction band is so large that electrons cannot make the energy jump from the valence band to the conduction band C Semiconductors Semiconductors have a small energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band Electrons can make the jump up to the conduction band but not with the same ease as they do in conductors There are two different kinds of semiconductors intrinsic and extrinsic i Intrinsic Semiconductors An intrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor in its pure state For every electron that jumps into the conduction band the missing electron will generate a hole that can move freely in the valence band The number of holes will equal the number of electrons that have jumped ii Extrinsic Semiconductors In extrinsic semiconductors the band gap is controlled by purposefully adding small impurities to the material This process is called doping Doping or adding impurities to the lattice can change the electrical conductivity of the lattice and therefore vary the efficiency of the semiconductor In extrinsic semiconductors the number of holes will not equal the number of electrons jumped There are two different kinds of extrinsic semiconductors ptype positive charge doped and ntype negative charge doped Problems How do you distinguish between a valence

molecule because it does not follow the octet rule by having eight valence electrons around the boron atom BF has single bonds between the boron atom and the fluorine atoms and contains no double bonds and an empty p orbital figure This is not predicted by the valence bond theory because it does not allow for any empty orbitals Valence bond theory and how it fails figure Valence Bond Theory states that when a half filled orbital in contact with another half filled orbital will hybridize to form a more stable bonding orbital According to the Valence Bond Theory the lone pair of one of the fluorine atoms should overlap to form a pi bond with the boron atom through a double bond in order to complete an octet on the boron atom figure but this does not occur There are two major reasons why there is no pi bond between any of the F atoms and B atoms electronegativity and separation of charge If one were to write out formal charges of the molecule without the pi bond they will find that the formal charges on all of the atoms are The boron shares its valence electrons with the fluorine creating a total of electrons shared with the fluorine making its formal charge Each fluorine shares one of its valence electrons creating a total of shared electrons with boron and has more electrons to themselves making their formal charges also figure figure If one of the fluorines were to form a pi bond with the boron then the fluorine which is the most electronegative element will have an oxidized state and a formal charge of and consequently the boron atom would have a formal charge of Although this still leaves the BF molecule to have an overall formal charge of the most stable form would be BF with no pi bonds because each of the atoms formal charge is The most stable state is to leave the boron with an empty p orbital The empty p orbital figure BF is a planar molecule because it does not have a lone pair which makes it have a trigonal planar geometry BF is considered a Lewis acid because it accepts electrons at its empty p orbital Examples of reactivity of the empty p orbital The most common reactions with involving BF is to form complexes with ethers figure Other

other atoms directly linked to that specified atom Coordination itself is the formation of a covalent bond the two shared electrons of which have come from only one of the two parts of the molecular entity linked by it as in the reaction of a Lewis acid and a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct alternatively the bonding formed in this way Coordination number is a measure of one of two things In a molecule the coordination number is simply the number of bound atoms to that molecule For an ion the coordination number is the number of ions that are either associated to or can associate with a given ionic species Coordination requires a sigma bond be present or available to be present and so a pi bond does not contribute to the coordination number of a species Lower Coordination Numbers Following are a few examples of more commonly encountered coordination numbers Coordination Number Coordination numbers of two are more common in organic molecules or in non transitionmetal containing species and relatively rare in transition metal containing species Coordination numbers of two result in a linear or collinear spacial arrangement Carbon Dioxide Coordination Number AgNH Coordination Number Coordination Number Coordination number is the most common coordination number especially among transition metal containing species Generally the octahedron is the preferred coordination geometry Other possible coordination geometries exist for coordination number six such as trigonal prismatic CoHO Coordination number Higher Coordination Higher coordination numbers and above exist though they are less common Coordination Number Seven coordinated atoms or molecules results in three main geometries Pentagonal bipyramid Capped octahedron Capped trigonal prism Coordination Number Eight coordinated atoms or molecules results in two main geometries Square antiprism Dodecahedron Coordination Number The only structure yet identified for coordination number systems is the tricrapt trigonal prism Two examples of these structures are ReH and TcH with the representative geometry shown below TcH Coordination number Higher Coordination Numbers Species exist with and coordination

predicts a diamagnetic doubly bonded molecule with four lone pairs O does have a double bond but it has two unpaired electrons in the ground state a property that can be explained by the MO picture We can construct the MO energy level diagrams for these molecules as follows We get the simpler diatomic MO picture on the right when the s and p AOs are well separated in energy as they are for O F and Ne The picture on the left results from mixing of the σs and σp MOs which are close in energy for Li Be B C and N The effect of this mixing is to push the σs down in energy and the σpup to the point where the pπ orbitals are below the σp Asymmetric diatomic molecules and ions such as CO NO and NO also have the ordering of energy levels shown on the left because of sp mixing A good animation of the molecular orbitals in the CO molecule can be found on the University of Liverpool Structure and Bonding website Why dont we get sporbital mixing for O and F The reason has to do with the energies of the orbitals which are not drawn to scale in the simple picture above As we move across the second row of the periodic table from Li to F we are progressively adding protons to the nucleus The s orbital which has finite amplitude at the nucleus feels the increased nuclear charge more than the p orbital This means that as we progress across the periodic table and also as we will see later when we move down the periodic table the energy difference between the s and p orbitals increases As the s and p energies become farther apart in energy there is less interaction between the orbitals ie less mixing A plot of orbital energies is shown below Because of the very large energy difference between the s and sp orbitals we plot them on different energy scales with the s to the left and the sp to the right For elements at the left side of the nd period Li Be B the s and p energies are only a few eV apart The energy difference becomes very large more than electron volts for O and F Since single bond energies are typically about eV this energy difference would be very large on the scale of our MO diagrams For all the elements in the nd row of the periodic table the s core orbitals are very low in energy compared to the sp valence orbitals so we dont need to consider them in drawing our MO diagrams Dinitrogen Tetraoxide Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Topic hierarchy

hierarchy Discovery of elements Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The longheld belief that all materials consist of atoms was only proven recently although elements such as carbon sulfur iron copper silver gold mercury lead and tin had long been regarded as being atomlike Precisely what constituted an element was recognized as modern chemistry grew through the time of alchemy and about elements were known by the end of the th century About elements had been identified by the middle of the th century and the periodicity of their properties had been observed The element technetium Z which was missing in the periodic table was synthesized by nuclear reaction of Mo in and the last undiscovered element promethium Z was found in the fission products of uranium in Neptunium Z an element of atomic number larger than uranium Z was synthesized for the first time in There are named elements Although the existence of elements Z has been confirmed they are not significant in inorganic chemistry as they are produced in insufficient quantity All transuranium elements are radioactive and among the elements with atomic number smaller than Z technetium prometium and the elements after polonium are also radioactive The halflives refer to Section of polonium astatine radon actinium and protoactinium are very short Considerable amounts of technetium Tc are obtained from fission products Since it is a radioactive element handling Tc is problematic as it is for other radioactive isotopes and their general chemistry is much less developed than those of manganese and rhenium in the same group Atoms are equivalent to alphabets in languages and all materials are made of a combination of elements just as sentences are written using only letters Discovery of Noble Gas Compounds Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers In at the University of British Columbia Neil Bartlett was working with the powerful oxidizer PtF and because of an accidental leak in his vacuum line noticed the compounds reaction with O to generate a solid with formula PtFO The formula suggested Pt in the oxidation state which was clearly unreasonable because PtF was known to be a more powerful oxidizer than either molecular fluorine F or molecular oxygen O Bartlett noticed that the Xray powder diffraction pattern of the compound was similar to that of CsAsF a salt with the CsCl structure in which octahedral AsF ions occupy the chloride ion sites This led Bartlett to propose a formulation of OPtF for his new compound Magnetic susceptibility data subsequently confirmed the presence of the paramagnetic O cation which see Chapter has a bond order of This formulation implies that PtF was a strong enough oxidizing agent to oxidize molecular oxygen But just how strong an oxidizer is PtF Its electron affinity could be estimated by using a BornHaber cycle filling in the lattice energy of OPtF by means of Kapustinskiis formula The electron affinity EA for PtF can be calculated as EA kJmol To put it in perspective this is kJmol more exothermic than the electron affinity of atomic fluorine kJ PtF was by far the strongest oxidizer that had ever been made Crystals of xenon difluoride XeF which is made by photolysis of a gas mixture of Xe and F XeF is used as a selective etchant for SiO in certain microelectronic fabrication processes Prior to Neil Bartletts discovery of the first xenon compound in it was believed that elements in group VIII He Ne Ar Kr Xe could not form chemical compounds Since then chemists have discovered a rich family of noble gas compounds containing Xe Kr or Ar Bartlett recognized that Xe has ionization energy of kJ which is very close to the ionization energy of O Since Xe should be about the same size as O the lattice energy should be about the same with Xe in the cation site of the OPtF structure Since all of the other terms in the BornHaber cycle for the reaction of Xe with PtF are the same Bartlett concluded that XePtF like OPtF should be a stable compound He purchased a lecture bottle of xenon gas and reacted the two compounds producing an orange solid While the product initially formed in the reaction may in fact be XePtF the Xe free radical is a powerful Lewis acid and reacts further with excess PtF The ultimate product of the reaction is formulated XeFPtF a salt which contains Xe in the oxidation state and Pt in the oxidation state This was an important discovery because it shattered the dogmatic notion which derived from the octet rule that elements in group VIII could not form bonds with other elements The name of this group was changed from the inert gases to the noble gases Subsequently many compounds of Xe and a few of Kr and even Ar which is much harder to oxidize were synthesized and characterized Discussion Questions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Using the Liverpool D visualization website httpwwwchemtubedcomsolidstate_tablehtm determine the anion

purify solids Usually this method works best when there is only a small amount of impurity in the solid The method involves addition of a cold solvent to the material The mixture that results is heated until the solids dissolve The mixture is slowly cooled again until a pure solid is obtained Recrystallization depends on different solubilities of the target compound and other compounds present in the impure mixture The goal of this method is to have one compound dissolved in a solvent while the other compound is not dissolved If one compound is an undissolved solid it can be filtered out of the solution in order to separate it from all the other things that are in solution Solubility in a solvent is a physical property of a material just like its boiling point or melting point Sodium chloride table salt has a particular solubility in cold water g will dissolve in mL while sodium oleate found in some soaps has a different solubility in cold water g per mL That difference can be exploited to separate these two compounds STOP AND THINK Suppose you were trying to go into the soap business Maybe you find you can easily produce a mixture of equal parts weightweight of sodium chloride and sodium oleate Describe how you could get pure sodium oleate Look at the structures of sodium chloride and sodium oleate Can you qualitatively explain the difference between their solubilities in water Its possible that a mixture of sodium chloride and sodium oleate could be purified through the addition of water If the right amount of water were added and the resulting slurry were stirred together and filtered much of the sodium chloride would be removed because it is more soluble in water than is sodium oleate Sodium oleate is less soluble in water than is sodium chloride so most of it would not dissolve It could be gathered or isolated by filtration The technique described above is not recrystallization It is referred to as washing The sodium oleate was washed with water to remove sodium chloride Washing is simple to do Sometimes it can increase the purity of a compound but it is not always very effective Sometimes in a mixture the two compounds are mixed very tightly together Suppose there is a pile of powder that contains sodium oleate and sodium chloride Instead of having individual grains of sodium chloride and individual grains of sodium oleate the grains of powder contain both compounds There might be a small nugget of sodium chloride surrounded by a coating of sodium oleate This situation is very common especially when the two compounds have formed together Washing might remove most of the exposed sodium chloride but it wouldnt touch the hidden or occluded sodium chloride that was surrounded by sodium oleate molecules STOP AND THINK How can you get all of the sodium chloride out of this mixture In other words how can you make sure there is no sodium chloride covered by sodium oleate It would be convenient if there were a switch that could be turned on and off to control dissolution When the switch is on all the sodium oleate dissolves and any sodium chloride trapped inside can get dissolved too When the switch is off the sodium oleate comes out of solution again so that you can filter it out This switch exists It is found on the front of your hot plate in the organic lab Solubility is temperaturedependent For example the solubility of sodium chloride is different in cold water g per mL at C than in hot water g per mL at C Its possible that in the right amount of hot water all the sodium oleate and all the sodium chloride dissolves If the resulting solution is cooled to room temperature the sodium oleate is no longer soluble The sodium oleate forms a solid again This solid can be filtered away from the water STOP AND THINK After filtration list the contents of the solution Instead of filtering can the solution be allowed to evaporate to leave the sodium oleate behind There is one more part of this process that would make it a complete recrystallization If the sodium oleate forms an amorphous solid when it comes back out of solution we have precipitation If the sodium oleate forms a crystalline solid when it comes back out of solution we have recrystallization An amorphous solid contains molecules that are packed together in random ways A crystalline solid contains molecules that are ordered in a specific way An amorphous solid is like a pile of boxes that were thrown across the room and piled in the corner A crystalline solid is like a set of boxes that were stacked neatly in the corner There are many open spaces between the boxes in the amorphous pile Impurities could get trapped in those spaces in that case we are back where we were at the beginning There are not really spaces between the boxes in the crystalline pile No impurities can be trapped Crystallization safeguards against the inclusion of impurities in the material STOP AND THINK There are many variations on most purification techniques One problem that could happen in a recrystallization is that there is a very insoluble impurity How could this very insoluble impurity be separated from the rest of the sample What precautions must be taken in doing so Suppose you are trying to recrystallize a sample of borneol You think it should be recrystallized from methanol You add a couple of mL of cold methanol and the sample all dissolves Evaluate the prognosis of your recrystallization is it working well If not what do you need to do Suppose you are trying to recrystallize a sample of borneol You think it should be recrystallized from methanol You add a couple of mL of cold methanol and only about half the sample dissolves Evaluate the prognosis of your recrystallization is it working well If not what do you need to do Suppose you are trying to recrystallize a sample of borneol You think it should be recrystallized from methanol You add a couple of mL of hot methanol and only about half the sample dissolves Evaluate the prognosis of your recrystallization is it working well If not what do you need to do Contributors Chris P Schaller PhD College of Saint Benedict Saint Johns University Page ID

in their reactions with water reacting alkali metals with liquid ammonia eventually produces hydrogen gas and the metal salt of the conjugate base of the solventin this case the amide ion NH rather than hydroxide where the am designation refers to an ammonia solution analogous to aq used to indicate aqueous solutions Without a catalyst the reaction in Equation ref tends to be rather slow In many cases the alkali metal amide salt MNH is not very soluble in liquid ammonia and precipitates but when dissolved very concentrated solutions of the alkali metal are produced One mole of Cs metal for example will dissolve in as little as mL g of liquid ammonia The pure metal is easily recovered when the ammonia evaporates Figure Solvated electrons The presence of solvated electrons e NH in solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia is indicated by the intense color of the solution and its electrical conductivity Solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia are intensely colored and good conductors of electricity due to the presence of solvated electrons e NH which are not attached to single atoms A solvated electron is loosely associated with a cavity in the ammonia solvent that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds Alkali metalliquid ammonia solutions of about M or less are deep blue Figure and conduct electricity about times better than an aqueous NaCl solution because of the high mobility of the solvated electrons As the concentration of the metal increases above M the color changes to metallic bronze or gold and the conductivity increases to a value comparable with that of the pure liquid metals Figure Alkali MetalLiquid Ammonia Solutions Most metals are insoluble in virtually all solvents but the alkali metals and the heavier alkaline earth metals dissolve readily

aluminum hydride LiAlH and sodium borohydride NaBH Note The hydride anion is not present during this reaction rather these reagents serve as a source of hydride due to the presence of a polar metalhydrogen bond Because aluminum is less electronegative than boron the AlH bond in LiAlH is more polar thereby making LiAlH a stronger reducing agent Contributors Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University D sp Hybridization Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionReferencesProblemsContributors Introduction The term sp hybridization refers to the mixing character of one sorbital and three porbitals to create four hybrid orbitals with similar characteristics In order for an atom to be sp hybridized it must have an s orbital and three p orbitals From wave function to the visual representation Four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals resulting from the combination of one s atomic orbital and three p atomic orbitals can then describe by four new wave functions equations ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz ψsp ψs ψpx ψpy ψpz Plotting any of these four wave functions gives a picture representation of a sp orbital Each hybrid orbital consists of a large lobe and a small lobe pointing in two opposite direction figure The Bond Angle is o When the graphs of the four wave functions are combined the resulting picture shows the tetrahedral arrangement of the four sp hybrid orbitals around the central atom Because of the tetrahedral molecular geometry the calculate bond angles between and and and and and and and approximately equal o figure The Energy level and election population All four sp hybrid orbitals are delocalizedthey occupy the same energy level however they are higher in energy than the s orbital and lower in energy than the p orbital figure Just like any other atomic orbital each sp hybrid orbital can house elections Scharacter and the stability of the anion Each sp orbital has part of scharacter to parts of pcharacter In other words it has scharacter and pcharacter Since the s orbital is closer to the nucleus and thus lower in energy than the p orbital the electrons of sp hybridized species are held farther from the nucleus than those in sp scharacter and sp scharacter hybridized species The closer the electrons are to the nucleus the more stable they are Therefore when bearing the negative charge sp species are less stable than sp and sp species Put differently sp species are less likely to get deprotonated leaving a pair of electron behind Hybridization and bond lengthbond strength The greater the scharacter the closer the electrons are held to the nucleus the shorter the bond and the stronger the bond Thus sp hybridized atoms form longer and weaker bonds than those of sp and sp hybridizedReferences Brown W H

originally formulated in by the scientists Born and Lande and is used to calculate the lattice energy measure of the strength of bonds of a compound This expression takes into account both the Born interactions as well as the Coulomb attractions Introduction Due to its high simplicity and ease the BornLandé equation is commonly used by chemists when solving for lattice energy This equation proposed by Max Born and Alfred Landé states that lattice energy can be derived from ionic lattice based on electrostatic potential and the potential energy due to repulsion To solve for the BornLandé equation you must have a basic understanding of lattice energy Lattice energy decreases as you go down a group as atomic radii goes up lattice energy goes down Going across the periodic table atomic radii decreases therefore lattice energy increases The BornLandé equation was derived from these two following equations the first is the electrostatic potential energy with is Avogadros constant is the Madelung Constant a constant that varies for different structures is the charge of an electron C is the cation charge is the anion charge is the permittivity of free space The second equation is the repulsive interaction with is the repulsion coefficient and is the Born Exponent typically ranges between that is used to measure how much a solid compresses These equations combine to form with is the closest ion distance Calculate Lattice Energy Lattice energy based on the equation from above is dependent on multiple factors We see that the charge of ions is proportional to the increase in lattice energy In addition as ions come into closer contact lattice energy also increases References Johnson D A Metals and Chemical Change Cambridge Royal Society of Chemistry Cotton F Albert and F Albert Cotton Advanced Inorganic Chemistry New York Wiley Problems Which compound has the greatest lattice energy AlF NACl LiF CaCl What is the lattice energy of NaCl Hint you must look up the values

we would measure between the two electrodes would be V In an electrolytic cell this reaction is run in reverse That is we put in electrical energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules In this case the half reactions and their standard potentials reverse Og bubbles form at the anode and Hg is formed at the cathode Now the anode is the positive electrode and the cathode is negative Electrons are extracted from the substance at the anode water and pumped into the solution at the cathode to make hydrogen An animation of the cathode half reaction is shown below In both galvanic and electrolytic cells oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode Halfcell potentials As noted above the equilibrium voltage of an electrochemical cell is proportional to the free energy change of the reaction Because electrochemical reactions can be broken up into two halfreactions it follows that the potentials of half reactions like free energies can be added and subtracted to give an overall value for the reaction If we take the standard hydrogen electrode as our reference ie if we assign it a value of zero volts we can measure all the other half cells against it and thus obtain the voltage of each one This allows us to rank redox couples according to their standard reduction potentials or more simply their standard potentials as shown in the table below Note that when we construct an electrochemical cell and calculate the voltage we simply take the difference between the half cell potentials and do not worry about the number of electrons in the reaction For example for the displacement reaction in which silver ions are reduced by copper metal the reaction is The two halfcell reactions are and the standard potential The reason we dont need to multiply the Ag potential by is that Eo is a measure of the free energy change per electron Dividing the free energy change by the number of electrons see below makes Eo an intensive property like pressure temperature etc Relationship between E and ΔG For systems that are in equilibrium where n is number of moles of electrons per mole of products and F is the Faraday constant Cmol Here the o symbol indicates that the substances involved in the reaction are in their standard states For example for the water electrolysis reaction the standard states would be pure liquid water H at M concentration or more precisely at unit activity and O and Hg at atmosphere pressure More generally at any concentration or pressure where or at K where Q is the concentration ratio of products over reactants raised to the powers of their coefficients in the reaction This equation in either form is called the Nernst equation The second term in the equation when multiplied by nF is RTlnQ This is the free energy difference between ΔG and ΔG We can think of this as an entropic term that takes into account the positive entropy change of dilution or the negative entropy change of concentrating a reactant or product relative to its standard state Using the Nernst equation Example For the half reaction E V by definition What is E at pH and PH atm so H M Example What is the potential of a fuel cell a galvanic HO cell operating at pH Overall reaction In this reaction H is oxidized to H and O is reduced to HO According to our convention we write out and balance both halfcell reactions as reductions For convenience we do this in acid It is left as an exercise to the interested reader to try to work the problem in base Half cell reactions Toyota fuel cell hybrid bus The bus runs on electrical energy obtained directly from the HO reaction Individual fuel cells are connected in series to make a power train that charges a battery pack and drives an electric motor Although the standard potential of the reaction is V because of kinetic overpotentials each fuel cell in the power train operates at a voltage of about V Despite this energy loss the fuel cell system is still about twice as efficient as a combustion engine performing the same reaction To solve this problem we need to find the difference between the H H and OHO half cell potentials at pH E V Like all standard potentials this is written as a reduction We need to reverse it and change the sign of Eo since H is being oxidized E V and add the standard potential of the substance being reduced at the cathode E V The difference between the two standard half cell potentials is V Ecell Volts We now use the Nernst equation to account for the fact that H is not in its standard state Note that the value of Ecell does not change with pH since both couples shift mVpH according to the Nernst equation This is the consequence of the fact that the number of electrons equals the number of protons in each of the half cell reactions Another way to rationalize this result is to remember that the overall reaction H O HO does not involve H as a reactant or product so ΔG and E should be independent of pH We can plot the shift in the HH and OHO halfcell potentials with pH on a potentialpH diagram also called a Pourbaix diagram as shown below The pHdependent potentials of the H and O couples are shown as dotted lines Notice that the potential difference between them is always V The dark circles represent the standard potentials Pourbaix diagram for water Pourbaix diagrams are essentially electrochemical phase diagrams which plot regions of thermodynamic stability for redoxactive substances As in other kinds of phase diagrams the lines represent conditions under which two phases coexist in equilibrium The shaded area in the water Pourbaix diagram represents the conditions of potential and pH where liquid water is stable relative to hydrogen or oxygen Outside the shaded region water is thermodynamically unstable and is reduced to Hg or oxidized to Og Although these processes are spontaneous in the thermodynamic sense for example water is unstable in the presence of Pb Cl Fe Zn or Al they are kinetically slow and require catalysis to proceed Electrochemistry Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The standard state is defined as the one corresponding to C K unit activity for all the substances in an electrochemical zerocurrent cell under bar of pressure Pa For a reaction in which H ions participate the standard state is pH approximately mol acid In the hydrogen electrode used as the standard of electrode potential atm of hydrogen gas aH is slowly contacted with a platinumblack electrode immersed in a strong acid solution of activity aH The potential is expressed as and by definition E in the standard state The hydrogen electrode in the standard state is called the standard hydrogen electrode or NHE Although reduction potential is usually expressed with reference to the NHE standard the hydrogen electrode is inconvenient to handle Therefore a saturated calomel SCE or an Ag AgCl electrode is used as a reference electrode for everyday electrochemical measurements and experimental potentials are measured against these electrodes or converted into NHE values When the NHE value is set to the SCE value is V and the AgAgCl value is V A redox reaction takes place only when redox partners exist and a reactant can be either an oxidant or reductant depending on its reaction partner The relative redox capability can be expressed numerically by introducing the reduction potentials E of imaginary halfreactions Table The free energy change of a reaction is related to E where n is the number of transferred electrons and F the Faraday constant C

Delta G_ FE_ endsplit do not occur independently but if both H aq and Zn s are present the redox reaction takes place The equation for the actual reaction is complete when the latter equation is subtracted from the former The free energy change of the whole redox reaction is the difference between for the respective halfreactions Because halfreactions are not real and they are used in pairs the free energy change of H is set to zero for convenience Since the experimental value of is kJ equals kJ Potential corresponding to of a halfreaction is called the standard reduction potential Therefore The standard potentials of various halfreactions are determined using similar procedures to that mentioned above Table The E s of redox reactions can be calculated by combining E of these halfreactions If E of a redox reaction is positive is negative and the reaction occurs spontaneously Consequently instead of the free energy change the difference in reduction potentials can be used to judge the thermodynamic spontaneity of a reaction The higher the reduction potential of a reagent the stronger its oxidation ability The positive or negative signs are based on the expedient of setting the reduction potential of a proton to and it should be understood that a positive sign does not necessarily mean oxidizing and a negative sign reducing The series arranged in the order of redox power is called the electrochemical series Electronegativity Values Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers There are a few different types of electronegativity which differ only in their definitions and the system by which they assign values for electronegativity For example there is Mulliken electronegativity which is defined as the average of the ionization energy and electron affinity of an atom which as we will see differs slightly from Paulings definition of electronegativity Topic hierarchy Electronic factors which govern bonding and structure Last updated Save as PDF Page ID a Effective nuclear chargeb Ionization energyc Electron affinityd Electronegativitye Molecular orbitalsConditions of the formation of bonding molecular orbitalsGreat theory and evaluation The bonding and structure of a compound are determined by electronic properties such as the power of constituent atoms to attract or repel electrons the molecular orbitals occupied by valence electrons etc Geometrical arrangements of atoms are also influenced by the electronic interactions between nonbonding electrons Here some fundamental concepts are described a Effective nuclear charge Since the positive nuclear charge is generally offset by the negative charge of the internal electrons in the electron shell inside the valence electrons the nuclear charge that valence electrons feel is smaller than the integer charge Ze for an atomic number Z This reduction is expressed by the shielding constant and the net nuclear charge is called the effective nuclear charge Zeff e The effective nuclear charge varies with different electron orbitals and distances from the nucleus b Ionization energy Ionization energy is defined as the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the atom in a gaseous phase g as shown in the following equation Ionization energy is expressed in units of electron volt eV where eV kJ mol The st ionization energy which removes the outermost electron is the smallest and the nd and rd ionization energies which further ionize cations increase rapidly The ionization enthalpy which is the standard enthalpy change of the ionization process and is used in thermodynamic calculations is the ionization energy multiplied by RT R is the universal gas constant J K mol and T is temperature kJ eV at room temperature The difference between these two parameters is small The st ionization energy varies periodically with atomic number across the periodic table with the lower left cesium Cs being the smallest and the upper right helium He the largest It is understandable that alkali metals generally have the lowest ionization energies because they are stabilized by removal of an s electron to attain the rare gas configuration Rare gas elements have stable electronic structures and their ionization energies are the largest Although the ionization energy increases almost monotonically from alkali metals to rare gases in each period there are reversals at several places such as nitrogen N and oxygen O and phosphorus P and sulfur S The st ionization energies are given in Table Table Electronic parameters of atoms eV I st ionization energy Ae electron affinity electronegativity Mulliken Atom I A H He Li Be B C N O F Ne Na Mg Al Si P S Cl Ar K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Kr Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Xe Cs Ba La Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi c Electron affinity Electron affinity is the negative of the electrongain enthalpy Heg of an atom in a gas phase as shown in the following equation and denoted by Ae Heg Table It may be regarded as the ionization enthalpy of an anion Since halogen atoms achieve rare gas electron configurations if an electron is added to them their electron affinities are large d Electronegativity Electronegativity is one of the most fundamental atomic parameters which expresses numerically the tendency to attract electrons to atoms in a molecule It is very useful in explaining differences in bonding structure and reaction from the standpoint of atomic properties Various schemes have been proposed to explain the theoretical basis of the power of electron attraction and studies are still actively seeking new numerical values of electronegativity The Pauling scale introduced first in is still the most frequently used and subsequent new numerical values have been justified if they are close to those of Pauling L Pauling defined electronegativity as the quantitative ionic character of bonds Originally the following equation was proposed as a formula to define the ionic character of the bond between atoms A and B where D is the bond energy of a covalent bond However it turned out that is not necessarily positive and Pauling modified the definition and redefined it as the ionic character of the AB bond Furthermore electronegativity was defined in such a way that the difference of the electronegativities of atoms A and B is proportional to the square root of the ionic character Here the coefficient is so determined that the electronegativity of hydrogen H becomes when bond energies are expressed in kcal mol Since Pauling electronegativities increase the higher the oxidization states of an atom these values correspond to the highest oxidization number of each element The electronegativities calculated using recent values of bond energies are shown in Table H Li Be Na Mg K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Cs Ba Lanthanoid Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Fr Ra Actinoid He B C N O F Ne Al Si P S Cl Ar Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Kr Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Xe Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Po At Rn A L Allred and E G Rochow defined electronegativity as the electric field Zeff r on the atomic surface They added a constant in order to make the electronegativity as near as possible to the Pauling values by using r for the covalent bond radius of atoms It turns out that elements with small covalent radii and large effective nuclear charges have large electronegativities Table R Mulliken defined electronegativity as the average of the ionization energy I and electron affinity Ae as follows Figure As ionization energy is the energy of electronic excitation from the HOMO and electron affinity the energy of electron addition to the LUMO refer to Section e in this definition electronegativity can also be called the average value of the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO Those elements which are hard to ionize and easy to attract electrons have large values Although the electronegativity is defined for the atoms in a valence state in a molecule and has the dimensions of energy it is treated as a dimensionless number Table Figure Mulliken electronegativity Although the definition of Mulliken is intelligible since it is directly related to atomic orbitals generally the values of Pauling or AllredRochow are used As these values are not much different the Pauling electronegativity is appropriate when choosing only one Electronegativity values change not only by definition but are also considerably affected by the bonding state of atoms and they should be used with considerable caution The electronegativities of the constituent atoms are fundamental to explaining the differences in bonding structure and reactions of compounds Therefore theoretical chemists continue in their efforts firmly to extend the foundations of this parameter Exercise Describe the numerical tendency of electronegativities of the elements in the periodic table Answer They increase toward the right and decrease down the table Namely the electronegativity of alkali metal Cs is the smallest and that of fluorine F is the largest e Molecular orbitals The wave functions of electrons in an atom are called atomic orbitals Since the probability of finding electrons in a molecular orbital is proportional to the square of a wave function the electron map looks like a wave function A wave function has domains of positive and negative amplitude called lobes The overlapping positive lobes or negative lobes of the wave functions of atoms in a molecule amplify each other to form a bond but the positive and negative lobes cancel each other forming no bond The extent of this interference effect corresponds to the magnitude of the overlap integral in quantum chemistry In the formation of a molecule atomic orbitals overlap to generate a molecular orbital which is the wave function of the electrons in the molecule The number of molecular orbitals is the sum of the atomic orbitals and these molecular orbitals are classified into bonding nonbonding or antibonding molecular orbitals by the extent of their participation in the bond between atoms The conditions of the formation of a bonding molecular orbital are as follows Conditions of the formation of bonding molecular orbitals The lobes of the atomic orbitals of the constituent atoms are suitable for an overlap The positive or negative sign of the overlapping lobes is the same The energy levels of atomic orbitals are close The simplest case where a molecular orbital is constructed from atomic orbitals A and B is explained here A bonding molecular orbital is formed between A and B if the above mentioned conditions and are satisfied but if the sign of one of the atomic orbitals is reversed condition is not satisfied and an antibonding molecular orbital in which the signs of the overlapping lobes are different Figure results The energy level of a bonding orbital is lower and the level of an antibonding orbital is higher than those of the constituent atomic orbitals The larger the energy difference of a bonding and an antibonding orbital the stronger the bond When there is no bonding or antibonding interaction between A and B the resultant molecular orbital is a nonbonding orbital Electrons occupy the molecular orbitals in order of lowest to highest energy levels The highest occupied molecular orbital is called the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied one the LUMO Kenichi Fukui Nobel prize named these orbitals frontier orbitals Two or more molecular orbitals of equal energy are called degenerate orbitals The symbol of a nondegenerate orbital is a or b a doubly degenerate orbital e and triply degenerate orbital t The symbol g gerade is attached as a suffix to the centrosymmetric orbital and u ungerade to the orbital which changes sign under inversion around an inversion center The number before the symmetry symbol is used in order of energy to distinguish orbitals of the same degeneracy Additionally they are named sigma or pi orbitals according to the orbital character A sigma orbital has rotation symmetry around the bond axis and a pi orbital has a nodal plane Therefore sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of ss pp sd pd and dd orbitals Figure and pi bonds the overlap of pp pd and dd orbitals Figure Figure Construction of molecular orbitals Figure The molecular orbitals Figure The molecular orbitals When the wave functions of two atoms are set to and a molecular orbital is a linear combination of the atomic orbitals LCAO expressed as Only the atomic orbitals of the valence electron shell are used in the simplest molecular orbital method Construction of a molecular orbital is illustrated below for the simplest case of the twoatom molecules All the levels below the HOMO are occupied by electrons and the levels above the LUMO are empty In a hydrogen molecule H the overlap of the s orbital of each hydrogen atom forms a bonding orbital if the lobes have equal sign and an antibonding orbital if they have opposite signs and two electrons occupy the bonding orbital Figure Figure The molecular orbitals of H The arrows indicate the electron spins In the twoatom molecules of the nd period from lithium Li to fluorine F if the z axis is set as a bond axis and are formed by the overlap of s orbital of each atom and and from pz orbitals and and from px and py The orbital energy levels for the molecules from Li to N are ordered as and electrons occupy the levels sequentially from the bottom The example of an N molecule with ten valence electrons is shown in Figure Since the ordering of orbitals is somewhat different in O and F in which the orbital comes under that of the molecular orbital of the oxygen molecule O is illustrated in Figure The th and th electrons among the valence electrons occupy the doubly degenerate orbital in the ground state and they have parallel spins under Hunds rule and hence an oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons Figure Molecular orbitals of N Figure Molecular orbitals of O The molecular orbitals of two different atoms are formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals with different energy levels The energy level of the orbital of the atom with larger electronegativity generally is lower and the molecular orbitals are more characteristic of the atomic orbital with the nearer energy level Therefore the bonding orbitals have the character of the atom with the larger electronegativity and the antibonding orbitals that of the atom with the smaller electronegativity For example five molecular orbitals in hydrogen fluoride HF are formed from the s orbital of hydrogen and the s and p orbitals of fluorine as shown in Figure The bonding orbital has the s character of fluorine and the antibonding orbital the s character of hydrogen Since hydrogen has only one s orbital the overlap with the p orbital of fluorine with character is not effective and the fluorine p orbital becomes a nonbonding orbital Since HF has eight valence electrons this nonbonding orbital is the HOMO Figure Molecular orbitals of HF In carbon monoxide CO carbon and oxygen have s and p orbitals resulting in both sigma and pi bonds and a triple bond is formed between the atoms Although molecular orbitals in this case are qualitatively the same as those of the isolectronic nitrogen molecule N and electrons occupy the orbital up to the energy level of each orbital differs from that of the nitrogen molecule The bonding orbital has the s character of oxygen because of its larger electronegativity and the bonding orbital also has the p character of oxygen The antibonding and orbitals have the p character of carbon Figure Figure Molecular orbitals of CO The bond order between atoms is a half of the number of electrons in the bonding orbitals minus those of the antibonding orbitals For example in N or CO it is equal to and is consistent with the Lewis structure Exercise Why are the atomic orbitals of oxygen atom in the molecular orbital diagram of carbon monoxide CO lower than those of carbon Answer It is because the electronegativity of oxygen is larger than that of carbon problems Using the Pauling equation calculate the electronegativity of chlorine from the bond energies of the hydrogen molecule H kJ mol chlorine molecule Cl kJ mol and hydrogen chloride HCl molecule kJ mol and electronegativity of hydrogen Why are the energy levels in the orbitals of sigma character and in those of pi character in the molecular orbital diagram of N or O Great theory and evaluation Lewis valence electron theory proposes that a covalent bond is formed with an electron pair and that there are eight valence electrons around each atom This is a very important concept with which we understand the bonds between the main group elements However the theory was not held in high enough regard for a Nobel prize to be awarded to Lewis One of the reasons of this disregard seems to be that chemists in the United States Lewis homeland ignored his theory at first and that a Nobel prize laureate Langmuir extended Lewiss theory which was later known as the LewisLangmuir theory N Bohr the eminent physicist who had great influence on the Nobel prize selection evaluated Langmuirs adsorption theory more highly which suggests that physicists considered Lewis theory too simplistic There is a similar story about the transition state theory of H Eyring Physicists and theoretical chemists who liked mathematical treatment of chemical phenomena thought Eyrings theory too unsophisticated For this reason the most important concept in chemical kinetics was not considered for a Nobel prize It is an episode in the history of chemistry which reminds us of the comment of R Hoffmann who pointed out that simple concepts are more important than deceptively complicated mathematical theories Electronic Structure of Complexes Part Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Ligand field theorySix coordinate octahedral complexesSquare planar complexesTetrahedral complexesJahnTeller Effect It is necessary to learn a few concepts to understand the structure spectrum magnetism and reactivity of complexes which depend on d electron configurations In particular the theory of electronic structure is important Ligand field theory Ligand field theory is one of the most useful theories to account for the electronic structure of complexes It originated in the application of the crystal field theory of ionic crystals to metal complex systems Six coordinate octahedral complexes The five d orbitals of transition metal cations are degenerate and have equal energy Figure Change of electronic energy upon complex formation The spherical negative electric field around a metal cation results in the total energy level being lower than that of a free cation because the electrostatic interactions The repulsive interaction between the electrons in the metal orbitals and the negative electric field destabilizes the system and compensates for the stabilization to some extent Figure Figure Ligand positions in the Cartesian coordinate with a metal ion at the origin Let us assume that instead of a uniform spherical negative field the field is generated by six ligands coordinating octahedrally to a central metal The negative field of the ligands is called the ligand field Negative charge in the case of anionic ligands or a negative end lone pair in the case of neutral ligands exert a repulsive force on the metal d orbitals which is anisotropic depending on the direction of the orbitals The position of the metal cation is taken as the origin and Cartesian coordinates are constructed Figure Then dxy and dz orbitals are aligned along the directions of the axes and the dxy dyz and dxz orbitals are directed between the axes If ligands are placed on the axes the repulsive interaction is larger for the eg orbitals dxy dz than for the tg orbitals dxy dyz dxz and the eg orbitals are destabilized and the tg orbitals are stabilized to an equal extent In the following discussion only the energy difference between the tg and eg orbitals is essential and the average energy of these orbitals is taken as the zero of energy If the energy difference between the two eg and three tg orbitals is set to the energy level of the eg orbitals is and that of the tg orbitals is Figure may also be expressed as Dq In this case the energy level of the eg orbitals is Dq and that of the tg orbitals Dq Figure Ligand field splitting in tetrahedral and octahedral complexes Transition metal ions have to d electrons and when the split d orbitals are filled from a lower energy level the electron configuration tgxegy corresponding to each ion is obtained With the zero energy level chosen as the average energy level the energy of the electron configuration relative to zero energy becomes This value is called the ligand field stabilization energy The electron configuration with smaller value taking the minus sign into consideration is more stable LFSE is an important parameter to explain some properties of dblock transition metal complexes A condition other than the orbital energy level is required to explain the filling of electrons being populated into the split tg and eg orbitals Two electrons can occupy an orbital with antiparallel spins but a strong electrostatic repulsion occurs between two electrons in the same orbital This repulsive interaction is called pairing energy P When the number of d electrons is less than three the pairing energy is minimized by loading the electrons in the tg orbital with parallel spins Namely the electron configurations arising are tg tg or tg Two possibilities arise when the fourth electron occupies either of the tg or eg orbitals The lower energy orbital tg is favorable but occupation of the same orbital gives rise to pairing energy P The total energy becomes If the fourth electron occupies the energetically unfavorable eg orbital the total energy becomes The choice of the electron configuration depends on which of the above values is larger Therefore if P tg is favoured and this is called the strong field case or the low spin electron configuration If P tgeg is favoured and this is called the weak field case or the high spin electron configuration A similar choice is required for d d and d octahedral complexes and in the strong field case tg tg or tgeg configurations are favoured whereas in the weak field case tgeg tgeg or tgeg configurations are favoured The ligand field splitting parameter is decided by the nature of the ligands and metal whereas the pairing energy P is almost constant and shows only a slight dependence on the identity of the metal Square planar complexes Complexes with four ligands in a plane containing the central metal are termed square planar complexes It is easier to understand the electronic energy levels of the d orbitals in square planar complexes by starting from those for hexacoordinate octahedral complexes Placing the six ligands along the Cartesian axes the two ligands on the z axis are gradually removed from the central metal and finally only four ligands are left on the xy plane The interaction of the two z coordinate ligands with the dz dxz and dyz orbitals becomes smaller and the energy levels of these ligands lower On the other hand the remaining four ligands approach the metal and the dxy and dxy energy levels rise as a result of the removal of the two ligands This results in the order of the energy levels of five d orbitals being dxz dyz dz dxy dxy Figure Rh Ir Pd Pt and Au complexes with a d configuration tend to form square planar structures because eight electrons occupy the lower orbitals leaving the highest dxy orbital empty Figure Change of the orbital energy from octahedral to square planar complexes Tetrahedral complexes Tetrahedral complexes have four ligands on the apexes of a tetrahedron around the central metal CoX X Cl Br I NiCO etc are all examples of coordination complexes Figure When a metal is placed on the origin of the Cartesian axes as in the octahedral complexes e orbitals dxy dz are distant from ligands and t orbitals dxy dyz dxz are nearer ligands Consequently the electronic repulsion is larger for the t orbitals which are destabilized relative to the e orbitals The ligand field exerted by four ligands splits the fivefold degenerate orbitals of the central metal into twofold degenerate e and threefold degenerate t sets Figure The t set has energy of and the e set with a ligand field splitting of As the number of the ligands is of that in hexacoordinate octahedral complexes and overlap of the ligands with the orbitals is smaller and the ligand splitting is about a half of Consequently only highspin electron configurations are known in tetrahedral complexes The ligand field splitting energies calculated by the above method are shown in Table Table Ligand field stabilization energy LFSE Octahedral

the tetragonal distortion of an octahedral coordination structure of hexacoordinate Cu complexes Figure JahnTeller splitting in a Cu ion Figure The relation between the metal and ligand orbitals during formation of bonds They have a d configurations and the eg orbitals in the octahedral structure are occupied by three electrons If the eg orbitals split and two electrons occupy the lower orbital and one electron the upper orbital the system gains energy of a half of the energy difference of two split orbitals Therefore a tetragonal distortion in the z axis becomes favorable Electronic

is expressed using three quantum numbers the principal quantum number n the azimuthal quantum number l and the magnetic quantum number m For a principal quantum number n there are n azimuthal quantum numbers l ranging from to n and each corresponds to the following orbitals An atomic orbital is expressed by the combination of n and l For example n is and l is for a d orbital There are l m values namely l l l l Consequently there are one s orbital three p orbitals five d orbitals and seven f orbitals The three aforementioned quantum numbers are used to express the distribution of the electrons in hydrogentype atom and another quantum number ms which describes the direction of an electron spin is necessary to completely describe an electronic state Therefore an electronic state is defined by four quantum numbers n l m ms The wave function which determines the orbital shape can be expressed as the product of a radial wavefunction R and an angular wave function Y as follows R is a function of distance from the nucleus and Y expresses the angular component of the orbital Orbital shapes are shown in Figure Since the probability of the electrons existence is proportional to the square of the wave function an electron density map resembles that of a wave function The following conditions must be satisfied when each orbital is filled with electrons The conditions of electron filling Pauli principle The number of electrons that are allowed to occupy an orbital must be limited to one or two and for the latter case their spins must be antiparallel different direction Hunds rule When there are equalenergy orbitals electrons occupy separate orbitals nd their spins are parallel same direction The order of orbital energy of a neutral atom is and the electron configuration is

simplicity let us consider the ionic solids as a collection of positive and negative ions In this simple view appropriate number of cations and anions come together to form a solid The positive ions experience both attraction and repulsion from ions of opposite charge and ions of the same charge The Madelung constant is a property of the crystal structure and depends on the lattice parameters anioncation distances and molecular volume of the crystal D Crystal Before considering a threedimensional crystal lattice we shall discuss the calculation of the energetics of a linear chain of ions

to evaluate the lattice energy accurately but the above calculation leads you to a good start When methods to evaluate the energy of crystallization or lattice energy lead to reliable values these values can be used in the BornHable cycle to evaluate other chemical properties for example the electron affinity which is really difficult to determine directly by experiment Energetics of Crystalline Solids The Ionic Model Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Electrostatic energy of a crystal latticeTotal lattice energy of a crystal Many ionic compounds have simple structures Because the forces holding the atoms together are primarily electrostatic we can calculate the cohesive energy of the crystal lattice with good accuracy Interesting questions to ask about these lattice energy calculations are How accurate are lattice energy calculations What do they teach us about the chemical bonds in ionic crystals Can we use lattice energies to predict properties such as solubility stability and reactivity Can we use lattice energies to predict the crystal structures of ionic compounds Lets start by looking at the forces that hold ionic lattices together There are mainly two kinds of force that determine the energy of an ionic bond The NaCl crystal structure is the archetype for calculating lattice energies and computing enthalpies of formation from BornHaber cycles Electrostatic Force of attraction and repulsion Coulombs Law Two ions with charges z and z separated by a distance r experience a force F where e C π ε C²J m This force is attractive for ions of opposite charge The electrostatic potential energy Eelec is then given by The sign of Eelec is negative for the attractive interaction between a cation and an anion That is the closer oppositely charged ions approach each other the lower the potential energy Closedshell repulsion When electrons in the closed shells of one ion overlap with those of another ion there is a repulsive force comes from the Pauli exclusion principle A third electron cannot enter an orbital that already contains two electrons This force is short range and is typically modeled as falling off exponentially or with a high power of the distance r between atoms For example in the Born approximation B is a constant and ρ is a number with units of length which is usually empirically determined from compressibility data A typical value of ρ is Å The energy of the ionic bond between two atoms is then calculated as the combination of net electrostatic and the closedshell repulsion energies as shown in the figure at the right Note that for the moment we are ignoring the attractive van der Waals energy between ions which we will explain below For a pair of ions the equilibrium distance between ions is determined by the minimum in the total energy curve At this distance the net force on each ion is zero Electrostatic energy of a crystal lattice We can use these equations to calculate the lattice energy of a crystal by summing up the interactions between all pairs of ions Because the closedshell repulsion force is short range this term is typically calculated only for interactions between neighboring ions However the Coulomb force is long range and must be calculated over the entire crystal This problem was first solved in by Erwin Madelung a German physicist Consider an ion in the NaCl structure labeled O in the diagram at the right We can see that the nearest neighbor interactions with ions labeled are attractive the next nearest neighbor interactions and are repulsive and so on In the NaCl structure counting from the ion in the center of the unit cell there are nearest neighbors on the faces of the cube next nearest neighbors on the edges of the cube in the next shell at the vertices of the cube and so on Their distances from ion increase progressively ro ro ro and so on where ro is the nearest neighbor distance We can now write the electrostatic energy at ion O as Factoring out constants and the nearestneighbor bond distance ro we obtain Where the sum in parentheses which is unitless slowly converges to a value of A Generalizing this formula for any threedimensional ionic crystal we get a function where N is Avogadros number because we are calculating energy per mole of ions and A is called the Madelung constant The Madelung constant depends only on the geometrical arrangement of the ions and so it varies between different types of crystal structures but within a given structure type it does not change Thus MgO and NaCl have the same Madelung constant because they both have the NaCl structure The Madelung constant is calculated by summing up electrostatic interactions with ion labeled in the expanding spheres method Each number designates the order in which it is summed For example ions labeled represent the six nearest neighbors attractive interaction ions labeled are the next nearest neighbors repulsive interaction and so on Note that if the sum is carried out over shells it converges very slowly but there are mathematical methods for summing it which give a rapidly converging series The table below lists Madelung constants for some common structures The reduced Madelung constant is obtained by normalizing the values to the number of ions in the formula unit It can be seen from the table that the reduced Madelung constants are quite similar for different structures This makes it hard to determine on the basis of electrostatic energy calculations which structure will be most stable for a given compound It is interesting to note that the trend in reduced Madelung constants roughly follows the trend in ionicity cf the MooserPearson diagram in Section For example wurtzite has a slightly higher Madelung constant than zincblende consistent with our earlier conclusion that the wurtzite structure is favored by more polar compounds Structure Madelung Constant A Reduced Madelung Constant An NaCl halite CsCl ZnS zincblende ZnS wurtzite CaF fluorite TiO rutile AlO corundum Total lattice energy of a crystal Having in hand a formula for the electrostatic energy we can now add in the closedshell repulsion term to obtain an equation that gives us the total lattice energy At the equilibrium bond distance the forces on all the ions are zero and we can use this fact to eliminate the constant B Expressed this way EL is a negative number because z and z have opposite signs It represents the energy change for forming one mole of solid salt from one mole of the gaseous ions separated initially at an infinite distance Lithium fluoride shown here as a large single crystal in a beaker of water is the only alkali halide that is not freely soluble in water The lattice energy of LiF is the most negative of the alkali fluorides because Li and F are both small ions and EL is proportional to r Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub of the

ZnS Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionZincblende SphaleriteThermal stabilityWurtziteCalculating density of a crystal structureContributors ZnS has a unique structure type compared to other molecules having different types of unique structures ZnS can have a zinc blende structure which is a diamondtype network and at a different temperature ZnS can become the wurtzite structure type which has a hexagonal type symmetry Structurewise the zinc blende structure is more thermodynamically favored however because of the wurtzite structures slow construction both forms of ZnS can be found Summary Zinc blend is a compound that comes in two forms sphalerite and wurtzite These are characterized by a stoichiometric ratio of Zinc to Sulfur It maintains a tetrahedral arrangement in both forms Introduction Zinc sulfide ZnS is a unique compound that forms two types of crystalline structures These two polymorphs are wurtzite and zincblende also known as sphalerite Wurtzite has a hexagonal structure while zincblende is cubic It is characterized by single bonds between each atom and maintenance of a zinc to sulfur ratio sphalerite Site Zn S Central Face Corner Total Since the number of atoms in a single unit cell of Zn and S is the same it is consistent with the formula ZnS The ionic radius for Zn is pm and for S is pm Therefore the ratio between cationic and anionic radii in zinc blend is pm pm This suggests a tetrahedral ion arrangement and four nearest neighbors from standard crystal structure prediction tables Therefore four sulfur atoms surround each zinc atom and four zinc atoms surround each sulfur atom The coordination number the number of of electron pairs donated to a metal by its ligands for both zinc an sulfur is four The difference between wurtzite and zincblende lies in the different arrangements of layers of ions Zincblende Sphalerite Zincblende is characterized as a cubic closet packing ccp also known as facecentered cubic structure This crystal

Generic license Fig A representation of ccp structure from Public Domain Notice how only half of the tetrahedral sites are occupied Thermal stability Density tends to decrease as temperature increases In this case since ccp structures are more dense than hcp structures so a conversion from sphalerite to wurtzite occurs naturally over time at a rate similar to that of diamond to graphite The sphalerite structure is favored at k by kJmol but at K the transition to wurtzite occurs Wurtzite Wurtzite has a hexagonal closest packing structure hcp which is characterized by ions in the corners of each unit that create a hexagonal prism seen in Fig As discussed previously zincblende slowly transforms to wurtzite due to thermodynamic stability Fig HCP structure of wurtzite Creator Alexander

Page ID Magnetization and susceptibility DefinitionsSusceptibility of paramagnets Susceptibility of ferro ferri and antiferromagnetsOrdering of spins below TC The magnetism of metals and other materials are determined by the orbital and spin motions of the unpaired electrons and the way in which unpaired electrons align with each other All magnetic substances are paramagnetic at sufficiently high temperature where the thermal energy kT exceeds the interaction energy between spins on neighboring atoms Below a certain critical temperature spins can adopt different kinds of ordered arrangements A pictorial description of the ordering of spins in ferromagnetism antiferromagnetism ferrimagnetism and paramagnetism Lets begin by considering an individual atom in the bcc structure of iron metal Fe is in group VIIIb of the periodic table so it has eight valence electrons The atom is promoted to the sd state in order to make bonds A localized picture of the delectrons for an individual iron atom might look like this Since each unpaired electron has a spin moment of the total spin angular momentum S for this atom is in units of hπ We can think of each Fe atom in the solid as a little bar magnet with a spinonly moment S of The spin moments of neigboring atoms can align in parallel antiparallel or random fashion In bcc Fe the tendency is to align parallel because of the positive sign of the exchange interaction This results in ferromagnetic ordering in which all the spins within a magnetic domain typically hundreds of unit cells in width have the same orientation as shown in the figure at the right Conversely a negative exchange interaction between neighboring atoms in bcc Cr results in antiferromagnetic ordering A third arrangement ferrimagnetic ordering results from an antiparallel alignment of spins on neighboring atoms when the magnetic moments of the neighbors are unequal In this case the spin moments do not cancel and there is a net magnetization The ordering mechanism is like that of an antiferromagnetic solid but the magnetic properties resemble those of a ferromagnet Ferrimagnetic ordering is most common in metal oxides as we will learn in Chapter Magnetization and susceptibility The magnetic susceptibility χ of a solid depends on the ordering of spins Paramagnetic ferromagnetic antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic solids all have χ but the magnitude of their susceptibility varies with the kind of ordering and with temperature We will see these kinds of magnetic ordering primarily among the d and f elements and their alloys and compounds For example Fe Co Ni NdFeB SmCo and YCo are all ferromagnets Cr and MnO are antiferromagnets and FeO and CoFeO are ferrimagnets Diamagnetic compounds have a weak negative susceptibility χ Definitions H applied magnetic field units Henry H B induced magnetic field in a material units Tesla T M magnetization which represents the magnetic moments within a material in the presence of an external field H Magnetic susceptibility χ MH Usually χ is given in molar units in the cgs system χM molar susceptibility units cmmol Typical values of χM Compound Type of Magnetism χ at K cmmol SiO Diamagnetic x Pt metal Pauli paramagnetic x GdSOHO Paramagnetic x NiFe alloy Ferromagnetic To correlate χ with the number of unpaired electrons in a compound we first correct for the small diamagnetic contribution of the core electrons Susceptibility of paramagnets For a paramagnetic substance The inverse relationship between the magnetic susceptibility and T the absolute temperature is called Curies Law and the proportionality constant C is the Curie constant Note that C is not a constant in the usual sense because it depends on µeff the effective magnetic moment of the molecule or ion which in turn depends on its number of unpaired electrons Curie law behavior of a paramagnet A plot of χ vs absolute temperature is a straight line with a slope of C and an intercept of zero Here µB is the Bohr magneton a physical constant defined as µB ehπme x erggauss in cgs units In cgs units we can combine physical constants Combining these equations we obtain These equations relate the molar susceptibility a bulk quantity that can be measured with a magnetometer to µeff a quantity that can be calculated from the number of unpaired electrons n Two important points to note about this formula are The magnetic susceptibility is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature with a proportionality constant C Curies Law So far we are talking only about paramagnetic substances where there is no interaction between neighboring atoms Number of unpaired electrons per atom determined from Curie constants of transition metals and their alloys Returning to the isolated Fe atom with its three unpaired electrons we can measure the Curie constant for iron metal above the temperature of its transition to a paramagnetic solid and compare it to the calculation of µeff Since n we calculate The plot at the right shows the number of unpaired electrons per atom calculated from measured Curie constants for the magnetic elements and alloys in the d series The plot peaks at a value of spins per atom slightly lower than we calculated for an isolated iron atom This reflects that fact that there is some pairing of delectrons ie that they do contribute somewhat to bonding in this part of the periodic table Susceptibility of ferro ferri and antiferromagnets Below a certain critical temperature the spins of a solid paramagnetic substance order and the susceptibility deviates from simple Curielaw behavior Because the ordering depends on the shortrange exchange interaction this critical temperature varies widely Metals and alloys in the d series tend to have high critical temperatures because the atoms are directly bonded to each other and the interaction is strong For example Fe and Co have critical temperatures also called the Curie temperature Tc for ferromagnetic substances of and K respectively The Curie temperature is determined by the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction and by the number of unpaired electrons per atom The number of unpaired electrons peaks between Fe and Co as the dband is filled and the exchange interaction is stronger for Co than for Fe In contrast to ferromagnetic metals and alloys paramagnetic salts of transition metal ions typically have critical temperatures below K because the magnetic ions are not directly bonded to each other and thus their spins are very weakly coupled in the solid state For example in gadolinium sulfate the paramagnetic Gd ions are isolated from each other by SO ions Magnetic susceptibility vs temperature Kelvin for ferrimagnetic ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials Above the critical temperature TC ferromagnetic compounds become paramagnetic and obey the CurieWeiss law This is similar to the Curie law except that the plot of χ vs T is shifted to a positive intercept TC on the temperature axis This reflects the fact that ferromagnetic materials in their paramagnetic state have a greater tendency for their spins to align in a magnetic field than an ordinary paramagnet in which the spins do not interact with each other Ferrimagnets follow the same kind of ordering behavior Typical plots of χ vs T and χ vs T for ferroferrimagnets are shown above and below Plots of χ vs T for ferromagnets ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets Antiferromagnetic solids are also paramagnetic above a critical temperature which is called the Néel temperature TN For antiferromagnets χ reaches a maximum at TN and is smaller at higher temperature where the paramagnetic spins are further disordered by thermal energy and at lower temperature where the spins pair up Typically antiferromagnets retain some positive susceptibility even at very low temperature because of canting of their paired spins However the maximum value of χ is much lower for an antiferromagnet than it is for a ferro or ferrimagnet The CurieWeiss law is also modified for an antiferromagnet reflecting the tendency of spins in the paramagnetic state above TN to resist parallel ordering A plot of χ vs T intercepts the temperature axis at a negative temperature θ and the CurieWeiss law becomes Ordering of spins below TC Below TC the spins align spontaneously in ferro and ferrimagnets Complex magnetization behavior is observed that depends on the history of the sample For example if a ferromagnetic material is cooled in the absence of an applied magnetic field it forms a mosaic structure of magnetic domains that each have internally aligned spins However neighboring domains tend to align the opposite way in order to minimize the total energy of the system This is illustrated in the figure at the left for a NdFeB magnet The sample consists of µm wide crystal grains that can be easily distinguished by the sharp boundaries in the image Within each grain are a series of lighter and darker stripes imaged by using the optical Kerr effect that are ferromagnetic domains with opposite orientations Averaged over the whole sample these domains have random orientation so the net magnetization is zero Microcrystalline grains within a piece of NdFeB the alloy used in neodymium magnets with magnetic domains made visible with a Kerr microscope The domains are the light and dark stripes visible within each grain When a sample like this one is magnetized ie exposed to a strong magnetic field the domain walls move and the favorably aligned domains grow at the expense of those with the opposite orientation This transformation can be seen in real time in the Kerr microscope The domain walls are typically hundreds of atoms wide so movement of a domain wall involves a cooperative tilting of spin orientation analogous to the wave in a sports stadium and is a relatively low energy process The movement of domain walls in a grain of silicon steel is driven in this movie by increasing the external magnetic field in the downward direction and is imaged using a Kerr microscope White areas are domains with their magnetization directed up dark areas which eventually comprise the entire grain are domains with their magnetization directed down The process of magnetization moves the solid away from its lowest energy state random domain orientation so magnetization involves input of energy When the external magnetic field is removed the domain walls relax somewhat but the solid especially in the case of a hard magnet can retain much of its magnetization If you have ever magnetized a nail or a paper clip by using a permanent magnet what you were doing was moving the walls of the magnetic domains inside the ferromagnet The object thereafter retains the memory of its magnetization However annealing a permanent magnet destroys the magnetization by returning the system to its lowest energy state in which all the magnetic domains cancel each other Rotation of orientation and increase in size of magnetic domains in response to an externally applied magnetic field Magnetic hysteresis Cycling a ferro or ferrimagnetic material in a magnetic field results in hysteresis in the magnetization of the material as shown in the figure at the left At the beginning the magnetization is zero but it begins to rise rapidly as the magnetic field is applied At high field the magnetic domains are aligned and the magnetization is said to be saturated When the field is removed a certain remanent magnetization indicated as the point Br on the graph is retained ie the material is magnetized Applying a field in the opposite direction begins to orient the magnetic domains in the other direction and at a field Hc the coercive field the magnetization of the sample is reduced to zero Eventually the material reaches saturation in the opposite direction and when the field is removed again it has remanent magnetization Br but in the opposite direction As the field continues to reverse the magnet follows the hysteresis loop as indicated by the arrows The area of colored region inside the loop is proportional to the magnetic work done in each cycle When the field cycles rapidly for example in the core of a transformer or in readwrite cycles of a magnetic disk this work is turned into heat Magnetization of a ferro or ferrimagnet vs applied magnetic field H Starting at the origin the upward curve is the initial magnetization curve The downward curve after saturation along with the lower return curve form the main loop The intercepts Hc and Br are the coercivity and remanent magnetization Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub of the

Lewis Pairs Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers A frustrated Lewis pair FLP is a compound or mixture that contains a Lewis acid and a Lewis base which because of steric hindrance cannot combine to form a classical adduct Many kinds of FLPs have been devised and their reactivity towards other molecules has been broadly developed The hydrogen adduct of the original FLP a phosphoniumborate salt can be prepared by combining a phenylene bridged phosphinoborane and dihydrogen The salt which is colorless is stable in the presence of air and moisture It releases molecular H when heated above C This reactivity is remarkable considering the strength of the HH bond kJmol Absorption and release of hydrogen from FLP The discovery that some FLPs can split H triggered the rapid growth of research into FLPs Because of their unquenched reactivity such systems are reactive toward substrates that can undergo heterolysis For example many FLPs split the hydrogen molecule This reactivity suggested that FLPs can be useful for hydrogenation reactions A sizable range of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic reactions have now been developed using FLPs Mixtures of sterically hindered Lewis acids and bases also can act as FLPs One successful strategy is to mix sterically hindered triarylphosphines with triarylboranes Small molecules such as CO and ethylene can then form a bridge between the phosphine Lewis base and borane Lewis acid eg Because FLPs behave at the same time as both nucleophiles and electrophiles they can effect the ringopening of cyclic ethers such as

ContractionReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswersContributors Every atom is different in its number of protons its mass and its size The size of the atoms is determined by the size of their orbitals The larger the quantum number n is the larger the orbital is which increases the size of the atom Introduction Each atom has different number of orbitals These orbitals differ in size depending on where they are on the periodic table The size of the orbitals determines the atomic radius for each atom As you go down a group the quantum number n increases meaning that the size of the orbital and the atomic radius increases as well Relation to Quantum Numbers Every atom has four quantum numbers but the only one that matters in the size of the atom is the quantum number n As n increases so does the size of the orbital As n decreaes the size of the orbital decreases as well Size of Orbitals and Atomic Radii The size of the orbital determines the radius of an atom As you go down a group on the periodic table the size of the orbital increases meaning the atomic radius increases as well The increase of size in the orbital is due to the increase of the quantum number n The size of the orbital and the atomic radii decreases as you go across a period from left to right This is due to the fact that as you go from left to right across a period the number of protons increase as well as the number of electrons The more electrons there are the closer they are to the nucleus due to the stronger interactions between them which decreases the size of the orbital and the atomic radius Figure General Trend of how the radius change within the Periodic Table Cations and Anions The atomic radii of cations and anions follow a different trend compared to the neutral atoms Cations have less electrons than their neutral atoms Since there are less electrons they are more attracted to the increased positvie charge at the nucleus The electrons pack themselves closely to the nucleus which leads to a decrease in the atomic radius Anions have more electrons than their neutral atoms Because there are more electrons repulsion within that ion is high The repulsion between electrons cause the electrons to spread out as far away from each other as possible The spreading of the electrons within the orbital increases the atomic radius Lanthanide Contraction Lanthanide contraction decreases the atomic radii starting from the lanthanide series The decrease in atomic radii is due to the poor shielding of the f electrons References Housecroft Catherine E and Sharpe Alan G

is formed by one silicon atom and two oxygen atoms with two sets of doubles bonds and single bonds Because of its main component glass silicon dioxide is a very common and important molecule in the construction industry One of the forms of silicon dioxide is quartz which is found in sand The Structure of Silica SiO is a dimensional structure and comes from the tetrahedral structure SiO Each of the Silicon atoms are connected to each other with an oxygen atom which creates a diamond type network All forms of SiO possess a dimensional shape and has a diamond structure The bonding angle of

for each of the different forms of SiO Forms that have alpha are at low temperature while forms with beta are at high temperature The structure of the different forms of SiO is important because it gives each of the different forms of SiO different characteristics and functions Commercially SiO is very important in steel electronic and semiconductor industries because of its structure SiO is able to undergo rapid temperature changes and still maintain its shape and structure Different Forms of Silica and Their Uses There are many different forms of SiO which mainly derived quartz glass

and ionic radiiLattice enthalpyMadelung constantd Structure of metal crystalsIonic CrystalRadius ratioVariation of the solid structure expression Two parameters radii and the electron attracting power of atoms or ions determine the bonding structure and reaction of elementary substances and compounds Much effort has been devoted to finding numerical values for these two factors applicable to all materials It is hoped that the chemical properties of a known compound and of a still nonexistent new material can be predicted with a combination of suitable numerical values Firstly geometrical factors will be described Table Atomic radii pm H Li Be B C N O F Na Mg Al Si P S Cl K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Cs Ba La Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Atomic and ionic radii The electron density in atoms gradually approaches but never reaches zero as the distance from the nucleus increases Therefore strictly speaking the radius of an atom or ion is indeterminable However it is possible to determine the bond distance between atomic nuclei experimentally Atomic radii determined experimentally are one of the most important atomic parameters describing the structural chemistry of compounds It is reasonable to define the metal radius of a bulk metal as half of the distance between metal atoms Half of the distance between atoms is defined also as the covalent radius of a covalent elementary substance Table Table Ionic radii in pm Li Be B N O F Na Mg Al P S Cl K Ca Ga As Se Br Rb Sr In Te I Cs Ba Tl Numbers in parentheses are the coordination number of the ions Since the cations and anions of different elements in an ionic compound are bonded by electrostatic interactions the bond distance is the sum of ionic radii assigned to the cation and anion The standard ionic radius of one species is fixed first and is then subtracted from the distance between ions to decide the radius of the partner ion As the standard the radius of O ion in a number of oxides is set to pm pm m R D Shannon Cationic radii in oxides are the difference between the bond distance and pm After cation radii in oxides are decided other anion radii can be calculated by subtraction of the cation radii from the distances between the atoms in ionic compounds By applying such methods to many ionic compounds ionic radii have been compiled in such a way that experimental and calculated values are generally consistent Table Even ionic compounds have some covalent contribution and it is not expected that calculated and experimental bond distances will agree exactly Even if the ionic radius assigned to a standard ion is changed we can still compile a set of ionic radii that are consistent across many compounds Other examples of the proposed radii of O ion are pm V M Goldschmidt or pm J C Slater We must also be mindful that the cationanion distances of the same ion pair become larger as the coordination number of opposite ions increases Therefore in any discussion of the structural features of ionic compounds from a viewpoint of ionic radii a set of the ionic radii calculated using the same standard radius for the compounds with the same coordination number should be used Exercise Which ionic radius is larger Cs or F Answer Cs pm F pm The anion radius is not always larger The metal and covalent radii also called the atomic radii become smaller in the same period of the periodic table as the group of the element goes to the right and then increase again in the next period The lanthanide contraction is responsible for the th period d elements having almost the same atomic radii as those of the th period d ones In the periodic table the lanthanide elements are inserted before the d elements The atomic radii of lanthanide elements decrease noticeably as the effective nuclear charge increases because the screening effects of the f orbitals of lanthanide elements are weak due to their orbital shapes Consequently the atomic radii of the elements following lanthanides are very similar to those of the d elements Lattice enthalpy Although the stability of a crystal at constant temperature and pressure depends on the Gibbs free energy change of the crystals formation from its constituent ions the stability of a crystal is determined mostly by the enthalpy change alone since the lattice formation is very exothermic and the entropy term is negligibly small refer to Section Lattice enthalpy is defined as the standard enthalpy change of the reaction in which an ionic crystal decomposes into gaseous ions s is solid g is gas and L is lattice Lattice enthalpy is indirectly calculated from the values of the enthalpy change at each stage using a BornHaber cycle Figure Namely a closed cycle is formed using enthalpy data standard enthalpy of formation of an ionic crystal from elements sublimation enthalpy of an elementary solid or atomization enthalpy Ηion which is the sum of the ionization enthalpy of cation formation and electron acquisition enthalpy of anion formation Lattice enthalpy is calculated using the relation that enthalpy change in a cycle is zero Figure BornHaber cycle of KCl Madelung constant The total Coulomb potential energy that exists between the ions in an ionic crystal consisting of ions A and B should be the sum of the individual Coulomb potential energies Vab Since the locations of the ions in the crystal lattice are decided by the structure type the total Coulomb potential between all ions is calculated by setting the distance between the ions to d A is the Madelung constant that is characteristic of each crystal type Table NA is Avogadros constant and zA and zB are the electric charges of the cation and anion The electrostatic interaction between contiguous ions is the strongest and the Madelung constant generally becomes larger as the coordination number increases Because the electrical charges have opposite signs the potential becomes negative indicating the stabilization that accompanies the formation of a crystal lattice from well dispersed gaseous phase ions Although it is generally true that the lowest electrostatic potential leads to the most stable structure this is not strictly correct since there are also other interactions to consider Table Madelung constants Structural type A Rocksalt Cesium chloride Sphalerite Wurtzite Fluorite Rutile The second largest factor that contributes to the lattice enthalpy is the van der Waals force and dispersion forces or the London interaction is the main origin of this force It is an attractive interaction between electric dipoles which is inversely proportional to the th power of the distance d between ions The van der Waals force is very small The value of the constant C is a function of each compound Since it is at most of the Coulombic force it may be safely neglected in the calculation of lattice enthalpy d Structure of metal crystals If we imagine metal atoms as being hard balls when densely packed in two dimensions each ball will be in contact with six other balls A When another layer of this dimensional arrangement is placed on top of the first the packing will be densest and the structure most energetically stable when the metal atoms are placed on top of the hollows B of the first layer When a rd layer is placed on top of the nd layer there are two possibilities Namely the rd layer A overlaps with the st layer A or the rd layer C overlaps with neither A nor B The ABABtype packing is called hexagonally closepacked hcp Figure and the ABCABCtype is called cubic closepacked ccp Figure In both cases each ball is surrounded by balls that is it is coordinated The coordination polyhedron of hcp is anticubooctahedron Figure Hexagonally closepacked hcp of balls Figure Cubic closepacked ccp of balls and that of ccp is cubooctahedron When the lattice is sliced in different planes the unit lattice of ccp appears to be a facecentered cubic lattice fcc containing a ball at each cubical apex and on the center of each face Figure The unit lattice of hcp is a rhombohedral prism in which two balls are located in the positions shown in Figure There are several different modes of piling up layers other than the normal hcp and ccp and many examples are known Figure Different expressions of cubic closepacked Figure Different expressions of hexagonally closepacked The lattice with another ball at the center of a cubic lattice consisting of eight balls is the body centered cubic lattice bcc and some metals assume this mode of packing The ratio of space occupation in a bcc lattice is smaller than that of closepacked ones but the difference is not large Although the central ball is formally coordinated it is essentially coordinated since there are a further six balls only more distant than the first eight balls However because of the smaller ratio of space occupation bcc appears relatively rarely and pure metals tend to adopt hcp or ccp In both hcp and ccp the cavities among the balls are either the Oh holes enclosed octahedrally by six balls or the Td holes enclosed tetrahedrally by four balls Figure Oh and Td are the symmetry symbols used in group theory In ionic solids if the anions are in hcp or ccp arrangements cations enter into either of these cavities Figure Octahedral and tetrahedral holes Ionic Crystal In ionic crystals such as metal halides oxides and sulfides metal cations and anions are aligned alternately and the solid is bound together mainly by electrostatic bonding Many metal halides dissolve in polar solvents eg sodium chloride NaCl dissolves in water whereas metal oxides and sulfides in which there is a significant contribution of covalent bonding are usually insoluble even in the most polar of solvents The fundamental structure of ionic crystals is that larger ions usually anions are closepacked and smaller ions usually cations enter into the octahedral or tetrahedral cavities between them Ionic crystals are classified into several typical structures according to the kinds of cations and anions involved and their ionic radii Each structure type is called by the name of the typical compound just as the rock salt structure representing the structures of not only NaCl rock salt but also various other compounds Representative structure types of solid compounds and examples belonging to each type are shown in Table Table Crystal types of solidstate compounds Crystal type Coordination number Examples of compounds Rocksalt LiCl NaCl KBr RbI AgCl MgO NiO InP Cesium chloride CsCl CsBr CsI CuZn Sphalerite ZnS CdS HgS CuCl GaP Fluorite CaF SrF CdF ZrO UO Rutile TiO SnO RuO NiF Cadmium iodide CdI CoI MgOH Rhenium oxide ReO WO ScOH Perovskite CaTiO BaTiO SrTiO Rocksalt structure Sodium chloride NaCl is a typical compound in which Cl anions are arranged in ccp and Na cations occupy all the octahedral holes Oh holes Figure Each Na cation is surrounded by six Cl anions The same structure results even if the positions of anions and cations are exchanged In the case of the reversed structure each Cl anion is surrounded by six Na cations Namely each ion is coordinated and it is convenient to describe the structure as the structure The number of ions in a unit lattice is calculated by summing up the ions shown in Figure Since there is one ion inside the lattice the ions on the faces of the lattice are shared by on the edges by and on the corners by lattices a net of Cl ions belonging to the unit lattice of NaCl is obtained by multiplying the numbers of ions inside the lattice by on the faces by on the edges by and on the corners by The number of Na ions in the unit lattice is also and the ratio of Cl and Na ions agrees with the formula NaCl Figure Rocksalt structure Cesium chloride structure Cesium chloride CsCl is a typical example of the structure shown in Figure There is a Cs ion at the center and eight Cl are located at the eight corners of the cube Conversely even if a Cl comes to the center and eight Cs come to the corners the number of each ion in the unit lattice is the same Thus this is referred to as the structure Since there is one Cs and one Cl ion belonging to this unit lattice it coincides with the formula CsCl Figure Cesium chloride structure Zinc blende structure Zinc blende has the composition ZnS and its unit lattice is shown in Figure S anions are arranged in ccp and Zn cations occupy half of the tetrahedral holes Td holes In this arrangement each cation is coordinated by four anions and each anion by four cations Hence this is a structure There are both four Zn and S ions belonging to this unit lattice and the atomic ratio coincides with the formula of ZnS Figure Zinc blende structure Fluorite structure The composition of fluorite is CaF Since the number of F is twice that of Ca all the tetrahedral holes of Ca arranged in ccp are occupied by F as shown in Figure There are four Ca and eight F ions and the number of ions is times the formula The antifluorite structure exchanges the cations and anions and is exemplified by potassium oxide KO etc Figure Fluorite structure Exercise How many cations and anions are there in a unit lattice of zinc blende structure Answer All four cations are included in a unit lattice The anions occupy the corners and faces and the number is x x Radius ratio Generally the total Coulombic potential energy Ec of the univalent ionic compound MX is expressed by the following formula NA is the Avogadro constant A the Madelung constant and R the distance between ions According to this formula a structure with a larger A R ratio is more stable The Madelung constant of an MX compound increases with increasing coordination number On the other hand it is advantageous to lower the coordination number and to reduce R in the case of small M rendering contact between M and X more difficult In an ionic crystal the ratio of rM and rX with the anions contacting each other and also with the cations depends on the coordination number In a partial structure consisting only of anions the anions form a coordination polyhedron around a cation The anionic radius rX is one half of the distance of the edge of the polyhedron and the distance from the cation center to an apex of the polyhedron is the sum of the anion and cation radii rX rM The coordination polyhedron of the CsCl structure is a cube the NaCl structure an octahedron and the ZnS structure a tetrahedron The distance from the center of each polyhedron to an apex is fracsqrt r_X Therefore the ratios of the cationic and anionic radii rM rX are fracsqrt r_X r_Xr_X sqrt for CsCl fracsqrt r_X r_Xr_X sqrt for NaCl and fracfracsqrt r_X r_Xr_x fracsqrt for ZnS structures Figure It has been explained that the coordination number decreases when these radius ratios are smaller than the given values since cations and anions do not come into contact with each other causing instability On the other hand the coordination number increases for larger cations increasing the radius ratio However the relation between a coordination number and a radius ratio is not simple For example halides of alkali metals adopt the NaCl structures at normal temperatures except cesium chloride CsCl cesium bromide CsBr and cesium iodide CsI It is not possible to assume structure types from the radius ratios even in the case of simple ionic compounds like alkali metal halides However the qualitative trend that smaller cations have smaller coordination numbers is generally correct Figure The radius ratio rM rX of cations and anions Variation of the solid structure expression Many solidstate inorganic compounds have complicated threedimensional structures Different structural illustrations for the same compound help our understanding of its structure In the case of complicated inorganic compounds drawing bond lines between atoms as in most organic compounds causes confusion The anions in many metal oxides sulfides or halides form tetrahedra or octahedra around the central metal cations Although there is no bond between anions the structures are greatly simplified if they are illustrated by the anion polyhedra sharing apexes edges or faces In such illustrations cationic metal atoms are usually omitted As has been mentioned ionic solid structures can be thought of as a close packed arrays of anions Figures and illustrate these three representations for molecular phosphorus pentoxide PO PO and molybdenum pentachloride MoCl MoCl Polyhedral representations are much easier to understand for the structures of large molecules or solidstate compounds formed by an infinite number of atoms However the bond line representation is suitable for molecular compounds such as the above examples Figure Three expressions for the structure of PO Figure Three expressions for the structure of MoCl Page ID No headers Welcome to the

Especially the content of sodium Na in the Earths crust is fourth after Al Fe and Ca Although the existence of sodium or potassium ions was recognized for many years a number of attempts to isolate the metals from aqueous solutions of their salts failed because of their high reactivity with water Potassium and subsequently sodium were isolated by the electrolysis of molten salt of KOH or NaOH by H Davy in the th century Lithium Li was discovered as a new element and Davy soon isolated it by molten salt electrolysis of LiO Rubidium Rb and Cesium Cs were discovered as new elements by spectroscopy in Francium Fr was discovered using a radiochemical technique in Its natural abundance is very low Table Properties of group metals mp C bp C d C g cm E V M e I kJ mol Li Na K Rb Cs As shown in Table meltingpoints boiling points and densities of alkali metals are low and they are soft metals Since the outer shell contains only one selectron the ionization energy is very low and mono cations of alkali metals form easily Qualitative analysis of alkali metals is possible by means of flame reactions using characteristic luminescence lines Especially the orange Dline of sodium is used in the sodium lamp Alkali metals are oxidized by water evolving hydrogen gas due to their low reduction potentials Except lithium the heavier alkali metals react violently with water and sufficient caution should be exercised in their handling Exercise Describe the reactivity of alkali metals in water Answer The reactivity of lithium is the lowest sodium reacts violently and potassium rubidium and cesium react explosively Figure Structure of Nacrypt Alkali metals are also highly reactive to oxygen or halogens As alkali metals are very reducing they are used widely as reducing agents Because of the high affinity of alkali metals to halogens they are important in organic and inorganic syntheses which produce alkali metal halides as the result of condensation and metathesis reactions Although it is generally difficult to dissolve metals in solvents to make atomic dipersions alkali metals can be dispersed in liquid ammonia solutions amalgams and as cryptand Figure naphthalene or benzophenone CHCO complexes Ammonia boils at C but liquid ammonia can be easily handled Alkali metals dissolve readily in liquid ammonia and dilute solutions are blue but concentrated ones show a bronze color The metal is recovered when ammonia is evaporated from metal solutions Alkali metal solutions show the same color irrespective of the kind of alkali metals as the color is due to the solvated electrons Namely the dissolution is accompanied by the separation of the alkali metal atoms into metal cations and electrons solvated by ammonia according to the following equation The liquid ammonia solution of an alkali metal is conductive and paramagnetic The highly reducing solution is used for special reduction reactions or syntheses of alkali metal complexes and polyhalides Page ID

origin of halogen is the Greek word meaning the production of salt by direct reaction with a metal Since their reactivity is very high halogens are found in nature only as compounds The basic properties of halogens are shown in Table and Table The electron configuration of each halogen atom is nsnp and they lack one electron from the closedshell structure of a rare gas Thus a halogen atom emits energy when it gains an electron Namely the enthalpy change of the reaction X g e rightarrow X gis negative Although electron affinity is defined as the energy change of gaining an electron a positive sign is customarily used In order to be consistent with the enthalpy change a negative sign would be appropriate Table Properties of halogens Ionization energy kJ mol Electronegativity Ionic radius rX pm F Cl Br I Table Properties of halogen molecules Interatomic distance rXX pm mp C bp C Color F Colorless gas Cl Yellow green gas Br Dark red liquid I Dark violet solid The electron affinity of chlorine kJ mol is the largest and fluorine kJ mol comes between chlorine and bromine kJ mol The electronegativity of fluorine is the highest of all the halogens Since halogens are produced as metal salts simple substances are manufactured by electrolysis Fluorine only takes the oxidation number in its compounds although the oxidation number of other halogens can range from to Astatine At has no stable nuclide and little is known about its chemical properties a Manufacture of halogen Fluorine has the highest reduction potential E V and the strongest oxidizing power among the halogen molecules It is also the most reactive nonmetallic element Since water is oxidized by F at much lower electrode potential V fluorine gas cannot be manufactured by the electrolysis of aqueous solutions of fluorine compounds Therefore it was a long time before elemental fluorine was isolated and F F H Moisson finally succeeded in isolating it by the electrolysis of KF in liquid HF Fluorine is still manufactured by this reaction Chlorine which is especially important in inorganic industrial chemistry is manufactured together with sodium hydroxide The basic reaction for the production of chlorine is electrolysis of an aqueous solution of NaCl using an ion exchange process In this process chlorine gas is generated in an anodic cell containing brine and Na moves through an ion exchange membrane to the cathodic cell where it pairs with OH to become an aqueous solution of NaOH Exercise Why can chlorine be manufactured by electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride Answer Despite the higher reduction potential of chlorine V than that of oxygen V the reduction potential of oxygen can be raised overvoltage depending on the choice of electrode used for the electrolysis process Bromine is obtained by the oxidation of Br with chlorine gas in saline water Iodine is similarly produced by passing chlorine gas through saline water containing I ions Since natural gas is found in Japan together with underground saline water containing I Japan is one of the main countries producing iodine Anomalies of fluorine Molecular fluorine compounds have very low boiling points This is due to the difficulty of polarization as a result of the electrons being strongly drawn to the nuclei of fluorine atoms Since the electronegativity of fluorine is highest and electrons shift to F resulting in the high acidity of atoms bonded to F Because of the small ionic radius of F high oxidation states are stabilized and hence low oxidation compounds like CuF are unknown in contrast with the compounds such as IF and PtF Pseudohalogens Since the cyanide ion CN the azide ion N and the thiocyanate ion SCN etc form compounds similar to those of halide ions they are called pseudohalide ions They form psudohalogen molecules such as cyanogene CN hydrogen cyanide HCN sodium thiocyanate NaSCN etc Finetuning electronic and steric effects that are impossible with only halide ions make pseudohalogens useful also in transition metal complex chemistry Polyhalogens Besides the usual halogen molecules mixed halogen and polyhalogen molecules such as BrCl IBr ICl ClF BrFIF etc also exist Polyhalogen anions and cations such as I I I and I are also known b Oxygen compounds Although many binary oxides of halogens consisting only of halogen and oxygen are known most are unstable Oxygen difluoride OF is the most stable such compound This is a very powerful fluorinating agent and can generate plutonium hexafluoride PuF from plutonium metal While oxygen chloride ClO is used for bleaching pulp and water treatment it is generated in situ from ClO since it is unstable Hypochlorous acid HClO chlorous acid HClO chloric acid HClO and perchloric acid HClO are oxoacids of chlorine and especially perchloric acid is a strong oxidizing agent as well as being a strong acid Although analogous acids and ions of other halogens had been known for many years BrO was synthesized as late as Once it was prepared it turned out to be no less stable than ClO or IO causing some to wonder why it had not been synthesized before Although ClO is often used for crystallizing transition metal complexes it is explosive and should be handled very carefully c Halides of nonmetals Halides of almost all nonmetals are known including fluorides of even the inert gases krypton Kr and xenon Xe Although fluorides are interesting for their own unique characters halides are generally very important as starting compounds for various compounds of nonmetals by replacing halogens in inorganic syntheses Table Table Typical chlorides and fluorides of main group elements LiCl BeCl BF CCl NF OF NaCl MgCl AlCl SiCl PCl PCl SCl SF ClF ClF KCl CaCl ZnCl GaCl GeF GeCl AsCl AsF SeCl SeF

irritating odor and is poisonous It is widely used as an industrial catalyst for FriedelCrafts type reactions It is also used as a catalyst for cationic polymerization It exists in the gaseous phase as a triangular monomeric molecule and forms Lewis base adducts with ammonia amines ethers phosphines etc because of its strong Lewis acidity Diethylether adduct CHOBF is a distillable liquid and is used as a common reagent It is a starting compound for the preparation of diborane BH Tetrafluoroborate BF is a tetrahedral anion formed as an adduct of BF with a base F Alkali metal salts a silver salt and NOBF as well as the free acid HBF contain this anion Since its coordination ability is very weak it is used in the crystallization of cationic complexes of transition metals as a counter anion like ClO AgBF and NOBF are also useful for electron oxidation of complexes Tetrachlorosilane SiCl is a colorless liquid mp C and bp C It is a regular tetrahedral molecule and reacts violently

acid it dissolves in carbon disulfide and carbon tetrachloride It is useful for cchlorination of organic compounds Arsenic pentafluoride AsF is a colorless gas mp C and bp C It is a triangular bipyramidal molecule Although it hydrolyzes it is soluble in organic solvents As it is a strong electron acceptor it can form electron donoracceptor complexes with electron donors Sulfur hexafluoride SF is a colorless and odorless gas mp C and sublimation point C It is a hexacoordinate octahedral molecule It is chemically very stable and hardly soluble in water Because of its excellent heatresisting property incombustibility and corrosion resistance it is used as a high voltage insulator Sulfur chloride SCl is an orange liquid mp C and bp C It has a similar structure to hydrogen peroxide It is readily soluble in organic solvents It is important as an industrial inorganic compound and is used in large quantities for the vulcanization of rubber etc d Metal halides Many metal halides are made by the combination of about metallic elements and four halogens Table Table Since there are more than one oxidation state especially in transition metals several kinds of halides are known for each transition metal These halides are most important as starting materials of the preparation of metal compounds and the inorganic chemistry of metal compounds depends on metal halides There are molecular dimensional chain dimensional layer and dimensional halides but few of them are molecular in crystalline states It should be noted that the anhydrous transition metal halides are usually solid compounds and hydrates are coordination compounds with water ligands As the dimensionality of structures is one of the most interesting facets of structural or synthetic chemistry

because water reacts with halides breaking the halogen bridges in the solid structures and coordinates to the resultant molecular complexes Hard and Soft Acids and Bases Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Lewis acids and bases can be classified by designating them as hard or soft Hard AcidsBases Hard acids and bases have a high charge positive for acids negative for bases to ionic radius ratio along with higher oxidation states Hard acids are not very polarizable and have high charge densities Thus metal ions with high positive charges and smaller ionic sizes tend to be hard acids Early transition metal ions in the d series tend to be hard Lewis acids Hard bases are typically small anions and neutral molecules Some examples of hard acids and bases include H O OH F Fe and Al Soft AcidsBases Soft acids or bases have a low charge to radius ratio with low oxidation states They are normally larger ions that are polarizable For example I and S are soft bases and low charge density transition metals such as Ag are considered soft acids Soft acids often include transition metals in the second and third row of the periodic table that have a or charge as well as late transition metals especially those in the d and d series with filled or almost completely filled d orbitals Acids and bases are not strictly hard or soft with many ions and compounds being classified as intermediate For example trimethylborane Fe and Pb cations are intermediate acids and pyridine and aniline are examples of intermediate bases An element can also change its hardsoft character depending on its oxidation state The most extreme example is hydrogen where H is a hard acid and H is a soft base Ni as in the layered compound NiOOH is a hard acid but Ni as in NiCO is a soft acid The figures below show hardsoft trends for acids left and bases right in the periodic table For bases the major hardsoft discontinuity is between the nd row NOF and the rows below Hardsoft trends for acids Hardsoft trends for bases Like binds with Like Hard acids interact more strongly with hard bases than they do with soft bases and soft acids interact more strongly with soft bases than hard bases Thus the most stable complexes are those with hardhard and softsoft interactions This tendency is illustrated in the table below which shows the trend in formation constants for hard and soft acids Hard acids bind halides in the order F Cl Br I whereas soft acids follow the opposite trend Log K fluoride chloride bromide iodide acid classification Fe Hard Pb Intermediate Ag Soft Hg Soft The softest metal ion in the periodic table is Auaq It forms stable complexes with soft bases such as phosphines and CN but not with hard bases such as O or F The affinity of Au for the soft base CN is high and the resulting AuCN complex is so stable that gold which is normally very difficult to oxidize can be oxidized by oxygen in the air This reaction is used in gold mining to separate small flakes of Au from large volumes of sand and other oxides Ag is similarly dissolved by air oxidation in cyanide solutions The precious metals are then isolated from the solution using chemical reducing agents or by electroplating The use of cyanide ion on a large scale in mining however creates a potentially serious environmental hazard In a spill at Baia Mare Romania resulted in the worst environmental disaster in Europe since Chernobyl Cyanide which is highly toxic is gradually oxidized by air to the less toxic cyanate OCN ion On the laboratory scale cyanide plating solutions are typically disposed of by using bleach to oxidize CN to OCN and the metal is recovered as an insoluble chloride salt Netted solution pond next to cyanide heap leaching of gold ore near Elko Nevada The Au ion because of its higher positive charge is a harder acid than Au and can form complexes with harder bases such as HO and amines In keeping with the like binds like principle the compound AuI softsoft is stable but AuI hardsoft is unknown Conversely AuF has never been isolated but AuF hardhard is stable Hard and Soft Magnets Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Whether a ferro or ferrimagnetic material is a hard or a soft magnet depends on the strength of the magnetic field needed to align the magnetic domains This property is characterized by Hc the coercivity Hard magnets have a high coercivity Hc and thus retain their magnetization in the absence of an applied field whereas soft magnets have low values The figure at the right compares hysteresis loops for hard and soft magnets Recall that the energy dissipated in magnetizing and demagnetizing the material is proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop We can see that soft magnets while they can achieve a high value of Bsat dissipate relatively little energy in the loop This makes soft magnets preferable for use in transformer cores where the field is switched rapidly Permalloy an alloy consisting of about Fe and Ni is a soft magnet that has very high magnetic permeability µ ie a large maximum slope of the B vs H curve and a very narrow hysteresis loop Some materials such as iron metal can exist as either hard or soft magnets Whether bcc iron is a hard or soft magnet depends on the crystal grain size When crystal grains in iron are submicron size and comparable to the size of the magnetic domains then the magnetic domains are pinned by crystal grain boundaries When the magnetic domains are pinned a stronger coercive magnetic field needs to be applied to cause them to realign When iron is annealed the crystal grains grow and the magnetic domains become more free to align with applied magnetic fields This decreases the coercive field and the material becomes a soft magnet Hysteresis

two materials are comparable Hard magnets such as CrO γFeO and cobalt ferrite CoFeO are used in magnetic recording media where the high coercivity allows them to retain the magnetization state read as a logical or of a magnetic bit over long periods of time Hard magnets are also used in disk drives refrigerator magnets electric motors and other applications Drive motors for hybrid and electric

atoms such as NO and the allyl anion CHCHCH is an example of center electron πbonding Our MO treatment of ozone is entirely analogous to the electron H anion We map that solution onto this one as follows The nonbonding πorbital has a node at the central O atom This means that the nonbonding electron pair in the πsystem is shared by the two terminal O atoms ie that the formal charge is shared by those atoms This is consistent with the octet resonance structure of ozone This trick of mapping the solution for a set of sorbitals onto a πbonding problem is a simple example of a broader principle called the isolobal analogy This idea developed extensively by Roald Hoffmann at Cornell University has been used to understand bonding and reactivity in organometallic compounds In the isolobal analogy symmetry principles as illustrated above in the analogy between H and ozone are used to construct MO diagrams of complex molecules containing dfrontier orbitals from simpler molecular fragments Professor Roald Hoffmanns ideas about orbital symmetry have helped explain the bonding and reactivity of organic and organometallic molecules and also the structures and properties of extended solids The triiodide ion An analogous and seemingly more complicated case of center electron bonding is I Each I atom has valence orbitals s px py pz making a total of frontier orbitals and the I anion has electrons We can simplify the problem by recalling two periodic trends The sp orbital splitting is large relative to the bond energy after the second row of the periodic table Thus the s orbital is low in energy and too contracted to make bonds with its neighbors πoverlap of p orbitals is very weak so the px and py orbitals will also be nonbonding This leaves only the three pz orbitals to make bondingnonbondingantibonding combinations Again the problem is entirely analogous to ozone or H Counting orbitals we obtain lone pairs from the nonbonding s px and py orbitals as well as one bond and one lone pair from the pz orbital combinations above The total of nonbonding pairs and one bond accounts for the electrons in the ion The nonbonding pz pair is localized on the terminal I atoms giving each a formal charge This MO description is entirely consistent with the octet nobond resonance picture of I that we developed in Chapter Homonuclear Diatomic Molecules

the largest at the center and reduces exponentially at larger distance The function is known as the s atomic orbital Hydrogen has more than one ground state exists in which is said to be degenerate The ground state wavefunction is ψsrπaera Since the probability density is ψsr therefore ρsrψsrπaera Next we need to consider that ρs is in spherical coordinates dVrsinφdr dθ dφ and then multiplied by

universe It is next to oxygen and silicon and about wt of all the elements on the Earth Needless to say most hydrogen exists as water on the Earth Since its polarity may change freely between hydride H atom H and proton H hydrogen also forms various compounds with many elements including oxygen and carbon Therefore hydrogen is highly important in chemistry Of the three kinds of isotopes of hydrogen deuterium D was discovered by H C Urey and others in and subsequently tritium T was prepared from deuterium in About of hydrogen is present as deuterium and this can be enriched by electrolysis of water Tritium is a radioactive isotope emitting particles with a halflife of years Since the mass of deuterium and tritium is about twice and three times that of hydrogen respectively the physical properties of the isotopes and compounds containing them differ considerably Some properties of the isotopes and water are listed in Table When the EH bond in a hydrogen compound is converted into the ED by deuterium substitution the EH stretching frequency in an infrared spectrum is reduced to about which is useful for determining the position of the hydrogen atom It is sometimes possible to conclude that scission of the bond with a hydrogen is the ratedetermining step when the deuterium substitution shows a marked effect on the rate of reaction of a hydrogencontaining compound Since the nuclear spin of hydrogen is and given its abundance it is the most important nuclide for NMR spectroscopy NMR is widely used not only for identification of organic compounds but also for medical diagnostic purposes using MRI magnetic resonance imaging of water in living bodies Human organs can now be observed with this noninvasive method Table Properties

state Spins of orthohydrogen are parallel and the sum is resulting in a triplet state Since parahydrogen is in a lower energy state it is the stabler form at low temperatures The theoretical ratio of parahydrogen is at K but it decreases to about at room temperature since the ratio of orthohydrogen increases at higher temperatures Gas chromatography and rotational lines in the electronic band

Nonaqueous Media Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The Brønsted theory encompasses any type of solvent that can donate and accept ions not just aqueous solutions The strength of an acid or a base varies depending on the solvent Nonaqueous acidbase chemistry follows similar rules to those developed for acids and bases in water For example in liquid ammonia the solvent autodissociates in the reaction This equilibrium is analogous to the autodissociation of water but has a smaller equilibrium constant K It follows by analogy to water that NH is the strongest acid and NH is the strongest base that can exist in liquid ammonia Because ammonia is a basic solvent it enhances the acidity and suppresses the basicity of substances dissolved in it For example the ammonium ion NH is a weak acid in water Ka x but it is a strong acid in ammonia Similarly acetic acid is weak in water but strong in ammonia Solvent leveling in fact makes CHCOOH and NHCl both strong acids in ammonia where they have equivalent acid strength Strong acids that are leveled in water have different acid strengths in acidic solvents such as HF or anhydrous acetic acid For example acid dissociation of HX in acetic acid CHCOOH involves protonating the solvent to make its conjugate acid CHCOOH and the X anion Because CHCOOH is a stronger acid that HO the anion X which is a spectator in water can become a weak base in CHCOOH It follows that acidic solvents magnify the Brønsted basicities of substances that cannot accept protons in water Conversely basic solvents magnify the acidity of substances that cannot donate a proton to The acidity and basicity of nonaqueous solvents is difficult to quantify precisely but one good relative measure is the Hammett acidity function which is defined analogously to pH according to the HendersonHasselbach equation For nonaqueous solvents or for acidic or basic compounds in dissolved in solvents that do not themselves dissociate Ho is a rough measure of the pH of the solvent or compound in question Anhydrous HF and HSO have Ho values of approximately and respectively Ionic Lattices Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Topic hierarchy Ionic Liquids Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Ionic Radii and Radius Ratios Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Radius ratio rules Atoms in crystals are held together by electrostatic forces van der Waals interactions and covalent bonding It follows that arrangements of atoms that can maximize the strength of these attractive interactions should be most favorable and lead to the most commonly observed crystal structures Radius ratio rules Early crystallographers had trouble solving the structures of inorganic solids using Xray diffraction because some of the mathematical tools for analyzing the data had not yet been developed Once a trial structure was proposed it was relatively easy to calculate the diffraction pattern but it was difficult to go the other way from the diffraction pattern to the structure if nothing was known a priori about the arrangement of atoms in the unit cell It was and still is important to develop some guidelines for guessing the coordination numbers and bonding geometries of atoms in crystals The first such rules were proposed by Linus Pauling who considered how one might pack together oppositely charged spheres of different radii Pauling proposed from geometric considerations that the quality of the fit depended on the radius ratio of the anion and the cation Atomic and Ionic Radii Note that cations are always smaller than the neutral atom pink of the same element whereas anions are larger Going from left to right across any row of the periodic table neutral atoms and cations contract in size because of increasing nuclear charge click for larger image The basic idea of radius ratio rules is illustrated at the right We consider that the anion is the packing atom in the crystal and the smaller cation fills interstitial sites holes Cations will find arrangements in which they can contact the largest number of anions If the cation can touch all of its nearest neighbor anions as shown at the right for a small cation in contact with larger anions then the fit is good If the cation is too small for a given site that coordination number will be unstable and it will prefer a lower coordination structure The table below gives the ranges of cationanion radius ratios that give the best fit for a given coordination geometry Critical Radius Ratio This diagram is for coordination number six anions in the plane are shown is above the plane and is below The stability limit is at rCrA Coordination number Geometry ρ rcationranion linear triangular tetrahedral square planar octahedral cubic cuboctahedral There are unfortunately several challenges with using this idea to predict crystal structures We dont know the radii of individual ions Atoms in crystals are not really ions there is a varying degree of covalency depending electronegativity differences Bond distances and therefore ionic radii depend on bond strength and coordination number remember Paulings rule Dn D log n Ionic radii depend on oxidation state higher charge smaller cation size larger anion size We can build up a table of ionic radii by assuming that the bond length is the sum of the radii r r if the ions are in contact in the crystal Consider for example the compounds MgX and MnX where X O S Se All of these compounds crystallize in the NaCl structure For the two larger anions S and Se the unit cell dimensions are the same for both cations This suggests that the anions are in contact in these structures From geometric considerations the anion radius in this case is given by and thus the radii of the S and Se ions are and Å respectively Once the sizes of these anions are fixed we can obtain a selfconsistent set of cation and anion radii from the lattice constants of many MX compounds How well does this model work Lets consider the structures of tetravalent metal oxides MO using Pauling radii and the predictions of the radius ratio model Oxide MO Radius ratio Predicted coord no Observed coord no structure CO linear molecule SiO various tetrahedral structures GeO silicalike structures rutile TiO rutile ZrO baddleyite fluorite ThO fluorite Note that cations have different radii depending on their coordination numbers and thus different radius ratios are calculated for Ge with coordination numbers and and for Zr with coordination numbers and For this series of oxides the model appears to work quite well The correct coordination number is predicted in all cases and borderline cases such as GeO and ZrO are found in structures with different coordination numbers The model also correctly predicts the structures of BeF SiO type MgF rutile and CaF fluorite What about the alkali halides NaCl KBr LiI CsF etc All of them have the NaCl structure except for CsCl CsBr and CsI which have the CsCl structure In this case the radius ratio model fails rather badly The Li salts LiBr and LiI are predicted to have tetrahedral structures and KF is predicted to have an structure like CsCl We can try adjusting the radii eg making the cations larger and anions smaller but the best we can do with the alkali halides is predict about half of their structures correctly Since the alkali halides are clearly ionic compounds this failure suggests that there is something very wrong with the radius ratio model and its success with MO compounds was coincidental In addition to the radius ratio rule Linus Pauling developed other useful rules that are helpful in rationalizing and also predicting the structures of inorganic compounds Paulings rules state that Stable structures are locally electroneutral For example in the structure of the double perovskite SrFeMoO MO M Fe Mo octahedra share all their vertices and Sr ions fill the cubooctahedral cavities that are flanked by eight MO octahedra Each O ion is coordinated to one Fe and one Mo ion in order to achieve local electroneutrality and thus the FeO and MoO octahedra alternate in the structure Cationcation repulsion should be minimized Anion polyhedra can share vertices as in the perovskite structure without any energetic penalty Shared polyhedral edges and especially shared faces cause cationcation repulsion and should be avoided For example in rutile the most stable polymorph of TiO the TiO octahedra share vertices and two opposite edges forming ribbons in the structure In anatase TiO each octahedron shares four edges so the anatase polymorph is less thermodynamically stable Highly charged cations in anion polyhedra tend not to share edges or even vertices especially when the coordination number is low For example in orthosilicates such as olivine MSiO there are isolated SiO tetrahedra Structure of olivine M Mg or Fe blue spheres Si pink tetrahedra O red spheres As we will soon see all of Paulings rules are justified on the basis of lattice energy considerations In ionic compounds the arrangement of atoms that maximizes anioncation interactions while minimizing cationcation and anionanion contacts is energetically the best Ionization Energies and Electron Affinities Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionIonization EnergyElectron AffinitiesExothermic vs endothermic processPeriodic TrendReferencesOutside Links Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron away from an atom which can be written as IE On the periodic table the IE of an atom decreases as you descend from a group and increases as you go across a period also as each molecular orbital is filled or half filled Electron affinity on the other hand is the energy released when an electron is added to the atom On the periodic table electron affinity usually decreases down a group and increases across a period Although these trends often hold truth there are some exceptions to these patterns Introduction Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from its molecular orbital The nth ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the nth electron The ionization energy can predict the atoms reactivity Atoms with lower ionization energies easily lose their valence electrons and become cations which will react with anions to from ionic bonds Ionization Energy The ionization energy is usually determined experimentally It is the energy needed to remove a valence electron off of its molecular orbital of the atom in its neutral state An equation to demonstrate it is shown below X g X g e Example of IE of Magnesium Mgg Mgg e I kJmol IE stands for the first ionization energy the energy the atom requires to expel the first electron from its orbital Similarly the second ionization energy will be the energy needed to expel the second electron Mgg Mgg e I kJmol However IE of Magnesium will be larger than that of IE because it is not energetically favorable to separate an electron from a positively charged ion The general pattern of the ionization energy as they are in regard to the period table is that the IE increases across a period and decreases down a group Because it requires more energy to remove an electron from a stable atom the noble gases are usually associated with the highest IE Because their valence shells are already filled and stablized they will require much more energy to disrupt that stability The first electron that is expelled is the most loosely held to the atom On the other hand the group elements are usually associated with the lowest IE Since only one electron occupies the valence shell of these atoms it will be more energetically favorable for them to lose the electron in order to achieve a full orbital shell However there are few exceptions The IE decreases when crossing from element in group to the element in group The group has halffilled electronic configuration ns np This type of configuration is very stable its hard to remove electron from valence shell Therefore element in group requires greater value of IE than group Another exception is that going from Be group to B group the IE decreases because Be has the filled shell s which is more stable than the electronic configuration of B s p Hence Be will require more IE than B Similarly the IE decreases when going from elements in group to group Electron Affinities Electron affinity often abbreviated as EA is the energy released when an electron is added to a valence shell of the atom Fg e Fg EA kJmol When an electron is added to an atom energy is given off This process is exothermic Atoms like the noble gases will not gain an electron because they are already in their most stable state with a full shell Atoms like F will most likely gain an electron because when a free electron is added to the outer shell of fluorine it will have obtained a full shell Generally atoms increasing across a period will increase in EA also Exothermic vs endothermic process Og e Og EA kJmol Og e Og EA kJmol When an electron is added to an atom the energy change is exothermic because of the attraction of the electron to the nucleus However in the case of EA where the electron is added to an anion the repulsion between the anion and this newly added electron will overwhelm the attraction of the electron to the nucleus Therefore this process will be endothermic as opposed to EA Periodic Trend The general trend of IE and EA along a periodic table References Vedeneyer Vladimir Ivanovich Bond Energies Ionization Potentials and

iron has the BCC structure and is a tough hard metal tough as nails Above oC pure iron switches over to the FCC austenite structure which is much more ductile So hot iron can be bent and worked into a variety of shapes when it is very hot but still solid it melts at oC Rapid quenching of hot iron eg when the blacksmith plunges a red hot piece directly into cold water cools it to room temperature but doesnt allow time for the FCC BCC phase transition to occur therefore such pieces are still relatively malleable and can be shaped The ironiron carbide FeFeC phase diagram Below C pure iron exists as the alpha phase ferrite which has the BCC structure Between and C pure iron exists as the gamma phase austenite which has the FCC structure Carbon is more soluble in the FCC phase which occupies area γ on the phase diagram than it is in the BCC phase The percent carbon determines the type of iron alloy that is formed upon cooling from the FCC phase or from liquid iron alpha iron carbon steel pearlite or cast iron Carbon is added about by weight to iron to make carbon steel which is a very hard material Carbon is rather soluble in the FCC phase of iron but not in the BCC phase Therefore when the ductile FCC phase cools and turns into BCC tempering the steel which means cooling it slowly enough so the FCC to BCC transformation can occur the iron can no longer dissolve the excess carbon The carbon forms layers or grains of an extra phase FeC cementite a very hard material which are layered or dotted throughout the matrix of BCC iron grains The effect of all these little grains of FeC is to stop the motion of dislocations making for a harder but with higher carbon content increasingly brittle material This is why knives and swords are quenched from the FCC phase cold worked into the appropriate shapes and then heated up again and tempered before they are sharpened when they are made Cast iron objects frying pans radiators etc have a higher carbon content and are therefore very strong but tend to fracture rather than bend because of the larger fraction of the brittle FeC phase in the alloy Upon cooling high carbon steels phase segregate into a mixture of bcc

Save as PDF Page ID No headers The JahnTeller effect sometimes also known as JahnTeller distortion describes the geometrical distortion of molecules and ions that is associated with certain electron configurations This electronic effect is named after Hermann Arthur Jahn and Edward Teller who proved using group theory that orbitally degenerate molecules cannot be stable The JahnTeller theorem essentially states that any nonlinear molecule with a spatially degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the molecule JahnTeller distortion of a d octahedral transition metal complex The tetragonal distortion lengthens the bonds along the zaxis as the bonds in the xy plane become shorter This change lowers the overall energy because the two electrons in the dz orbital go down in energy as the one electron in the dxy orbital goes up We can understand this effect in the context of octahedral metal complexes by considering delectron configurations in which the eg orbital set contains one or three electrons The most common of these are high spin d eg CrF low spin d egNaNiO and d eg Cu If the complex can distort to break the symmetry then one of the formerly degenerate eg orbitals will go down in energy and the other will go up More electrons will occupy the lower orbital than the upper one resulting in an overall lowering of the electronic energy A similar distortion can occur in tetrahedral complexes when the t orbitals are partially filled Such geometric distortions that lower the electronic energy are said to be electronically driven Similar electronically driven distortions occur in onedimensional chain compounds where they are called Peierls distortions and in twodimensionally bonded sheets where they are called charge density waves The JahnTeller effect is most often encountered in octahedral complexes especially sixcoordinate copperII complexes The d electronic configuration of this ion gives three electrons in the two degenerate eg orbitals leading to a doubly degenerate electronic ground state Such complexes distort along one of the molecular fourfold axes always labelled the z axis which has the effect of removing the orbital and electronic degeneracies and lowering the overall energy The distortion normally takes the form of elongating the bonds to the ligands lying along the z axis but occasionally occurs as a shortening of these bonds instead the JahnTeller theorem does not predict the direction of the distortion only the presence of an unstable geometry When such an elongation occurs the effect is to lower the electrostatic repulsion between the electronpair on the Lewis basic ligand and any electrons in orbitals with a z component thus lowering the energy of the complex If the undistorted complex would be expected to have an inversion center this is preserved after the distortion The JahnTeller effect is responsible for the tetragonal distortion of the hexaaquacopperII complex ion CuOH which might otherwise possess octahedral geometry The two axial CuO distances are Å whereas the four equatorial CuO distances are Å In octahedral complexes the JahnTeller effect is most pronounced when an odd number of electrons occupy the eg orbitals This situation arises in complexes with the configurations d lowspin d or highspin d complexes all of which have doubly degenerate ground states In such compounds the eg orbitals involved in the degeneracy point directly at the ligands so distortion can result in a large energetic stabilization Strictly speaking the effect also occurs when there is a degeneracy due to the electrons in the tg orbitals ie configurations such as d or d both of which are triply degenerate In such cases however the effect is much less noticeable because there is a much smaller lowering of repulsion on taking ligands further away from the tg orbitals which do not point directly at the ligands see the table below The same is true in tetrahedral complexes eg manganate distortion is very subtle because there is less stabilisation to be gained because the ligands are not pointing directly at the orbitals The expected effects for octahedral coordination are given in the following table JahnTeller effect Number of d electrons HighLow Spin HS LS HS LS HS LS HS LS Strength of JT Effect w w s w w w w s s w weak JahnTeller effect tg orbitals unevenly occupied s strong JahnTeller effect expected eg orbitals unevenly occupied blank no JahnTeller effect expected The JahnTeller effect is manifested in the UVVIS absorbance spectra of some compounds where it often causes splitting of bands It is readily apparent in the structures of many copperII complexes Additional detailed information about the anisotropy of such complexes and the nature of the ligand binding can be obtained from the fine structure of the lowtemperature electron spin resonance spectra The CuII ion can also coordinate five water molecules in an elongated square pyramid with four CuOeq bonds x Å and x Å and a long CuOax bond Å The four equatorial ligands are distorted from the mean equatorial plane

clear that the lattice energy EL of an ionic crystal can be calculated with reasonable accuracy if the structure is known But how can we calculate EL for a new or hypothetical compound of unknown structure Recall that the reduced Madelung constant is about the same for different crystal structures Russian chemist A F Kapustinskii recognized this fact and devised a formula that allows one to calculate EL for any compound if we know the univalent radii of the constituent ions The Madelung constant A is proportional to the number of ions n in formula unit so dividing by the n gives similar values as shown in the table below An invariant Structure An NaCl CsCl Rutile Fluorite Kapustinskii noticed that the difference in ionic radii between M and M the monovalent vs divalent radius largely compensates for the differences in An between monovalent NaCl CsCl and divalent rutile CaF structures He thus arrived at a lattice energy formula using an average Madelung constant corrected to monovalent radii In the Kapustinskii formula the lattice energy kJmol is given by Here the sum of the monovalent radii is used in place of ro the bond distance in the BornMayer equation The beauty of this formula is that it requires no knowledge of the structure of the compound Therefore it can be used in combination with BornHaber cycles to predict the stability of unknown compounds As we show below this is a broadly useful tool in guiding syntheses and predicting the reactivity of inorganic solids Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub of

used as a general symbol for the lanthanoid elements Although lanthanoids scandium Sc and yttrium Y are sometimes called rare earth elements they are relatively abundant in the earths crust With the exception of promethium Pm which does form a stable isotope even the least abundant thulium Tm and lutetium Lu are as abundant as iodine Because lanthanoids have very similar properties and are difficult to separate from one another they were not useful for basic research and application and hence they were regarded as rare elements Since a liquidliquid solvent extraction method using tributylphosphine oxide became available in the s lanthanoid elements have been readily available and widely used not only for chemical research but also as materials in alloys catalysts lasers cathoderay tubes etc Exercise What is the difference between lanthanoids and lanthanides Answer Fifteen elements LaLu are lanthanoids and fourteen elements CeLu without lanthanum are lanthanides meaning the elements similar to lanthanum Occasionally the names are confused and elements including lanthanum may be called lanthanides Table Properties of lanthanoids Atomic number Name Symbol Electron configuration M radius pm Lanthanum La ds Cerium Ce fds Praseodymium Pr fs Neodymium Nd fs Promethium Pm fs Samarium Sm fs Europium Eu fs Gadolinium Ge fds Terbium Tb fs Dysprosium Dy fs Holmium Ho fs Erbium Er fs Thurium Tm fs Ytterbium Yb fs Lutetium Lu fds Because the three stages of ionization enthalpy of lanthanoid elements are comparative low they are positive elements and readily assume trivalent ionic states Most compounds of lanthano other than Ce f Eu f Yb f are usually Ln ones Ln species are hard acids and since f electrons are buried deeply and not used for bonding they are hardly influenced by ligands There is a tendency for atomic and ionic radii to decrease with the increase of the atomic number and this phenomenon is called the lanthanide contraction This contraction is due to small shielding effects of f electrons which causes the atomic nucleus to draw outer shell electrons strongly with an increase of atomic number Complexes of lanthanoid metals are to coordinate and especially many and coordinate compounds are known Organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands of the types or are also known all of which are very reactive to oxygen or water Latimer and Frost Diagrams Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Latimer diagrams Thermodynamically stable and unstable oxidation statesFrost diagrams In addition to Pourbaix diagrams there are two other kinds of redox stability diagrams known as Latimer and Frost diagrams Each of these diagrams contains similar information but one representation may be more useful in a given situation than the others Latimer and Frost diagrams help predict stability relative to higher and lower oxidation states usually at one fixed pH Pourbaix diagrams help understand pHdependent equilibria which are often coupled to solubility equilibria and corrosion which will be talked about more later Manganese nodules on the sea floor contain Mn in oxidation states and Latimer diagrams Latimer diagrams are the oldest and most compact way to represent electrochemical equilibria for substances that have multiple oxidation states Electrochemical potential values are written for successive redox reactions from highest to lowest oxidation state typically under standard conditions in either strong acid H M pH or strong base OH M pH The oxidation states of successive substances in a Latimer diagram can differ by one or more electrons Oxidation states for the element undergoing redox are typically determined by difference we assign the oxygen atoms an oxidation state of and the hydrogen atoms an oxidation state of Example Mn in Acid The Latimer diagram for Mn illustrates its standard reduction potentials in M acid in oxidation states from to The Latimer diagram compresses into shorthand notation all the standard potentials for redox reactions of the element Mn For example the entry that connects Mn and Mn gives the potential for the halfcell reaction E V and the entry connecting Mn and Mn represents the reaction E V We can also calculate values for multielectron reactions by first adding ΔGnFE values and then dividing by the total number of electrons For example for the electron reduction of MnO to Mn we write and for the threeelectron reduction of MnOaq to MnOs Remember to divide by the number of electrons involved in the oxidation number change and for the above equations Thermodynamically stable and unstable oxidation states An unstable species on a Latimer diagram will have a lower standard potential to the left than to the right Example ceMnO MnO MnO the MnO species is unstable spontaneous disproportionation Which Mn species are unstable with respect to disproportionation MnO Mn So stable species are MnO MnO MnO Mn and Mn But MnO is also unstable why E V Moral All possible disproportionation reactions must be considered in order to determine stability this is often more convenient with a Frost diagram Note Thermodynamically unstable ions can be quite stable kinetically For example most Ncontaining molecules NO NO NH are unstable relative to the elements O N H but they are still quite stable kinetically Frost diagrams In a Frost diagram we plot ΔGF nE vs oxidation number The zero oxidation state is assigned a nE value of zero Stable and unstable oxidation states can be easily identified in the plot Unstable compounds are higher on the plot than the line connecting their neighbors Note that this is simply a graphical representation of what we did with the Latimer diagram to determine which oxidation states were stable and unstable The standard potential for any electrochemical reaction is given by the slope of the line connecting the two species on a Frost diagram For example the line connecting Mn and MnO on the Frost diagram has a slope of the standard potential of MnO reduction to Mn This is the number that is written above the arrow in the Latimer diagram for Mn Multielectron potentials can be calculated easily by connecting the dots in a Frost diagram A Frost diagram Contains the same information as in a Latimer diagram but graphically shows stability and oxidizing power The lowest species on the diagram are the most stable Mn MnO The highest species on diagram are the strongest oxidizers MnO Lattice Energies and Solubility Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Lattice energies can also help predict compound solubilities Lets consider a BornHaber cycle for dissolving a salt in water We can imagine this as the sum of two processes the vaporization of the salt to produce gaseous ions characterized by the lattice enthalpy and the hydration of those ions to produce the solution The enthalpy change for the overall process is the sum of those two steps We know that the entropy change for dissolution of a solid is positive so the solubility depends on the enthalpy change for the overall process Here we need to consider the trends in both the lattice energy EL and the hydration energy EH The lattice energy depends on the sum of the anion and cation radii r r whereas the hydration energy has separate anion and cation terms Generally the solvation of small ions typically cations dominates the hydration energy because of the r dependence For salts that contain large anions EL doesnt change much as r changes That is because the anion dominates the r r term in the denominator of the formula for EL On the other hand EH changes substantially with r especially for small cations As a result sulfate salts of small divalent cations such as MgSO epsom salts are soluble whereas the lower hydration energy of Ba in BaSO makes that salt insoluble Ksp Left EL diagram for sulfate salts The large SO ion is sizemismatched to small cations such as Mg which have large hydration energies resulting soluble salts With larger cations such as Ba which have lower EH the lattice energy exceeds the solvation enthalpy and the salts are insoluble Right In the case of small anions such as F and OH the lattice energy dominates with small cations such as transition metal ions TMn Mg and Li Anioncation size mismatch occurs with larger cations such as Cs and Ba which make soluble fluoride salts For small anions EL is more sensitive to r whereas EH does not depend on r as strongly For fluorides and hydroxides LiF is slightly soluble whereas CsF is very soluble and MgOH is insoluble whereas BaOH is very soluble Putting both trends together we see that low solubility is most often encountered when the anion and cation match well in their sizes especially when one or both are multiply charged Spacefilling models showing the van der Waals surfaces of Ba and SO The similarity in size of the two ions contributes to the low solubility of BaSO in water Combining all our conclusions about solubility we note the following trends Increasing size mismatch between the anion and cation leads to greater solubility so CsF and LiI are the most soluble alkali halides Increasing covalency leads to lower solubility in the salts due to larger EL For example AgF AgCl AgBr and AgI exhibit progressively lower solubility because of increasing covalency Increasing the charge on the anion lowers the solubility because the increase in EL is large relative to the increase in EH Small polyvalent cations having large EH make soluble salts with large univalent anions such as I NO ClO PF and acetate Examples Salts of transition metal and lanthanide ions Ln Nitrate salts are soluble but oxides and hydroxides are insoluble Fe Perchlorate is soluble but sulfate is insoluble Multiple charged anions such as O S PO and SO make insoluble salts with most M M and M metals Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub of the LibreTexts project which

Page ID IntroductionLattice EnergyBornHaber CycleUsing the BornHaber CycleStep Step Step Step Step EquationReferencesProblemsSolutionsReferences Ionic solids tend to be very stable compounds The enthalpies of formation of the ionic molecules cannot alone account for this stability These compounds have an additional stability due to the lattice energy of the solid structure However lattice energy cannot be directly measured The BornHaber cycle allows us to understand and determine the lattice energies of ionic solids Introduction This module will introduce the idea of lattice energy as well as one process that allows us to calculate it the BornHaber Cycle In order to use the BornHaber Cycle there are several concepts that we must understand first Lattice Energy Lattice Energy is a type of potential energy that may be defined in two ways In one definition the lattice energy is the energy required to break apart an ionic solid and convert its component atoms into gaseous ions This definition causes the value for the lattice energy to always be positive since this will always be an endothermic reaction The other definition says that lattice energy is the reverse process meaning it is the energy released when gaseous ions bind to form an ionic solid As implied in the definition this process will always be exothermic and thus the value for lattice energy will be negative Its values are usually expressed with the units kJmol Lattice Energy is used to explain the stability of ionic solids Some might expect such an ordered structure to be less stable because the entropy of the system would be low However the crystalline structure allows each ion to interact with multiple oppositely charge ions which causes a highly favorable change in the enthalpy of the system A lot of energy is released as the oppositely charged ions interact It is this that causes ionic solids to have such high melting and boiling points Some require such high temperatures that they decompose before they can reach a melting andor boiling point BornHaber Cycle There are several important concept to understand before the BornHaber Cycle can be applied to determine the lattice energy of an ionic solid ionization energy electron affinity dissociation energy sublimation energy heat of formation and Hesss Law Ionization Energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom or an ion This process always requires an input of energy and thus will always have a positive value In general ionization energy increases across the periodic table from left to right and decreases from top to bottom There are some excepts usually due to the stability of halffilled and completely filled orbitals Electron Affinity is the energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or an ion Usually energy released would have a negative value but due to the definition of electron affinity it is written as a positive value in most tables Therefore when used in calculating the lattice energy we must remember to subtract the electron affinity not add it In general electron affinity increases from left to right across the periodic table and decreases from top to bottom Dissociation energy is the energy required to break apart a compound The dissociation of a compound is always an endothermic process meaning it will always require an input of energy Therefore the change in energy is always positive The magnitude of the dissociation energy depends on the electronegativity of the atoms involved Sublimation energy is the energy required to cause a change of phase from solid to gas bypassing the liquid phase This is an input of energy and thus has a positive value It may also be referred to as the energy of atomization The heat of formation is the change in energy when forming a compound from its elements This may be positive or negative depending on the atoms involved and how they interact Hesss Law states that the overall change in energy of a process can be determined by breaking the process down into steps then adding the changes in energy of each step The BornHaber Cycle is essentially Hesss Law applied to an ionic solid Using the BornHaber Cycle The values used in the BornHaber Cycle are all predetermined changes in enthalpy for the processes described in the section above Hess Law allows us to add or subtract these values which allows us to determine the lattice energy Step Determine the energy of the metal and nonmetal in their elemental forms Elements in their natural state have an energy level of zero Subtract from this the heat of formation of the ionic solid that would be formed from combining these elements in the appropriate ration This is the energy of the ionic solid and will be used at the end of the process to determine the lattice energy Step The BornHaber Cycle requires that the elements involved in the reaction are in their gaseous forms Add the changes in enthalpy to turn one of the elements into its gaseous state and then do the same for the other element Step Metals exist in nature as single atoms and thus no dissociation energy needs to be added for this element However many nonmetals will exist as polyatomic species For example Cl exists as Cl in its elemental state The energy required to change Cl into Cl atoms must be added to the value obtained in Step Step Both the metal and nonmetal now need to be changed into their ionic forms as they would exist in the ionic solid To do this the ionization energy of the metal will be added to the value from Step Next the electron affinity of the nonmetal will be subtracted from the previous value It is subtracted because it is a release of energy associated with the addition of an electron This is a common error due to confusion caused by the definition of electron affinity so be careful when doing this calculation Step Now the metal and nonmetal will be combined to form the ionic solid This will cause a release of energy which is called the lattice energy The value for the lattice energy is the difference between the value from Step and the value from Step The diagram below is another representation of the BornHaber Cycle Equation The BornHaber Cycle can be reduced to a single equation Heat of formation Heat of atomization Dissociation energy sum of Ionization energies sum of Electron affinities Lattice energy Note In this general equation the electron affinity is added However when plugging in a value determine whether energy is released exothermic reaction or absorbed endothermic reaction for each electron affinity If energy is released put a negative sign in front of the value if energy is absorbed the value should be positive Rearrangement to solve for lattice energy gives the equation

Structures and Intercalation Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Layered structures are characterized by strong and typically covalent bonding between atoms in two dimensions and weaker bonding in the third A broad range of compounds including metal halides oxides sulfides selenides borides nitrides carbides and allotropes of some pure elements B C P As exist in layered forms Structurally the simplest of these structures for example binary metal halides and sulfides can be described as having some fraction of the octahedral andor tetrahedral sites are filled in the fcc and hcp lattices For example the CdCl structure is formed by filling all the octahedral sites in alternate layers of the fcc lattice and the CdI structure is the relative of this structure in the hcp lattice In the CdCl structure the stacking sequence of anion layers is ABCABC In the CdI structure the anion stacking sequence is ABAB and all the cations are eclipsed along the stacking axis Comparison of the CdCl left and CdI right crystal structures These are examples of structures because the cations are coordinated by an octahedron of six anions and the anions are coordinated by three cations to make a trigonal pyramid like NH Another way to describe these structures is to say that the MX octahedra each share six edges in the MX sheets Polyhedral drawing of one layer of the CdCl or CdI structure showing edgesharing MX octahedra Because these structures place the packing atoms the anions in direct van der Waals contact they are most stable for relatively covalent compounds Otherwise the electrostatic repulsion between contacting anions would destabilize the structure energetically More ionic MX compounds tend to adopt the fluorite CaF or rutile TiO structures which are not layered Despite the fact that these two structure types are the same at the level of nearest and nextnearest neighbor ions the CdI structure is much more common than the CdCl structure CdCl

Pt MTe M Ti Co Ni Rh Pd Pt Physically layered compounds are soft and slippery because the layer planes slide past each other easily For example graphite MoS and talc a silicate are layered compounds that are used widely as lubricants and lubricant additives An important reaction of layered compounds is intercalation In intercalation reactions guest molecules and ions enter the galleries that separate the sheets usually with expansion of the lattice along the stacking axis This reaction is typically reversible if it does not perturb the bonding within the sheets Often the driving force for intercalation is a redox reaction ie electron transfer between the host and guest For example lithium metal reacts with TiS MoS and graphite to produce LiTiS LixMoS x and LiC In these compounds lithium is ionized to Li and the sheets are negatively charged Oxidizing agents such as Br FeCl and AsF also react with graphite In the resulting intercalation compounds the sheets are positively charged and the intercalated species are anionic Intercalation reactions are especially important for electrochemical energy storage in secondary batteries such as lithium ion batteries nickelmetal hydride batteries and nickelcadmium batteries The reversible nature of the intercalation reaction allows the electrodes to be charged and discharged up to several thousand times without losing their mechanical integrity In lithium ion batteries the negative electrode material is typically graphite which is intercalated by lithium to make LiC Several different oxides and phosphates containing redox active transition metal ions Mn Fe Co Ni are used as the positive electrode materials Oxidative or reductive intercalation involves the placement of anions or cations between sheets Lithium ion batteries based on CoO were first described in by John B Goodenoughs research group at Oxford In batteries based on CoO which has the CdI structure the positive electrode halfreaction is The negative electrode half reaction is The battery is fully charged when the positive electrode is in the CoO form and the negative electrode is in the LiC form Discharge involves the motion of Li ions through the electrolyte forming LixCoO and graphite at the two electrodes Blue plaque erected by the Royal Society of Chemistry commemorating the development of cathode materials for the lithiumion battery Crystal structure of LiCoO The lithium ion battery is a rocking chair battery so named because charging and discharging involve moving Li ions from one side to the other CoO is one example of a positive electrode material that has been used in lithium ion batteries It has a high energy density but batteries based on CoO have poor thermal stability Safer materials include lithium iron phosphate LiFePO and LiMO M a mixture of Co Mn and Ni These batteries are used widely in laptop computers portable electronics cellular telephones cordless tools and electric and hybrid vehicles A similar intercalation reaction occurs in nickelcadmium batteries and nickelmetal hydride batteries except in this case the reaction involves the movement of protons in and out of the NiOH lattice which has the CdI structure There are many layered compounds that cannot be intercalated by redox reactions typically because some other stable product is formed For example the reaction of layered CdI with Li produces LiI NaCl structure and Cd metal Ligand Substitution Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Transition metal complexes can exchange one ligand for another and these reactions are important in their synthesis stereochemistry and catalytic chemistry The mechanisms of chemical reactions are intimately connected to reaction kinetics As in organic chemistry the mechanisms of transition metal reactions are typically inferred from experiments that examine the concentration dependence of the incoming and outgoing ligands on the reaction rate the detection of intermediates and the stereochemistry of the reactants and products Thermodynamic vs kinetics When we think about the reactions of transition metal complexes it is important to recall the distinction between their thermodynamics and kinetics Take for example the formation of the square planar tetracyanonickelate complex Thermodynamically NiCN is very stable meaning that the equilibrium above lies very far to the right Kinetically however the complex is labile meaning that it can exchange its ligands rapidly For example the exchange between a C labeled CN ion and a bound CN ligand occurs on the timescale of tens of milliseconds Conversely a compound can be thermodynamically unstable but kinetically inert meaning that it takes a relatively long time to react For example the CoNH ion is unstable in acid but its hydrolysis reaction with concentrated HCl takes about one week to go to completion at room temperature Henry Taube who studied the mechanisms of ligand exchange reactions in simple test tube experiments classified transition metal complexes as labile if their reaction halflife was one minute or less and inert if they took longer to react The dynamic range of ligand substitution rates is enormous spanning at least orders of magnitude On the timescale of most laboratory experiments the Taube definition of lability is a useful one for classifying reactions into those that have low and high activation energies As we will see the crystal field stabilization energy CFSE plays a key role in determining the activation energy and therefore the rate of ligand substitution Henry Taube Stanford University received the Nobel Prize for his work on the electron transfer and ligand exchange reactions of transition metal complexes Crystal field stabilization energy and ligand exchange rates Lets consider a very commmon and simple ligand exchange reaction which is the substitution of one water molecule for another in an octahedral MHOn complex Since the products except for the label are the same as the reactants we know that ΔG and Keq for this reaction The progress of the reaction can be monitored by NMR by using isotopically labeled water typically containing O or O The most striking thing about this otherwise boring reaction is the vast difference in rate constants about orders of magnitude for different metal ions and oxidation states Mn log k sec Cr V Cr Cu While at first it may seem strange that the same ion in two different oxidation states Cr vs Cr would be inert or labile respectively we can begin to rationalize the difference by drawing dorbital splitting diagrams for the complexes What we find is that octahedral complexes that have high CFSE Cr V tend to be inert Conversely ions with electrons in high energy eg orbitals Cr Cu tend to be labile In the case of Cr and V the energy penalty for distorting the complex away from octahedral symmetry to make for example a or coordinate intermediate is particularly high This activation energy for ligand substitution is lower for Cr and Cu which already have electrons in antibonding eg orbitals Based on the rules we developed for calculating the CFSE of transition metal complexes we can now predict the trends in ligand substitution rates Octahedral complexes with d and dlow spin configurations such as Cr d Co d Rh d Ru d and Os d tend to be substitutioninert because of their high CFSE Square planar d complexes especially those in the d and d series are also substitutioninert Examples are complexes of Pd Pt and Au Intermediate cases are complexes of Fe V V Ni and of main group ions Be Al that are hard Lewis acids These complexes make strong metaloxygen bonds and have water exchange rates in the range of s Ions with zero CFSE exchange water molecules on a timescale of nanoseconds k s These include ions with d d high spin and d electron counts including alkali metal Li Na K Rb Cs and alkali earth Mg Ca Sr Ba cations Zn Cd Hg and Mn In these cases the CFSE is zero and the energetic cost of breaking octahedral symmetry is relatively low For pblock elements faster exchange occurs with larger ions eg Ba Ca and Ga Al because Lewis acid strength decreases with increasing ion size The Cu ion d as a JahnTeller ion is already distorted away from octahedral symmetry and is therefore quite labile exchanging water ligands at a rate of about s Ligand Substitution Mechanisms For an MLn complex undergoing ligand substitution there are essentially three different reaction mechanisms In the dissociative mechanism a MLn complex first loses a ligand to form an MLn intermediate and the incoming ligand Y reacts with the MLn fragment This mechanism is illustrated below for ligand substitution on an octahedral ML complex The intermediate state in this example involves a trigonal bipyramidal ML fragment as well as free L and Y ligands If the rate determining step is the dissociation of L from the complex then the concentration of Y does not affect the rate of reaction leading to the firstorder rate law Illustration of the dissociative ligand substitution mechanism for an ML complex The reaction energy profile is shown at the right In the case of an octahedral complex this reaction would be first order in ML and zero order in Y but only if the highest energy transition state is the one that precedes the formation of the ML intermediate If the two transition states are close in energy as in the case of the animation at the right then the rate law becomes more complicated In this case we can simplify the problem by assuming a low steadystate concentration of the MLn intermediate The resulting rate law is which reduces to the simpler firstorder rate law when kY kL Because the formation of the transition state involves dissociation of a ligand the entropy of activation is always positive in the dissociative mechanism In the associative mechanism the incoming ligand Y attacks the MLn complex transiently forming an MLnY intermediate and the intermediate then loses a ligand L forming the MLnY product Complexes that undergo associative substitution are typically either coordinatively unsaturated or contain a ligand that can change its bonding to the metal eg a change in the hapticity or bending of a nitric oxide ligand NO In homogeneous catalysis the associative pathway is desirable because the binding event and hence the selectivity of the reaction depends not only on the nature of the metal catalyst but also on the molecule that is involved in the catalytic cycle Berry pseudorotation mechanism Examples of associative mechanisms are commonly found in the chemistry of d square planar metal complexes eg Vaskas complex IrClCOPCH and tetrachloroplatinateII These compounds ML bind the incoming substituting ligand Y to form pentacoordinate intermediates MLY which in a subsequent step dissociate one of their ligands Although the incoming ligand is initially bound at an equatorial site the Berry pseudorotation provides a low energy pathway for all ligands to sample both the equatorial and axial sites Ligand dissociation must occur from an equatorial site according to the principle of microscopic reversibility Dissociation of Y results in no reaction but dissociation of L results in net substitution yielding the d complex MLY The first step is typically rate determining Thus the entropy of activation is negative which indicates an increase in order in the transition state Associative reactions follow second order kinetics the rate of the appearance of product depends on the concentration of both ML and Y The Trans Effect which is connected with the associative mechanism controls the stereochemistry of certain ligand substitution reactions The trans effect refers to the labilization making more reactive of ligands that are trans to certain other ligands the latter being referred to as transdirecting ligands The labilization of trans ligands is attributed to electronic effects and is most notable in square planar complexes but it can also be observed with octahedral complexes The cis effect is most often observed in octahedral complexes In addition to the kinetic trans effect trans ligands also have an influence on the ground state of the molecule the most notable ones being bond lengths and stability Some authors prefer the term trans influence to distinguish this from the kinetic effect while others use more specific terms such as structural trans effect or thermodynamic trans effect The discovery of the trans effect is attributed to Ilya Ilich Chernyaev who recognized it and gave it a name in The intensity of the trans effect as measured by the increase in the rate of substitution of the trans ligand follows this sequence F HO OH NH py Cl Br I SCN NO SCNH Ph SO PR AsR SR CH H NO CO CN CH Note that weak field ligands tend to be poor transdirecting ligands whereas strong field ligands are strongly transdirecting The classic example of the trans effect is the synthesis of cisplatin and its trans isomer Starting from PtCl the first NH ligand is added to any of the four equivalent positions at random However since Cl has a greater trans effect than NH the second NH is added trans to a Cl and therefore cis to the first NH If on the other hand one starts from PtNH the trans product is obtained instead The trans effect in square complexes can be explained in terms of the associative mechanism described above which goes through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate Ligands with a high kinetic trans effect are in general those with high π acidity as in the case of phosphines or lowligand lonepairdπ repulsions as in the case of hydride which prefer the more πbasic equatorial sites in the intermediate The second equatorial position is occupied by the incoming ligand The third and final equatorial site is occupied by the departing trans ligand so the net result is that the kinetically favored product is the one in which the ligand trans to the one with the largest trans effect is eliminated The interchange mechanism is similar to the associative and dissociative pathways except that no distinct MLnY or MLn intermediate is formed This concerted mechanism can be thought of as analogous to nucleophilic substitution via the SN pathway at a tetrahedral carbon atom in organic chemistry The interchange mechanism is further classified as associative Ia or dissociative Id depending on the relative importance of MY and ML bonding in the transition state If the transition state is characterized by the formation of a strong MY bond then the mechanism is Ia Conversely if weakening of the ML bond is more important in reaching the transition state then the mechanism is Id An example of the Ia mechanism is the interchange of bulk and coordinated water in VHO In contrast the slightly more compact ion NiHO ion exchanges water via the Id mechanism Effects of ion pairing Highly charged cationic complexes tend to form ion pairs with anionic ligands and these ion pairs often undergo reactions via the Ia pathway The electrostatically held nucleophilic incoming ligand can exchange positions with a ligand in the first coordination sphere resulting in net substitution An illustrative process is the anation reaction with an anion of the chromiumIII hexaaquo complex Liquid Ammonia Last updated Save as PDF

ce bonds and center electron ce bonds electron deficient bonds between boron atoms Figure Boron is very hard and shows semiconductivity Figure The structure of the elemental boron with B icosahedra The chemistry of boranes boron hydrides started from the research of A Stock reported during the period Although boron is adjacent to carbon in the periodic table its hydrides have completely different properties from those of hydrocarbons The structures of boron hydrides in particular were unexpected and could be explained only by a new concept in chemical bonding For his contribution to the very extensive new inorganic chemistry of boron hydrides W N Lipscomb won the Nobel prize in Another Nobel prize was awarded to H C Brown for the discovery and development of a very useful reaction in organic synthesis called hydroboration Because of the many difficulties associated with the low boiling points of boranes as well as their activity toxicity and airsensitivity Stock had to develop new experimental methods for handling the compounds in vacuo Using these techniques he prepared six boranes BH BH BH BH BH and BH by the reactions of magnesium boride MgB with inorganic acids and determined their compositions However additional research was necessary to determine their structures At present the original synthetic method of Stock using MgB as a starting compound is used only for the preparation of BH Since reagents such as lithium tetrahydroborate LiBH and sodium tetrahydroborate NaBH are now readily available and diborane BH is prepared according to the following equation higher boranes are synthesized by the pyrolysis of diborane A new theory of chemical bonding was introduced to account for the bonding structure of diborane BH Although an almost correct hydrogenbridged structure for diborane was proposed in many chemists preferred an ethanelike structure HBBH by analogy with hydrocarbons However H C LonguetHiggins proposed the concept of the electrondeficient center electron bond ce bond and it was proven by electron diffraction in that the structure was correct Figure Figure Structure of diborane It has been elucidated by electron diffraction single crystal Xray structure analysis infrared spectroscopy etc that boranes contain center electron bonds ce bond BHB and besides the usual center electron covalent bonds ce bond BH and BB Such structures can be treated satisfactorily by molecular orbital theory Boranes are classified into closo nido arachno etc according to the skeletal structures of boron atoms Closoborane BnHn has the structure of a closed polyhedron of n boron atoms bonded to n hydrogen atoms as seen in the examples of a regular octahedron BH and an icosahedron BH The boranes of this series do not contain BHB bonds Boranes BnHn such as BH form structures with BB BBB and BHB bonds and lack the apex of the polyhedron of closo boranes and are referred to as nido type boranes Borane BnHn such as BH have a structures that lacks two apexes from the closo type and are more open Skeletons are also built by BB BBB and BHB bonds and these are called arachno type boranes The structures of typical boranes are shown in Figure Figure Structures of boranes Not only diborane but also higher boranes are electrondeficient compounds that are difficult to explain using Lewis electronic structure based on simple center electron covalent bonds Exercise Why is diborane called an electron deficient compound Answer It is because there are only valence electrons of boron and hydrogen atoms although electrons are necessary to assign two electrons each to eight BH bonds K Wade summarized the relation of the number of valence electrons used for skeletal bonds and the structures of boranes and proposed an empirical rule called the Wade rule According to this rule when the number of boron atoms is n the skeletal valence electrons are n for a closo type n for a nido type and n for an arachno type borane The relationship between the skeletal structure of a cluster compound and the number of valence electrons is also an important problem in the cluster compounds of transition metals and the Wade rule has played a significant role in furthering our understanding of the structures of these compounds b Carbon Graphite diamond fullerene and amorphous carbon are carbon allotropes Usually a carbon atom forms four bonds using four valence electrons Graphite Graphite is structured as layers of honeycombshaped membered rings of carbon atoms that look like condensed benzene rings without any hydrogen atoms Figure The carboncarbon distance between inlayer carbon atoms is pm and the bonds have double bond character analogous to aromatic compounds Since the distance between layers is pm and the layers are held together by comparatively weak van der Waals forces they slide when subjected to an applied force This is the origin of the lubricating properties of graphite Various molecules such as alkali metals halogens metal halides and organic compounds intercalate between the layers and form intercalation compounds Graphite has semimetallic electrical conductivity about cm parallel to layers and about times more resistant in the perpendicular direction Figure Structure of graphite Diamond Its structure is called the diamondtype structure Figure A unit cell of diamond contains eight carbon atoms and each carbon atom is coordinate in a regular tetrahedron Diamond is the hardest substance known with a Mohs hardness Diamond has very high heat conductivity although it is an electrical insulator Although previously a precious mineral only formed naturally industrial diamonds are now commercially prepared in large quantities at high temperatures C or higher and under high pressures GPa or more from graphite using metal catalysts In recent years diamond thin films have been made at low temperatures about C and under low pressures about Pa by the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons and are used for coating purposes etc Figure Structure of diamond Fullerene Fullerene is the general name of the rd carbon allotrope of which the soccer ballshaped molecule C is a typical example Figure R E Smalley H W Kroto and others detected C in the mass spectra of the laser heating product of graphite in and fullerenes isolation from this socalled soot was reported in It has the structure of a truncated cornercuticosahedron and there is double bond character between carbon atoms It is soluble in organic solvents with benzene solutions being purple Usually it is isolated and purified by chromatography of fullerene mixtures Wideranging research on chemical reactivities and physical properties such as superconductivity is progressing rapidly Besides C C and carbon nanotubes are attracting interest Figure Structure of C c Silicon Silicon is the most abundant element in the earths crust after oxygen Most of this silicon exists as a component of silicate rocks and the element is not found as a simple substance Therefore silicon is produced by the reduction of quartz and sand with highgrade carbon using electric arc furnaces Highergrade silicon is obtained by hydrogen reduction of SiHCl which is produced by the hydrochlorination of low purity silicon followed by rectification The silicon used for semiconductor devices is further refined by the crystal Czochralski or zone melting methods The crystal mp o C has a metallic luster and the diamond type structure There are three isotopes of silicon Si Si and Si Because of its nuclear spin of I Si is used for NMR studies of organic silicon compounds or silicates solidstate NMR Silicates and organosilicon compounds show a wide range of structures in silicon chemistry Section c describes the properties of silicates Organosilicon chemistry is the most active research area in the inorganic chemistry of main group elements other than carbon Silicon chemistry has progressed remarkably since the development of an industrial process to produce organosilicon compounds by the direct reaction of silicon with methyl chloride CHCl in the presence of a copper catalyst This historical process was discovered by E G Rochow in Silicone resin silicone rubber and silicone oil find wide application In recent years silicon compounds have also been widely used in selective organic syntheses Although silicon is a congener of carbon their chemical properties differ considerably A wellknown example is the contrast of silicon dioxide SiO with its dimensional structure and gaseous carbon dioxide CO The first compound MesSiSiMes Mes is mesityl CHCH with a siliconsilicon double bond was reported in in contrast with the ubiquitous carboncarbon multiple bonds Such compounds are used to stabilize unstable bonds with bulky substituents kinetic stabilization Exercise Why are the properties of CO and SiO different Answer Their properties are very different because CO is a chainlike threeatom molecule and SiO is a solid compound with the three dimensional bridges between silicon and oxygen atoms d Nitrogen Nitrogen is a colorless and odorless gas that occupies of the atmosphere volume ratio It is produced in large quantities together with oxygen bp C by liquefying air bp C and fractionating nitrogen bp C Nitrogen is an inert gas at room temperatures but converted into nitrogen compounds by biological nitrogen fixation and industrial ammonia synthesis The cause of its inertness is the large bond energy of the NN triple bond The two isotopes of nitrogen are N and N Both isotopes are NMRactive nuclides e Phosphorus Simple phosphorus is manufactured by the reduction of calcium phosphate CaPO with quartz rock and coke Allotropes include white phosphorus red phosphorus and black phosphorus White phosphorus is a molecule of composition of P Figure It has a low meltingpoint mp C and is soluble in benzene or carbon disulfide Because it is pyrophoric and deadly poisonous it must be handling carefully Figure Structure of white phosphorus Red phosphorus is amorphous and its structure is unclear The principal component is assumed to be a chain formed by the polymerization of P molecules as the result of the opening of one of the PP bonds It is neither pyrophoric nor poisonous and used in large quantities for the manufacturing of matches etc Black phosphorus is the most stable allotrope and is obtained from white phosphorus under high pressure about GPa It is a solid with a metallic luster and a lamellar structure Although it is a semiconductor under normal pressures it shows metallic conductivity under high pressures GPa Phosphorus compounds as ligands Tertiary phosphines PR and phosphites POR are very important ligands in transition metal complex chemistry Especially triphenylphosphine PCH triethyl phosphine PCH and their derivatives are useful ligands in many complexes because it is possible to control precisely their electronic and steric properties by modifying substituents refer to Section c Although they are basically sigma donors they can exhibit some pi accepting character by changing the substituents into electron accepting Ph phenyl OR Cl F etc The order of the electronaccepting character estimated from the CO stretching vibrations and C NMR chemical shifts of the phosphine or phosphitesubstituted metal carbonyl compounds is as follows Ar is an aryl and R is an alkyl On the other hand C A Tolman has proposed that the angle at the vertex of a cone that surrounds the substituents of a phosphorus ligand at the van der Waals contact distance can be a useful parameter to assess the steric bulkiness of phosphines and phosphites This parameter called the cone angle is widely used Figure When the cone angle is large the coordination number decreases by steric hindrance and the dissociation equilibrium constant and dissociation rate of a phosphorus ligand become large Table The numerical expression of the steric effect is very

Malleability of Metals and Alloys Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Metals with closepacked structures HCP and FCC such as copper gold silver zinc magnesium etc are in general more malleable than those with the BCC structure tungsten vanadium chromium etc Why In the closepacked structure there is relatively little corrugation between sheets of metal atoms This means that these planes can slip past each other relatively easily In the BCC structure there are no closepacked planes and much greater corrugation between atoms at different levels This makes it much harder for one row to slide past another This effect explains the hardness of alloys like brass CuZn which has the BCC structure which are made by combining two soft metals Cu and Zn which are respectively FCC and HCP as pure metals are both soft and ductile Bronzes originally made as alloys of copper and arsenic but later as alloys of copper and tin are harder than either of the constituent metals for the same reason The history of bronzes and brass dates to prehistoric times with the earliest brasses made by smelting copperzinc ores In the Bronze Age possession of these hard alloys provided a tactical advantage

gas Compounds In the th century H Cavendish discovered an inert component in air In a line was discovered in the spectrum of sunlight that could not be identified and it was suggested to be due to a new element helium Based on these facts at the end of the th century W Ramsay isolated He Ne Ar Kr and Xe and by studying their properties demonstrated that they were new elements In spite of the nearly content of argon Ar in air the element had not been isolated until then and noble gases were completely lacking in Mendeleevs periodic table The Nobel prize was awarded to Ramsay in for his achievement Noble gases are located next to the halogen group in the periodic table Since noble gas elements have closedshell electronic configurations they lack reactivity and their compounds were unknown Consequently they were also called inert gases However after the discovery of noble gas compounds it was considered more suitable to call these elements noble gases as is mentioned in the following chapter Although the abundance of helium in the universe is next to that of hydrogen it is very rare on the Earth because it is lighter than air Helium originated from solar nuclear reactions and was locked up in the earths crust It is extracted as a byproduct of natural gas from specific areas especially in North America Since helium has the lowest boiling point K of all the substances it is important for lowtemperature science and superconductivity engineering Moreover its lightness is utilized in airships etc Since argon is separated in large quantities when nitrogen and oxygen are produced from liquid air it is widely used in metallurgy and in industries and laboratories that require an oxygenfree environment b noble gas compounds Xenon Xe reacts with elements with the largest electronegativities such as fluorine oxygen and chlorine and with the compounds containing these elements like platinum fluoride PtF Although the first xenon compound was reported as XePtF the discoverer N Bartlett later corrected that it was not a pure compound but a mixture of XePtFx x If this is mixed with fluorine gas and excited with heat or light fluorides XeF XeF and XeF and are generated XeF has chainlike XeF square XeF distorted octahedral structures Although preparation of these compounds is comparatively simple it is not easy to isolate pure compounds especially XeF Hydrolysis of the fluorides forms oxides XeO is a very explosive compound Although it is stable in aqueous solution these solutions are very oxidizing Tetroxide XeO is the most volatile xenon compound MXeF M is Rb and Cs are very stable and do not decompose even when heated at C Thus xenon forms divalent to octavalent compounds Fluorides can also be used as fluorinating reagents Although it is known that krypton and radon also form compounds the compounds of krypton and radon are rarely studied as both their instability and their radioactivity make their handling problematic Discovery of noble gas Compounds H Bartlett studied the properties of platinum fluoride PtF in the s and synthesized OPtF It was an epochmaking discovery in inorganic chemistry when analogous experiments on xenon which has almost equal ionization energy kJ mol to that of O kJ mol resulted in the dramatic discovery of XePtF noble gas compounds had not been prepared before this report but various attempts were made immediately after the discovery of noble gases W Ramsay isolated noble gases and added a new group to the periodic table at the end of the th century Already in F F H Moisson who is famous for the isolation of F reacted a cm argon offered by Ramsay with fluorine gas under an electric discharge but failed to prepare an argon fluoride At the beginning of this century A von Antoropoff reported the synthesis of a krypton compound KrCl but later he concluded that it was a mistake L Pauling also foresaw the existence of KrF XeF and HXeO and anticipated their synthesis In a post doctoral research fellow A L Kaye in the laboratory of D M L Yost of Caltech where Pauling was a member of faculty attempted to prepare noble gas compounds Despite elaborate preparations and eager experiments attempts to prepare xenon compounds by discharging electricity through a mixed gas of xenon fluorine or chlorine were unsuccessful It is said that Pauling no longer showed interest in noble gas compounds after this failure Although R Hoppe of Germany predicted using theoretical considerations that the existence of XeF and XeF was highly likely in advance of the discovery of Bartlett he prepared these compounds only after knowing of Bartletts discovery Once it is proved that a compound of a certain kind is stable analogous compounds are prepared one after another This has

in catalysis The most important nonoctahedral geometries for transition metal complexes are coordinate square planar and tetrahedral coordinate square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal cisPtNHCl a d square planar complex Crystal field energy diagram showing the transition from octahedral to square planar geometry Energies of the dorbitals in nonoctahedral geometries The figure above shows what happens to the dorbital energy diagram as we progressively distort an octahedral complex by elongating it along the zaxis a tetragonal distortion by removing one of its ligands to make a square pyramid or by removing both of the ligands along the zaxis to make a square planar complex In all cases we keep the total bond order the same by making the bonds in the xy plane shorter as the bonds in the zdirection are stretched andor broken Barnett Rosenberg Michigan State University accidentally discovered the biological effects of square planar cisPtNHCl while researching bacterial growth in electric fields The Pt electrode he used reacted with chloride and ammonium ions in the electrolyte to produce the compound at ppm concentration Further experiments revealed that the cisisomer but not the transisomer is a potent anticancer drug which is especially effective against testicular cancer The drug works by crosslinking guaninecytosine rich regions of DNA thus inhibiting cell division The distortion away from octahedral symmetry breaks the degeneracy of the tg and eg orbitals dorbitals with a zcomponent dxz dyz dz go down in energy as orbitals that reside in the xy plane dxy dxy rise in energy The barycenter the weighted average orbital energy remains constant Also it is important to note that the splitting between the dxy and dxy orbitals stays constant at ΔO regardless of the nature of the distortion Why would a happy octahedral complex want to lose two of its ligands to make a square planar complex This occurs frequently in d and sometimes in d complexes with large ΔO ie d complexes with strong field ligands and d d complexes with any ligands Examples of such d complexes are NiCN the anticancer drug cisplatin cisPtNHCl PdHO and AuCl At the d electron count the lowest four orbitals are filled and the highest orbital the dxy is empty resulting in a large CFSE These complexes are diamagnetic and tend to be quite stable With weak field ligands d complexes are octahedral and paramagnetic eg NiHO which has two unpaired electrons in the eg orbitals Square planar complexes in catalysis Square planar d complexes can be oxidized by two electrons to become octahedral low spin d complexes which also have a large CFSE Because the loss of two electrons is accompanied by the gain of two ligands this process is called oxidative addition The reverse process is called reductive elimination Both processes function together in catalytic cycles such as the hydrogenation of olefins using Wilkinsons catalyst The catalytic cycle is shown below The catalyst cycles between coordinate RhI d and coordinate RhIII d The complex first adds H oxidatively to give a sixcoordinate complex in which the hydrogen is formally H An olefin molecule displaces a solvent molecule using its πelectrons to coordinate the metal The complex rearranges by inserting the olefin into the metalhydrogen bond a process called migratory insertion Finally the complex returns to the square planar geometry by eliminating the hydrogenated olefin reductive elimination Wilkinsons catalyst is highly active and is widely used for homogeneous hydrogenation hydroboration and hydrosilation reactions With chiral phosphine ligands the catalyst can hydrogenate prochiral olefins to give enantiomerically pure products Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson an inorganic chemist at Imperial College London developed Wilkinsons catalyst in Earlier as an Assistant Professor at Harvard University he had elucidated the sandwich structure of ferrocene which had been discovered a few years before but not understood Wilkinson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in for his contributions to organometallic chemistry Orbital Filling Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers MOs are filled from the bottom according to the Aufbau principle and Hunds rule as we learned for atomic orbitals Question what is the quantum mechanical basis of Hunds rule Consider the case of two degenerate orbitals such as the π or π orbitals in a secondrow diatomic molecule If these orbitals each contain one electron their spins can be parallel as preferred by Hunds rule or antiparallel The Pauli exclusion principle says that no two electrons in an orbital can have the same set of quantum numbers n l ml ms That means that in the parallel case the Pauli principle prevents the electrons from ever visiting each others orbitals In the antiparallel case they are free to come and go because they have different ms quantum numbers However having two electrons in the same orbital is energetically unfavorable because like charges repel Thus the parallel arrangement thanks to the Pauli principle has lower energy For O valence electrons we get the MO energy diagram below The shapes of the molecular orbitals are shown at the right This energy ordering of MOs correctly predicts two unpaired electrons in the π orbital and a net bond order of two bonding electrons and antibonding electrons This is consistent with the experimentally observed paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule Other interesting predictions of the MO theory for secondrow diatomics are that the C molecule has a bond order of and that the B molecule has two unpaired electrons both verified experimentally We can also predict using the O F Ne diagram above that NO has a bond order of and CO has a bond order of The symbols g and u in the orbital labels which we only include in the case of centrosymmetric molecules refer to their symmetry with respect to inversion Gerade g orbitals are symmetric meaning that inversion through the center leaves the orbital unchanged Ungerade u means that the sign of the orbital is reversed by the inversion operation Because g and u orbitals have different symmetries they have zero overlap with each other As we will see below factoring orbitals according to g and u symmetry simplifies the task of constructing molecular orbitals in more complicated molecules such as butadiene and benzene The orbital shapes shown above were computed using a oneelectron model of the molecule as we did for hydrogenlike AOs to get the shapes of s p and dorbitals To get accurate MO energies and diagrams for multielectron molecules ie all real molecules we must include the fact that electrons are correlated ie that they avoid each other in molecules because of their negative charge This problem cannot be solved analytically and is solved approximately in numerical calculations by using density functional theory DFT We will learn about the consequences of electron correlation in solids such as superconductors in Chapter Red giant stars are characterized by the presence of C molecules in their atmospheres Since C has a net bond order of two it reacts rapidly as it cools from the gas phase to make other forms of carbon such as fullerenes graphite and diamond all of which have four bonds for every two carbon atoms Orbital Symmetry Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The MO picture for a molecule gets complicated when many valence AOs are involved We can simplify the problem enormously by noting without proof here that orbitals of different symmetry with respect to the molecule do not interact The symmetry operations of a molecule which can include rotations mirror planes inversion centers etc and the symmetry classes of bonds and orbitals in molecules can be rigorously defined according to group theory Here we will take a simple approach to this problem based on our intuitive understanding of the symmetry of threedimensional objects as illustrated in Fig Figure Example of σ symmetry AOs must have the same nodal symmetry as defined by the molecular symmetry operations or their overlap is zero For example in the HCl molecule there is a unique symmetry axis which is typically defined as the Cartesian zaxis as shown in Fig Figure Orbitals of σ and π symmetry do not interact We can see from this figure that the H s orbital is unchanged by a rotation about the bond axis However the same rotation inverts the sign of the Cl pywavefunction Because these two orbitals have different symmetries the Cl py orbital is nonbonding and doesnt interact with the H s The same is true of the Cl pxorbital The px and py orbitals have π symmetry nodal plane containing the bonding axis and are labeled πnb in the MO energy level diagram Fig In contrast the H s and Cl pz orbitals both have σ symmetry which is also the symmetry of the clay pot shown in Fig Because these orbitals have the same symmetry in the point group of the molecule they can make the bonding and antibonding combinations shown in Fig The MO diagram of HCl that includes all the valence orbitals of the Cl atom is shown in Fig Two of the Cl valence orbitals px and py have the wrong symmetry to interact with the H s orbital The Cl s orbital has the same σ symmetry as H s but it is much lower in energy so there is little orbital interaction The energy of the Cl s orbital is thus affected only slightly by forming the molecule The pairs of electrons in the πnb and σnb orbitals are therefore nonbonding Figure Energy level diagram of the HCl molecule showing MOs derived from the valence AOs Note that the MO result in Fig bond and three pairs of nonbonding electrons is the same as we would get from valence bond theory for HCl The nonbonding orbitals are localized on the Cl atom just as we would surmise from the valence bond picture In order to differentiate it from the σ bonding orbital the σ antibonding orbital which is empty in this case is

cyclopentadienl complexesOlefin complexesArene complexes electron rulec Phosphine complexes The organometallic chemistry of transition metals is comparatively new Although an ethylene complex of platinum called Zeises salt KPtClCH tetracarbonylnickel NiCO and pentacarbonyliron FeCO which today are classified as organometallic compounds were prepared in the th century their bonding and structures were unknown The research of W Hieber and others on metal carbonyl compounds was important in the s but the results of these studies were limited because of the underdeveloped techniques of structural analyses available at the time The discovery of ferrocene FeCH in was epochmaking for the chemistry of this field The very unique bonding mode of this complex became clear by means of single crystal Xray structural analysis NMR spectra infrared spectra etc and served as a starting point for subsequent developments in the field It was a major discovery that ferrocene exhibited very high thermal stability in spite of the general view that the transition metalcarbon bonds were very unstable It was also clearly demonstrated that the compound had a sandwich structure in which the five carbon atoms of the cyclopentadienyl groups bonded simultaneously to the central metal iron While the various coordination modes of hydrocarbon ligands were determined one after another the industrial importance of organometallic compounds of transition metals increased with the discoveries of olefin polymerization catalysts Ziegler catalyst homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts Wilkinson catalyst and development of catalysts for asymmetric synthesis etc The Nobel prize awarded to K Ziegler G Natta E O Fischer and G Wilkinson was in recognition of this importance According to the definition of an organometallic compound at least one direct bond between a metal and a carbon atom should exist but CN complexes etc with no organometallic character are usually excluded from organometallic compounds Metal carbonyl compounds are organometallic in various aspects of their bonding structure and reactions and they are a good model system for understanding of the essence of transition metal organometallic chemistry a Metal carbonyl compounds Binary metal carbonyl compounds that consist only of a metal and CO ligands are usually prepared by the direct reaction of the powder of a highly reactive metal and carbon monoxide or by the reduction of a metal salt to zero valance followed by reaction with highpressure carbon monoxide However tetracarbonylnickel first discovered at the end of the th century forms by the reaction of nickel metal and carbon monoxide under atmospheric pressure and at room temperature The preparation of other metal carbonyl compounds on the other hand requires high temperatures and high pressures Figure Structures of metal carbonyl compounds Mononuclear metal carbonyl compounds take highly symmetric polyhedral coordination structures Hexacoordinate chromium molybdenum and tungsten hexacarbonyl MCO assume a regular octahedral pentacoordinate pentacarbonyliron FeCO a triangular bipyramid and tetracarbonylnickel NiCO a regular tetrahedron coordination structure Figure The carbon atoms of carbonyl ligands coordinate to the metal and the CO moieties are oriented along the direction of the metalcarbon axis Binuclear metal carbonyl MnCO has an MnMn bond joining two square pyramidal MnCO parts In FeCO two FeCO subunits are bridged by three CO ligands and in CoCO two CoCO subunits are connected by both three CO bridges and a CoCo bond There are a number of cluster metal carbonyl compounds with metalmetal bonds joining three or more metals and terminal CO CO a bridge between two metals and CO a bridge capping three metals are coordinated to the metal frames refer to Section f Many cluster carbonyls are formed by a pyrolysis reaction of mononuclear or binuclear carbonyl compounds Typical metal carbonyl compounds and their properties are shown in Table VCO Black solid d CrCO White solid d MnCO Yellow solid mp FeCO Yellow liquid bp CoCO Red solid mp NiCO Colorless liquid bp MoCO White solid sublime TcCO White solid mp RuCO Orange solid d RhCO Black solid d WCO White solid sublime ReCO White solid mp OsCO Orange solid mp IrCO Yellow solid d Back donation A metal carbonyl compound consists of carbon monoxide coordinated to a zero valent metal For a long time it had been unclear why such bonding was possible let alone stable at all The belief that normal coordination bonds were formed by the donation of electrons from highly basic ligands to a metal formed the basis of the coordination theory of A Werner Because the basicity of carbon monoxide is very low and transition metalcarbon bonds are generally not very stable a suitable explanation for the stability of metal carbonyl compounds was sought If the shape and symmetry of the metal d orbital and of the CO antibonding orbital for the carbonoxygen bond are suitable for overlap a bonding interaction between the metal and carbon is expected The bonding scheme shown in Figure was proposed from this point of view The mechanism by which electrons are donated to the vacant carbon monoxide orbital from the filled metal d orbital is called back donation Since accumulation of superfluous electrons on a low oxidation state metal atom is prevented backdonation leads to the stabilization of the MC bond Fig Back donation in metal carbonyls A rise in the order of the metal carbon bond is reflected in the increase of the MC and decrease of the CO stretching frequencies in vibrational spectra Infrared spectra are useful because carbonyl frequencies are easily detectable The lowering of the oxidation state of a metal by the flow of negative charge from its coordinated ligands is reflected in the reduction of the CO stretching frequencies b Hydrocarbon complexes An organometallic compound is one which has metalcarbon bonds and between one and eight carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon ligand bond to a metal Hapticity describes the number of atoms in a ligand that have direct coordinative interaction with the metal and the number is added to An example is pentahaptocyclopentadienyl Table A ligand that donates an odd number of electrons to a metal is formally a radical and it is stabilized by bonding to the metal A ligand that donates an even number of electrons to a metal is generally a neutral molecule and it is stable even if it is not bonded to the metal Carbene or carbyne ligands are exceptions to this rule The chemical formula of an organometallic compound is expressed in many cases without using the square brackets usual for such a complex and we shall follow this convention in this book Table Hapticity and number of donating electrons of hydrocarbon ligands Name Hapticity Number of electrons Example Alkyl WCH Alkylidene CrCOCOCHCH Alkene KPtClCH allyl NiCH Diene FeCOCH Cyclopentadienyl FeCH Arene CrCH Tropylium VCO CH Cyclooctatetraene U CH Exercise Describe the difference between cyclopentadiene and cyclopentadienyl ligands Answer The chemical formula of cyclopentadiene is CH and it is bonded to a metal as a or ligand The chemical formula of cyclopentadienyl is CH and it is bonded to a metal as a or ligand Alkyl ligands Alkyl or aryl transition metal compounds have MC single bonds In spite of many attempts over most of the course of chemical history their isolation was unsuccessful and it was long considered that all MC bonds were essentially unstable Stable alkyl complexes began to be prepared gradually only from the s CpZrClPrWMe CpFeMeCO CoMepydmg dmg dimethylglyoximato IrClXEtCOPPh NiEtbipy PtClEtPEt are some representative compounds Among various synthetic processes so far developed the reactions of compounds containing Mhalogen bonds with maingroup metalalkyl compounds such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound are common synthetic routes Especially vitamin B of which D Hodgkin Nobel Prize determined the structure is known to have a very stable CoC bond Metal alkyl compounds which have only alkyl ligand such as WMe are called homoleptic alkyls It is gradually accepted that a major cause of the instability of alkyl complexes is the low activation energy of their decomposition rather than a low MC bond energy The most general decomposition path is elimination Namely the bonding interaction of a hydrocarbon ligand with the central transition metal tends to result in the formation of a metal hydride and an olefin Such an interaction is called an agostic interaction Although an alkyl and an aryl ligand are electron ligands they are regarded as anions when the oxidation number of the metal is counted The hydride ligand H resembles the alkyl ligand in this aspect allyl complexes If an allyl group CHCHCH is bonded to a metal via a carbon atom it is a electron ligand like an alkyl group If the double bond delocalizes three carbon atoms bond to the metal simultaneously as a electron ligand This is also an odd electron and formally anionic ligand and is stabilized by being coordinated to the metal PdCHAcPPh CoCH etc are wellknown examples Since and coordination modes are possible in the catalytic reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons various reactions occur cyclopentadienl complexes The cyclopentadie nyl ligand CH is abbreviated as Cp CMe in which the hydrogen atoms of Cp are replaced with methyl groups is a useful ligand called Cp star and is denoted by Cp Ferrocene CpFe is a very stable orangecolored iron compound in which two cyclopentadienyl groups are bonded to iron It was discovered independently in two laboratories but the discoverers proposed incorrect structures The correct structure was clarified by the group of G Wilkinson who won a Nobel Prize The preparation of ferrocene is usually carried out according to the following reaction path Figure Structure of ferrocene Single crystal Xray structure analysis showed that the structure of ferrocene is an iron atom sandwiched between two CH rings Figure Five carbon atoms bond to the iron simultaneously in ferrocene and unsaturated CC bonds are delocalized in the fivemembered rings Since this kind of bond was not known before it aroused interest many derivative compounds were prepared and a wide range of chemistry has since been studied Table CpTiCl Red mp CpV Black mp CpCr Scarlet mp CpMn Brown mp CpFe Orange mp CpCo Black mp CpNi Green d CpZrCl White mp CpNbCl Brown CpMoCl Green d CpTcH Yellow mp

bonded to a metal it is a electron ligand like an alkyl group It becomes a electron ligand in rare cases and coordinates to a metal as a allyl system that extends over carbon atoms The Cp group of ferrocene has reactivity analogous to that of aromatic compounds Since the Cp group has played a significant role as a stabilizing ligand to realize the preparation of new compounds with new metalligand bonding modes it can reasonably be claimed that this ligand has made the greatest contribution to organometallic chemistry of any other ligand Although two Cp rings are bonded to the metal in parallel in ferrocene CpTiCl and CpMoH have bent Cp ligands and they are called bentsandwich compounds Olefin complexes Zeises salt KPtClCH is the oldest known organometallic compound and was synthesized and analyzed in ca by Zeise although its coordination structure was assumed only in and confirmed by the neutron diffraction in The mode of coordination of an olefin to a transition metal is described by the DewarChattDuncanson model and the bond between the metal and olefin is stabilized by the contribution of dp back donation An olefin is a electron ligand and there are many olefin complexes in which the central metal is in a relatively low oxidation state Dienes or trienes with two or more double bonds coordinate to a metal as electron or electron ligands FeCOCH and Nicod in which a butadiene or cyclooctadienes cod are coordinated to the metal are well known examples Since cyclooctadienes are easily eliminated from Nicod it is conveniently used for generating atomic zero valent nickel This complex is sometimes called naked nickel Figure Backdonation in olefin complexes Arene complexes Aromatic compounds are electron donors that coordinate to transition metals in the coordination mode with six carbon atoms Bisbenzenechromium CrCH is a typical example of such a compound The compound is prepared by reducing chromium chloride in benzene and it has a sandwich structure in which a chromium atom is insertedb etween two benzene rings When a benzene ligand is replaced by three carbonyls CrCOCH is obtained electron rule Counting valence electrons is of utmost importance in chemistry Changes in the number of valence electrons has a profound influence on the bonding structure and reactions of a compound Since both the metal and organic moieties are involved in organometallic compounds counting the number of electrons becomes complicated Hydrocarbyl ligands are classified as either neutral molecules coordinating to the metal or radicals bonding to the metal and the radicals such as alkyls and cyclopentadienyl are generally called anionic ligands Transfer of one electron from the metal to the radical ligand makes the ligand formally anionic However it is less confusing to consider that both the metal and the ligands are neutral when counting the number of valence electrons The numbers of donor electrons in typical carbon ligands from this viewpoint are listed in Table It is important to note that even in the same ligand the number of donor electrons supplied by the ligand differs depending upon the number of ligating atoms that have coordinative interactions with the metal For example or electrons can be donated from a cyclopentadienyl ligand depending on the type of coordinative interactions with the metal When the total number of valence electrons of the metal and ligands is a transition metal organometallic compound usually has high thermal stability For example CrCO FeCO NiCO FeCH MoCHCO etc satisfy the electron rule but the monomeric parts of MnCO CoCO or FeCHCO have only electrons and the extra electron comes from the partner metal by forming a metalmetal bond Unlike the electron rule in main group compounds applicability of the electron rule is limited That is to say it is a sufficient condition but compounds with high thermal stability are not necessarily electron compounds Although there are many Group chromium group through Group cobalt group organometallic compounds with carbonyl or cyclopentadienyl ligands that satisfy the electron rule many compounds of the early transition metals Group and Group nickel group fail to conform to this rule For example WCH e TiClCH e and IrClCOPPh e VCO e CoCH e NiCH e etc do not satisfy the electron rule However the electron rule provides useful clues as to the bonding modes present in a given complex For example FeCHCO with two pentahapto cyclopentadienyl ligands formally has electrons but if one of the ligands is monohapto the compound has electrons Structural analysis has shown that this is the actual coordination of this complex Exercise Calculate the valence electron number of CpMnCO Answer They are a total of electrons from Mn Cp and three CO c Phosphine complexes Tertiary phosphines PX are very useful as stabilization ligands in transition metal complexes and they coordinate to the metals in relatively high to low oxidation states Phosphines are frequently used as carbonyl or cyclopentadienyl ligands in the chemistry of organometallic complexes PX are Lewis bases and coordinate to the metal using the lone pair on phosphorus and show acidity when carrying substituents X including Ph Cl or F that have strong electron accepting properties The electronic flexibility of PX is the reason it forms so many complexes Generally the πacidity becomes smaller in the order PF PCl PPh PR Triphenylphosphine and triethylphosphine are typical substituted phosphines The tertiaryphosphine complexes mainly of metal halides are listed in Table Manganese Mn and the early transition metals form very few phosphine complexes Table Typical tertiary phosphine complexes dmpe bisdimethylphosphinoethane dppe bisdiphenylphosphinoethane TiClPPh

AuClPPh Many derivatives can be prepared by substituting the halogens of the phosphine complexes A number of the complexes of polydentate phosphines with more than two coordination sites as well as those of monodentate phosphines have been prepared and they are used also as stabilization ligands in hydride alkyl dinitrogen and dihydrogen complexes The complexes of rhodium or ruthenium in which optically active phosphines are coordinated are excellent catalysts for asymmetric synthesis Oxidation and reduction Last updated Save as PDF Page ID a Oxidation numberb Redox reactionsc Latimer diagram a Oxidation number The oxidation number is the formal electrical charge of a component atom in a compound or in an ion allocated in such a way that the atom with smaller electronegativity has a positive charge Since electrical charges do not differ in the case of a molecule composed of the same atoms the oxidation number of the atoms is the quotient of the net electrical charge divided by the number of atoms In the case of a compound or an ion consisting of different atoms the atoms with larger electronegativity can be considered as anions and those with smaller electronegativity as cations For example nitrogen is valent in N oxygen is in O nitrogen is and oxygen in NO but nitrogen is and hydrogen in NH That is the oxidation number can be different for the same atom combined with different partners and the atom is said to be in the formal oxidation state corresponding to that oxidation number Although this does not express the quantitative deviation of the actual electric charge it is convenient in counting valence electrons or in dealing with redox reactions Exercise Which halogen has the largest oxidizing power Answer Since the reduction potential of fluorine is the highest its oxidizing power is the largest b Redox reactions Originally oxidation meant the formation of oxides from elements or the formation of compounds by the action of oxygen and reduction is the reverse of oxidation The present definition of reduction is a reaction which gives an electron and oxidation is the reaction which takes an electron Therefore a reagent which gives an electron is a reductant and one which takes an electron is an oxidant As a result of a redox reaction a reductant is oxidized and an oxidant is reduced For example in the reaction of molybdenum metal and chlorine gas to form molybdenum pentachloride molybdenum is a reductant and changes its oxidation state from to and chlorine is an oxidant and changes its oxidation state from to c Latimer diagram A Latimer diagram is a diagram in which the chemical species in the highest oxidation state is placed at the left end and a series of the reduced chemical species of the same atom are arranged to the righthand side in the order of the oxidation states and the standard reduction potentials V are written above the line which connects each state This diagram is convenient for discussing a redox reaction Since electric potential differs between an acidic and a basic solution different diagrams are required depending on the pH of the solution Taking the series of the oxides and hydrides of nitrogen in acidic solution as an example in a basic solution the series becomes The additivity of the state function G is used in order to calculate the standard reduction potential between remote oxidation states Where the free energy change and electric potential between adjacent states are respectively and the number of transferred electrons n n Namely For example in the reduction of NO to HNO two electrons are transferred to form HNO via NO and the potential becomes Exercise Calculate the reduction potential of the reduction of NO to NO in a basic solution Answer In recent years whenever a new inorganic compound is synthesized its redox properties are investigated usually by electrochemical measurements Cyclic voltammetry is the technique of choice for the study of its redox properties including the electric potential the number of transferred electrons and the reversibility of the reactions etc because of the simplicity of the measurements It is approximately correct to consider that the oxidation potential corresponds to the energy level of the HOMO because oxidation usually takes an electron from the HOMO and the reduction potential to the level of the LUMO since reduction adds an electron to the LUMO However various factors such as solvent effects should be taken into consideration during quantitative discussions of redox processes Oxygen and oxides Part Last updated Save as

major components of water and rocks oxygen is the most abundant element on the Earths surface Despite its abundance it was established as an element as late as the th century Since an immense quantity of oxygen gas is consumed for steel production now it is separated in large quantities from liquified air The isotopes of oxygen are O abundance O and O O has nuclear spin I and is an important nuclide for NMR measurements O is used as a tracer for tracking reagents or for the study of reaction mechanisms It is also useful for the assignment of absorption lines in infrared or Raman spectra by means of isotope effects As already described in section e dioxygen O in the ground state has two unpaired spins in its molecular orbitals shows paramagnetism and is called triplet dioxygen In the excited state the spins are paired and dioxygen becomes diamagnetic which is called singlet dioxygen Singlet dioxygen is important in synthetic chemistry because it has characteristic oxidation reactivity Singlet dioxygen is generated in a solution by an energy transfer reaction from a photoactivated complex or by the pyrolysis of ozonides O compounds Superoxide ion O and peroxide ion O are the anions of dioxygen Table They can be isolated as alkali metal salts There is another state O called the dioxygen cation and it can be isolated as a salt with suitable anions Table Oxidation states of dioxygen Bond order Compound OO distance Å νOO cm O OAsF O O KO O NaO Ozone O is an allotrope of oxygen that is an unstable gas with an irritating odor Ozone is a bent threeatom molecule and has unique reactivities In recent years it has been discovered that ozone plays an important role in intercepting the detrimental ultraviolet radiation from the sun in the upper atmospheric zone and in protecting life on the Earth from photochemical damage It is now clear that chlorofluorocarbons frequently used as refrigerants or as cleaners of electronic components destroy the ozone layer and measures are being taken on a global scale to cope with this serious environmental problem b Oxides of hydrogen Oxygen is highly reactive and direct reactions with many elements form oxides Water is an oxide of hydrogen and is crucially important for the global environment and life in general Water HO Ninetyseven percent of water on the Earth is present as sea water as ice of the polar zone and fresh water represents only the small remaining fraction Fundamental chemical and physical properties of water are very significant to chemistry The main physical properties are shown in Table Most of the unusual properties of water are caused by its strong hydrogen bonds Physical properties of water differ considerably with the presence of isotopes of hydrogen At least nine polymorphs of ice are known and their crystal structures depend on the freezing conditions of the ice Water has a bond angle of and a bond distance of pm as a free molecule It is described in Section b that selfdissociation of water generates oxonium ion HO Further water molecules add to HO to form HOHn HO HO HO and HO and the structures of the various species have been determined Hydrogen peroxide HO Hydrogen peroxide is an almost colorless liquid mp C and bp extrapolated C that is highly explosive and dangerous in high concentrations Usually it is used as a dilute solution but occasionally aqueous solutions are used Since it is consumed in large quantities as a bleaching agent for fiber and paper largescale industrial synthetic process has been established This process applies very subtle catalytic reactions to produce a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide from air and hydrogen using a substituted anthraquinone This dilute solution is then concentrated When deuterium peroxide is prepared in a laboratory the following reaction is applied Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed into oxygen and water in the presence of catalysts such as manganese dioxide MnO Hydrogen peroxide may be either an oxidant or a reductant depending on its coreactants Its reduction potential in an acidic solution expressed in a Latimer diagram refer to Section c is c Silicon oxides Silicon oxides are formed by taking SiO tetrahedra as structural units and sharing the corner oxygen atoms They are classified by the number of cornersharing oxygen atoms in the SiO tetrahedra as this determines their composition and structure When the SiO tetrahedra connect by corner sharing the structures of the polymeric compounds become a chain a ring a layer or dimensional depending on the connection modes of adjacent units Fractional expression is adopted in order to show the bridging modes Namely the numerator in the fraction is the number of bridging oxygens and the denominator is meaning that one oxygen atom is shared by two tetrahedra The empirical formulae are as follows and each structure is illustrated in Figure in coordinationpolyhedron form A bridge is constructed with one oxygen atom SiOO SiO Bridges are constructed with two oxygen atoms SiOOnn SiOnn Bridges are constructed with three oxygen atoms SiOOnn SiOnn Amalgamation of bridging modes with three oxygen and two oxygen atoms SiOSiOOn SiOn Bridges are constructed with four oxygen atoms SiOn SiOn Silicates with various cross linkage structures are contained in natural rocks sand clay soil etc Figure Bridging modes of the SiO tetrahedra Aluminosilicates There are many minerals in which some silicon atoms of silicate minerals are replaced by aluminum atoms They are called aluminosilicates Aluminum atoms replace the silicon atoms in the tetrahedral sites or occupy the octahedral cavities of oxygen atoms making the structures more complicated The substitution of a tetravalent silicon by a trivalent aluminum causes a shortage of charge which is compensated by occlusion of extra cations such as H Na Ca etc Feldspars are a typical aluminosilicate mineral and KAlSiO orthoclase and NaAlSiO albite are also known well Feldspars take dimensional structures in which all the corners of the SiO and AlO tetrahedra are shared On the other hand dimensional layers are formed if AlSiO units are lined and stratified minerals like mica are constructed if coordinate ions are inserted between layers If the number of oxygen atoms in the layers is not enough to form regular octahedra between layers hydroxide groups bond to the interstitial Al ions Muscovite KAlOHSiAlO is a type of mica with such a structure and can be eas ily peeled into layers Zeolite One of the important aluminosilicates is zeolite Zeolites are present as natural minerals and also many kinds of zeolites are prepared synthetically in large quantities The SiO and AlO tetrahedra are bonded by oxygen bridges and form holes and tunnels of various sizes The structures are composites of the basic structural units of tetrahedral MO As shown in Figure the basic units are cubes with condensed MO hexagonal prisms with condensed MO and truncated octahedra with condensed MO Figure Structure of zeolite A Silicon or aluminum atoms are located on the corners of the polyhedra and the bridging oxygen atoms on the middle of each edge it should be noted that this expression is different from the polyhedron model of oxides When these polyhdra are bonded various kinds of zeolite structures are formed For example the truncated octahedra called cages are the basic frames of synthetic zeolite A NaAlSiO HO and the quadrangle portions are connected through cubes It can be seen that an octagonal tunnel B forms when eight truncated octahedra bind in this way The structure in which the hexagon portions connect through hexagonal prisms is faujasite NaCaAlSiO HO Alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cations exist in the holes and the number of these cations increases with the content of aluminum to compensate for the charge deficiency The structures of zeolites have many crevices in which cations and water are contained Utilizing this cationexchange property zeolites are used in large quantities as softeners of hard water As zeolites dehydrated by heating absorb water efficiently they are also used as desiccants of solvents or gases Zeolites are sometimes called molecular sieves since the sizes of holes and tunnels change with the kinds of zeolites and it is possible to segregate organic molecules according to their sizes Zeolites can fix the directions of more than two molecules in their cavities and can be used as catalysts for selective reactions For example synthetic zeolite ZSM is useful as a catalyst to convert methanol to gasoline This zeolite is prepared hydrothermally in an autoclave highpressure reaction vessel at ca C using metasodium luminate NaAlO as the source of aluminum oxide and silica sol as the source of silicon oxide with tetrapropylammonium bromide PrNBr present in the reaction The role of this ammonium salt is a kind of mold to form zeolite holes of a fixed size When the ammonium salt is removed by calcination at C the zeolite structure remains d Nitrogen oxides A variety of nitrogen oxides will be described sequentially from lower to higher oxidation numbers Table Table Typical oxides of main group elements LiO BeO BO CO CO NO NO NO NaO NaO NaO MgO AlO SiO PO PO SO SO ClO ClO KO KO KO CaO ZnO GaO GeO AsO AsO SeO SeO RbO RbO RbO SrO CdO InO SnO SbO SbO TeO TeO IO XeO XeO CsO CsO BaO HgO TlO TlO PbO PbO BiO Dinitrogen monoxide NO Oxide of monovalent nitrogen Pyrolysis of ammonium nitrate generates this oxide as follows Although the oxidation number is a formality it is an interesting and symbolic aspect of the versatility of the oxidation number of nitrogen that NHNO forms a monovalent nitrogen oxide is a half of the average of and for NH and NO respectively The NNO bond distances of the straight NO are pm NN and pm NO corresponding to th and th bond order respectively NO e is isoelectronic with carbon dioxide CO e This compound is also called laughing gas and is widely used for analgesia Nitric oxide NO An oxide of divalent nitrogen This is obtained by reduction of nitrite as follows Having an odd number of valence electrons electrons it is paramagnetic The NO distance is pm and the bond has double bond character The unpaired electron in the highest antibonding orbital is easily removed and NO becomes NO nitrosonium which is isoelectronic with CO Since an electron is lost from the antibonding orbital the NO bond becomes stronger The compounds NOBF and NOHSO containing this cation are used as electron oxidants Although NO is paramagnetic as a monomer in the gas phase dimerization in the ondensed phase leads to diamagnetism It is unique as a ligand of transition metal complexes and forms complexes like FeCONO in which NO is a neutral electron ligand Although MNO is straight in these kind of complexes the MNO angle bends to in CoNHNO Br in which NO coordinates as a electron ligand It has become clear recently that nitric oxide has various biological control functions such as bloodpressure depressing action and it attracts attention as the second inorganic material after Ca to play a role in signal transduction Dinitrogen trioxide NO The oxidation number of nitrogen is and this is an unstable compound decomposing into NO and NO at room temperature It is generated when equivalent quantities of NO and NO are condensed at low temperatures It is light blue in the solid state and dark blue in the liquid state but the color fades at higher temperatures Nitrogen dioxide NO A nitrogen compound with oxidation number It is an odd electron compound with an unpaired electron and is dark reddish brown in color It is in equilibrium with the colorless dimer dinitrogen tetroxide NO The proportion of NO is at C and it increases gradually to at its boiling point C and becomes at C NO can be generated by the pyrolysis of lead nitrate as follows When NO is dissolved in water nitric acid and nitrous acid are formed By one electron oxidation NO nitroyl forms and the ONO angle changes from to in the neutral NO On the other hand by one electron reduction NO nitrito forms and the angle bends to Dinitrogen pentoxide NO is obtained when concentrated nitric acid is carefully dehydrated with phosphorus pentoxide at low temperatures It sublimes at C As it forms nitric acid by dissolving in water it may also be called a nitric anhydride Although it assumes an ionpair structure NONO and straight NO and planar NO ions are located alternately in the solid phase it is molecular in the gas phase Oxoacids Oxyacids of nitrogen include nitric acid HNO nitrous acid HNO and hyponitrous acid HNO Nitric acid HNO is one of the most important acids in the chemical industry along with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid Nitric acid is produced industrially by the Ostwald process which is the oxidation reaction of ammonia in which the oxidation number of nitrogen increases from to Because the Gibbs energy of the direct conversion of dinitrogen to the intermediate NO is positive and therefore the reaction is unfavorable thermodynamically dinitrogen is firstly reduced to ammonia and this is then oxidized to NO Nitric acid HNO Commercial nitric acid is a ca aqueous solution and vacuum distillation of it in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide gives pure nitric acid As it is a srong oxidizing agent while also being a strong acid it can dissolve metals copper silver lead etc which do not dissolve in other acids Gold and platinum can even be dissolved in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid aqua regia The nitrate ion NO and nitrite ion NO take various coordination forms when they coordinate as ligands in transition metal complexes Nitrous acid HNO Although not isolated as a pure compound aqueous solutions are weak acids pKa at C and important reagents Since NaNO is used industrially for hydroxylamine NHOH production and also used for diazotidation of aromatic amines it is important for the manufacture of azo dyes and drugs Among the various coordination forms of NO isomers now known monodentate nitro Ncoordination and nitrito Ocoordination ligands had already been discovered in the th century e Phosphorus oxides The structures of the phosphorus oxides PO PO PO and PO have been determined Phosphorus pentoxide PO is a white crystalline and sublimable solid that is formed when phosphorus is oxidized completely Four phosphorus atoms form a tetrahedron and they are bridged by oxygen atoms refer to Figure Since a terminal oxygen atom is bonded to each phosphorus atom the coordination polyhedron of oxygen is also a tetrahedron When the molecular PO is heated a vitrified isomer is formed This is a polymer composed of similar tetrahedra of phosphorus oxide with the same composition that are connected to one another in sheets Since it is very reactive with water phosphorus pentoxide is a powerful dehydrating agent It is used not only as a desiccant but also it has remarkable dehydration properties and NO or SO can be formed by dehydration of HNO or HSO respectively Phosphorus pentoxide forms orthophosphoric acid HPO when reacted with sufficient water but if insufficient water is used various kinds of condensed phosphoric acids are produced depending on the quantity of reacting water Phosphorus trioxide PO is a molecular oxide and its tetrahedral structure results from the removal of only the terminal oxygen atoms from phosphorus pentoxide Each phosphorus is tricoordinate This compound is formed when white phosphorus is oxidized at low temperatures in insufficient oxygen The oxides with compositions intermediate between phosphorus pentoxide and trioxide have to terminal oxygen atoms and their structures have been analyzed Although arsenic and antimony give molecular oxides AsO and SbO that have similar structures to PO bismuth forms a polymeric oxide of composition BiO Phosphoric acid Orthophosphoric acid HPO It is one of the major acids used in chemical industry and is produced by the hydration reaction of phosphorus pentoxide PO Commercial phosphoric acid is usually of purity The pure acid is a crystalline compound mp C One terminal oxygen atom and three OH groups are bonded to the phosphorus atom in the center of a tetrahedron The three OH groups release protons making the acid tribasic pK When two orthophosphoric acid molecules condense by the removal of an HO molecule pyrophosphoric acid HPO is formed Phosphonic acid HPO This acid is also called phosphorous acid and has H in place of one of the OH groups of orthophosphoric acid Since there are only two OH groups it is a dibasic acid Phosphinic acid HPO It is also called hypophosphorous acid and two of the OH groups in orthophosphoric acid are replaced by H atoms The remaining one OH group shows monobasic acidity If the PO tetrahedra in the above phosphorus acids bind by O bridges many condensed phosphoric acids form Adenosine triphosphate ATP deoxyribonucleic acid DNA etc in which the triphosphorus acid moieties are combined with adenosine are phosphorus compounds that are fundamentally important for living organisms f Sulfur oxides Sulfur dioxide SO This is formed by the combustion of sulfur or sulfur compounds This is a colorless and poisonous gas bp C and as an industrial emission is one of the greatest causes of environmental problems However it is very important industrially as a source material of sulfur Sulfur dioxide is an angular molecule and recently it has been demonstrated that it takes various coordination modes as a ligand to transition metals It is a nonaqueous solvent similar to liquid ammonia and is used for special reactions or as a solvent for special NMR measurements Sulfur trioxide SO It is produced by catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide and used for manufacturing sulfuric acid The usual commercial reagent is a liquid bp C The gaseous phase monomer is a planar molecule It is in equilibrium with a ring trimer SO SO in the gaseous or liquid phase In the presence of a minute amount of water SO changes to SO which is a crystalline high polymer with a helical structure SO is also known as a solid of still more complicated lamellar structure All react violently with water to form sulfuric acid Sulfur acids Although there are many oxy acids of sulfur most of them are unstable and cannot be isolated They are composed of a combination of SO SOH SOS and SS bonds with a central sulfur atom As the oxidation number of sulfur atoms varies widely various redox equilibria are involved Sulfuric acid HSO It is an important basic compound produced in the largest quantity of all inorganic compounds Pure sulfuric acid is a viscous liquid mp C and dissolves in water with the generation of a large amount of heat to give strongly acidic solutions Thiosulfuric acid HSO Although it is generated if thiosulfate is acidified the free acid is unstable The SO ion is derived from the replacement of one of the oxygen atoms of SO by sulfur and is mildly reducing Sulfurous acid HSO The salt is very stable although the free acid has not been isolated The SO ion that has pyramidal Cv symmetry is a reducing agent In dithionic acid HSO and the dithionite ion SO the oxidation number of sulfer is and one SS bond is formed This is a very strong reducing agent g Metal oxides Oxides of all the metallic elements are known and they show a wide range of properties in terms of structures acidity and basicity and conductivity Namely an oxide can exhibit molecular dimensional chain dimensional layer or dimensional structures There are basic amphoteric and acidic oxides depending on the identity of the metallic element Moreover the range of physical properties displayed is also broad from insulators to semicondutors metallic conductors and superconductors The compositions of metallic oxide can be simply stoichiometric stoichiometric but not simple or sometimes nonstoichiometric Therefore it is better to classify oxides according to each property However since structures give the most useful information to understand physical and chemical properties typical oxides are classified first

πbonding from the sideways overlap of porbitals in the MO diagrams of secondrow diatomics BO It is important to remember that πbonds are weaker than σ bonds made from the same AOs and are especially weak if they involve elements beyond the second row Example Ethylene Stable molecule doesnt polymerize without a catalyst Silylene Never isolated spontaneously polymerizes Calculations indicate kJmol stability in the gas phase relative to singlybonded triplet HSiSiH The large Ne core of Si atoms inhibits sideways overlap of p orbitals weak πbond Other examples P vs N P cannot make πbonds with itself so it forms a tetrahedral molecule with substantial ring strain This allotrope of P undergoes spontaneous combustion in air Solid white phosphorus very slowly converts to red phosphorus a more stable allotrope that contains sheets of pyramidal P atoms each with bonds to three neighboring atoms and one lone pair White phosphorus P is a soft waxy solid that ignites spontaneously in air burning with a bright flame and generating copious white PO smoke The sample shown here is photographed under water to prevent the oxidation reaction N can make πbonds so N has a very strong triple

ChlorideWaterSummaryContributors and Attributions Learning Objectives Demonstrate how photoelectron spectoscopy can be used to resolve the absolution energies of molecular orbitals Photoelectron spectroscopy PES utilizes photoionization and analysis of the kinetic energy distribution of the emitted photoelectrons to study the composition and electronic state of the surface region of a sample Xray Photoelectron Spectroscopy XPS uses soft xrays with a photon energy of eV to examine electrons in corelevels Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy UPS using vacuum UV radiation with a photon energy of eV to examine electrons in valence levels Both photoelectron spectroscopy is based upon a single photon inelectron out process The energy of a photon of all types of electromagnetic radiation is given by the PlanckEinstein relation where is Planck constant and is the frequency Hz of the radiation UPS is a powerful technique to exam molecular electron structure since we are interested in the molecular orbitals from polyatomic molecules especially the valence orbitals and is the topic of this Module Figure Diagram of a basic typical PES instrument used in UPS where the radiation source is an UV light source When the sample is irradiated the released photoelectrons pass through the lens system which slows them down before they enter the energy analyzer The analyzer shown is a spherical deflection analyzer which the photoelectrons pass through before they are collected at the collector slit CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Photoelectron spectroscopy uses monochromatic sources of radiation ie photons of fixed energy In UPS the photon interacts with valence levels of the molecule or solid leading to ionization by removal of one of these valence electrons The kinetic energy distribution of the emitted photoelectrons ie the number of emitted photoelectrons as a function of their kinetic energy can be measured using any appropriate electron energy analyzer and a photoelectron spectrum can thus be recorded The process of photoionization can be considered in several ways One way is to look at the overall process for a species Conservation of energy then requires that after using Equation Since the free electrons energy is present solely as kinetic energy ie there is no internal energy in a free electron Equation can then be rearranged to give the following expression for the KE of the photoelectron The final term in brackets represents the difference in energy between the ionized and neutral species and is generally called the vertical ionization energy of the ejected electron this then leads to the following commonly quoted equations or The vertical ionization energy is a direct measure of the energy required to just remove the electron concerned from its initial level to the vacuum level free electron Photoelectron spectroscopy measures the relative energies of the ground and excited positive ion states that are obtained by removal of single electrons from the neutral molecule Note Equation ref may look familiar to you as it the same equation Einstein used to describe the photoelectric effect except the vertical ionization energy is substituted for workfunction Both vertical ionization energy and workfunctions are metrics for the binding energy of an electron in the sample At a fundamental level ionization energies are welldefined thermodynamic quantities related to the heats of protonation oxidationreduction chemistry and ionic and covalent bond energies Ionization energies are closely related to the concepts of electronegativity electronrichness and the general reactivity of molecules The energies and other characteristic features of the ionization bands observed in photoelectron spectroscopy provide some of the molecular orbitals detailed and specific quantitative information regarding the electronic structure and bonding in molecules Figure Vertical ionization process for molecular hydrogen CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Ionization is explicitly defined in terms of transitions between the ground state of a molecule and ion states as shown in Equation and as illustrated in the Figure Nonetheless the information obtained from photoelectron spectroscopy is typically discussed in terms of the electronic structure and bonding in the ground states of neutral molecules with ionization of electrons occurring from bonding molecular orbitals lone pairs antibonding molecular orbitals or atomic cores These descriptions reflect the relationship of ionization energies to the molecular orbital model of electronic structure Ionization energies are directly related to the energies of molecular orbitals by Koopmans theorem which states that the negative of the eigenvalue of an occupied orbital from a HartreeFock calculation is equal to the vertical ionization energy to the ion state formed by removal of an electron from that orbital Figure provided the distributions of the remaining electrons do not change ie frozen There are many limitations to Koopmans theorem but in a first order approximation each ionization of a molecule can be considered as removal of an electron from an individual orbital The ionization energies can then be considered as measures of orbital stabilities and shifts can be interpreted in terms of orbital stabilizations or destabilizations due to electron distributions and bonding Koopmans theorem is implicated whenever an orbital picture is involved but is not necessary when the focus is on the total electronic states of the positive ions Figure Within Koopmans Theorem the energies of the orbitals epsilon have an attractively simple physical interpretation they give the amount of energy necessary to remove ionize the electron out of the molecular orbital which corresponds to the negative of the experimentally observable ionization potential CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Koopmans Theorem Koopmans theorem argues that the negative of the eigenvalue of an occupied orbital from a HartreeFock calculation is equal to the vertical ionization energy to the ion state formed by removal of an electron from that orbital Several different ionization energies can be defined depending on the degree of vibrational excitation of the cations In general the following two types of ionization energies are considered Figure Adiabatic ionization energy corresponds to the ionization energy associated with this transition Adiabatic ionization energy that is the minimum energy required to eject an electron from a molecule in its ground vibrational state and transform it into a cation in the lowest vibrational level of an electronic state x of the cation Vertical ionization energy corresponds to the ionization energy associated with this transition where the value n of the vibrational quantum number v corresponds to the vibrational level whose wavefunction gives the largest overlap with the v wavefunction This is the most probable transition and usually corresponds to the vertical transition where the internuclear separations of the ionic state are similar to those of the ground state Figure Difference between vertical and adiabatic ionization energies for a simple harmonic oscillator system CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The geometry of an ion may be different from the neutral molecule The measured ionzation energy in a PES experiment can refer to the vertical ionization energy in which case the ion is in the same geometry as the neutral or to the adiabatic ionzaiton energy in which case the ion is in its lowest energy relaxed geometry mostly the former though This is illustrated in the Figure For a diatomic the only geometry change possible is the bond length The figure shows an ion with a slightly longer bond length than the neutral The harmonic potential energy surfaces are shown in green neutral and red ion with vibrational energy levels The vertical ionzation energy is always greater than the adiabatic ionzation energy Differing Ionization Energies You have been exposed to three metrics of ionization energies already which are similar but with distinct differences The ionization energy also called adiabatic ionization energy is the lowest energy required to effect the removal of an electron from a molecule or atom and corresponds to the transition from the lowest electronic vibrational and rotational level of the isolated molecule to the lowest electronic vibrational and rotational level of the isolated ion The binding energy also called vertical ionization energy is the energy change corresponding to an ionization reaction leading to formation of the ion in a configuration which is the same as that of the equilibrium geometry of the ground state neutral molecule The workfunction is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a bulk solid to a point in the vacuum Example Molecular Hydrogen As you remember the molecular orbital description of hydrogen involves two atomic orbitals generating a bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals The two electrons that are responsible for the bond are occupied in the MO diagram and PES spectrum of CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The PES spectrum has a single band that corresponds to the ionization of a σg electron The multiple peaks are due to electrons ejecting from a range of stimulated vibrational energy levels When extensive vibrational structure is resolved in a PES molecular orbital then the removal of an electron from that molecular orbital induces a significant change in the bonding in this case an increase in the bond length since the bond order has been reduced Example Molecular Nitrogen Diatomic nitrogen is more complex than hydrogen since multiple molecular orbitals are occupied Four molecular orbitals are occupied the two orbitals are both occupied The UV photoelectron spectrum of has three bands corresponding to and occupied molecular orbitals Both and are weakly bonding and antibonding The orbital is not resolved in this spectrum since the incident light used did not have sufficient energy to ionize electrons in that deeply stabilized molecular orbital MO diagram and PES spectrum of CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Note that extensive vibrational structure for the band indicates that the removal of an electron from this molecular orbital causes a significant change in the bonding Hydrogen Chloride The molecular energy level diagram for is reproduced in Figure Figure Molecular Orbital EnergyLevel Diagram for HCl The hydrogen s atomic orbital interacts molecular orbitals strongly with the pz orbital on chlorine producing a bondingantibonding pair of molecular orbitals The other electrons on Cl are best viewed as nonbonding As a result only the bonding σ orbital is occupied by electrons giving a bond order of CC BYNC Ümit Kaya Important aspects of molecular orbital diagram in Figure The H s energy lies well above the Cl s and p atomic orbitals The valence electron configuration can be written σπ The H s orbital contributes only to the σ molecular orbitals as does one of the Cl p orbitals hence the lines in Figure connecting these atomic orbitals and the σ and σ molecular orbitals The remaining Cl p orbitals ie those perpendicular to the bond axis are unaffected by bonding and these form the π molecular orbitals The π orbitals are nonbonding they are not affected energetically by the interaction between the atoms and are hence neither bonding nor antibonding The σ orbital is weakly bonding and largely Cl p The σ orbital is antibonding and primarily of H s character Figure shows the analogous MO diagram and photoelectron spectrum for The spectrum has two bands corresponding to nonbonding p or molecular orbitals with negligible vibrational structure and the s bonding molecular orbital vibrational structure Figure Photoelectron spectrum CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The higher energy more stabilized core molecular orbitals are not observed since the incident photon energy is below their ionization energies Water In the simplified valence bond theory perspective of the water molecule the oxygen atom form four hybrid orbitals Two of these are occupied by the two lone pairs on the oxygen atom while the other two are used for bonding Within the molecular orbital picture the electronic configuration of the molecule is where the symbols and are orbital labels based on molecular symmetry that will be discussed later Figure Within Koopmans theorem The energy of the b HOMO corresponds to the ionization energy to form the ion in its ground state The energy of the secondhighest molecular orbitals refers to the ion in the excited state Figure MO diagram for water CC BYNC Ümit Kaya The HartreeFock orbital energies with sign changed of these orbitals are tablulated below and compared to the experimental ionization energies Molecular orbital HartreeFock orbital Energies eV Experimental Ionization Energies eV a b a b As explained above the deviations between orbital energy and ionization energy is small and due to the effects of orbital relaxation as well as differences in electron correlation energy between the molecular and the various ionized states The molecular orbital perspective has the lone pair in different orbitals one in a nonbonding orbital and one in the bonding orbitals We tern to the photoelectron spectroscopy to help identify which theory is more accurate ie describes reality better The photoelectron spectrum of water in Figure can be interpreted as having three major peaks with some fine structure arises from vibrational energy changes The light source used in this experiment is not sufficiently energetic to ionize electrons from the lowest lying molecular orbitals Figure Photoelectron spectrum of water Note the energy axes is flipped compared to other spectra on this pagehis spectrum does not go to high enough energy to show the deep molecular orbital If water was formed two identical OH bonds and two lone pairs on the oxygen atom line valence bond theory predicts then the PES in Figure would have two degenerate peaks one for the two bonds and one for the two lone pairs The photoelectron spectrum clearly shows three peaks in the positions expected for the molecular orbitals in Figure If the molecular orbitals in Figure represent the real electronic structure how do we view the bonding These molecular orbitals are delocalized and bare little relationship to the familiar center bonds used in valence bond theory For example the and molecular orbitals all have contributions from all three atoms they are really centered molecular orbitals The bonds however can be thought of as representing a build up of the total electron density which loosely put is a total of all the orbital contributions Despire this we keep the ideas of hybridization and center bonds because they are useful NOT because they represent reality Summary A photoelecton spectrum can show the relative energies of occupied molecular orbitals by ionization ie ejection of an electron A photoelectron spectrum can also be used to determine energy spacing between vibrational levels of a given electronic state

strong tradition in the development of magnets and has made many epochmaking magnetic materials for practical use Alnico magnets with Fe Ni and Al as their main constituents ferrite magnets composed of solid solutions of CoFeO and FeO cobaltrare earth magnets such as SmCo and NbFeB magnets were especially significant achievements Since soft magnetic materials are strongly magnetized in weak magnetic fields they are most suitable for use as core materials in transformers Hard magnetic properties are necessary for the stable maintenance of information whereas soft magnetic properties are required for recording and overwriting information in magnetic recording materials such as magnetic tapes floppy disks and hard disks Although FeO is a typical magnetic powder used for these purposes Co or crystalline CrO is added to it to improve its magnetic properties Recording materials as well as semiconductor devices are indispensable to our modern informationoriented society and the role played by inorganic chemistry in the improvement of the performance of these materials is significant Recently ferromagnetism of organic compounds or metal complexes has been discovered in which unpaired spins are aligned parallel in a molecule and coupled ferromagnetically The study of molecular magnets has the subject of intensive investigation Molecular design to couple paramagnetic metal complexes and to make spins parallel is an interesting subject in coordination chemistry c Optical properties Mainly inorganic substances are used as materials for optical applications The optical fiber in particular has been used for optical communications on a large scale and has had a major social influence in information communication A necessary property of good optical glass materials is the transmission of information to distant places with little optical loss Silica fibers are manufactured by lengthening silica glass rods produced from silica grains The silica is made from ultra pure SiCl which is oxidized in the vapor phase by an oxyhydrogen flame As the optical loss along fibers obtained by this method has already reached its theoretical limit fluoride glasses are being used in the search for materials with lower levels of loss Compound semiconductors such as GaP are widely used as laser light emitting diodes for optical communications CD players laser printers etc A

Consider how to locate each atom in such a unit cell Structurefunction correlation Since all the naturally occurring elements have been discovered various bonding modes are established and the structures of compounds can be readily determined studies of the chemical properties of inorganic compounds will give way to studies of reactions and physical properties The synthesis of new compounds and the elucidation of structurefunction correlations will be the foundations of these studies although the is distant It is considerably difficult quantitatively to explain the thermal stability of a known inorganic compound using our present knowledge of theoretical chemistry and it is almost impossible fully to design compounds by a rational method Although the selectivity of a catalytic reaction can be explained to some extent the theoretical calculation of a reaction rate remains difficult The relation between superconductivity and structure is not understood well and critical temperatures cannot be predicted Many of the structures and functions of the metalloenzymes that are the basis of biological activities are unknown The research problems confronting the next

Pourbaix Diagrams Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Pourbaix Diagrams plot electrochemical stability for different redox states of an element as a function of pH As noted above these diagrams are essentially phase diagrams that map the conditions of potential and pH most typically in aqueous solutions where different redox species are stable We saw a simple example of such a diagram in section for HO Typically the water redox reactions are plotted as dotted lines on these more complicated diagrams for other elements The lines in Pourbaix diagrams represent redox and acidbase reactions and are the parts of the diagram where two species can exist in equilibrium For example in the Pourbaix diagram for Fe below the horizontal line between the Fe and Fe regions represents the reaction which has a standard potential of V While we could use standard potentials for all these lines in practice Pourbaix diagrams are usually plotted for lower ion concentrations often mM that are more relevant to corrosion and electrochemical experiments Example Iron Pourbaix diagram Areas in the Pourbaix diagram mark regions where a single species Feaq FeOs etc is stable More stable species tend to occupy larger areas Lines mark places where two species exist in equilibrium Pure redox reactions are horizontal lines these reactions are not pHdependent Pure acidbase reactions are vertical lines these do not depend on potential Reactions that are both acidbase and redox have a slope of VpH x H e Figure Pourbaix diagram for iron at ionic concentrations of mM CC BYSA Unported Metallos via Wikipedia Examples of equilibria in the iron Pourbaix diagram numbered on the plot pure redox reaction no pH dependence pure redox reaction no pH dependence pure acidbase no redox slope x mVpH slope x mVpH The water redox lines have special significance on a Pourbaix diagram for an element such as iron Recall that liquid water is stable only in the region between the dotted lines Below the H line water is unstable relative to hydrogen gas and above the O line water is unstable with respect to oxygen For active metals such as Fe the region where the pure element is stable is typically below the H line This means that iron metal is unstable in contact with water undergoing reactions in acid in base Iron and most other metals are also thermodynamically unstable in airsaturated water where the potential of the solution is close to the O line in the Pourbaix diagram Here the spontaneous reactions are in acid ceFe_s O FeO_s in base Corrosion and passivation It certainly sounds bad for our friend Fe unstable in water no matter what the pH or potential Given enough time it will all turn into rust But iron and other active metals can corrode or can be stabilized against corrosion depending on the conditions Because our civilization is dependent on the use of active metals such as Fe Al Zn Ti Cr for practically everything it is important to understand this and we can do so by referring to the Pourbaix diagram The corrosion of iron and other active metals such as Al is indeed rapid in parts of the Pourbaix diagram where the element is oxidized to a soluble ionic product such as Feaq or Alaq However solids such as FeO and especially AlO form a protective coating on the metal that greatly impedes the corrosion reaction This phenomenon is called passivation Draw a vertical line through the iron Pourbaix diagram at the pH of tap water about and you will discover something interesting at slightly acidic pH iron is quite unstable with respect to corrosion by the reaction but only in water that contains relatively little oxygen ie in solutions where the potential is near the H line Saturating the water with air or oxygen moves the system closer to the O line where the most stable species is FeO and the corrosion reaction is This oxidation reaction is orders of magnitude slower because the oxide that is formed passivates the surface Therefore iron corrodes much more slowly in oxygenated solutions More generally iron and other active metals are passivated whenever they oxidize to produce a solid product and corrode whenever the product is ionic and soluble This behavior can be summed up on the colorcoded Pourbaix diagram below The red and green regions represent conditions under which oxidation of iron produces soluble and insoluble products respectively In the yellow part of the diagram an active metal such as iron can be protected by a second mechanism which is to bias it so that its potential is below the oxidation potential of the metal This cathodic protection strategy is most frequently carried out by connecting a more active metal such as Mg or Zn to the iron or steel object eg the hull of a ship or an underground gas pipeline that is being protected The active metal which must be higher than Fe in the activity series is also in contact with the solution and slowly corrodes so it must eventually be replaced In some cases a battery or DC power supply the anode of which oxidizes water to oxygen in the solution is used instead to apply a negative bias The white patches visible on the ships hull are zinc block sacrificial anodes Another common mode of corrosion of iron and carbon steel is differential aeration In this case part of the iron object eg the base of a bridge or the drill in an oil rig is under water or in an anoxic environment such as mud or soil The potential of the solution is close to the H line in the Pourbaix diagram where Fe can corrode to Fe aq Another part of the iron object is in the air or near the surface where water is well oxygenated At that surface oxygen can be reduced to water O H e HO The conductive iron object completes the circuit carrying electrons from the anode where Fe is oxidized to the cathode where O is reduced Corrosion by differential aeration can be rapid because soluble ions are produced and the reaction has a driving force of over V Iron or carbon steel that is subjected to frequent weathering such as the cast iron bridge and lamppost shown below is corroded on the surface by differential aeration Rusty cast iron bridge and lamppost North Ayrshire Scotland Differential aeration is involved in the formation of a rust ring around wet areas of cast iron eg an iron frying pan left partially submerged in water for a day or more You may have seen this mechanism of corrosion in action when you did not get to the dirty dishes right away Under the water Fe is oxidized to soluble Fe and at the water line O is reduced to HO As Fe ions diffuse towards the water surface they encounter oxygen molecules and are oxidized to Fe However Fe is insoluble at neutral pH and deposits as rust typically just below the water line forming the rust ring Prelude to AcidBase Chemistry Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Acids and bases are important for a number reasons in inorganic chemistry Many industrially useful catalytic reactions involve inorganic acids and superacids such as zeolites anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and sulfated zirconia These acids are sufficiently strong in anhydrous media that they can protonate olefins and alcohols to produce carbocations Carbocations are key intermediates in the transformations of hydrocarbons Inorganic compounds are sometimes synthesized in strongly acidic or basic media For example ternary metal oxides can be synthesized and crystallized in molten NaOH or KOH which are strongly basic Organic fluorination reactions are often done in strongly acidic media such as anhydrous HF Understanding the familiar chemistry of acids and bases in water helps us understand how these nonaqueous media work The acidic or basic environment of metal ions affects the stability of their oxidation states We will learn more about this in Chapter Transition metal complexes coordination compounds and organometallic compounds are essentially Lewis acidbase complexes We

Things the Roman poet Lucretius c BC c BC drawing on his Epicurean beliefs describes some atoms and chemical bonding in the following way What seems to us the hardened and condensed Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked Be held compacted deep within as twere By branchlike atoms of which sort the chief Are diamond stones despisers of all blows And stalwart flint and strength of solid iron And brazen bars which budging hard in locks Do grate and scream But what are liquid formed Of fluid body they indeed must be Of elements more smooth and round because Their globules severally will not cohere Lucretius poem is enjoyable reading and contains some remarkable insights into the microscopic world given the tools available at the time Modern analytical methods show that he was off base with his ideas about hooks and spheres however We will revisit the nature of chemical bonding in the substances Lucretius mentions diamond silicates iron brass and water in the context of modern chemical theories to understand why they have the special properties they do Prelude to Coordination Chemistry and Crystal Field Theory Last updated Save as PDF Page ID History Coordination compounds or complexes are molecules and extended solids that contain bonds between a transition metal ion and one or more ligands In forming these coordinate covalent bonds the metal ions act as Lewis acids and the ligands act as Lewis bases Typically the ligand has a lone pair of electrons and the bond is formed by overlap of the molecular orbital containing this electron pair with the dorbitals of the metal ion Ligands that are commonly found in coordination complexes are neutral molecules HO NH organic bases such as pyridine CO NO H ethylene and phosphines PR and anions halides CN SCN cyclopentadienide CH H etc The resulting complexes can be cationic eg CuNH neutral PtNHCl or anionic FeCN As we will see below ligands that have weak or negligible strength as Brønsted bases for example CO CN HO and Cl can still be potent Lewis bases in forming transition metal complexes With ligands that are Lewis bases coordinate covalent bonds also called dative bonds are typically drawn as lines or sometimes as arrows to indicate that the electron pair belongs to the ligand X In counting electrons on the metal described below the convention is to assign both electrons in the dative bond to the ligand although in reality the bonds are typically polar covalent and electrons are shared between the metal and the ligand ZnOBDC also called MOF is a metalorganic framework in which benzenedicarboxylate BDC anions bridge between cationic ZnO clusters The rigid framework contains large voids represented by orange spheres MOFs can be made from many different transition metal ions and bridging ligands and are being developed for practical applications in storing gases especially H and CO MOF has a volumetric storage density of g HL close to that of liquid H When writing out the formulas of coordination compounds we use square brackets around the metal ions and ligands that are directly bonded to each other Thus the compound CoNHClCl contains octahedral CoNHCl ions in which five ammonia molecules and one chloride ion are directly bonded to the metal and two Cl anions that are not coordinated to the metal History Coordination compounds have been known for centuries but their structures were initially not understood For example Prussian Blue which has an empirical formula FeCNxHO is an insoluble deep blue solid that has been used as a pigment since its accidental discovery by Diesbach in Prussian Blue actually contains Fe cations and FeCN anions and a more descriptive formulation is FeFeCNxHO Simpler compounds such as the ammonia complex of Co were known to chemists but did not fit the expected behavior of ionic solids For example cobaltIIIhexammine chloride CoNHCl was formulated as CoClNH It had mysterious properties in that it dissolved in water like an ionic solid but it retained its six ammonia molecules when recrystallized Even more intriguing was the observation that chemically different forms isomers of transition metal complexes such as CoNHClCl could be made The puzzle was solved by Alfred Werner who proposed in that these Co complexes contained octahedrally coordinated metal ions that made primary covalent bonds to six ligands Werner showed through conductivity measurements that solutions of CoClNH contained three free Cl anions and one CoNH cation per formula unit Magnetic susceptibility measurements later confirmed the presence of diamagnetic Co in both the salt and its solutions Werners theory also explained the existence of two and only two structural isomers for CoNHCl cisCoNH Cl transCoNH Cl Like organic compounds transition metal complexes can vary widely in size shape charge and stability We will see that bonds formed from the dorbitals of the metal largely control these properties Alfred Werner was a Swiss chemist who received the Nobel prize in for elucidating the bonding in coordination compounds Prelude to Ionic and Covalent Solids Energetics Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers In Chapter we learned all about crystal structures of ionic compounds A good question to ask is what makes a compound choose a particular structure In addressing this question we will learn about the forces that hold crystals together and the relative energies of different structures This will in turn help us understand in a more quantitative way some of the heuristic concepts we have learned about in earlier chapters such as hardsoft acidbase theory At ordinary pressures the CsCl structure is adopted by only three of the alkali halides CsCl CsBr and CsI Under high pressure however other alkali halides transform from the NaCl to the CsCl structure because of the higher Madelung constant of CsCl Prelude to Ionic and Covalent Solids Structures Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers As we noted in our discussion of metal and alloy structures in Chapter there is an intimate connection between the structures and the physical properties of materials As we graduate from simple metal structures based on sphere packings to more complex structures we find that this is still true In this chapter we will try to systematize the structures of inorganic solids metal oxides halides sulfides and related compounds and develop some rules for which structures to expect based on electronegativity differences hardsoft acidbase rules and other periodic trends We will see that many of these structures are related to the sphere packings that we learned about in Chapter The morphology of twinned crystals of iron pyrite FeS is related to the underlying cubic symmetry of the unit cell Like NaCl the pyrite crystal structure can be thought of as a facecentered cubic array of anions S with cations Fe occupying all the octahedral holes Inorganic solids often have simple crystal structures and some of these structures are adopted by large families of ionic or covalent compounds Examples of the most common structures include NaCl CsCl NiAs zincblende wurtzite fluorite perovskite rutile and spinel We will develop these structures systematically from the close packed and nonclose packed lattices shown below Some layered structures such as CdCl and CdI can be thought of as relatives of simple ionic lattices with some atoms missing Prelude to Metals and Alloys Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers In the chemistry of molecular compounds we are accustomed to the idea that properties depend strongly on structure For example we can rationalize the polarity of the water molecule based on its shape We also know that two molecules with the same composition eg ethanol and dimethyl ether have very different properties based on the bonding arrangements of atoms It should come as no surprise that the properties of extended solids are also connected to their structures and so to understand what they do we should begin with their crystal structures Most of the metals in the periodic table have relatively simple structures and so this is a good place to begin We will see in Chapter that the structures of more complex compounds are also in many cases related to the simple structures of metals and alloys Over of the elements in the periodic table exist in their pure form as metals All elemental metals except the three Cs Ga Hg that are liquid are crystalline solids at room temperature and most have one of three simple crystal structures Prelude to Molecular Orbital Theory Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Valence bond VB theory gave us a qualitative picture of chemical bonding which was useful for predicting the shapes of molecules bond strengths etc It fails to describe some bonding situations accurately because it ignores the wave nature of the electrons Molecular orbital MO theory has the potential to be more quantitative With it we can also get a picture of where the electrons are in the molecule as shown in the image at the right This can help us understand patterns of bonding and reactivity that are otherwise difficult to explain Although MO theory in principle gives us a way to calculate the energies and wavefunctions of electrons in molecules very precisely usually we settle for simplified models here too These simple models do not give very accurate orbital and bond energies but they do explain concepts such as resonance eg in the ferrocene molecule that are hard to represent otherwise We can get more accurate energies from MO theory by computational number crunching While MO theory is more correct than VB theory and can be very accurate in predicting the properties of molecules it is also rather complicated even for fairly simple molecules For example you should have no trouble drawing the VB pictures for CO NH and benzene but we will find that these are increasingly challenging with MO theory The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the carbon monoxide molecule is a π antibonding orbital that derives from the p orbitals of carbon left and oxygen right Prelude to Redox Stability and Redox Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers In redox reactions one element or compound is reduced gains electrons and another is oxidized loses electrons In terms of everyday life redox reactions occur all of the time around us For example the metabolism of sugars to CO which stores energy in the form of ATP is a redox reaction Another example of redox is fire or combustion such as in a car engine In a car engine hydrocarbons in the fuel are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water while oxygen is reduced to water Corrosion ie the formation of rust on iron is a redox reaction involving oxidation of a metal Oxidation states of vanadium in acidic solution From left to right the oxidation state goes from to These four oxidation states form the basis of the vanadium flow battery a storage device for electricity generated from sunlight and wind Oxidationreduction reactions are important to understanding inorganic chemistry for several reasons Transition metals can have multiple oxidation states Main group elements N halogens O S also have multiple oxidation states and important redox chemistry Many inorganic compounds catalyze redox reactions which are

catalysis Electrochemistry provides a way to measure equilibrium constants for dissolutionprecipitation complexation and other reactions Reaction mechanisms in organometallic chemistry oxidative addition reductive elimination involve changes in the oxidation states of metals Not all oxidizers and reducers are created equal The electrochemical series ranks substances according to their oxidizing and reducing power ie their standard electrode potential Strong oxidizing agents are typically compounds with elements in high oxidation states or with high electronegativity which gain electrons in the redox reaction Examples of strong oxidizers include hydrogen peroxide permanganate and osmium tetroxide Reducing agents are typically electropositive elements such as hydrogen lithium sodium iron and aluminum which lose electrons in redox reactions Hydrides compounds that contain hydrogen in the formal oxidation state such as sodium hydride sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride are often used as reducing agents in organic and organometallic reactions Problems Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Predict the shape of the following complexes and determine

NiTPP is reacted with sodium thiocyanate it forms another complex that is paramagnetic Draw the structures of NiTPP and the product complex and the crystal field energy level diagram that explains each What value of the magnetic moment in units of μB would you expect for the paramagnetic complex One of the simplest reactions a coordination complex can do is ligand exchange For example metal aquo complexes can exchange a coordinated water molecule with a free solvent water molecule and the rate of the reaction can be measured by isotope labeling NMR and other techniques Interestingly these rates vary widely for water exchange with different metal ions over a range of orders of magnitude as shown in the figure below For some metal ions the rate is so slow that it takes weeks for one water molecule to exchange for another In other cases the timescale of the exchange is nanoseconds a There is an overall trend in which the rate of exchange decreases as the oxidation state of the

Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Water covers of the Earths surface and is vital for all known forms of life On Earth of the planets water is found in seas and oceans in groundwater in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland a small fraction in other large water bodies and in the air as vapour clouds formed from solid and liquid water particles suspended in air and precipitation Only of the Earths water is freshwater and of that water is in ice and groundwater Less than of all freshwater is in rivers lakes and the atmosphere and an even smaller amount of the Earths freshwater is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products The major chemical and physical properties of water are Water is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure It is tasteless and odourless The intrinsic colour of water and ice is a very slight blue hue although both appear colourless in small quantities Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas Water is the only substance occurring naturally in all three phases as solid liquid and gas on the Earths surface Water is transparent in the visible electromagnetic spectrum Thus aquatic plants can live in water because sunlight can reach them Infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrogenoxygen or OH bonds Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge whereas the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges As a result water is a polar molecule with an electrical dipole moment Water can form an unusually large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds four for a molecule of its size These factors lead to strong attractive forces between molecules of water giving rise to waters high surface tension and capillary forces The capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity This property is relied upon by all vascular plants such as trees The boiling point of water like all other liquids is dependent on the barometric pressure For example on the top of Mount Everest water boils at C compared to C at sea level at a similar latitude since latitude modifies atmospheric pressure slightly Conversely water deep in the ocean near geothermal vents can reach temperatures of hundreds of degrees and remain liquid Water has a high specific heat capacity J kg K as well as a high heat of vaporization kJ mol both result from the extensive hydrogen bonding between its molecules These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earths climate by buffering large fluctuations in temperature Solid ice has a density of kg m The maximum density of liquid water occurs at C where it is kg m Elements that are more electropositive than hydrogen such as lithium sodium calcium potassium and caesium displace hydrogen from water forming hydroxides Since hydrogen is a flammable gas when given off it is dangerous and the reaction of water with the more electropositive of these elements can be violently explosive so they are often stored in oil Most known pure substances display simple behaviour when they are cooled they shrink Liquids contract as they are cooled because the molecules move slower and they are less able to overcome the attractive intermolecular forces drawing them closer to each other Once the freezing temperature is reached the substances solidify causing them to contract even more because crystalline solids are usually tightly packed Water however water has the anomalous property of becoming less dense when it is cooled to its solid form ice When liquid water is cooled it initially contracts as expected until a temperature of C is reached C After that it expands slightly until it reaches the freezing point and then when it freezes it expands by approximately Just above the freezing point the water molecules begin to locally arrange into icelike structures with an extended hydrogen bonded network This creates some openness in the liquid water accounting for the decrease in its density This is in opposition to the usual tendency for cooling to increase the density At C these opposing tendencies cancel out producing the density maximum Since water expands to occupy a greater volume in the form of ice and is less dense it floats on liquid water as in icebergs Fortunately this happens since in colder climates where water is susceptible to freezing if it all turned solid during the winter it would kill all the life within it The extended structure of the water molecule in liquid and solid form seen in the models below provides the explanation for the variation of density with temperature Topic hierarchy Reactions of Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID a Ligand substitution reactionFormation constantAssociative mechanismInterchange mechanismDissociative mechanismTrans effectThe HO exchange rate in aqua ionsTest tube experimentsb Redox reactionsInnersphere mechanismOutersphere mechanism The reactions of complexes are classified into the substitution reaction of ligands the conversion reaction of ligands and the redox reaction of the central metal The substitution and redox reactions in particular have been studied in detail a Ligand substitution reaction Ligand substitution reactions of complexes are very important for the preparation of various kinds of derivatives The detailed conditions which complexes and ligands fulfill have been studied in order to understand their stereochemistry and attain practical rates of substitution reactions As with other types of chemical reactions we require an understanding of both equilibrium and reaction rates Formation constant The equilibrium constant of a ligand substitution reaction is called a formation or stability constant The concept and the method of computing successive formation constants were proposed by N Bjerrum Equilibrium constants for the replacement of a hydrated ion M by other ligands L in an aqueous solution are M L rightarrow ML qquad qquad K_ fracMLML ML L rightarrow ML_ qquad qquad K_ fracML_MLL ML_ L rightarrow ML_ qquad qquad K_ fracML_ML_L ML_n L rightarrow ML_n qquad qquad K_n fracML_nML_nL and the overall formation constant is The thermodynamic stability of a substitution product becomes larger as the formation constant increases On the other hand an understanding of the effect of the leaving ligand X and the entering ligand Y on the substitution rate and on the intermediate species formed are essential to elucidate the reaction chemistry of metal complexes It is especially useful to summarize the electronic structure of the central metals the stereochemistry of complexes and the correlation between the parameters representing their steric properties and the reaction rate Generally reaction mechanisms can be classified into associative interchange and dissociative mechanisms according to the differences in the intermediate state Figure Figure The stability of the intermediate of ligand substitution Associative mechanism If the substitution rate of a ligand substitution of a complex is dependant upon the entering ligand Y coordinating to the central metal and is insensitive to the leaving ligand X it is presumed to take the associative mechanism which increases the coordination number Such a substitution reaction is often seen in planar tetracoordinate PtII complexes and the intermediate species are triangular bipyramidal pentacoordinate complexes The reaction is firstorder with respect to both the tetracoordinate complex and Y and is secondorder as a whole Since it is accompanied by a reduction of molecular species in the intermediate stage thermodynamic measurements of the reaction indicate the activation entropy S to be negative The intermediate species in the case of the associative mechanism in hexacoordinate complexes are heptacoordinate complexes Interchange mechanism When the life of an intermediate state is very short the reaction proceeds by the interchange mechanism as the coordination of Y and elimination of X are considered to occur simultaneously Dissociative mechanism A substitution reaction that is highly sensitive to the identity of the leaving ligand X and practically insensitive to the identity of the entering ligand Y assumes the dissociative mechanism in which the coordination number decreases in the intermediate state This is often observed in octahedral hexacoordinate complexes and the intermediate states are pentacoordinate complexes that form by the elimination of X As the elimination is accompanied by an increase of molecular species in the intermediate stage the entropy of activation S becomes positive Exercise The order of the rate of ligand substitution of PtII complexes is HO Cl I PR CN for entering ligands Which mechanism associative or dissociative do the substitutions take Answer Since they are dependent on the entering ligands the associative mechanism is more likely Trans effect In squareplanar tetracoordinate complexes typically of PtII the ligand trans to the leaving ligand X governs the substitution rate This is called the trans effect The substitution rate increases as the σ donor or π acceptor ability of the trans ligand becomes larger in the order of NH Cl Br I NCS PR CN CO An analogous effect may also be seen in octahedral hexacoordinate complexes although the effect is usually relatively small The HO exchange rate in aqua ions Inert intermediate and labile are classification of the exchange rate proposed by H Taube The exchange rate of aqua ions ions coordinated by water molecules of maingroup and transition metals differ greatly depending upon the identity of the metal species Since the rate of water ligand exchange is well correlated withthe exchange rates of other ligands it is useful for general comparison of the exchange rates in the complexes of different metal ions For alkali and alkaline earth metals the exchange rates are very high s and the complexes of these metals are classified as labile As the dissociative mechanism is generally found in these cases ions with smaller ionicity and of larger size attract water ligands less and their exchange rates becomes higher In Group metal ions Zn Cd Hg Group metal ions Al Ga In and Group metal ions Sc Y rapid water ligand exchange takes place by a dissociative mechanism On the other hand the exchange rates of M II ions in d block transition metal ions is medium s and that of M III ions are lower still The rates of d Cr and d Co are notably slow s and their complexes are termed inert There has been a great deal of study of ligandexchange reactions The exchange rates are smaller the larger the ligand field stabilization energy Therefore the ligandexchange rates of d and d transition metal complexes are generally slow Test tube experiments Easy chemical or biological reactions performed in test tubes are sometimes called test tube experiments Solutions in test tubes are mixed at room temperature in air and the mixture is shaken to observe a color change or formation of precipitates and the results of the reactions are speculated on University professors occasionally attempt these sorts of experiments Although easy these simple experiments show only the effects of visible light absorption and solubility However since even great discoveries can be born from such experiments they should not be dismissed H Taube wrote that he found a hint of the innersphere electron transfer mechanism from test tube experiments He mixed Craq and I in a test tube in order to clarify the oxidation of Craq and observed the change of color to the one characteristic of CrHO via green The green color is due to HOCrI which is unstable and changes to CrHO I He assumed that this was due to the formation of a CrI bond before CrII was oxidized by I Subsequently he performed another test tube experiment using NHCoCl as an oxidant and found that Craq was converted into CrHO via green HOCrCl This reaction established the innersphere electron transfer mechanism in which a CoClCr bridge forms between Co and Cr and led to the Nobel Prize in a later year b Redox reactions The oxidation number of the central metal in a transitionmetal compound can vary in a few steps from low to high Namely the oxidation state of a compound is changeable by redox reactions As a consequence of this the bond distance and the bond angle between the metal and coordinating elements or between metals change and at times the whole structure of a complex can be distorted remarkably or the compound may even decompose The reactions of a metal compound with various reducing or oxidizing agents are also very important from the viewpoint of synthetic chemistry Especially reduction reactions are used in the preparation of organometallic compounds such as metal carbonyls or cluster compounds Meanwhile the study of electron transfer between complexes especially the redox reactions of transition metal complexes has developed Taube won the Nobel Prize for the study of electron transfer reactions in transition metal complexes classifying such reactions into two mechanisms The mechanism of electron transfer in which a bridging ligand is shared between two metals is called the innersphere mechanism and the one involving a direct transfer of electrons between two metals without a bridging ligand is called the outersphere mechanism Innersphere mechanism When CoClNH is reduced by CrOH an intermediate complex NHCoClCrOH is formed in which the chlorine atom forms a bridge between cobalt and chromium As a result of an electron transfer from chromium to cobalt through chlorine CoNHCl in which cobalt is reduced from a trivalent to a divalent oxidation state and CrOH in which chromium is oxidized from a divalent to a trivalent oxidation state are formed This kind of reaction is a redox reaction via the innersphere mechanism The anions other than halogens suitable for such bridge formation are SCN N CN etc Outersphere mechanism When Fephen phen is orthophenanthroline is reduced by FeCN no ligand bridge forms between the metals and an electron moves from the HOMO of FeII to the LUMO of FeIII in a very short and direct contact between the two complexes As the result of the electron transfer Fephen and FeCN form This kind of reaction is a redox one via the outersphere mechanism and is characteristic of a complex system that has a very slow ligand substitution rate compared with the speed of electron transfer especially in systems that have the same ligands but different oxidationnumbers for example FeCN FeCN has a high rate of electron transfer R A Marcus won the Nobel Prize for his study of this outersphere electron transfer mechanism problems Which cavity either the octahedral or tetrahedral one in an array of oxygen atoms do Fe ions tend to occupy in iron oxide FeO containing

Equilibria Coupled equilibria solubility complexation acidbase and other reactions change the value of E effectively by changing the concentrations of free metal ions We can use the Nernst equation to calculate the value of E from the equilibrium constant for the coupled reaction Alternatively we can measure the halfcell potential with and without the coupled reaction to get the value of the equilibrium constant This is one of the best ways to measure Ksp Ka and Kd values As an example we consider the complexation of Fe and Fe by CN ions Which oxidation state of Fe is more strongly complexed by CN We can answer this question by measuring the standard halfcell potential of the FeCN couple and comparing it to that of the Fecouple E V E V IronIII is harder to reduce ie E is less positive when it is complexed to This implies that the equilibrium constant for complexation reaction Equation ref should be smaller than that for reaction Equation ref How much smaller We can calculate the ratio of equilibrium constants by adding and subtracting reactions ____________________________________ The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the product of the two reactions we added ie K KK But we can make the same overall reaction by combining reactions and ____________________________________ In this case we can calculate E V It follows from nFE ΔG RTlnK that Thus we find that FeCN is about a million times more stable as a complex than FeCN Solubility Equlibria We can use a similar procedure to measure Ksp values electrochemically For example the silver halides AgCl AgBr AgI are sparingly soluble We can calculate the Ksp of AgCl by measuring the standard potential of the AgClAg couple This can be done very simply by measuring the potential of a silver wire which is in contact with solid AgCl and M Claq against a hydrogen reference electrode That value is then compared to the standard potential of the AgAg couple Subtracting the second reaction from the first one we obtain and again using nFE RTlnK we obtain K Ksp x M Because the solubility of the silver halides is so low this would be a very difficult number to measure by other methods eg by measuring the concentration of Ag spectroscopically or by gravimetry In practice almost all Ksp values involving electroactive substances are measured potentiometrically AcidBase Equilibria Many electrochemical reactions involve H or OH For these reactions the halfcell potentials are pHdependent Example Recall that the disproportionation reaction is spontaneous at pH H M from the Latimer diagram or Frost plot However when we properly balance this half reaction we see that it involves protons as a reactant By Le Chateliers principle it follows that removing protons increasing the pH should stabilize the reactant MnO Thus we would expect the oxidation state of Mn which is unstable in acid to be stabilized in basic media We will examine these protoncoupled redox equilibria more thoroughly in the context of Pourbaix diagrams below Acid mine drainage occurs when sulfide rocks such as pyrite FeS are exposed to the air and oxidized The reaction produces aqueous Fe and HSO When the acidic effluent of the mine meets a stream or lake at higher pH solid FeOH precipitates resulting in the characteristic orange muddy color downstream of the mine The acidic effluent is toxic to plants and animals

solute dissociates into ions to a greater extent in water than in methanol equilibrium constant for dissociation of MX Kdis One must not confuse the dielectric constant of a solvent with its dipole moment The dipole moment of a solvent or of any covalent compound is a microscopic property meaning it is a property of the molecule of the compound In contrast the dielectric constant of a solvent is a a macroscopic property meaning it is a property of a pure sample of the solvent Given below is the scattergram of the dielectric constants of sixteen solvents against their dipole moments showing that there is no clear correlation between the dielectric constant of a solvent and its dipolar moment graph Resonance Energy of Metals Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The solution to the problem above must consider the quantum mechanical nature of the electron The valence electrons in Na metal are in orbitals that are delocalized over the entire crystal However in the Na e salt form the electrons are localized on specific anion sites This localization imparts an additional kinetic energy via the particle in a box effect that adds to the total energy From the quantum mechanical result for a particle in a onedimensional box we obtain where h Planks constant x J s n energy level assumed to be the lowest n m electron mass x kg L size of the box If we approximate the size of the electron box as Å x m we obtain This extra kinetic energy makes the Nae salt unstable relative to the electrondelocalized metal Sodium owes its metallic properties to the resonance stabilization of its delocalized valence electrons The calculation is not very accurate because the electron kinetic energy is not zero in the metal and because the box size is not so well defined However it does illustrate that electron delocalization has a substantial effect in thermodynamically stabilizing metals The situation is entirely analogous to the stabilization of aromatic molecules by electron delocalization In molecules like benzene resonance is also a quantummechanical kinetic energy effect In general the resonance stabilization energy is significantly larger in metals than it is in πdelocalized organic molecules For example the resonance energy of the six πelectrons in benzene is approximately kJmol less than half of the value we have calculated per electron in sodium metal Interestingly several of the alkali metals and other metallic elements transform at ultrahigh pressures to optically transparent insulating phases in which the valence electrons are localized These high pressure electride phases defy the general rule which we will encounter in Chapter that insulators transform to metals at sufficiently high density They illustrate how the stable structure of an element can depend on the tradeoff between the lattice energy of an ionic electride structure and the resonance energy of an electrondelocalized metal Crystal structure of CaN with D electron layers shown schematically in blue In addition to the saltlike electrides that are formed by complexing alkali metals with crown ether ligands there are a number of recently discovered solid state nitrides and oxides such as CaN and CaAlO that are more properly formulated as electrides ie as CaNe and CaAlOe In these compounds the Ca Al O and N atoms have their ordinary octet oxidation states and respectively and electrons act as anions filling in cagelike voids or layers in the crystal For example CaN adopts the antiCdCl structure as shown at the right with void spaces between layers that are occupied by a D gas of electrons Like other layered materials CaN can be easily delaminated into thin nanosheets while retaining its structure and properties as an electride These compounds are

series is Weak field I Br Cl NO F OH HO Pyridine NH NO CN CO Strong field Orbital overlap Referring to the molecular orbital diagram above we see that the splitting between delectron levels reflects the antibonding interaction between the eg metal orbitals and the ligands Thus we expect ligand field strength to correlate with metalligand orbital overlap Ligands that bind through very electronegative atoms such as O and halogens are thus expected to be weak field and ligands that bind through C or P are typically strong field Ligands that bind through N are intermediate in strength Another way to put this is that hard bases tend to be weak field ligands and soft bases are strong field ligands Water is a weak field ligand The electronegative O atom is strongly electronwithdrawing so there is poor orbital overlap between the electron pair on O and a metal dorbital The more electropositive C atom in the strong field ligand CN allows better orbital overlap and sharing of the electron pair Note that CN typically coordinates metal ions through the C atom rather than the N atom Cobalt II complexes have different colors depending on the nature of the ligand In crystals of the red compound cobaltII nitrate dihydrate each cobalt ion is coordinated by six water molecules The CoHO cations and NO anions crystallize to make a salt When the complex is dissolved in water CoII retains its coordination shell of six water molecules and the solution has the same red color as the crystal Energy units Energy can be calculated in a number of ways and it is useful to try to relate the splitting energy ΔO to more familiar quantities like bond energies Here ν is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation h is Plancks constant x Js and c is the speed of light is called the wavenumber and is the inverse of the wavelength usually measured in cm Energy gaps are often expressed by spectroscopists in terms of wavenumbers For example a red photon has a wavelength of about nm and a wavenumber of about cm In other energy units the same red photon has an energy of eV eV nm or kJmol eV kJmol If we compare this to the dissociation energy of a carboncarbon single bond kJmol we see that the CC bond has about twice the energy of a red photon We would need an ultraviolet photon E kJmol eV nm cm to break a CC bond We will see that ΔO varies widely for transition metal complexes from nearinfrared to ultraviolet wavelengths Thus the energy difference between the tg and eg orbitals can range between the energy of a rather weak to a rather strong covalent bond ΔO depends on both the metal and the ligand We can learn something about trends in ΔO by comparing a series of d metal complexes Complex ΔO cm CoHO CoHO CoCN RhHO RhCN Important trends in ΔO Co complexes have larger ΔO than Co complexes with the same ligand This reflects the electrostatic nature of the crystal field splitting Rh complexes have larger ΔO than Co complexes In general elements in the nd and rd transition series the d and d elements have larger splitting than those in the d series For a given metal in one oxidation state eg Co the trend in ΔO follows the spectrochemical series Thus ΔO is larger for CoCN which contains the strong field CN ligand than it is for CoHO with the weak field ligand HO The d and d elements are similar in their size and their chemistry In comparing ΔO values for complexes in the d d and d series eg comparing elements in the triads CoRhIr or FeRuOs we always find d d d This trend reflects the spatial extent of the dorbitals and thus their overlap with ligand orbitals The d orbitals are smaller and they are less effective in bonding than the d or d The d and d orbitals are similar to each other because of the lanthanide contraction At the beginning of the d series between Ba and Hf are the fourteen lanthanide elements La Lu Although the valence orbitals of the d elements are in a higher principal quantum shell than those of the d elements the addition of protons to the nucleus in crossing the lanthanide series contracts the sizes of the atomic orbitals The important result is that the valence orbitals of the d and d elements have similar sizes and thus the elements resemble each other in their chemistry much more than they resemble their cousins in the d series For example the chemistry of Ru is very similar to that of Os as illustrated below but quite different from that of Fe Both Os and Ru form volatile molecular tetroxides MO OsO is used in epoxidation reactions and as a stain in electron microscopy In contrast the highest binary oxide of iron is FeO Colors of transition metal complexes A simple qualitative way to see the relative crystal field splitting energy ΔO is to observe the color of a transition metal complex The higher the energy of the absorbed photon the larger the energy gap However the color a complex absorbs is complementary to the color it appears ie the color of light it reflects which is opposite the absorbed color on the color wheel Complementary colors are across the color wheel from each other Examples all d Co complexes CoHO looks purple in its salts and in concentrated solution because it absorbs in the green range CoNH is strawcolored because it absorbs in the blue range CoCN looks red absorbs in the violet and ultraviolet part of the spectrum This is consistent with the idea that CN is a stronger field ligand than NH because the energy of a UV photon is higher than that of a redorange photon This method is applicable to most transition metal complexes as the majority of them absorb somewhere in the visible range nm to cm or have UV transitions that tail into the visible making them appear yellow however there are complexes such as RhCN that appear colorless because their dd transitions are in the ultraviolet Other complexes such as MnHO are weakly colored because their dd transitions involve a change in the spin state of the complex Spinel Perovskite and Rutile Structures Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Normal vs inverse spinel structureMagnetism of ferrite spinelsFerroelectric perovskites There are three more structures which are derived from closepacked lattices that are particularly important because of the material properties of their compounds These are the spinel structure on which ferrites and other magnetic oxides are based the perovskite structure which is adopted by ferroelectric and superconducting oxides and the rutile structure which is a common binary structure adopted by oxides and fluorides The spinel structure is formulated MMX where M and M are tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated cations respectively and X is an anion typically O or F The structure is named after the mineral MgAlO and oxide spinels have the general formula ABO In the normal spinel structure there is a closepacked array of anions The Asite cations fill of the tetrahedral holes and the Bsite cations fill of the octahedral holes A polyhedral view of the normal spinel unit cell is shown at the left and a simplified view with the contents of the back half of the cell removed for clarity is shown above Each unit cell contains eight formula units and has a composition ABO Inverse spinels have a closely related structure with the same large unit cell in which the Asite ions and half of the Bsite ions switch places Inverse spinels are thus formulated BABO where the AB ions in parentheses occupy octahedral sites and the other B ions are on tetrahedral sites There are also mixed spinels which are intermediate between the normal and inverse spinel structure Some spinel and inverse spinel AB combinations are AB eg MgAlO normal spinel AB eg PbO PbIIPbIIPbIVO inverse spinel AB eg NaWO normal spinel Many magnetic oxides such as FeO and CoFeO are spinels Normal vs inverse spinel structure For transition metal oxide spinels the choice of the normal vs inverse spinel structure is driven primarily by the crystal field stabilization energy CFSE of ions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites For spinels that contain d elements such as Cr Mn Fe Co and Ni the electron configuration is typically high spin because O is a weak field ligand As an example we can consider magnetite FeO This compound contains one Fe and two Fe ions per formula unit so we could formulate it as a normal spinel FeFeO or as an inverse spinel FeFeFeO Which one would have the lowest energy dorbital energy diagram for Fe First we consider the crystal field energy of the Fe ion which is d Comparing the tetrahedral and high spin octahedral diagrams we find that the CFSE in an octahedral field of O ions is In the tetrahedral field the CFSE is Since Δo is about times larger than Δt the octahedral arrangement has a larger CFSE and is preferred for Fe dorbital energy diagram for Fe In contrast it is easy to show that Fe which is d would have a CFSE of zero in either the octahedral or tetrahedral geometry This means that Fe has a preference for the octahedral site but Fe has no preference Consequently we place Fe on octahedral sites and FeO is an inverse spinel FeFeFeO Ferrites are compounds of general formula MIIFeO We can see that magnetite is one example of a ferrite with M Fe Other divalent metals M Mg Mn Co Ni Zn also form ferrites Ferrites can be normal or inverse spinels or mixed spinels depending on the CFSE of the MII ion Based on their CFSE Fe Co and Ni all have a strong preference for the octahedral site so those compounds are all inverse spinels ZnFeO is a normal spinel because the small Zn ion d fits more easily into the tetrahedral site than Fe d and both ions have zero CFSE MgFeO and MnFeO in which all ions have zero CFSE and no site preference are mixed spinels Chromite spinels MIICrO are always normal spinels because the d Cr ion has a strong preference for the octahedral site Examples of normal and inverse spinel structures MgAlO is a normal spinel since both Mg and Al are nontransition metal ions and thus CFSE The more highly charged Al ion prefers the octahedral site where it is surrounded by six negatively charged oxygen atoms MnO is a normal spinel since the Mn ion is a high spin d system with zero CFSE The two Mn ions are high spin d with higher CFSE on the octahedral sites ΔO than on the tetrahedral site Δt ΔO FeO is an inverse spinel since the Fe ion is a high spin d system with zero CFSE Fe is a high spin d system with more CFSE on an octahedral site than on a tetrahedral one NiFeO is again an inverse spinel since Ni a d ion prefers the octahedral site and the CFSE of Fe a d ion is zero FeCrO is a normal spinel since Fe is high spin d ion with on an octahedral site and Cr is a d ion with CFSE ΔO ΔO Hence it is more energetically favorable for Cr to occupy both of the octahedral sites CoO is a normal spinel Even in the presence of weak field oxo ligands Co is a low spin d ion with very high CFSE on the octahedral sites because of the high charge and small size of the Co ion Hence the Co ions occupy both octahedral sites and Co occupies the tetrahedral site Magnetism of ferrite spinels Ferrite spinels are of technological interest because of their magnetic ordering which can be ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the structure normal or inverse and the nature of the metal ions FeO CoFeO and NiFeO are all inverse spinels and are ferrimagnets The latter two compounds are used in magnetic recording media and as deflection magnets respectively Illustration of antiferromagnetic superexchange between two transition metal cations through a shared oxygen atom In order to understand the magnetism of ferrites we need to think about how the unpaired spins of metal ions are coupled in oxides If an oxide ion is shared by two metal ions it can mediate the coupling of spins by superexchange as shown at the right The coupling can be antiferromagnetic as shown or ferromagnetic depending on the orbital filling and the symmetry of the orbitals involved The GoodenoughKanamori rules predict the local magnetic ordering ferromagnetic vs antiferromagnetic that results from superexchange coupling of the electron spins of transition metal ions For ferrites the strongest coupling is between ions on neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral sites and the ordering of spins between these two sites is reliably antiferromagnetic Because all the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in a spinel or inverse spinel crystal are coupled together identically it works out that ions on the tetrahedral sites will all have one orientation eg spin down and ions on all the octahedral sites will have the opposite orientation eg spin up If the number of spins on the two sites is the same then the solid will be antiferromagnetic However if the number of spins is unequal as in the case of FeO CoFeO and NiFeO then the solid will be ferrimagnetic This is illustrated above for FeO The spins on the Fe sites cancel because half of them are up and half are down However the four unpaired electrons on the Fe ions are all aligned the same way in the crystal so the compound is ferrimagnetic Perovskites are ternary oxides of general formula ABO More generally the perovskite formula is ABX where the anion X can be O N or halogen The A ions are typically large ions such as Sr Ba Rb or a lanthanide ion and the B ions are smaller transition metal ions such as Ti Nb Ru etc The mineral after which the structure is named has the formula CaTiO The perovskite structure has simple cubic symmetry but is related to the fcc lattice in the sense that the A site cations and the three O atoms comprise a fcc lattice The Bsite cations fill of the octahedral holes and are surrounded by six oxide anions ABX perovskite structure A B and X are white blue and red respectively The coordination of the A ions in perovsite and the arrangement of BO octahedra is best understood by looking at the ReO structure which is the same structure but with the Asite cations removed In the polyhedral representation of the structure shown at the right it can be seen that the octahedra share all their vertices but do not share any octahedral edges This makes the ReO and perovskite structures flexible like threedimensional wine racks in that the octahedra can rotate and tilt cooperatively Eight such octahedra surround a large cuboctahedral cavity which is the site of the A ions in the perovskite structure Cations in these sites are coordinated by oxide ions as expected from the relationship between the perovskite and fcc lattices Polyhedral representation of the ReO structure showing the large cuboctahedral cavity that is surrounded by oxygen atoms Because the Asite is empty in the ReO structure compounds with that structure can be reversibly intercalated by small ions such as Li or H which then occupy sites in the cuboctahedral cavity For example smart windows that darken in bright sunlight contain the electrochromic material WO which has the ReO structure In the sunlight a photovoltaic cell drives the reductive intercalation of WO according to the reaction WO is a light yellow compound containing d WVI In contrast HxWO which is mixedvalent WVWVI dd has a deep blue color Such coloration is typical of mixedvalence transition metal complexes because their delectrons can be excited to delocalized conduction band levels by red light Because the electrochemical intercalationdeintercalation process is powered by a solar cell the tint of the windows can adjust automatically to the level of sunlight Ferroelectric perovskites The flexibility of the network of cornersharing BO octahedra is also very important in ferroelectric oxides that have the perovskite structure In some perovsites with small Bsite cations such as Ti and Nb the cation is too small to fit symmetrically in the BO octahedron The octahedron distorts allowing the cation to move offcenter These distortions can be tetragonal as in the example shown at the right rhombohedral or orthorhombic depending on whether the cation moves towards a vertex face or edge of the BO octahedron Moving the cation offcenter in the octahedron creates an electric dipole In ferroelectrics these dipoles align in neighboring unit cells through cooperative rotation and tilting of octahedra The crystal thus acquires a net electrical polarization Tetragonal distortion of the perovskite unit cell in the ferroelectric oxide PZT PbTixZrx Ferroelectricity behaves analogously to ferromagnetism except that the polarization is electrical rather than magnetic In both cases there is a critical temperature Tc above which the spontaneous polarization of the crystal disappears Below Tc the electric polarization of a ferroelectric can be switched with a coercive field and hysteresis loop of polarization vs field resembles that of a ferromagnet Above Tc the crystal is paraelectric and has a high dielectric permittivity Ferroelectric and paraelectric oxides along with piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics have a wide variety of applications as switches actuators transducers and dielectrics for capacitors Ferroelectric capacitors are important in memory devices FRAM and in the tuning circuits of cellular telephones Multiferroics which are materials that are simultaneously ferroelectric and ferromagnetic are rare and are being now intensively researched because of their potential applications in electrically adressable magnetic memory Halide perovskites ABX X Cl Br I can be made by combining salts of monovalent A ions A Cs NH RNH and divalent metal salts such as PbCl or PbI These compounds have sparked recent interest as light absorbers for thin film solar cells that produce electricity from sunlight Lead and tin halide perovskites can be grown as thin films from solution precursors or by thermal evaporation at relatively low temperatures In some lead halide perovskites the mobility of electrons and holes is very high comparable to that of more expensive IIIV semiconductors such as GaAs which must be grown as very pure single crystals at high temperatures for use in solar cells Because of their high carrier mobility some lead halide perovskites are also electroluminescent and are of interest as inexpensive materials for lightemitting diodes LEDs Tin and lead halide perovskites were first studied in the s as materials for thin film electronics and more recently as light absorbers in dyesensitized solar cells Soon after the results on dyesensitized perovskite cells were reported it was discovered that halide perovskites could also be used in thin film solid state solar cells The structures of these solar cells are shown schematically at the right The highest reported solar power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have jumped from in to in and a certified in The highest performing cells to date contain divalent lead in the perovskite B cation site and a mixture of methylammonium and formamidinium ions in the perovskite A cation site a Solar cell architecture in which a lead halide perovskite absorber coats a layer of nanocrystalline anatase TiO b Thinfilm solar cell with a layer of lead halide perovskite sandwiched between two selective contacts c Charge generation and extraction in the sensitized architecture and d in the thinfilm architecture Despite their very impressive efficiency perovskite solar cells are stable for relatively short periods of time and are sensitive to air and moisture Current research is focused on understanding the degradation mechanisms of these solar cells and improving their stability under operating conditions The rutile structure is an important MX X O F structure It is a structure in which the cations are octahedrally coordinated by anions and as such is intermediate in polarity between the CaF and SiO structures The mineral rutile is one of the polymorphs of TiO the others anatase and brookite also being structures The rutile structure can be described as a distorted version of the NiAs structure with half the cations removed Recall that compounds with the NiAs structure were typically metallic because the metal ions are eclipsed along the stacking axis and thus are in relatively close contact In rutile the MO octahedra share edges along the tetragonal caxis and so some rutile oxides such as NbO RuO and IrO are also metallic because of dorbital overlap along that axis These compounds are important as electrolyzer catalysts and catalyst supports because they combine high catalytic activity with good electronic conductivity View down the tetragonal caxis of the rutile lattice showing edgesharing MO octahedra Rutile TiO because of its high refractive index is the base pigment for white paint It is a wide bandgap semiconductor that has also been extensively researched as an electrode for water splitting solar cells and as a photocatalyst primarily as the anatase polymorph for degradation of pollutants in air and water Selfcleaning glass exploits the photocatalytic properties of a thin film of TiO to remove oily substances from the glass surface and improve the wetting properties of the glass Stability Constants of Coordination Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Stability of Transition Metal Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Hardsoft interactions The crystal field stabilization energy CFSE is an important factor in the stability of transition metal complexes Complexes with high CFSE tend to be thermodynamically stable ie they have high values of Ka the equilibrium constant for metalligand association and are also kinetically inert They are kinetically inert because ligand substitution requires that they dissociate lose a ligand associate gain a ligand or interchange gain and lose ligands at the same time in the transition state These distortions in coordination geometry lead to a large activation energy if the CFSE is large even if the product of the ligand exchange reaction is also a stable complex For this reason complexes of Pt Ir both low spin d and Pt square planar d have very slow ligand exchange rates There are two other important factors that contribute to complex stability Hardsoft interactions of metals and ligands which relate to the energy of complex formation The chelate effect which is an entropic contributor to complex stability Hardsoft interactions Hard acids are typically small high charge density cations that are weakly polarizable such as H Li Na Be Mg Al Ti and Cr Electropositive metals in high oxidation states are typically hard acids These elements are predominantly found in oxide minerals because O is a hard base Some hard bases include HO OH O F NO Cl and NH The hard acidbase interaction is primarily electrostatic Complexes of hard acids with hard bases are stable because of the electrostatic component of the CFSE Soft acids are large polarizable electronegative metal ions in low oxidation states such as Ni Hg Cd Cu Ag and Au Soft bases are anionsneutral bases such as H CH CO PR RS and CN Soft acids typically occur in nature as sulfide or arsenide minerals The bonding between soft acids and soft bases is predominantly covalent For example metal carbonyls bind through a covalent interaction between a zero or lowvalent metal and neutral CO to form NiCO FeCO CoCO MnCO WCO and related compounds The preference for hardhard and softsoft interactions like binds like is nicely illustrated in the properties of the copper halides CuF unstable CuI stable CuF stable CuI unstable The compounds CuF and CuI have never been isolated and are thermodynamically unstable to disproportionation We will learn more about quantifying the energetics of these compounds in Chapter Stabilization of High and Low Oxidation States Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Lattice energies in addition to guiding the discovery of unknown compounds are useful in explaining the absence ie the thermodynamic instability of nonexistent compounds For example CuF and AuF are unknown compounds whereas CuF AuF and AuF are stable In contrast AgF is a known stable compound From the Born Haber cycle for CuF the compound should be marginally stable ΔHfo kJmol with respect to the elements Why then is CuF unknown To gain insight into this question we first construct a BornHaber cycle for the formation of CuF from the elements This compound is stable with respect to the elements by kJmol Combining the two cycles we see that the disproportionation of CuF to Cu and CuF is spontaneous From similar cycles we can also predict that the reaction AuF AuF Au should be spontaneous Why is the lowest oxidation state unstable for these fluorides The key point is that the large difference in EL values kJ in the case of copper fluorides drives their disproportionation reactions Note that when we use the Kapustinskii equation we calculate that EL for CuF is approximately three times that of CuF We use the same univalent radii in both calculations but Cu has a charge in CuF doubling the lattice energy relative to CuF and contains as many ions The product zzn is thus three times larger for CuF The difference in EL values will thus increase as EL for the monovalent salt increases We know that fluorides having a small anion radius will give larger EL values than iodides which have larger anions Thus the disproportionation reaction becomes more favorable for CuF than it is for CuI The stability of the lower vs higher oxidation state thus depends on the size of the anion For example in fluorides CuF is unstable but CuF is stable However in iodides CuI is stable whereas CuI is unstable From this we can develop a broad conclusion small anions OF tend to stabilize higher oxidation states whereas large anions S Br I stabilize lower oxidation states Note that this trend has to do with the size and not with the electronegativity of the anion Coincidentally F and O are electronegative elements but it is really their small size that has consequences for the lattice energy and their stabilization of higher oxidation states Cuprous iodide CuI is a crystalline compound used in organic synthesis and cloud seeding This compound can be made in the laboratory by reacting soluble Cu salts with a solution of sodium or potassium iodide Because CuI is thermodynamicaly unstable the reaction liberates I and a CuI precipitate forms Remember that the hardsoft acidbase rules could be interpreted in terms of the dominance of ionic vs covalent interactions Here we have put the hardhard interaction in quantitative terms based on electrostatic lattice energies Ag appears to buck the periodic trend Why is AgF stable This is because the second IP is very high kJ vs kJ for Cu for Au Thus both AgF and AgF are known fluorides of Ag Standard Reduction Potentials E and the Relationship Between E ΔG

Maps Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Structure maps which plot structures against properties such electronegativity are more consistent than radius ratio rules in correctly predicting coordination numbers and crystal structures One of the early examples of this approach was published by Mooser and Pearson in A MooserPearson diagram maps crystal structures according to the average principal quantum numbers of the atoms and their electronegativity difference The basic ideas behind such a plot are The greater the electronegativity difference the more ionic is the compound Higher ionicity results in higher coordination numbers because anions like to surround cations and vice versa Higher principal quantum numbers result in less sp hybridization less directional bonding and therefore higher coordination number We saw this trend before with the structures of elements in group IV descending the group the coordination number increases progressively from carbon to Pb The lines in the MooserPearson diagram separate MX compounds with CsCl NaCl and tetrahedral wurtzite and zincblende structures Note that wurtzite has higher ionicity than zincblende in the plot consistent with our discussion of the boat and chair ring structures in Chapter Diamorphic compounds tend to fall on the boundaries On the whole the MooserPearson diagram makes far fewer errors in predicting

complexesHigher coordinate complexes Transition elements are metallic elements that have incomplete d or f shells in the neutral or cationic states They are called also transition metals and make up of the elements These transition metals are classified into the dblock metals which consist of d elements from Sc to Cu d elements from Y to Ag and d elements from Hf to Au and fblock metals which consist of lanthanoid elements from La to Lu and actinoid elements from Ac to Lr Although Sc and Y belong to the dblock their properties are similar to those of lanthanoids The chemistry of dblock and fblock elements differs considerably This chapter describes the properties and chemistry of mainly dblock transition metals Central Metals Properties of dblock transition metals differ considerably between the first d and the second series metals d although the differences in properties between the second and the third series d metals is not pronounced Metallic radii of elements from scandium Sc to copper Cu to pm are significantly smaller than those of yttrium Y to silver Ag to pm or those of lanthanum La to gold Au to pm Further metal compounds of the first series transition metals are rarely coordinate whereas transition metals from the second and third series may be to coordinate Cerium Ce radius pm lutetium Lu radius pm fall between La and Hf and because of the lanthanide contraction metallic radii of the second and third series transition metals show little variation Higher oxidation states in the second and third series transition metals are considerably more stable than those in the first series transition metals Examples include tungsten hexachloride WCl osmium tetroxide OsO and platinum hexafluoride PtF Compounds of the first series transition metals in higher oxidation states are strong oxidants and thus are readily reduced On the other hand whereas MII and MIII compounds are common among the first series transition metals these oxidation states are generally uncommon in compounds of second and third series metals For example there are relatively few MoIII or WIII compounds compared with many CrIII ones Aqua ions ions with water ligands are very common among compounds of first series metals but few are known amongst the second and third metal compounds Metal carbonyl cluster compounds of first series transition metals with MM bonds in low oxidation states exist but halide or sulfide cluster compounds are rare In general metalmetal bonds are formed much more easily in the d and d metals than in the d ones Magnetic moments of the first series transition metal compounds can be explained in terms of spinonly values cf Chapter d but it is difficult to account for the magnetic moments of the second and third series compounds unless complex factors such as spinorbital interactions are taken into account Thus it is necessary to acknowledge and understand the significant differences in chemical properties that exist between metals of the first and later series metal compounds even for elements in the same group Properties of the dblock transition metals are different not only in the upper and lower positions in the periodic table but also in the left and right groups The Group to metals are now often referred to as early transition metals and they are generally oxophilic and halophilic Smaller numbers of d electrons and the hardness of these elements explain their affinity toward hard oxygen and halogens In the absence of bridging ligands the formation of metalmetal bonds is difficult for these elements Organometallic compounds of these metals are known strongly to activate CH bonds in hydrocarbons Late transition metals in the groups to the right of the periodic table are soft and have a high affinity toward sulfur or selenium The dblock transition metals have s p and d orbitals and those with n electrons in the d orbitals are termed ions with a dn configuration For example Ti is a d ion and Co a d ion The number of electrons occupying the orbitals split by the ligand field cf a is denoted by a superscript on the orbital symbol For example an ion with electrons in tg and electrons in eg is described as tgeg Ligands Compounds of metal ions coordinated by ligands are referred to as metal complexes Most ligands are neutral or anionic substances but cationic ones such as the tropylium cation are also known Neutral ligands such as ammonia NH or carbon monoxide CO are independently stable molecules in their free states whereas anionic ligands such as Cl or CH are stabilized only when they are coordinated to central metals Representative ligands are listed in Table according to the ligating elements Common ligands or those with complicated chemical formula are expressed in abbreviated forms Those ligands with a single ligating atom are called monodentate ligands and those with more than one ligating atoms referred to as polydentate ligands which are also called chelate

coordinate complexes were rare but the number of new complexes with this coordination is increasing The energy difference between the two coordination modes is not large and structural transformation readily occurs For example the molecular structure and infrared spectrum of FeCO are consistent with a trigonal bipyramid structure but the C NMR spectrum shows only one signal at the possible lowest temperature which indicates that the axial and equatorial carbonyl ligands are fluxional in the NMR time scale s Structural transformation takes place via a square pyramid structure and the mechanism is well known as Berrys pseudorotation Figure Berrys pseudorotation Six coordinate complexes When six ligands coordinate to a central metal octahedral Oh coordination is the most stable geometry and the majority of such complexes assume this structure In particular there are a number of Cr and Co complexes which are inert to ligand exchange reactions represented by CrNH or CoNH They have been particularly important in the history of the development of coordination chemistry MoCO RhCl etc are also octahedral complexes In the case of mixed ligands cis and transMAB and mer and facMAB

arsenides The cations are shown in gray while the anions are light blue in the figure at the right The cations are in octahedral coordination so each cation is coordinated to six anions The anions are also coordinated to six cations but they occupy trigonal prismatic sites In terms of layer stacking the NiAs structure is AcBcAcBc where the A and B sites the hcp lattice are occupied by the As atoms and the c sites which are eclipsed along the layer stacking axis are occupied by Ni Unlike the NaCl structure where the anion and cation sites are interchangeable NiAs has unique anion and cation sites The layer stacking sequence for NiAs is shown below A c B c A c B c The NiAs structure cannot be adopted by ionic compounds because of the eclipsing cations because the cationcation repulsions would be internally destabilizing for an ionic compound This structure is mainly adopted by covalent and polar covalent MX compounds typically with soft X anions S Se P As and lowvalent transition

Early Quantum Theory Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Successive Operations Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Sometimes new symmetry operations form by carrying out two or more simpler operations successively to result in an indistinguishable configuration For example the improper rotation axis that was introduced in the last section results from rotation about an axis of rotation Cn followed by reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis h Note also that Cn in this case need not be a symmetry element for the molecule For example staggered ethane has an S symmetry element although it does not have a C Another example of a symmetry element that results from a combination of two different elements is the inversion center i which results from a C rotation followed by a reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis h Note that an inversion center is a special case of an improper rotation axis because it results when in the first equation That is In fact any symmetry operation can be carried out multiple time in a row For example when BH is rotated twice by the twostep operation can be symboled by When the C operation is performed a third time

headers The term superacid was originally coined by James Bryant Conant in to describe acids that were stronger than conventional mineral acids George A Olah prepared the socalled magic acid sonamed for its ability to attack hydrocarbons by mixing antimony pentafluoride SbF and fluorosulfonic acid FSOH The name was coined after a candle was placed in a sample of magic acid The candle dissolved showing the ability of the acid to protonate hydrocarbons which under aqueous acidic conditions cannot be protonated At C FSOHSbF converts methane into the tertiarybutyl carbocation a reaction that begins with the protonation of methane Fluoroantimonic acid HSbF can produce solutions with H down to Fluoroantimonic acid is made by combining HF and SbF In this system HF releases its proton H concomitant with the binding of F by antimony pentafluoride which as described below is a Lewis acid The resulting anion SbF is both a weak nucleophile and an extraordinarily weak base Superacids are useful in reactions such as the isomerization of alkanes Industrially anhydrous acidexchanged zeolites which are superacid catalysts are used on a massive scale to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil to gasoline Superbases such as lithium diethylamide LiNEt alkyllithium compounds RLi and Grignard reagents RMgX useful in a broad range of organic reactions LiNEt deprotonates CH bonds to generate reactive carbanions RLi and RMgX are powerful nucleophiles The use of superbases in nonaqueous media allows us to rank the acidities and measure the pKas of different classes of molecules This ranking is particularly important in understanding the reactions of organic molecules Note that the order of acidities for hydrocarbons is alkynes alkenes aromatics alkanes This ordering has to do with the hybridization of the carbon atom that forms the carbanion The negatively charged lone pair of the carbanion is stabilized in orbitals that have high s character eg sp vs sp or sp This is because s orbitals have finite probability density at the nucleus and feel the positive nuclear charge thereby stabilizing the extra negative charge on carbon more than p orbitals Resonance effects also stabilize carbanions Thus cyclopentadiene is more acidic than even an alkyne because the negative charge is delocalized over the entire aromatic CH ring when the CH is deprotonated Table Carbon acid acidities in pKa in DMSO Reference acids in bold name formula structural formula pKa Methane CH Propene CH Benzene CH Acetylene CH Cyclopentadiene CH

symmetry operation is a rotation where the resulting position is indistinguishable from the original A rotation is called a C operation the axis of rotation is the symmetry element CCBYNCSA Kathryn Haas Introduction The symmetry of a molecule consists of symmetry operations and symmetry elements A symmetry operation is an operation that is performed to a molecule which leaves it indistinguishable and superimposable on the original position Symmetry operations are performed with respect to symmetry elements points lines or planes An example of a symmetry operation is a rotation of a water molecule in which the resulting position of the molecule is indistinguishable from the original position see Figure In this example the symmetry operation is the rotation and the symmetry element is the axis of rotation There are five types of symmetry operations including identity reflection inversion proper rotation and improper rotation The improper rotation is the sum of a rotation followed by a reflection The symmetry elements that correspond to the five types of symmetry operations are listed in Table Table Table of elements and operations Element Operation Symbol Identity identity E Proper axis rotation by no Cn Symmetry plane reflection in the plane σ Inversion center inversion of a point at xyz to xyz i Improper axis rotation by no followed by reflection in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis Sn Symmetry Operations and Elements Identity E All molecules have the identity element The identity operation is doing nothing to the molecule it doesnt rotate reflect or invertit just is Proper Rotation and Proper Axis Cn A proper rotation is just a simple rotation operation about an axis The symbol for any proper rotation or proper axis is Cn where n is the degree of rotation Thus a rotation is a C rotation around a C axis and a rotation is a C rotation about a C axis PRINCIPLE AXIS The principle axis of a molecule is the highest order proper rotation axis For example if a molecule had C and C axes the C is the principle axis Reflection and Symmetry Planes σ Symmetry planes are mirror planes within the molecule A reflection operation occurs with respect to a plane of symmetry There are three classes of symmetry elements σh horizontal horizontal planes are perpendicular to principal axis σv vertical vertical planes are parallel to the principal axis σd dihedral dihedral planes are parallel to the principle axis and bisecting two C axes Inversion and Inversion Center i The inversion operation requires a point of symmetry a center of symmetry within a molecule In other words a point at the center of the molecule that can transform xyz into xyz coordinate Structures of tetrahedron triangles and pentagons lack an inversion center Improper rotation Sn Improper rotation is a combination of a rotation with respect to an axis of rotation Cn followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to that Cn axis In short and Sn operation is equivalent to Cn followed by References Introduction to Molecular Symmetry by J S Ogden Inorganic Chemistry by Catherine Housecroft And Alan G Sharpe Problems Water molecule HO was used as an example and was mentioned that water was rotated degree around an axis bisecting the oxygen then the molecule was superimposable on the original water molecule how about CO Is it going to be like the water molecule since CO also has atoms of oxygen Of course not because every molecule has different molecular shape To recognize the symmetry of any molecule the structure and the molecular shape of that molecule should be defined The water molecule is bent but CO is not and if CO is rotated degree around the axis bisecting the C atom then it can be superimposed on the original molecule We then see the symmetry for the CO Why should all of the five symmetry elements be done on a molecule in order to find the point group the molecule belongs to why is performing only one or two of the symmetry elements not enough for recognizing the point group One or two of the symmetry elements will not be able to tell us everything about the molecules symmetry since those one or two properties do not tell us everything about the molecule Also while different molecules may have one or two symmetrical properties in common the five properties will not be the same for all molecules What does the symbol Cn stand for and what does n represent Why is it important to identify n C is the axis of rotation and n is the order of the axis How are the character tables helpful The character table tells us about all the operational elements performed on the molecule and indicates if we have forgotten to perform any of the symmetry elements The tables serve as a checklist because all the operational elements should be done on the molecule in order to find the point group of the molecule Why is important to find symmetry in molecules Symmetry tells us about bounding for that molecular bonding Tetrahedral Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Tetrahedral complexes are formed with late transition metal ions Co Cu Zn Cd and some early transition metals Ti Mn especially in situations where the ligands are large In these cases the small metal ion cannot easily accommodate a coordination number higher than four Examples of tetrahedal ions and molecules are CoCl MnCl and TiX X halogen Tetrahedral coordination is also observed in some oxoanions such as FeO which exists as discrete anions in the salts NaFeO and SrFeO and in the neutral oxides RuO and OsO The metal carbonyl complexes NiCO and CoCO are also tetrahedral The splitting of the dorbitals in a tetrahedral crystal field can be understood by connecting the vertices of a tetrahedron to form a cube as shown in the picture at the left The tetrahedral ML bonds lie along the body diagonals of the cube The dz and dxy orbitals point along the cartesian axes ie towards the faces of the cube and have the least contact with the ligand lone pairs Therefore these two orbitals form a low energy doubly degenerate e set The dxy dyz and dxz orbitals point at the edges of the cube and form a triply degenerate t set While the t orbitals have more overlap with the ligand orbitals than the e set they are still weakly interacting compared to the eg orbitals of an octahedral complex The resulting crystal field energy diagram is shown at the right The splitting energy Δt is about the splitting of an octahedral complex formed with the same ligands For d elements Δt is thus small compared to the pairing energy and their tetrahedral complexes are always high spin Note that we have dropped the g subscript because the tetrahedron does not have a center of symmetry Tetrahedral complexes often have vibrant colors because they lack the center of symmetry that forbids a dd transition Because the low energy transition is allowed these complexes typically absorb in the visible range and have extinction coefficients that are orders of magnitude higher than the those of the corresponding octahedral complexes An illustration of this effect can be seen in Drierite which contains particles of colorless anhydrous calcium sulfate gypsum that absorbs moisture from gases The indicator dye in Drierite is cobalt II chloride which is is a light pink when wet octahedral and deep blue when dry tetrahedral The reversible hydration reaction is deep blue tetrahedral CoCl light pink octahedral CoHO Tetrahedral Structures Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers In ccp and hcp lattices there are two tetrahedral holes per packing atom A stoichiometry of either MX or MX gives a structure that fills all tetrahedral sites while an MX structure fills only half of the sites An example of an MX structure is fluorite CaF whose structure is shown in the figure at the left The packing atom in fluorite is Ca and the structure is composed of three interpenetrating fcc lattices It should be noted that the Ca ion gray spheres as a packing atom defies our rule that anions are larger than cations and therefore must be the packing atoms The fluorite structure is common for ionic MX MgF ZrO etc and MX compounds LiO In contrast the hcp relative of the fluorite structure is quite rare because of unfavorable close contacts between likecharged ions The fluorite CaF crystal structure showing the coordination environments of the Ca and F atoms In terms of geometry Ca is in cubic coordination with eight F neighbors and the fluoride ions are tetrahedrally coordinated by four Ca ions The coordination geometry is consistent with the CaF stoichiometry in all crystal structures the ratio of the coordination numbers is the inverse of the stoichiometric ratio The three interpenetrating fcc lattices have Ca at etcF at etc and F at etc Looking more closely at the tetrahedral sites in fluorite we see that they fall into two distinct groups T and T If a tetrahedron is oriented with a vertex pointing upwards along the stacking axis the site is T Likewise a tetrahedron with a vertex oriented downward is T The alternation of T and T sites allows for efficient packing of ions in the structure The layer stacking sequence in this structure including fluoride ions in the T and T sites is A b T a T B c T b T C a T c T A b T a T Polyhedral view of the fluorite crystal structure showing T and T CaF tetrahedra The Ca ions are stacked ABCABC along the body diagonal of the unit cell which is the vertical direction in this image Tetrahedrally bonded compounds with a stoichiometry MX compounds have only half of the tetrahedral sites either the T or T sites filled In this case both the M and the X atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated The zincblende and wurtzite structures are tetrahedral structures based on fcc and hcp lattices respectively Both structures are favored by pblock compounds that follow the octet rule and these compounds are usually semiconductors or insulators The zincblende structure shown below can be thought of as two interpenetrating fcc lattices one of anions and one of cations offset from each other by a translation of along the body diagonal of the unit cell Examples of compounds with the zincblende structure include CuCl CuI ZnSe HgS BeS CdTe AlP GaP SnSb CSi and diamond Additionally the compound CuInSe is zincblende in an ordered doubled unit cell the chalcopyrite structure The solid solution compounds CuInxGaxSe with this structure are among the most widely studied materials for use in efficient thin film photovoltaic cells Using ZnS as a representative of zincblende the coordination of both Zn and S atoms is tetrahedral The layer sequence which is AbBcCaAbBcC results in sixmembered ZnS rings that have the same geometry as the chair version of cyclohexane The chair conformation allows for a relatively long distance between opposite atoms in the ring and as a result it is more sterically favorable than the boat form The sequence of closepacked layers in zincblende filling only the T sites and leaving the T sites empty is shown below A b T T B c T T C a T T The zincblende unit cell The wurtzite structure is a close relative of zinc blende based on filling half the tetrahedral holes in the hcp lattice Like zincblende wurtzite contains planes of fused sixmembered rings in the chair conformation Unlike zincblende however the rings joining these planes contain sixmembered boat rings The boat aligns the anions so that they are directly above the cations in the structure a less favorable situation sterically but a more favorable one in terms of electrostatics As a result the wurtzite structure tends to favor more polar or ionic compounds eg ZnO NHF than the zincblende structure As with zincblende both ions are in tetrahedral coordination and there are typically eight valence electrons in the MX compound Examples of compounds with this structure include BeO ZnO MnS CdSe MgTe AlN and NHF The layered structure of wurtzite is AbBaAbB and the layer sequence with T sites filled is illustrated below A b T T B a T T A b T T B The chair and boat conformations of sixmembered ZnS rings in the wurtzite structure An interesting consequence of the layer stacking in the wurtzite structure is that the crystals are polar When cleaved along the caxis the stacking axis crystals of ZnO ZnS and GaN have one negatively charged face and an opposite positively charged face An applied electric field interacts with the crystal dipole resulting in compression or elongation of the lattice along this direction For this reason crystals of compounds in the wurtzite structure are typically piezoelectric Some compounds are diamorphic and can have either the zincblende or wurtzite structure Examples of these compounds that have intermediate polarities include CdS and ZnS SiO exists in polymorphs crystobalite and tridymite that resemble zincblende and wurtzite with O atoms midway between each of the Si atoms The zincblende and wurtzite structures have efficient packing arrangements for tetrahedrally bonded networks and are commonly found in compounds that have tetrahedral bonding Water for example has a tetrahedral hydrogen bonding network and is wurtzitetype The undistorted wurtzite and zinc blende structures are typically found for AX compounds with eight valence electrons which follow the octet rule AX compounds with nine or ten electrons such as GaSe and GaAs crystallize in distorted variants of the wurtzite structure In GaSe the extra electrons form lone pairs and this creates layers in the structure as can be seen in the figure below To the right of GaSe the structures of As Sb and SbAs show an ever further breakdown of the structure into layers as more valence electrons are added Hexagonal ice is the most stable polymorph of ice which is obtained upon freezing at atmosphere pressure This polymorph iceI has a hcp wurtzitetype structure Looking at the structure shown at the right we see that there are irregular arrangements of the OHO bonds In the structure hydrogen bonding enforces the tetrahedral coordination of each water molecule resulting in a relatively open structure that is less dense than liquid water For this reason ice floats in water The Aufbau Principle Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Topic hierarchy The Effect of

PDF Page ID No headers The classification of Lewis acids and bases as hard and soft is a useful qualitative approach to rationalize their behavior The ECW Model is a more quantitative model that describes and predicts the strength of Lewis acid Lewis base interactions The strength of the acidbase interaction is measured as the enthalpy of adduct formation H Each acid is characterized by an EA and a CA Each base is likewise characterized by its own EB and CB The E and C parameters refer respectively to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form These parameters have been empirically obtained by using enthalpies for adducts that form only σ bonds between the acid and base as well as adducts that have no steric repulsion between the acid and base This equation reproduces and predicts the enthalpy change H of a reaction between many acids and a bases H is a measure of strength of the bond between the acid and the base both in the gas phase and in weakly solvating media The W term represents a constant energy for cleavage of a dimeric acid or base For example the enthalpy of cleavage of RhCOCl by base B involves two steps The first step is cleavage of the dimer which is W The second step is the binding of B to the RhClCO monomer In another case W is the enthalpy needed to cleave the internal hydrogen bonding of the Hbonding acid CFCOH The calculation of the enthalpy of adduct formation for the reaction of pyridine CHN and bishexafloroacetyacetonatocopper II CuHFacac shows how these parameters are used In this case W since neither the acid nor the base is a dimer Selected parameters can be found at the Wikipedia page for the ECW Model However the ᐃH calculated for the reaction of MeB with MeN is less negative than that observed This discrepancy is attributed to steric repulsion between the methyl groups on the B and N atoms The difference between the calculated and observed values can then be taken as the amount of the steric effect a value otherwise not attainable Steric effects have also been identified with CHSnCl and with CuHFacac When π bonding contributes to the measured enthalpy the enthalpy calculated from the E and C parameters will be less than the measured enthalpy and the difference provides a measure of the extent of the π bonding contribution A graphical presentation of this model clearly shows that there is no single ranking order of Lewis acid or Lewis base strengths a point often overlooked and emphasizes that the magnitude of acid and base interactions requires two parameters E C to account for the interactions A CramerBopp plotusing the three Lewis bases acetonitrile ammonia and dimethyl sulfide illustrates that there is no unique ordering of Lewis base strengths The CramerBopp plot is a visual tool for comparing Lewis base strengths with the range of possible Lewis acid partners and similar plots can be constructed to examine selected Lewis acids against the range of possible Lewis bases These plots show that two properties are needed to completely define acid and base strength and that any attempt to define strength with one property or parameter is limited in its utility For Dragos quantitative ECW model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent while for Pearsons qualitative HSAB theory the two properties are hardness and strength The Energetics of Acid Dissociation in Aqueous Solution Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The Octet Rule and Isoelectronic Species Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Topic

properties of the elements to their position in the periodic table or as was originally done by Mendeleev et al arranging the elements into the periodic table according to their properties Heavier Elements There is little chemistry to learn about for many of the transuranium elements especially the newest because of their extremely short halflives In some cases only one or two atoms have been made The rest of the chapter is divided into secions A and B which respectively describe the pure elements themselves and then the general group trends and nontrends Part A The Nature and types of the Elements Monatomic Elements Includes all the noble gases and many metal vapours The noble gases do not form bonds to each other because of their closed valence shell configuration and the metals have their own kind of bonding which does not work in the gas phase see below Diatomic Elements These are H the simplest of all neutral molecules the halogens which also have single bonds and N and O which have multiple pppp bonding Discrete Small Polyatomic Molecules Sn and Se P Since pppp bonding is not a very useful option for elements below the first short period because of corecore repulsion at useful pbonding distances P S and Se can form clusters or chains see the next group Sulphur which can form two single bonds to itself comes in various ring sizes up to S S being the most stable orthorhombic sulphur White phosphorus which can form three comes as P with PP at Å which is more or less normal A particularly strained PP ie bent would be longer Nevertheless P is the most reactive form of phosphorus for example spontaneously inflaming in air Boron and carbon capable of forming and bonds respectively could have been included here too but see below Elements with Extended Structures Boron is a somewhat anomalous case because it is electron deficient The allotropic forms of boron are all hased on the icosahedral B unit In this unit each boron has nearest neighbours and since the units are weakly bonded to form more extended frameworks the borons that will have more remote neighbours as well There are nowhere near enough electrons and atomic orbitals to do this using localized electron centre Lewis type bonds As usual molecular orbital theory comes to the rescue but the B cage alone is a rather complex system to use as an example The topic of the boranes boron hydrides to be covered later might help shed some light on how the molecular orbitals might be set up The allotropes of crystalline boron are the most complex of the structures of the elements and their study has been futher complicated by the presence of small but stoichiometric amounts of carbon or nitrogen leading to some false ones The basic icosohedral B unit Depending on the number of bonds that they can form the following elements can form chain sheet or three dimensional structures C P S Si As Se Ge Sb Te Sn Bi Plastic sulphur Sn has a rubbery texture and is thermally unstable at room temperature with respect to conversion to S Selenium also forms chains but infinite spirals in an ordered crystalline structure Tellurium is similar and the solid has semiconductor propeties Crystalline black phosphorus has a double sheet structure This structure is shared by its cogeners members of the same group but they are metals Red phosporus the other common form contains chains of phosphorus tetrahedra Graphite has dimensional sheets of trigonal sp carbon atom arranged in aromatic six membered rings Because of the extended delocalized orbitals graphite is a conductor especially parallel to the sheets Diamond is a dimensional lattice of tetrahedral sp carbon atoms arranged in saturated sixmembered rings all in the chair form Diamond is an insulator A number of additional carbon structures have been discovered quite recently Buckmeisterfullerene C the simplest of the bucky balls is shown on the right It was discovcerd in soot Its shape like an international soccer ball is an icosahedron with all corners cut off to of the way along each edge which generates new pentagonal faces and converts the old triangular ones to hexagons There are a number of elongated spheroidal structures and tubes capped by hemispheres known all made by cooling carbon vapour from and arc or plasma discharge Chemists are still trying to make them do something useful Heats of formation for carbon forms are Graphite diamond and C kJ mol Metals The structures of many metals are based on hexagonal or cubic close packing Chapter section or the less efficient bodycentered cubic Fig Figure shows the distribution of these structures Metals are sometimes described as a regular array of cations immersed in a sea of valence electrons which are completely delocalized and free to roam through the entire mass A simplified theoretical picture of this follows In the molecule Li the bond results from overlap of the s orbitals each of which contains electrons The diagram below shows several representations of this The part of the diagram on the left shows the energy levels at the observed internuclear distance marked with a vertical dotted line on the right hand diagram A crude representation of the two molecular orbitals is also shown The internal spherical nodes that the s orbitals possess are omitted The next four diagrams show orbital energies and orbitals for hypothetical linear molecules Li Li Li and Li Variation of orbital enery with internuclear separation for a hypothetical linear Li molecule Variation of orbital enery with internuclear separation for a hypothetical linear Li molecule Variation of orbital enery with internuclear separation for a hypothetical linear Li molecule At the left is the diagram for the hypothetical Li The infinite number of morse curves merge together to give the band shown Because lithium has the s valence shell configuration only half of this band will be filled and electrons can easily move into the empty orbitals accounting for the metallic conduction observed The occupied levelsorbitals are shown by the shaded area in the diagram below The situation described above is not real Real crystals are threedimensional and in addition to the molecular orbitals formed by the atomic sorbitals there will be another set formed by overlap of the atomic porbitals The text figures and are a more realistic representation Cohesive Energies of the Metals See figure Note that the main group metals have relatively low enthalpies of atomization correlating roughly with the number of valence electrons Maxima occur at the halffilled shell after which antibonding parts of the conduction bands begin to be populated Part B The Chemistry of the Elements in Relation to their Position in the Periodic Table Hydrogen s With an intermediate electronegativity and one valence electron hydrogen might range from H to H in its compounds The proton radius x cm cannot exist in condensed states liquid or solids because it exerts too powerful a polarizing influence on molecules near to itself Therefore it is always complexed for example as HO Covalent compounds are the normal situation When combined with very electropositive elements eg Na K Ca it behaves as H hydride ion and is a very powerful reducing agent Helium s and the noble gases nsnp The energy necessary to make a valence state is not compensated by bond formation above krypton which forms a few flourides The rest of the group have fairly extensive chemistry with fluorine chlorine and oxygen The first noble gas compound originally thought to be XePtF by analogy with OPtF was made by Bartlett in Prior to that they had been thought to be inert Elements of the First Short Period Li F They are poor representatives of their groups The second short period elements are much better for this The reason is connected to their small size and lack of empty dorbitals which limits their coordination number to in the absence of multicentre bonding To achieve their normal valencies Be B and C use a valence state where one of the s electrons is promoted to the psubshell Electron deficient Li Be and B compounds are Lewis acids This involves a change in hybridization The extent to which the coordination number can be increased is limited by negative charge buildup on the acceptor Li Be and B also tend to be involved in molecules featuring centre e bonding as a way to reduce their electron deficiency N O and perhaps F compounds can be Lewis bases because of the available electon pairs on these atoms The sharing of more than one pair is opposed by positive charge buildup on the donor atom and sometimes steric factors Li exists in rather few compounds because of its small size Covalent and multicenter bonding is common eg the lithium alkyls Be would be even more polarizing than Li so no compounds containing it exist Covalency is the norm eg BeF and BeHO which hydrolyses extensively to BeOH containing species for Li Be and B there is a marked similarity to the diagonally related Mg Al and C Although the valencies differ the chemical behaviour such as covalency of halides or coordination chemistry tends to be somewhat similar For example there are close parallels between the lithium alkyls and the magnesium alkyls or between beryllium halides and the aluminium halides For B C and N there are no longlived compounds in which the elements are cationic Covalency dominates the chemistry of these elements There are compounds containing anions eg C acetylide and N which is a major product when Mg burns in air The chemistry of O and F is dominated by anion formation and covalency Remember O is too strong a base to exist in water though solid compounds are known Fluoride F is only a weak base and so known in solids and aqueous solution C N and O commonly participate in multiple bonding by the use of porbitals N is a rather unreactive molecule because of the great strength of the triple bond O is much more reactive partly because it is a biradical F is very reactive because the filled porbitals perpendicular to the bond repel each other Covalent Bonds Covered as part of the previous section Elements of the Second Short Period Na to Ar These elements are much more representative of the chemistry of the elements below them in their groups This specially true for the nonmetalic elements The elements of this period and those below it do not tend to use their porbitals for pbonding Rather the empty dorbitals are used if pbonding occcurs For example aside from special sterically encumbered cases there are few compounds containing SiSi PP or SS bonds An example of an exception is CHCPPCCH ppppbonding is not stable with respect to addition reactions a kinetic effect Multiple bonding that does occur usually involves a first short period element such as oxygen or nitrogen Examples include ClPO SO or ClO Such molecules may contain ppdpbonding and the octet rule is often violated On the other hand there is no analogue in silicon chemistry of OCO SiO is a network solid although the SiOSi groupings are linear which does hint and pinteractions The dobitals can be invoked to explain valence states where the coordination number exceeds and the octet is exceeded also Examples include PCl SF and IF The possibility of higher coordination numbers lead also to different reactivity eg CCl which is inert to hydrolysis and SiCl The metals differ from the first memeber of their group eg sodium does not form covalent compounds aluminum is a cationforming metal quite unlike boron and the coordination numbers are often rather than for these second row elements The Remainder of the NonTransition Elements This section contains a groupbygroup summary of the properties characterizing each group and indicating again how the top member of each group differs The following is list of key properties appropriate for comparisions Metallic character Properties of the oxides Ionic vs covalent Acidic vs basic Properties of the halides Ionic vs molecular Ease of hydrolysis General trends in electrovalence and covalence Trends in structure Coordination numbers for discrete species Aggregation in the solid state to increase coordination number Properties of the hydrides Tendency to catenate The relative importance of pppp vs ppdp vs dpdp bonding The general strength of covalent bonding The relative importance of the lower valent states vs the hight valent states Group IA or See text Table The elements have chemistry dominated by the ionic state The behaviour going down a group is wellbehaved The following decrease down a group melting points and heats of sublimation lattice energies mostly Effective hydrated radii and hydration energies Ionization Enthalpies Group IIA or and IIB or See text Table For group IIA Mg Ca Sr Ba and Ra which all form the ionic state there are again wellbehaved trends including those mentioned for group IA and adding Solubility of the sulphates and carbonates Thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrates which decrease going down the group Group IIB metals Zn Cd and Hg have two selectrons outside filled dsubshells In Zn and Cd the delectrons do a somewhat poorer screening job than the closed shells of the group IIA so that the ions which are more polarizing are more inclined to form complex ions with NH halides and CN Mercuric ion Hg where the fsubshell also has been filled is quite different in that it is even more inclined to form complexes The oxidation potential for mercury is positive whereas the others are all negative which means that mercury metal is rather easily produced in its reactions It also readily forms the mercurous ion Hg Group IIIA or and IIIB or See text Table The text includes the group IIIA elements and the rest of the lanthanides among the nontransition metals because of the relative simplicity of their chemistry They all behave as quite electropositive elements and form the ion Scandium behaves as if it falls somewhere between aluminum and gallium in terms of its covalency The lanthanides are so similar to each another that separation is difficult Cation exchange chromatography is used All the group IIIB elements form compounds containing the ion but there is a marked tendency towards covalency especially for aluminum eg its alkyls are volatile liquids and its chloride sublimes Group IIIB is the first group to clearly demonstrate the inert pair effect On descending the group there is a tendency for the ions to become more and more stable Tl is more stable than Tl and its chemistry is complicated by its redox behaviour The unusual stability of Hg could also be ascribed to the inert pair effect Group IVB or See text Table This is the group in which the property differences between the first member carbon and the rest is perhaps most marked Knowing the chemistry of carbon is almost useless for predicting the chemistry of the remaining elements The chemistry of carbon is dominated by its extraordinary ability to catenate While silicon can form analogues to the hydrocarbons multiple bonding is not viable and the SiO bond is the important bond in silicon chemistry The chemistry of the group IVB elements in their IV oxidation state is predominantly covalent SiCl is a liquid as is PbCH the infamous antiknock gasoline additive The covalent bonds generally weaken on descending the group The divalent state of carbon in carbenes is very reactive and it comes in both singlet and triplet forms Silicon has virtually no chemistry in this state For the rest of the group the II state becomes successively more stable going down the group The inert pair is usually stereoactive in both molecular and solid state aggregated compounds The MII compounds can never be considered truly ionic The trend is probably associated with decreasing covalent bond strengths compared to the energy needed to obtain the valence state because the ionization potential differences are small GeCl Cl GeCl Rapid at oC SnCl Cl SnCl Slow at oC PbCl Cl PbCl Does not go except at higher temperature and pressure PbBr and PbI cannot be made Group VB or See text Table The oxidation states V and III are normal for this group Phosphorus compounds are all covalent but the tendency towards ionic behaviour increases down the group especially for the III state but the only species that can be considered as predominantly cations are SbOand BiO and Bi in its fluoride Group VIB or See text Table This group is relatively wellbehaved so that its features can be tablulated The ions exist in salts with electropositive elements There are also anions containing one covalent bond eg RS or HS There are covalent compounds of type for example RE or XE R is organic X is a halogen and E is the group VIB element There are monocations of type RE There are anionic ompounds where the group VI element is in the IV or VI state and with coordination numbers and eg SCl SeF TeF There are stereoactive lone pairs to worry about The hydrides HE decrease in stability down the group The elements themselves become gradually more metallic The tendency to form anionic complexes increases eg SeBr TeBr and even PoI Group VIIB or See text Table With the elements of group IA this group is the most wellbehaved The properties progress nicely down the group The elements all form th X ion and compounds with one covalent bond eg RX or HX Interhalogens eg ClF have properties somewhat intermediate between the parent dihalogens but they are polar in the expected sense The higher

EnthalpyEntropyGibbs energy Thermodynamic parameters on changes of state are necessary to describe chemical bonding structure and reaction This is true also in inorganic chemistry and the most important concepts in thermodynamics are described in this section Even simple thermodynamic knowledge is considerably useful for judging whether structures of compounds are stable and the likelihood of spontaneous reactions and for the calculations of reaction heat determination of reaction mechanism and understanding of electrochemistry Enthalpy Since enthalpy is the heat content of a system under constant pressure the changeH is negative in an exothermic reaction and positive in an endothermic reaction The standard reaction enthalpy H is the enthalpy change between mol of products and reactants in the standard state Pa and K The standard enthalpy of formation Hf of a compound is the standard reaction enthalpy for the formation of the compound from its constituent elements Since enthalpy is a state function the standard reaction enthalpy is calculated by defining the standard enthalpy of formation of simple substances to be zero Namely Entropy Entropy is a state function and is a criterion determining whether one state can be reached spontaneously from another state The nd law of thermodynamics states that the entropy S of an isolated system increases upon a spontaneous change Namely A thermodynamically irreversible process produces entropy Entropy is related to the disorder of a system in statistical themodynamics as follows k is the Boltzmann constant and W is the number of the arrangements of atoms or molecules of the system with the same energy and corresponds to the extent of disorder As entropy becomes larger the larger the disorder of a system Gibbs energy This quantity is defined as A spontaneous reaction occurs when Gibbs energy of a reaction is negative at constant temperature and pressure The standard Gibbs free energy G is related to the equilibrium constant K of the reaction K is larger than when G becomes negative and the reaction proceeds to the right The Shapes of Molecules VSEPR Theory and Orbital Hybridization Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Geometrical isomersOrbital hybridization Rules for orbital hybridization The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion VSEPR theory is a simple and useful way to predict and rationalize the shapes of molecules The theory is based on the idea of minimizing the electrostatic repulsion between electron pairs as first proposed by Sidgwick and Powell in then generalized by Gillespie and Nyholm in and then broadly applied over the intervening years Geometry of the water molecule To use the VSEPR model one begins with the Lewis dot picture to determine the number of lone pairs and bonding domains around a central atom Because VSEPR considers all bonding domains equally ie a single bond a double bond and a half bond all count as one electron domain one can use either an octet or hypervalent structure provided that the number of lone pairs which should be the same in both is calculated correctly For example in either the hypervalent or octet structure of the Iion above there are three lone pairs on the central I atom and two bonding domains We then follow these steps to obtain the electronic geometry Determine the number of lone pairs on the central atom in the molecule and add the number of bonded atoms aka bonding domains This number the steric number defines the electronic shape of the molecule by minimizing repulsion For example a steric number of three gives a trigonal planar electronic shape The angles between electron domains are determined primarily by the electronic geometry eg for a steric number of which implies that the electronic shape is a tetrahedron These angles are adjusted by the hierarchy of repulsions lone pair lone pair lone pair bond bond bond The molecular geometry is deduced from the electronic geometry by considering the lone pairs to be present but invisible The most commonly used methods to determine molecular structure Xray diffraction neutron diffraction and electron diffraction have a hard time seeing lone pairs but they can accurately determine the lengths of bonds between atoms and the bond angles The table below gives examples of electronic and molecular shapes for steric numbers between and We are most often concerned with molecules that have steric numbers between and Bonding electron pairs Lone pairs Electron domains Steric Shape Ideal bond angle examples bond angle Example Image linear CO trigonal planar BF bent SO tetrahedral CH trigonal pyramidal NH bent HO trigonal bipyramidal PCl seesaw SF Tshaped ClF linear XeF octahedral SF square pyramidal BrF square planar XeF pentagonal bipyramidal IF pentagonal pyramidal XeOF planar pentagonal XeF square antiprismatic XeF tricapped trigonal prismatic ReH From the Table we see that some of the molecules shown as examples have bond angles that depart from the ideal electronic geometry For example the HNH bond angle in ammonia is and the HOH angle in water is We can rationalize this in terms of the last rule above The lone pair in ammonia repels the electrons in the NH bonds more than they repel each other This lone pair repulsion exerts even more steric influence in the case of water where there are two lone pairs Similarly the axial FSF angle in the seesaw molecule SF is a few degrees less than because of repulsion by the lone pair in the molecule Geometrical isomers For some molecules in the Table we note that there is more than one possible shape that would satisfy the VSEPR rules For example the XeF molecule has a steric number of five and a trigonal bipyramidal geometry There are three possible stereoisomers one in which the F atoms occupy axial sites resulting in linear molecule one in which the F atoms occupy one equatorial and one axial site resulting in a bond angle and one in which the F atoms are both on equatorial sites with a FXeF bond angle of The observed geometry of XeF is linear which can be rationalized by considering the orbitals that are used to make bonds or lone pairs in the axial and equatorial positions There are four available orbitals s px py and pz If we choose the zaxis as the axial direction we can see that the px and py orbitals lie in the equatorial plane We assume that the spherical s orbital is shared equally by the five electron domains in the molecule the two axial bonds share the pz orbital and the three equatorial bonds share the px and py orbitals We can then calculate the bond orders to axial and equatorial F atoms as follows Because fluorine is more electronegative than a lone pair it prefers the axial site where it will have more negative formal charge In general by this reasoning lone pairs and electropositive ligands such as CH will always prefer the equatorial sites in the trigonal bipyramidal geometry Electronegative ligands such as F will always go to the axial sites In the case of the BrF anion which is isoelectronic with XeF in the Table the electronic geometry is octahedral and there are two possible isomers in which the two lone pairs are cis or trans to each other In this case lone pair lone pair repulsion dominates and we obtain the trans arrangement of lone pairs giving a square planar molecular geometry Orbital hybridization The observation of molecules in the various electronic shapes shown above is at first blush in conflict with our picture of atomic orbitals For an atom such as oxygen we know that the s orbital is spherical and that the px py and pz orbitals are dumbellshaped and point along the Cartesian axes The water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms bound to oxygen not at a angle but at an angle of Given the relative orientations of the atomic orbitals how do we arrive at angles between electron domains of and so on To understand this we will need to learn a little bit about the quantum mechanics of electrons in atoms and molecules The atomic orbitals ψ represent solutions to the Schrödinger wave equation Here E is the energy of an electron in the orbital and is the Hamiltonian operator By analogy with classical mechanics the Hamiltonian is commonly expressed as the sum of operators corresponding to the kinetic and potential energies of a system in the form where is the potential energy and is the kinetic energy operator in which m is the mass of the particle and the momentum operator is Here is hπ where h is Plancks constant and the Laplacian operator is Although this is not the technical definition of the Hamiltonian in classical mechanics it is the form it most commonly takes in quantum mechanics Combining these together yields the familiar form used in the Schrödinger equation For hydrogenlike oneelectron atoms the Schrödinger equation can be written as where Z is the nuclear charge e is the electron charge and r is the position of the electron The radial potential term on the right side of the equation is due to the Coulomb interaction ie the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron in which ε is the dielectric constant permittivity of free space and is the body reduced mass of the nucleus of mass mn and the electron of mass me To a good approximation µ me Erwin Schrödinger as a young scientist This is the equation that Erwin Schrödinger famously derived in to solve for the energies and shapes of the s p d and f atomic orbitals in hydrogenlike atoms It was a huge conceptual leap for both physics and chemistry because it not only explained the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom but also provided the theoretical basis for the octet rule and the arrangement of elements in the periodic table The Schrödinger equation can be used to describe chemical systems that are more complicated than the hydrogen atom eg multielectron atoms molecules infinite crystals and the dynamics of those systems if we substitute the appropriate potential energy function Vrt into the Hamiltonian The math becomes more complicated and the equation must be solved numerically in those cases so for our purposes we will stick with the simplest case of timeinvariant oneelectron hydrogenlike atoms Without going into too much detail about the Schrödinger equation we can point out some of its most important properties The equation derives from the fact that the total energy E is the sum of the kinetic energy KE and the potential energy PE These three quantities are represented mathematically as operators in the equation On the left side of the equation the total energy operator E is a scalar that is multiplied by the wavefunction ψ ψ is a function of the spatial coordinates xyz and is related to the probability that the electron is at that point in space The first term on the right side of the equation represents the kinetic energy KE The kinetic energy operator is proportional to the Laplacian operator which takes the second derivative with respect to three spatial coordinates of ψ Thus the Schrödinger equation is a differential equation The second term on the right side of the equation represents the Coulomb potential PE ie the attractive energy between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron The solutions to the Schrödinger equation are a set of energies E which are scalar quantities and wavefunctions aka atomic orbitals ψ which are functions of the spatial coordinates You will sometimes see the energies referred to as eigenvalues and the orbitals as eigenfunctions because mathematically the Schrödinger equation is an eigenfunctioneigenvalue equation Although ψ is a function of the coordinates E is not So an electron in a pz orbital has the same total energy E PE KE no matter where it is in space These E values and their associated wavefunctions ψ are catalogued according to their quantum numbers n l and ml That is there are many solutions to the differential equation and each solution ψxyz and E has a unique set of quantum numbers Some sets of orbitals are degenerate meaning that they have the same energy eg px py and pz The solutions ψxyz to the Schrödinger equation eg the s s px py and pz orbitals represent probability amplitudes for finding the electron at a particular point xyz in space A probability amplitude can have either or sign We typically represent the different signs by shading or by and signs on the two lobes of a p orbital The square of the probability amplitude ψ is always a positive number and represents the probability of finding the electron at a point xyz in space Because the total probability of finding the electron somewhere is the wavefunction must be normalized so that the integral of ψ over the spatial coordinates from to is The solutions to the Schrödinger equation are orthogonal meaning that the product of any two integrated over all space is zero For example the product of the s and px orbitals integrated over the spatial coordinates from to is zero The shapes of the first five atomic orbitals s s px py and pz The colors denote the sign of the wave function Orbital hybridization involves making linear combinations of the atomic orbitals that are solutions to the Schrödinger equation Mathematically this is justified by recognizing that the Schrödinger equation is a linear differential equation As such any sum of solutions to the Schrödinger equation is also a valid solution However we still impose the constraint that our hybrid orbitals must be orthogonal and normalized Rules for orbital hybridization Add and subtract atomic orbitals to get hybrid orbitals We get the same number of orbitals out as we put in The energy of a hybrid orbital is the weighted average of the atomic orbitals that make it up The coefficients are determined by the constraints that the hybrid orbitals must be orthogonal and normalized For sp hybridization as in the BeF or CO molecule we make two linear combinations of the s and pz orbitals assigning z as the axis of the BeF bond Here we have simply added and subtracted the s and pz orbitals we leave it as an exercise for the interested student to show that both orbitals are normalized ie and orthogonal ie What this means physically is explained in the figure below By combining the s and pz orbitals we have created two new orbitals with large lobes high electron probability pointing along the zaxis These two orbitals are degenerate and have an energy that is halfway between the energy of the s and pz orbitals Linear combinations of the s and pz atomic orbitals make two spz hybrids The pxand py orbitals are unchanged For an isolated Be atom which has two valence electrons the lowest energy state would have two electrons spinpaired in the s orbital However these electrons would not be available for bonding By promoting these electrons to the degenerate spz hybrid orbitals they become unpaired and are prepared for bonding to the F atoms in BeF This will occur if the bonding energy in the promoted state exceeds the promotion energy The overall bonding energy ie the energy released by combining a Be atom in its ground state with two F atoms is the difference between the bonding and promotion energies We can similarly construct sp hybrids eg for the BF molecule or the NO anion from one s and two p atomic orbitals Taking the plane of the molecule as the xy plane we obtain three hybrid orbitals at to each other The three hybrids are These orbitals are again degenerate and their energy is the weighted average of the energies of the s px and py atomic orbitals Finally to make a sp hybrid as in CH HO etc we combine all four atomic orbitals to make four degenerate hybrids The lobes of the sp hybrid orbitals point towards the vertices of a tetrahedron or alternate corners of a cube consistent with the tetrahedral bond angle in CH and the nearly tetrahedral angles in NH and HO Similarly we can show that we can construct the trigonal bipyramidal electronic shape by making sp and sp hybrids and the octahedral geometry from three sets of sp hybrids The picture that emerges from this is that the atomic orbitals can hybridize as required by the shape that best minimizes electron pair repulsions Interestingly however the bond angles in PH HS and HSe are close to suggesting that P S and Se primarily use their porbitals in bonding to H in these molecules This is consistent with the fact that the energy difference between s and p orbitals stays roughly constant going down the periodic table but the bond energy decreases as the valence electrons get farther away from the nucleus In compounds of elements in the rd th and th rows of the periodic table there thus is a decreasing tendency to use sp orbital hybrids in bonding For these heavier elements the bonding energy is not enough to offset the energy needed to promote the s electrons to sp hybrid orbitals The Strange Case of the Alkali Oxides Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Metalair batteries The alkali oxides made by reacting alkali metals Li Na K Rb Cs with oxygen show an unusual trend When lithium reacts with oxygen we obtain the binary oxide LiO as expected from combining an element in group I with one in group VI Curiously the oxide that forms most readily when sodium metal is oxidized is not NaO but is instead the peroxide NaO which we can formulate as NaO With potassium rubidium and cesium we obtain the superoxides MO which contain the superoxide radical anion O and should be formulated as MO While it is possible to make NaO KO RbO and CsO by reaction of the appropriate metal nitrate MNO with elemental alkali metal M it is curious that these normal valent compounds do not form by direct reaction of the metal with oxygen Sodium metal is oxided in air to sodium peroxide NaO Because the alkali metals are all very electropositive χ and oxygen is very electronegative χ we expect all the compounds we make by combining them to be reliably ionic Consistent with this picture we find that LiO along with NaO KO and RbO adopts the antifluorite structure coordination see problem which we expect to find with relatively ionic MX compounds Strangely however CsO crystallizes in the antiCdCl structure This is odd because CdCl has a layered structure that we normally associate with polar covalent MX compounds see section In CsO six Cs cations surround each O anion in an octahedron Each Cs is coordinated to three O ions and the Cs ions contact each other across a van der Waals gap The juxtaposition of Cs ions near each other is clearly electrostatically unfavorable so why does CsO prefer the antiCdCl structure to antifluorite The answer has to do with the crowding of alkali ions around oxygen as illustrated for KO at the right Because eight large K ions surround each O ion in the structure the cations are essentially in contact Indeed the metaloxygen bonds are stretched in NaO KO and RbO relative to MO bonds with the same bond order in other structures The situation is so extreme for CsO that it finds an electrostatically unfavorable structure in which the coordination is lowered to This packing problem is relieved somewhat in the peroxides where the coordination is still but the anion is larger and especially in the superoxides where the cationanion ratio is and the coordination is Thus the larger alkali ions K Rb Cs tend to form superoxides Spacefilling models of the crystal structures of KO top and CsO bottom Oxygen atoms are red potassium ions are blue and cesium ions are magenta Another way that we can rationalize this trend is through the energetics of forming the oxides peroxides and superoxides Lets calculate the enthalpy change per mole of metal for forming a metal oxide MO from the metal and oxygen We can use Hess law to write this as a sum of reactions Reaction ΔH Overall To get the enthalpy change for the overall reaction the heat of formation of mole of MO we will need the heats of formation of Mg and Og which are available from tabulated values and EL which we can calculate from Kapustinskiis equation Similarly we can write for the formation of the alkali peroxides Reaction Reaction ΔH Overall and for the superoxides Reaction ΔH Overall For the gaseous anions and cations we have the following heats of formation and ionic radii CN Ion ΔHf kJ ionic radius Å Li Na K Rb Cs O O O Now using Kapustinskiis equation we can calculate the lattice energies for each compound these have been converted to lattice enthalpies by subtracting RT or RT as appropriate Metal ΔHLMO ΔHLMO ΔHLMO Li kJ kJ kJ Na K Rb Cs As expected the lattice energies for MO and MO are comparable the latter being somewhat smaller in magnitude because of the larger size of the O anion The lattice energies of the superoxides MO are about those of the corresponding peroxides because both the anion and cation are singly charged and there are only two ions per formula unit Now putting it all together we can use the lattice energies and heats of formation of the individual ions to compare the heats of formation per mole of metal of each of the oxides Metal ΔHfMO ΔHfMO ΔHfMO Li kJ kJ kJ Na K Rb Cs We can see that for Li the formation of LiO is favored over LiO or LiO because of the very favorable lattice energy of LiO As the lattice energy becomes less negative with increasing cation size the peroxide becomes the most stable at Na For the heavier alkalis MO becomes quite unstable and the superoxides MO are the most stable This is consistent with our observations of the chemistry of the group I oxides Metalair batteries The alkali oxides are quite interesting in the context of metalair batteries because of their potential for extremely high energy storage on a mass basis Such batteries have alkali metal typically Li or Zn anodes and utilize oxygen from the air at the cathode Although lithium is the lightest and therefore the most energydense alkali metal there are materials problems associated with the formation of Li dendrites when the battery is recharged and also with the slow kinetics of the fourelectron interconversion between Og and O at the cathode For this reason superoxide batteries are currently being studied as alternatives The oneelectron cathode reaction O e O is kinetically fast and potassium and sodium represent potentially viable alternatives to lithium for the anode of these airbreathing batteries Recently it has been shown that LiO can be kinetically stabilized by template growth on iridium nanoparticles potentially opening the door to very high energy density lithiumair batteries Schematic of an airbreathing lithium battery Threecenter Bonding Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Many but not all of the problems we will solve with MO theory derive from the MO diagram of the H molecule Fig which is a case of twocenter bonding The rest we will solve by analogy to the H ion which introduces the concept of threecenter bonding We can draw the H ion and also H and H in either a linear or triangular geometry Walsh correlation diagram for H A few important points about this diagram For the linear form of the ion the highest and lowest MOs are symmetric with respect to the inversion center in the molecule Note that the central s orbital has g symmetry so by symmetry it has zero overlap with the u combination of the two s orbitals on the ends This makes the σu orbital a nonbonding orbital In the triangular form of the molecule the orbitals that derive from σu and σg become degenerate ie they have identically the same energy by symmetry The term symbol e means doubly degenerate We will see later that t means triply degenerate Note that we drop the g and u for the triangular orbitals because a triangle does not have an inversion center The triangular form is most stable because the two electrons in H have lower energy in the lowest orbital Bending the molecule creates a third bonding interaction between the s orbitals on the ends MO diagram for XH X Be B C Some key points about this MO diagram In the linear form of the molecule which has inversion symmetry the s and p orbitals of the X atom factor into three symmetry classes s σg pz σu px py πu Similarly we can see that the two H s orbitals make two linear combinations one with σg symmetry and one with σu symmetry They look like the bonding and antibonding MOs of the H molecule which is why we say we use that problem to solve this one The πu orbitals must be nonbonding because there is no combination of the H s orbitals that has πu symmetry In the MO diagram we make bonding and antibonding combinations of the σgs and the σus For BeH we then populate the lowest two orbitals with the four valence electrons and discover not surprisingly that the molecule has two bonds and can be written HBeH The correlation diagram shows that a bent form of the molecule should be less stable An interesting story about this MO diagram is that it is difficult to predict a priori whether CH should be linear or bent In Charles Bender and Henry Schaefer using quantum chemical calculations predicted that the ground state should be a bent triplet with an HCH angle of The best experiments at the time suggested that methylene was a linear singlet and the theorists argued that the experimental result was wrong Later experiments proved them right A theory is something nobody believes except the person who made it An experiment is something everybody believes except the person who made it Einstein Page ID No headers Welcome to the Chemistry Library This Living Library is a principal hub of the LibreTexts project which is a multiinstitutional collaborative venture to

Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Crystals can be thought of as repeating patterns much like wallpaper or bathroom tiles but in three dimensions The fundamental repeating unit of the crystal is called the unit cell It is a three dimensional shape that can be repeated over and over by unit translations to fill space and leave minimal gaps in the structure Some possible unit cells are shown in the tiling pattern at the right along with arrows that indicate unit translation vectors In three dimensions the hexagonal or rhombic unit cells of this pattern would be replaced by three dimensional boxes that would stack together to fill all space As shown in the figure the origin of the unit cell is arbitrary The same set of boxes will fill all space no matter where we define the origin of the lattice We will see that pure metals typically have very simple crystal structures with cubic or hexagonal unit cells However the crystal structures of alloys can be quite complicated When considering the crystal structures of metals and alloys it is not sufficient to think of each atom and its neighboring ligands as an isolated system Instead think of the entire metallic crystal as a network of atoms connected by a sea of shared valence electrons The electrons are delocalized because there are not enough of them to fill each bond between atoms with an electron pair For example in the crystal structures of sblock and pblock metals each atom has either or nearest neighbors but the maximum number of s p electrons is Thus there are not enough to put two electrons between each pair of atoms Transition metals can also use their dorbitals in bonding but again there are never enough electrons to completely fill all the bonds Possible unit cells in a periodic tile pattern The arrows connect translationally equivalent points lattice points in the pattern The atoms in a metal lattice arrange themselves in a certain pattern which can be represented as a D box structure known as the unit cell which repeats across the entire metal Simple Cubic Body Centered Cubic Face Centered Cubic Hexagonal Close Packed atomcell atomscell atomscell atomscell Metal atoms can be approximated as spheres and therefore are not efficient in packing the same way a stack of cannonballs has some empty spaces between the balls Different unit cells have different packing efficiencies The number of atoms that is included in the unit cell only includes the fractions of atoms inside of the box Atoms on the corners of the unit cell count as ⅛ of an atom atoms on a face count as ½ an atom in the center counts as a full atom Using this lets calculate the number of atoms in a simple cubic unit cell a face centered cubic fcc unit cell and a body centered cubic bcc unit cell Simple Cubic corner atoms ⅛ atomcell The packing in this structure is not efficient and so this structure type is very rare for metals Body Centered Cubic bcc corner atoms ⅛ center atom atomscell The packing is more efficient and the structure is a common one for alkali metals and early transition metals Alloys such as brass CuZn also adopt these structures Face Centered Cubic fcc also called Cubic Close Packed ccp corner atoms ⅛ face atoms ½ atomscell This structure along with its hexagonal relative hcp has the most efficient packing Many metals adopt either the fcc or hcp structure Hexagonal Close Packed hcp Like the fcc structure the packing density of hcp is The unit cell of a bcc metal contains two atoms Calculating the packing fraction The packing fractions of the crystal structures shown above can be calculated by dividing the volume of the atoms in the cell by the volume of the cell itself The volume of the atoms in the cell is equal to the number of atomscell times the volume of a sphere πr The volume of the cubic cells is found by cubing the side length As an example lets calculate the packing efficiency of a simple cubic unit cell As we saw earlier in the section a simple cubic unit cell contains one atom The side length of the simple cubic unit cell is r since the centers of each atom occupy the corners of the unit cell The same method can be applied

moleculeResonance structuresInequivalent resonance structuresNobond resonanceThe isoelectronic principleIsoelectronic solids Atoms and Molecules Atomism because it was dismissed by Aristotle enjoyed a long sleep in scientific discourse until it was reconsidered by Galileo Decartes and Gassendi in the s Dalton postulated the modern atomic theory in based on his observation that elements such as hydrogen and oxygen combined in specific ratios the Law of Definite Proportions but the atomic theory remained contentious throughout most of the th century Thompson Rutherford Bohr and others around the turn of the th century established that matter was indeed composed of atoms that contained heavy nuclei and light electrons and that atoms could exist in excited states that could be interpreted as excitations of their electrons to different energy levels However the atomic theory did not provide a ready explanation for the bonded states of atoms in molecules In still more than a decade before modern quantum theory would adequately describe the shapes of atomic orbitals Lewis proposed the octet theory based on the empirically observed rules of valence ie the combining ratios of atoms in molecules This theory in hindsight can be rationalized for s and pblock elements by observing that maingroup atoms can use their four valence orbitals s px py and pz to accommodate up to eight electrons some or all of which may be shared with other atoms In Lewis model the valence electrons of an atom were situated at the corners of a cube and the cubes could share edges or faces to complete their octets Lewis developed a shorthand notation for these structures based on dots that represented the valence electrons as illustrated in Fig A pair of electrons shared between atoms constitutes a chemical bond and can also be represented as a line joining the atoms Four electrons shared between atoms represented by two lines is a double bond and so forth Any pairs of electrons not involved in bonding form lone pairs that belong to one atom only and are thus not involved in bonding The Lewis picture is powerful in its simplicity It can be readily used to rationalize or predict the combining ratios of atoms to sort plausible and unlikely structures for molecules including large ones and to rationalize the acidbase properties of many molecules It is important to remember that the model is built on a shaky prequantum mechanical description of atoms and so with it we will make mistakes Nevertheless it is useful to see how far we can go with the Lewis model Figure Examples of Lewis dot diagrams showing chemical bonds between carbon hydrogen and oxygen and nonbonding electron pairs Constructing the octet valence bond picture for a molecule We can construct an octet picture for any molecule using the NV method Number of electrons needed to make separate octets around all atoms N N for nonH atoms N for H Number of valence electrons V add up using group numbers dont forget to add or subtract for charges on ions Number of shared electrons S NV and therefore the number of bonds S Fill in lone pairs everywhere else to complete octets Example nitrate anion NO N atoms x electrons V N O O O charge S shared electrons bonds The number of lone pairs is obtained by difference VS Now draw the molecule starting with the four bonds and adding eight lone pairs to complete the octets Count the shared and unshared electrons around each atom in the nitrate ion and you will see that all atoms are octet and that the total number of valence electrons V is If you do the NV calculation according to the rules above you should always get an octet structure The charges on atoms in a molecule or an extended solid such as SiO can be estimated from Xray photoelectron spectra XPS Energetic Xrays ionize atoms by kicking out electrons from their core orbitals By conservation of energy the kinetic energy KE of an emitted electron is related to its binding energy BE and the energy of the incoming Xray photon hν by BE hν KE Electrons are harder to remove from positively charged atoms higher BE and easier to remove from negatively charged atoms lower BE relative to the neutral element The formal charge distribution is assigned by dividing the shared bonding electrons equally between atoms Thus the singly bonded O atoms each possess electrons and because O is in group their formal charge is The doubly bonded O has a formal charge of zero The N atom has a formal charge of because it owns valence electrons and is in group Note that the formal charge is not the same thing as the oxidation number or oxidation state In the nitrate ion the oxidation state of nitrogen is and the oxidation state of oxygen is The formal charge is typically closer to the real charge on the atom as measured eg by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy Oxidation states are a useful bookkeeping device for keeping track of oxidationreduction reactions as we will discuss in Chapter Like oxidation states the formal charges on the atoms in a molecule or ion must add up to its overall charge We can similarly draw the Lewis structure for ammonia as shown below When we divide the shared electrons equally between the atoms we see that the N atom has five electrons and each H atom has one These are the same as their group numbers and thus all the formal charges in the ammonia molecule are zero Octet structures of the Lewis acidbase adduct NHBF the hydronium ion HO and the sulfate anion SO are shown below In this case and in many Lewis structures we will draw we leave off the implied lone pairs around the peripheral atoms Try calculating the number of bonds in each of these molecules using the NV method and fill in the lone pairs that are not explicitly drawn in In cases where more than one valence bond structure is possible we can use formal charges to decide which structures should be more or less stable The rules are The formal charges on atoms are minimized in stable structures zero being the best case Negative formal charges should be placed on the most electronegative atoms Positive formal charges should be placed on the least electronegative atoms It is unfavorable to place like charges or on neighboring atoms in a molecule Examples of these rules are shown below for alternative structures of BF and ONF In the BF case the structure on the left is nonoctet because there are only six electrons three bonds in the valence shell of B Such structures are said to be electron deficient An octet structure right can be drawn but it places a positive formal charge on F the most electronegative atom in the molecule Thus neither structure is completely happy but the formal charge rules tell us that the electrondeficient structure on the left is more stable The electron deficiency of BFmakes it a powerful Lewis acid In the case of ONF the structure on the left is unfavorable for two reasons First it places a positive formal charge on F the most electronegative atom Second there is another possible structure right that has zero formal charge which is preferable to one with nonzero charge This means that the structure on the right with a double bond between N and O is more reasonable Life outside of the ocean owes its existence to the presence of ozone O in the stratosphere Ozone absorbs the ultraviolet light in the solar spectrum which otherwise would cause catastrophic damage to DNA and other biological molecules Because ozone is produced photochemically from O which is itself generated by photosynthesis the spectroscopic signature of ozone in the atmosphere of distant planets is one possible way to look for extraterrestrial life Resonance structures The ozone O molecule has two equivalent octet structures shown below In both cases the Lewis dot diagram suggests that there are three kinds of oxygen atoms in the molecule with and formal charges These structures also suggest that ozone should have one single and one double bond Experimentally by electron diffraction however we find that the molecule is symmetric with both OO bond lengths the same The real instantaneous structure is the average of the two forms as shown below In the classical Lewis picture of the molecule we can rationalize resonance by observing that electrons being thousands of times lighter than the nuclei of atoms move very fast on the timescale of molecular vibrations Thus in the time it takes for the oxygen atoms to adjust their positions the electrons can move back and forth many times In the quantum mechanical MO picture Chapter we will see that resonance involves electrons that are fully delocalized over the atoms in the molecule We represent resonance structures with a doubleheaded arrow to signify that the only difference between the Lewis structures is the distribution of electrons Susan Solomon discovered the heterogeneous catalytic mechanism whereby ozone is decomposed by chlorofluorocarbons freons creating the Antarctic ozone hole Her work formed the basis of the UN Montreal Protocol an international agreement to protect the ozone layer by regulating damaging chemicals In the instantaneous structure of ozone the formal charge is shared between the two terminal oxygen atoms and therefore each one has a formal charge of The OO bonds are the average of a single and a double bond ie each OO bond order is Similarly the nitrate anion has three resonance structures and experimentally by Xray crystallography of nitrate salts we find that all the NO bonds in the ion are the same In this case in the averaged structure each O atom has a formal charge of and the NO bond order is Inequivalent resonance structures The rules of resonance also apply to inequivalent structures which in general will have different energies from each other In this case the structure of the molecule represents a weighted average of the low energy structures A good example is the cyanate ion OCN We can write three inequivalent octet structures for the molecule The first two are reasonable resonance structures although we suspect the one on the left is the best because it puts the negative formal charge on the most electronegative atom The last one is clearly a bad resonance structure because the formal charges are high and there is a positive charge on the oxygen atom The real structure is thus a weighted average of the first two Nobond resonance An interesting and useful kind of inequivalent resonance structure is one in which there is a bond order of zero between two of the atoms This concept of nobond resonance is important in understanding the bonding in many halogen and hydrogencontaining compounds The idea is illustrated below for the generic molecule XYZ where Z might be an electronegative halogen atom such as F By moving the bonding electrons from the YZ bond onto the Z atom and moving a lone pair from X into the XY bond we generate the resonance structure shown on the right in which all atoms remain octet but there is no bond between Y and Z It is important to recognize in this example that the nobond form is only one resonance structure and therefore the Z atom is still bound to Y If the two resonance structures in this example have the same energy we would expect the XY bond order to be and the YZ bond order to be Therefore the YZ bond should be longer than it is in a compound where the bond order is one and it should be relatively easy to break the YZ bond Some molecular examples of nobond resonance are shown below In the molecule ONF the NF bond is unusually long relative to the NF bond in NF in which the bond order is This can be explained by the nobond resonance forms shown on the right Similarly in the Lewis acidbase adduct formed by combining BH with CO we can explain the long BH bonds using nobond resonance forms that place a partial positive charge on the H atoms Nobond resonance is often used to provide an octet bonding picture for socalled hypervalent compounds which are compounds that appear to have more than valence electrons in the bonding shell of the central atom For example we can consider two different valence bond structures for the triiodide ion I which is formed by reaction of I with I in water In this structure the central iodine atom has electrons in its valence shell in violation of the octet rule Raman spectra of the triiodide ion show that the II bond is weaker than the II single bond in I suggesting that this picture is not an accurate description of the bonding A better representation of I can be obtained with nobond resonance structures as shown below We will see that this picture is consistent with the MO description of I in Chapter The deep blue color of starchiodine solutions results from the complexation of linear polyiodide ions In by the starch amylose lefthanded helix The interior of the helix is hydrophobic In electron donor solvents such as ethanol and water I and salts of I have a brown color the result of a charge transfer interaction between the solvent and solute We can draw a similar picture for the XeF molecule which has the same number of valence electrons as I This picture is consistent with XPS data which show a partial negative charge on the F atoms as well as vibrational spectra which show that the XeF bond is weaker in XeF than it is in the singlybonded cation XeF Other well known examples of hypervalent compounds are PF PCH and SF as well as oxyacids such as HSO and HClO The hypervalent structure is often drawn for these molecules with the explanation that dorbitals on the central atom contribute to the bonding in dsp and dsp hybrids for and coordinate molecules respectively However realistic molecular orbital calculations show that the phosphorus and sulfur d orbitals are too high in energy to contribute significantly to bonding in PF and SF For these molecules we can use nobond resonance to make reasonable octet structures that predict polar bonds between the central atom and F Spacefilling model of sulfur hexafluoride SF is surprisingly unreactive with water relative to other compounds that contain SF bonds The tight packing of F atoms around S prevents nucleophilic attack by water In other cases such as PCH the octet structure is unreasonable because it suggests a polar bond between P and C with a partial negative charge on C Further in the case of oxyacids such as HSO and HClO Xray crystallographic data establish that the SO and ClO bonds are shorter for the oxygen atoms not bonded to hydrogen which is more consistent with the hypervalent picture The question of whether hypervalency and the octet rule are really useful descriptions of the bonding in these compounds has been considered in a number of computational studies which have used increasingly accurate quantum mechanical calculations to determine the number of electrons associated with the central atom In a study Gillespie and Silvi found that the population of the valence shell is greater than eight for compounds with electropositive ligands such as PCH and less than eight for compounds such as PF They concluded that these valence electron shell populations depend primarily on the coordination numbers and electronegativities of the central atoms and their ligands and that there is no fundamental difference between the bonding in hypervalent and nonhypervalent Lewis octet molecules This reminds us that the octet rule is not a law of nature but rather an empirical rule that is useful within certain limits The isoelectronic principle In calculating the octet structures of molecules using the NV method we needed to know only the number of atoms and the number of electrons not the identities of the atoms themselves This means that we will get the same answer and the same set of octet and resonance structures for any molecule or ion that contains a the same number of nonhydrogen atoms and b the same total number of valence electrons Such molecules are said to be isoelectronic This is a powerful conclusion because once we have determined the electronic structure of one molecule we can write down the same solution for all other molecules that are isoelectronic For example we noted above that I and XeF which both have valence electrons have the same valence bond structure We can further expect that isoelectronic molecules will have the same shapes and very often similar physical properties The four molecules and ions below all contain three nonhydrogen atoms and valence electrons All of them are linear molecules with two double bonds The four molecules and ions shown below them all contain four nonhydrogen atoms and valence electrons These four have a trigonal planar shape While BF is a member of this isoelectronic series we do not write it in the resonance form that contains a BF double bond because that would put a positive formal charge on F Similarly we can show that CH NH NH HO HO HF F and OH are all isoelectronic with one nonH atom and eight valence electrons In the next section we will see that this gives rise to nearly identical electronic shapes for these molecules Nitrous oxide NO or laughing gas is isoelectronic with CO The two molecules have the same shape linear and similar physical properties CO sublimes at C whereas NO melts at C and boils at C Isoelectronic solids The isoelectronic principle works not just for molecules but for extended solids as well One technologically important set of isoelectronic solids are the pblock semiconductors The group element Si is the most widely used semiconductor for electronics but as we will discuss later it is not a good light emitter Lightemitting diodes LEDs which are used in lasers high efficiency lighting and display technologies are made from compounds that are isoelectronic with Si and Ge especially GaAs GaP AlAs and GaN all contain four valence electrons per atom CdTe and CuInxGaxSe CIGS are promising solar cell materials that also have the same number of valence electrons per atom Like Si and Ge these compounds have tetrahedrally bonded structures in the solid state and absorb light across most of the solar spectrum as we will discuss in more detail in Chapters and Figure The tetrahedral bonding in crystals of GaAs CdTe CuInxGaxSe and other semiconductors is similar to that in isoelectronic Si and Ge The isoelectronic principle is also a powerful tool in materials research because it provides guidance about where to look for new materials with similar and perhaps improved properties For example the discovery that efficient thin layer solar cells could be made with the compound CsSnI stimulated the exploration of many isoelectronic ABX compounds with the same perovskite crystal structure Very recently thin film solar cells based on light absorbers in this structural family MAPbIxClx and FAxMAxPbBryIy MA

Vibrational Spectroscopy Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Topic hierarchy Work Hardening Alloying and Annealing Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers One of the questions we would like to ask is why are the yield stresses of normal polycrystalline metal samples so much lower by a factor of than they are in perfect single crystals The answer has to do with the motion of dislocations Consider the picture below which shows planes of metal atoms near a dislocation the individual atoms are numbered to help you see which bonds are broken and which are formed The arrows indicate force applied under shear stress Notice how the dislocation moves by breakingmaking metalmetal bonds The key point here is that we can induce plastic deformation shear by breaking only one line of metalmetal bonds at a time along the dislocation line This involves far less force than breaking an entire plane of bonds as we would need to do to shear a perfect crystal In a given polycrystalline sample there are many dislocation lines that run perpendicular to all possible shear directions so their motion can be used to tear the metal apart Turbine rotors on large jets are made of very expensive single crystal nickeltitanium alloys so that these shearing deformations can be avoided We can see that motion of dislocations is basically bad news if we want a metal to be strong and hard eg if we want a structural material or a knife that can hold a decent edge There are several ways we can overcome to some extent this problem Use single crystals and anneal out all the dislocations expensive especially with large items like turbine blades and impossible with very large items like airplane wings or bridges Work hardening of the metal this moves all dislocations to grain boundaries the dislocation essentially becomes part of the grain boundary Since a grain boundary is a planar defect it is much less responsive to stress than a line defect Introduce impurity atoms that is alloying elements or impurity phases that pin the motion of defects An impurity atom stops the motion because it is a different size or makes stronger bonds than the other metal atoms the line defect has a hard time moving away from rows of such atoms An impurity phase like FeC in iron makes extra grain boundaries that can stop the motion of defects This effect is analogous to the graphite fibers in fiberreinforced crosslinked polymers used eg in tennis rackets that stop the propagation of cracks A simple illustration of work hardening can be done with a piece of copper wire When struck many times with a hammer the copper wire becomes stiffer and it is possible to hang a weight from it Dislocations move to the crystal grain boundaries during work hardening effectively halting their motion and at the same time making the individual crystal grains smaller Because the crystal grains are now smaller the amount of grain boundary area has increased and with it the free energy of the material Annealing reverses the process by lowering the free energy When the wire is annealed in a flame heated so that atoms can move and rearrange the crystal grains grow and the dislocations reappear The copper again becomes ductile and bends easily Coldworking work hardening of metals is important for strengthening structural materials eg iron beams and for making brittle hard edges this is why blacksmiths hammer on knives and swords when they are making them If you have ever watched them they do the same thing to horseshoes when they cool down to make them stiff Blacksmith πBonding between Metals and Ligands Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers An important factor that contributes to the high ligand field strength of ligands such as CO CN and phosphines is πbonding between the metal and the ligand There are three types of pibonding in metal complexes The most common situation is when a ligand such as carbon monoxide or cyanide donates its sigma nonbonding electrons to the metal while accepting electron density from the metal through overlap of a metal tg orbital and a ligand π orbital This situation is called backbonding because the ligand donates σelectron density to the metal and the metal donates πelectron density to the ligand The ligand is thus acting as a σdonor and a πacceptor In πbackbonding the metal donates π electrons to the ligand π orbital adding electron density to an antibonding molecular orbital This results in weakening of the CO bond which is experimentally observed as lengthening of the bond relative to free CO in the gas phase and lowering of the CO infrared stretching frequency dd π bonding occurs when an element such phosphorus which has a σsymmetry lone pair and an empty metal d orbital binds to a metal that has electrons in a tg orbital This is a common situation for phosphine complexes eg triphenylphosphine bound to lowvalent late transition metals The backbonding in this case is analogous to the CO example except that the acceptor orbital is a phosphorus d orbital rather than a ligand π orbital Here the phosphine ligand acts as a σdonor and a πacceptor forming a dπdπ bond The third kind of metalligand πbonding occurs when a πdonor ligand an element with both a σsymmetry electron pair and a filled orthogonal porbital bonds to a metal as shown above at the right for an O ligand This occurs in early transition metal complexes In this example O is acting as both a σdonor and a πdonor This interaction is typically drawn as a metalligand multiple bond eg the VO bond in the vanadyl cation VO Typical πdonor ligands are oxide O nitride N imide RN alkoxide RO amide RN and fluoride F For late transition metals strong πdonors form antibonding interactions with the filled dlevels with consequences for spin state redox potentials and ligand exchange rates πdonor ligands are low in the spectrochemical series Carboncontaining ligands that are πdonors and their complexes with transition metal ions are very important in olefin metathesis a reaction in which carboncarbon double bonds are interchanged Using these catalysts cyclic olefins can be transformed into linear polymers in high yield through ringopening metathesis polymerization ROMP Catalysts of this kind were developed by the groups of Richard Schrock and Robert Grubbs who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Yves Chauvin for their discoveries The Schrock catalysts are based on early transition metals such as Mo they are more reactive but less tolerant of different organic functional groups and protic solvents than the Grubbs catalysts which are based on Ru complexes A chiral Schrock catalyst polymerizes a norbornadiene derivative to a highly stereoregular isotactic polymer Synthesis of a Grubbs olefin metathesis catalyst σ π and δ orbitals Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Inorganic compounds use s p and d orbitals and more rarely f orbitals to make bonding and antibonding combinations These combinations result in σ π and δ bonds and antibonds You are already familiar with σ and π bonding in organic compounds In inorganic chemistry π bonds can be made from p andor dorbitals δ bonds are more rare and occur by facetoface overlap of dorbitals as in the ion ReCl The fact that the Cl atoms are eclipsed in this anion is evidence of δ bonding Figure The octachlorodirhenateIII anion ReCl which has a quadruple ReRe bond Some possible σ top row π bottom row and δ bonding combinations right of s p and d orbitals are sketched below In each case we can make bonding or antibonding combinations depending on the signs of the AO wavefunctions Because pπpπ bonding involves sideways overlap of porbitals it is most commonly observed with secondrow elements C N O πbonded compounds of heavier elements are rare because the larger cores of the atoms prevent good πoverlap For this reason compounds containing CC double bonds are very common but those with SiSi bonds are rare δ bonds are generally quite weak compared to σ and π bonds Compounds with metalmetal δ bonds occur in the middle of the transition series Transition metal dorbitals can also form σ bonds typically with sp hybrid orbitals of appropriate symmetry on ligands For example phosphines RP are good σ donors in complexes with transition metals as shown below pπdπ bonding is also important in transition metal complexes In metal carbonyl complexes such as NiCO and MoCO there is sideways overlap between filled metal dorbitals and the empty πantibonding orbitals the LUMO of the CO molecule as shown in the figure below This interaction strengthens the metalcarbon bond but weakens the carbonoxygen bond The CO infrared stretching frequency is diagnostic of the strength of the bond and can be used to estimate the degree to which electrons are transferred from the metal dorbital to the CO πantibonding orbital The same kind of backbonding occurs with phosphine complexes which have empty π orbitals as shown at the right Transition metal complexes containing halide ligands can also have significant pπdπ bonding in which a filled pπ orbital on the ligand donates electron density to an unfilled metal dπ orbital We will encounter these bonding situations in Chapter
