Arrhenius acids and bases Although the term proton is often used for H this should really be reserved for H protium not D deuterium or T tritium The more general term hydron covers all isotopes of hydrogen The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions H in An Arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of H ions in the water Note that chemists often write Haq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acidbase reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus does not exist alone in water it exists in a hydrated form which for simplicity is often written as the hydronium hydroxonium ion HO Thus an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation selfionization of water into hydronium and hydroxide OH ions Kw is defined as HOH and the value of Kw varies with temperature as shown in the table below where at C Kw is approximately ie pKw Water temperature Kw pKw C C C C C In pure water the majority of molecules are HO but the molecules are constantly dissociating and reassociating and at any time a small number of the molecules about in are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide Because the numbers are equal pure water is neutral not acidic or basic and has an electrical conductivity of microSiemen μS m For comparison sea waters conductivity is about one million times higher S m An Arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium ions Note To qualify as an Arrhenius acid upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise an increase in the aqueous hydronium concentration or a decrease in the aqueous hydroxide concentration Conversely to qualify as an Arrhenius base upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise a decrease in the aqueous hydronium concentration or an increase in the aqueous hydroxide concentration The definition is expressed in terms of an equilibrium expression acid base conjugate base conjugate acid With an acid HA the equation can be written symbolically as The equilibrium sign is used because the reaction can occur in both forward and backward directions The acid HA can lose a hydron to become its conjugate base A The base B can accept a hydron to become its conjugate acid HB Most acidbase reactions are fast so that the components of the reaction are usually in dynamic equilibrium with each other BrønstedLowry Acids and Bases While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it has limitations In chemists Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry independently recognized that acidbase reactions involve the transfer of a hydron A BrønstedLowry acid or simply Brønsted acid is a species that donates a hydron to a BrønstedLowry base The BrønstedLowry acidbase theory has several advantages over the Arrhenius theory Consider the following reactions of acetic acid CHCOOH Both theories easily describe the first reaction CHCOOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of HO when dissolved in water and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a hydron to water In the second example CHCOOH undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a hydron to ammonia NH but it cannot be described using the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium ions Lewis Acids and Bases A third concept was proposed in by Gilbert N Lewis which includes reactions with acidbase characteristics that do not involve a hydron transfer A Lewis acid is a species that reacts with a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct The Lewis acid accepts a pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor Brønsted acidbase reactions involve hydron transfer reactions while Lewis acidbase reactions involve electron pair transfers All Brønsted acids are Lewis acids but not all Lewis acids are Brønsted acids BF F BF NH H NH In the first example BF is a Lewis acid since it accepts an electron pair from the fluoride ion This reaction cannot be described in terms of the Brønsted theory because there is no hydron transfer The second reaction can be described using either theory A hydron is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia a Brønsted base alternatively ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion Other Definitions LuxFlood acidbase definition This acidbase theory was a revival of the oxygen theory of acids and bases proposed by German chemist Hermann Lux in and further improved by Håkon Flood circa It is still used in modern geochemistry and for the electrochemistry of molten salts This definition describes an acid as an oxide ion O acceptor and a base as an oxide ion donor For example MgO base CO acid MgCO CaO base SiO acid CaSiO NO base SO acid NO SO Usanovich acidbase definition Mikhail Usanovich developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogencontaining compounds and his approach published in was even more general than the Lewis theory Usanovichs theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species anions or electrons or donates positive ones cations and a base as the reverse This definition could even be applied to the concept of redox reactions oxidationreduction as a special case of acidbase reactions Some examples of Usanovich acidbase reactions include NaO base SO acid Na SO species exchanged anion O NHS base SbS acid NH SbS species exchanged anion S Na base Cl acid Na Cl species exchanged electron A comparison of the above definitions of Acids and Bases shows that the Usanovich concept encompasses all of the others but some feel that because of this it is too general to be useful
