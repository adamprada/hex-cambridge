understanding molecular bonding properties and structures From the electrons in an atom to the differing orbitals and hybridization the ground state electron configuration sheds light on many different atomic properties Fundamentally understanding electron configuration leads to an understanding of the periodic table Introduction In Niels Bohr proposed that electrons could orbit an atom at a certain distance without collapsing into the atom and that each orbit distance had its own energy level He proposed that each orbitals angular momentum M was equal to a multiple n of Planks constant h divided by π This gives the equation M nħ where ħ hπ and n This model proposed the Bohr atom which shows circular orbits surrounding the nucleus Orbitals In addition to having different energy levels orbitals also have different shapes and orientations and each can be occupied by two electrons For each principal quantum number n there is one s orbital three p orbitals five d orbitals and seven f orbitals Therefore an s orbital can hold two electrons a p orbital can hold six electrons a d orbital can hold ten electrons and an f orbital can hold electrons Ground State Electron Configuration Quantum numbers There are four quantum numbers n l ml and ms The principal quantum number n is a positive integer and it represents the energy of the orbital The angular momentum quantum number l is from to n The l values of and correspond to the s p d and f orbitals respectively The magnetic quantum number ml ranges from l to l This quantum number dictates the orbital orientation such as px py or pz The quantum spin number ms is either or and it dictates the electron spin Aufbau Principle The Aufbau principle states that electrons must fill lowest energy shells first Following the model electrons fill the s orbital with two electrons then the s with two electrons then the p with six electrons then the s with two electrons etc There are some exceptions to the Aufbau Principle This occurs mainly with electrons in the d orbital where extra stability is obtained from a half filled or fully filled d orbital Therefore if there are electrons or electrons in the d orbital it will move one electron from the s orbital below it to fill the extra space Example Chromium Crs electron configuration following the model would be s s p s p sd but instead it is s s p s p sd because there is extra stability gained from the halffilled d orbital Hunds Rule Hunds rule states that when filled sublevels other than s orbital electrons must not be spin paired in the orbitals until each orbital contains one electron and no orbital can have two electrons with the same spin ms Pauli Exclusion Principle Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons can have the same quantum numbers An orbital can only hold or electrons They must have opposite spins if there are electrons in the orbittal Periodic Trend Valence electron shells in the periodic table follow a trend This can be referred to as the s block the p block the d block and the f block lanthanides and actinides meaning that in its ground state an element in a certain block will have its valence electrons in the s p d or f orbitals depending How to Write Ground State Electron Configurations Basics Electron configurations are written using the principal quantum number n followed by the orbital s p d or f with the total number of electrons written as a superscript Example s For writing ground state electron configurations a few main steps should be followed Find the amount of electrons in the atom Example Na e Na e Fill orbitals following the model until all electrons have been accounted for Example Na e s s p s or Na s s p After that it is important to check for a nearly halffilled or filled d orbital d or d and adjust accordingly by removing an electron from the s orbital beneath it Example Chromium Cr s s p s psd half filled orbital s orbital beneath it s s p s p sd Shorthand Because writing the entire electron configuration can become cumbersome there is a shorthand option It is done by using the symbol of the noble gas in the period above the element to represent the electron configuration before it Example Na Ne s References Housecroft Catherine E and Alan G Sharpe Inorganic Chemistry rd ed England Pearson Education Limited Tro Nivaldo J Chemistry A Molecular Approach th
