A Ionic Radii Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionHardSphere modelPeriodic TrendsReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswers In a crystal lattice the ionic radius is a measure of the size of the atoms ion When formed ionic atoms change in size with respect to their orginal atom Cation radii will decrease and the anion radii will increase in size compared to their neutral atoms Questions such as What methodology is used by chemists to measure ionic radii and Are there any nonexperimental ways to estimate the size of ionic radii will be answered in this module Accordingly there are many ways to determine ionic radii IntroductionHardSphere modelPeriodic TrendsReferencesOutside LinksProblemsAnswers Introduction In the past after an atom is ionized Xray diffraction is used to measure how much the radius of the atom increased or decreased However scientists wanted to use another technique due to the fact that Xray diffraction is difficult to distinguish a boundary between two ions As a result the hard sphere model can be used HardSphere model The HardSphere model are impenetrable spheres that do not overlap in space The HardSphere model has been tested by wellknown scientists Lande Pauling and Goldsmidt The ion radii measured under crystal state of ionic compound which cations and anions are stacking in pattern as shown below Figure Schematic of the hardsphere model The HardSphere model can be applied to metallic and ionic compounds such as NaCl which is shown below Figure D hard sphere model of Sodium Chloride taken with permission from httpenwikipediaorgwikiFileSoeDionicpng In general scientists uses formula of Internuclear distance to test out the radii of ion then compared with the ion radii had done on Xray diffraction Internuclear distance d rcation ranion To calculate ion radii Lande used ionic compound under solid state ex NaCl This will minize the distribution of electrons Find the radii of anion r atom Find internuclear distance d between anion and cation Use Internuclear distance formula to find the r Figure The Hard sphere model can roughly determine the ion radii Periodic Trends As described earlier cations are smaller in size compared to their neutral atoms while anions are larger in sizeCations are smaller than its neutral atoms because the positive nuclear charge which holds the electrons in closer exceeds the negative charge when a metal atom loses an electron On the contrary anions are larger because the electrons are not held as tightly repulsions of electrons increase and the electrons spread out more due to nonmetal atoms gaining an electron Refer to the outside link to learn more about the periodic trends for ionic radii httpabulafiamticacukshannonptablephp References Kotz Treichel Weaver Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity Thomson BrooksCole Mason OH p Housecroft C and Shappe A Inorganic Chemistry rd edition Pearson Education Limited England p Barrera M and FZuloagat Determination of the ionic radii by means of the KohnSham potential Identification of the chemical potential International journal of quantum chemistry Ionic radii for Group and Group halide hydride fluoride oxide sulfide selenide and telluride crystals Dalton transactions httpenwikipediaorgwikiHard_spheres httpenwikipediaorgwikiIonic_radius Outside Links httpabulafiamticacukshannonptablephp Problems What is the most general formula that used to determine the ion radii for hard sphere model Find radius for Cacium ion in Calcium Chloride CaCl List out all the steps numbers are not necessary Determine which is larger a K or Cs b La or Lu c Ca or Zn Answers Internuclear distance d rcation ranion Find the radii of anion r atom Find internuclear distance d between anion and cation Use Internuclear distance formula to find the r a Cs b La c Ca
