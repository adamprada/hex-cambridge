Factors affect the strength of orbital interaction There are several factors that contribute to the overlap of two atomic orbitals as a consequence they affect the strength of the orbital interaction the symmetry of the orbitals the energy difference between them their orbital sizes and distance between the orbitalsFigure shows a delta bond forming from the overlap of two d orbitals In the delta bond interaction lobes are perpendicular to the axis lie between atoms Comparing to the sigma and pi bond interaction the delta bond has the weakest interaction figure The difference between energies of two atomic orbitals also takes a significant contribution to the strength of orbital interaction The relative energies of atomic orbitals of X and Y will dictate whether an interaction will lead to efficient overlap or not Housecroft page The more similar in energy of two atomic orbitals will result in the stronger interaction in the formation of new molecular orbital The homonuclear diatomics such as O N Cl have the same atomic orbital energies so the orbital interaction between them is very strong On the other hand in the heteronuclear diatomic CO HF the atomic orbitals lie at different energy the orbital interaction depends on how close their energy difference is Orbital size is another factor that affects the strength of orbital interactions due to the overlap region of orbitals The orbitals with different sizes have weaker interactions than the same size orbitals the result of a weaker bond can be explained by the weaker overlap between orbitals This is shown in figure figure The last factor that affects the orbital interaction is the distance between orbitals The sigma bonding interaction and the pi bonding interaction have strong interaction due to their much closed orbitals The delta bonding interaction will possess the weakest interaction because their orbitals are far from each other Show in figure figure The wave interaction of atomic orbitals Depending on the phase relationship there are two different ways that the two orbital overlap The phase of an orbital has the same properties of the wavelike of electrons Light waves interaction have two different ways one is inphase increasing the intensity of the light and other one is outofphase decreasing the intensity of the light Similarly electron waves interaction has two types inphase and outofphase Inphase interaction increases the intensity of negative charge On the other hand decreasing the intensity of the negative charge results from the out of phase interaction The orbital phase is presented by a plus or minus sign When the two same sign orbitals overlap to form a molecular orbital the electron density will occupy at the region between two nuclei This negative charge intensity of electrons will increase in the inphase interaction The increasing negative charge increases attractions between electrons and nucleiThe molecular orbital resulting from inphase interaction is defined as the bonding orbital which has lower energy than the original atomic orbital The out of phase interaction between two atomic orbitals doesnt result in electron density between the two atomic nuclei The negative charge intensity of electrons will decrease in the out of phase interaction The decreasing negative charge decreases attractions between electrons and nuclei As a consequence the out of phase interaction forms the anti bonding molecular orbital with the higher energy than the initial atomic orbital The diagram shows the bonding and antibonding between two s

factors that affect the orbital interaction There are some significant factors that affect the strength of orbital interaction Symmetry of the molecule orbital The difference between orbitals energies The orbitals sizes The distance between orbitals What are HOMO and LUMO How do they interact in the molecule orbitals The highest energy occupied molecular orbital is called HOMO The lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital is called LUMO These orbitals are a pair and they lie very close together in energy of two molecules Therefore the interaction between them is very strong What are the two types of electron waves interaction Inphase and out of phase interactions How do the intensity of negative charge of electrons change in each types of of electron waves interaction The intensity of negative charge of electrons increases in the inphase interaction and decreases in the outofphase interaction
