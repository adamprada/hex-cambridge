A Molten Salt Solvent Systems Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers When a solid salt melts it forms a solution of the cations and anions For example KOH melts at temperatures above C and dissociates into K and OH ions which can act as a solvent for chemical reactions Because of the autodissociation of the OH solvent water is always present in a molten KOH flux according to the acidbase equilibrium It follows that in this very basic solvent water the conjugate acid of the solvent is the strongest acid that can exist The conjugate base of the solvent O is the strongest base This autodissociation equilibrium allows for the acidity of a flux to be easily tuned through the addition or boiling off of water A wet flux is more acidic and can dissolve metal oxides that contain the basic O anion Conversely a dry flux is more basic and will cause oxides to precipitate Molten hydroxide fluxes can thus be used in the synthesis of oxide crystals such as the perovskite superconductor KXBaXBiO Eutectic mixtures of NaOH and KOH are relatively low melting C and can be used as solvents for crystallizing a variety of basic oxides
