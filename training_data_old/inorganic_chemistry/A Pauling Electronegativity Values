A Pauling Electronegativity Values Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Pauling ElectronegativityReferencesProblemsContributors and Attributions Linus Pauling described electronegativity as the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself Basically the electronegativity of an atom is a relative value of that atoms ability to attract election density toward itself when it bonds to another atom The higher the electronegativity of an element the more that atom will attempt to pull electrons towards itself and away from any atom it bonds to The main properties of an atom dictate its electronegativity are its atomic number as well as its atomic radius The trend for electronegativity is to increase as you move from left to right and bottom to top across the periodic table This means that the most electronegative atom is Fluorine and the least electronegative is Francium There are a few different types of electronegativity which differ only in their definitions and the system by which they assign values for electronegativity For example there is Mulliken electronegativity which is defined as the average of the ionization energy and electron affinity of an atom which as we will see differs slightly from Paulings definition of electronegativity Pauling Electronegativity Linus Pauling was the original scientist to describe the phenomena of electronegativity The best way to describe his method is to look at a hypothetical molecule that we will call XY By comparing the measured XY bond energy with the theoretical XY bond energy computed as the average of the XX bond energy and the YY bond energy we can describe the relative affinities of these two atoms with respect to each other Δ Bond Energies XYmeasured XYexpected If the electonegativities of X and y are the same then we would expect the measured bond energy to equal the theoretical expected bond energy and therefore the Δ bond energies would be zero If the electronegativities of these atoms are not the same we would see a polar molecule where one atom would start to pull electron density toward itself causing it to become partially negative By doing some careful experiments and calculations Pauling came up with a slightly more sophisticated equation for the relative electronegativities of two atoms in a molecule ENX ENY Δ In that equation the factor is simply a conversion factor between kJ and eV to keep the units consistent with bond energies By assigning a value of to Fluorine the most electronegative element Pauling was able to set up relative values for all of the elements This was when he first noticed the trend that the electronegativity of an atom was determined by its position on the periodic table and that the electronegativity tended to increase as you moved left to right and bottom to top along the table The range of values for Paulings scale of electronegativity ranges from Fluorine most electronegative to Francium least electronegative Furthermore if the electronegativity difference between two atoms is very large then the bond type tends to be more ionic however if the difference in electronegativity is small then it is a nonpolar covalent bond References Zumdahl Steven S Chemical Principles th Edition Houghton Mifflin Company Chapter Electronegativity pgs Housecroft Catherine E et al Inorganic Chemistry rd Edition Pearson Education Limited Chapter Electronegativity Values pgs International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Electronegativity goldbookiupacorgEhtml Problems Explain the difference between Electronegativity and Electron Affinity Predict the order or increasing electronegativity from the following elements a F Li C O b Te Cl S Se c Cs At Tl I Contributors and Attributions Matthew Salem UC Davis
