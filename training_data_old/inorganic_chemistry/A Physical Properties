A Physical Properties Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Hydrofluoric acid is difficult to work with because is corrodes glass and silica giving gaseous or the so it must be stored in PTFE or dry Cu or Monel metalI Liquid range to K Relative permittivity at K at K Liquid HF undergoes selfionization Kself x at K dihydridofluorine ion difluorohydrogenate ion Large electronegativity difference between H xP and F xP results in the presence of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the liquid Hydrogen bonded molecules molecules on average in liquid phase Cyclic HFx species are present in the gas phase Warning causes burns that are slow to heal or even get progressively worse Exercise extreme caution if using this solvent Very few compounds exist which are strong enough F acceptors to be considered acids An example is which leads to pure HF having superacid properties Pure HF has a dielectric constant of and is a good solvent like water which is surprisingly gentle It can be used for example to remove Fe from metalloproteins without damaging the apoprotein primary structure
