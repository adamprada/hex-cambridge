A Schottky Defect Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionPoint DefectsSchottky defects for and ReferencesProblemsAnswers Lattice structures are not perfect in fact most of the time they experience defects Lattice structures or crystals are prone to defects especially when their temperature is greater than K One of these defects is known as the Schottky defect which occurs when oppositely charged ions vacant their sites Introduction Like the human body lattice structures most commonly known as crystals are far from perfection Our body works hard to keep things proportional but occasionally our right foot is bigger than our left similarly crystals may try to arrange its ions under a strict layout but occasionally an ion slips to another spot or simply goes missing Realistically speaking it should be expected that crystals will depart itself from order not surprising considering defects occurs at temperature greater than K There are many ways a crystal can depart itself from order thus experiences defects these defects can be grouped in different categories such as Point Defects Line Defects Planar Defects or Volume or Bulk Defects We will focus on Point Defects specifically the defect that occurs in ionic crystal structures ie NaCl called the Schottky Defect Point Defects Lattice structures or crystals undergoing point defects experience one of two types atoms or ions leaving their spot thus creating vacancies atoms or ions slipping into the little gaps in between other atoms or ions those little gaps are known as interstitialssince atoms or ions in the crystals are occupying interstitials they inherently become create interstitials By the simplest definition the Schottky defect is defined by type one while type two defects are known as the Frenkel defect The Schottky defect is often visually demonstrated using the following layout of anions and cations vacant vacant Figure The positive symbols represents cations ie Na and the negative symbol represents anions ie Cl In addition this layout is applicable only for ionic crystal compounds of the formula MXlayout for ionic crystals with formula MX and MX will be discussed laterwhere M is metal and X is nonmetal Notice the figure has exactly one cation and one anion vacating their sites that is what defines a one Schottky Defect for a crystal of MX formulafor every cation that vacant its site the same number of anion will follow suit essentially the vacant sites come in pairs This also means the crystal will neither be too positive or too negative because the crystal will always be in equilibrium in respect to the number of anions and cations It is possible to approximate the number of Schottky defects ns in a MX ionic crystal compound by using the equation where is the enthalpy of defect formation is the gas constant is the absolute temperature in K and N can be calculated by From Equation it is also possible to calculate the fraction of vacant sites by using the equation Schottky defects for and As mentioned earlier a Schottky defect will always result a crystal structure in equilibriumwhere no crystal is going to be too positive or too negative thus in the case of MX one Schottky defect equals one cation and two anion vacancy MX one Schottky defect equals two cation and three anion vacancy References Housecroft Catherine Inorganic Chemistry Pearson Prentice Hall Sólyom JJenö Fundamentals of the Physics of Solids Translated by Attila Piróth New York Springer c Tilley Richard Understanding Solids John Wiley Sons LTD Problems How does an ionic crystal structure maintain electrical neutrality despite undergoing a Schottky defect How is a Schottky defect defined for a compound with a MX formula MX MX Given that the enthalpy of defect formation for LiCl is x J and the density of LiCl is gcm Calculate the number of Schottky defect at K Using the number of Schottky defect solved for question determine the fraction of vacant site for LiCl If a anion and a cation vacant its site and occupies a space between other anions and cations is it still a Schottky defect Answers For a MX compound one anion and one cation vacant their sites so the overall charge will remain balanced This is the same for MX and MX because appropriate numbers of anions and cations vacant their site thus leaving the overall charge neutral MX compound one Schottky defect is when one anion and one cation leave their sites MX compound one Schottky defect is when one anion and two cations leave their sites MX is when two anions and three cations leave their sites
