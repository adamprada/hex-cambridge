and oxidationreduction The definition of acid and base has changed over the course of time This is not a problem of the orthodoxy of one definition but of the convenience of applying the concept to a particular chemical problem Therefore ranking the strength of acids and base also depends on the definition of acid and base used a Arrheniuss acid and base In Arrhenius defined that an acid is a substance that gives H and a base one that gives OH Namely if an acid is HA and a base BOH then HA H A and BOH B OH Therefore when an acid and a base react water is formed b BrønstedLowrys acid and base In a new theory submitted in independently by Brønsted and Lowry an acid is defined as a molecule or an ion which gives H and a molecule or ion that receives H from a partner is a base A base is not only a molecule or an ion which gives OH but anything which receives H Since the acid HA gives H to water in an aqueous solution and generates an oxonium ion HO water is also a kind of base according to this definition Here HO is called a conjugate acid and A a conjugate base However since water gives H to ammonia and generates NH it is also an acid as is shown below That is water can be an acid or a base dependent on the coreactant Although the definition of BrønstedLowry is not much different from that of Arrhenius for aqueous solutions it is more useful because the theory was extended to nonaqueous acids and bases Exercise Write the molecular formulae of nitric acid perchloric acid sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid as oxo acids together with the formal oxidation number of the central atom Answer Nitric acid HONO Perchloric acid HOClO Sulfuric acid HOSO and Phosphoric acid HOPO Acid strength A protonic acid gives H to water and generates the oxonium ion HO The strength of an acid in a dilute aqueous solution is estimated from the equilibrium constant Ka for the dissociation equilibrium but it is more convenient to use An acid with pKa is classified as a strong acid and one with pKa a weak acid The conjugate base of a strong acid is a weak base The pKa values of typical acids at C are shown in Table Table Acidity constants for aqueous solutions of acids at C Acid pKa HF HCl HBr HI HCO HClO HNO HPO HPO HSO CHCOOH CHCOOH NH CHNH Estimated value Since a solvent also works as an acid or a base the acidity and its range depend on the solvent dissolving the acid Full dissociation of an acid stronger than HO gives H to water forming HO in an aqueous solution For example both HBr and HI dissociate completely to become HO and their acidities are similar This kind of phenomenon is called the leveling effect and all acidities become equal to that of HO In measuring the relative acidity of strong acids it is necessary to use a solvent whose H affinity is smaller than that of water such as acetic acid or ethanol Binary halo acids HX except for HF are very strong acids Although the HO concentration itself is also high in an aqueous solution of HF the stronger hydrogen bond of F compared with that of other halide anions decreases the thermodynamic activity of HO The acidity of oxo acids such as phosphoric acid sulfuric acid nitric acid and perchloric acid is related to the formal oxidation number of P S N and Cl Namely if the oxo acid HnXOm is denoted by HOnXOmn the positive charge on X becomes positive m n and the acidity is higher for larger value of this number The number parallels the ease of dissociation of OH to give a proton Acidity is higher in the following order perchloric acid HOClO sulfuric acid HOSO nitric acid HONO phosphoric acid HOPO Although phosphoric acid can be written as HOPO phosphorous acid is not HOP but HOHPO and has an acid strength comparable to phosphoric acid Hammett acidity function Hydrogen ion concentration and pH are meaningful only in dilute aqueous solutions of acids The acidity in nonaqueous and concentrated solutions is measured using the Hammett acidity function This function makes it possible to measure the acidities of various acids in a nonaqueous solvent or of an acid in various nonaqueous solvents The Hammett acidity function in the equilibrium is defined by In a very dilute solution and An acid with H over is called a superacid This is an acid that is times stronger than a molar solution of a strong acid H for pure sulfuric acid is for a solution of HF in SbF and for the combination of HSOF and SbF Superacids have the ability to remove H from a hydrocarbon and perform HD exchange and CC bond scission etc c Lewis acid and base Whereas the concept of Brønsted acid and base is limited to the transfer of protons a Lewis acid A is generally defined as an acceptor and a Lewis base B a donor of an electron pair An acid A and a base B bind together to form an adduct AB For example a Lewis acid BF and a Lewis base OEt diethylether form an adduct FBOEt The stability increases by the completion of an octet around boron when such an adduct forms The stability of an adduct is expressed by the equilibrium constant of the reaction Therefore the Lewis acidities of a series of acids are measured by comparing Kf against a common base B Since a proton is also an electron acceptor Brønsted acids are the special case of the more general Lewis definition of acids According to this definition a coordinate bond in a transition metal complex is also an acidbase reaction of a ligand Lewis base with a metal center Lewis acid V Gutmann proposed the negative enthalpy of formation kcal mol unit of the adduct ClSbSol of Sol solvent with a standard acid SbCl in dichloroethane as a measure of the Lewis basicity of a solvent This is called the donor number DN of a solvent On the other hand the P NMR chemical shift of EtP in a solvent is defined as the measure of the Lewis acidity of the solvent and is called the acceptor number AN Hard and soft acids and bases R G Pearson classified Lewis acids and bases according to their hardness and softness This classification is an extension of the original theory of S Ahrland J Chatt and N R Davies who proposed that metal cations were classified in the order of the stability constants Kf of the formation of the complexes of the metal cations with halide anions Namely the order of Kf is I Br Cl F toward metal ions belonging to class a and F Cl Br I toward those of class b The class a type metal cations are hard acids and class b type ones are soft acids The metal cations which are not much dependent on the kind of halogens have borderline character What should be noticed here is that Kf tends to become large for the combination of a hard acid and a hard base or a soft acid and a soft base If the concept is extended from simple metal cations and halide anions to general Lewis acids and bases they can similarly be classified in terms of the hard and soft acidbase affinity Typical hard acids and bases and soft acids and bases are shown in Table Table The classification of Lewis acids and bases Hard Borderline Soft Acids H Li Na K Be Mg Ca Al Ti Cr Fe BF Cl Fe Co NiCu Zn Sn Pb Sb Bi Cu Ag Au Tl Cd Hg Hg PdPtPt Bases NHHORO FOHO NOSOPO NNNO Br SO HCNR I PRSRCO The qualitative expression softness is a chemical paraphrasing of the ease of polarization and the larger contribution of covalency than ionicity in bonding The cations of alkali and alkaline earth metals as well as aluminum are hard and the cations of mercury copper silver and gold etc are soft Whereas oxides are hard sulfides and phosphorus compounds are soft In the minerals of the Earths crust aluminum which is hard and oxophilic is found as an oxide and cadmium which is soft and chalcophilic is found as a sulfide Exercise Applying the concept of hard and soft acids for ferric and ferrous ions what kind of minerals are expected in iron ores Answer Fe is a hard acid and Fe is a borderline acid Therefore it is likely that the main iron ores are oxide minerals Although the main ores are actually the oxides hematite FeO or magnetite FeO a Fe sulfide pyrite FeS is also widely distributed Acidbase and oxidationreduction Some people confuse acidbase and redox reactions This confusion may be caused firstly by the similar terms originating from oxygen and secondly by misunderstanding about electron transfer Historically A L Lavoisier who was one of the great founders of modern chemistry in the th century considered that oxygen was the basis of all acids He also defined oxidation as the formation of oxides from an element and oxygen It then took a long time before the present definitions of acidbase and redox reactions were proposed and the old definitions were no longer satisfactory Furthermore the Lewis acid accepts an electron pair from a base forming a Lewis acidbase complex and the oxidizing agent accepts electrons from a reducing agent and is reduced The fact that acids and oxidizing agents are electron acceptors and that bases and reducing agents are electron donors is one of the causes of this confusion Problems The Latimer diagram of oxygen is shown below Write the oxidation number of oxygen in each compound Calculate the reduction potential of the reaction which converts an oxygen molecule to water and judge whether this reaction is a spontaneous reaction Which is the stronger base ammonia or pyridine The order of the Lewis acidity of boron halides is BF BCl BBr Is this order reasonable from the standpoint of the electronegativities of halogens
