Amorphous Alloys Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Alloys of metals with more complex stoichiometries can be made in amorphous form by slower cooling from the melt These alloys have been prepared and studied since the s and since the s amorphous alloys have been discovered that can be prepared in bulk form at cooling rates on the order of degs similar to the cooling rates of other kinds of glasses Currently amorphous metals marketed under the tradenames Vitreloy and Liquidmetal are used commercially in golf clubs watches USB flash drives and other applications where very high elasticity yield strength andor wear resistance are needed Year Alloy Cooling Rate Ks AuSi thin films ribbons PdCuSi s LaAlCu others s ZrTiCuNiBe similar to oxide glasses
