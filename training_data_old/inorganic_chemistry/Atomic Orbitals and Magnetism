Atomic Orbitals and Magnetism Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Periodic trends in delectron bonding Late transition metal alloysFilling of the d and sp bands The MO picture we developed in Section helps us rationalize the electrical conductivity of Na s but what about Mg which as an atom in the gas phase has a s electronic configuration The two valence electrons are spinpaired in atomic Mg as they are in the helium atom s When the s orbitals of Mg combine to form a band we would expect the band to be completely filled since Mg has two electrons per orbital By this reasoning solid Mg should be an insulator But Mg has all the properties of a metal high electrical and thermal conductivity metallic luster malleability etc In this case the s and p bands are sufficiently broad because of strong orbital overlap between Mg atoms that they form a continuous band This band which contains a total of four orbitals one s and three p per atom is only partially filled by the two valence electrons Mg crystals Another way to think about this is to consider the hybridization of the s and p electrons in Mg Hybridization requires promotion from the sp ground state of an Mg atom to a sp excited state The promotion energy kJmol is more than offset by the bonding energy kJmol the energy released when gaseous atoms in the excited state condense to form the metallic solid The heat of vaporization or the cohesive energy of a metal is the difference between the bonding energy and the promotion energy Experimentally we can measure the vaporization energy kJmol and the promotion energy and use them to calculate the bonding energy From this we learn that each s or p electron is worth about kJmol in bonding energy The concepts of promotion energy and bonding energy are very useful in rationalizing periodic trends in the bond strengths and magnetic properties of metals which are described below The cohesive energy of Mg metal is the difference between the bonding and promotion energies The ground state of a gas phase Mg atom is Ars but it can be promoted to the Arsp state which is kJmol above the ground state Mg uses two electrons per atom to make bonds and the sublimation energy of the metal is kJmol Periodic trends in delectron bonding While electrons in s and p orbitals tend to form strong bonds delectron bonds can be strong or weak There are two important periodic trends that are related to orbital size and orbital overlap As we move across the periodic table Sc Ti V Cr Fe the d orbitals contract because of increasing nuclear charge Moving down the periodic table V Nb Ta the d orbitals expand because of the increase in principal quantum number These trends explain the distinct behavior of the d elements relative to those in the d and d series In the d series the contraction of orbitals affects the ability of the d electrons to contribute to bonding Past V in the first row of the transition metals the d electrons become much less effective in bonding because they overlap weakly with their neighbors Weak overlap of d orbitals gives narrow dbands and results in the emergence of magnetic properties as discussed below Schematic representation of the sizes of different orbitals of Cr and W In the first transition series shielding of the d orbitals is poor Therefore the s and p orbitals are more effective in bonding than the d In the third transition series the situation is reversed The increased nuclear charge is felt most strongly by the s which takes on the character of an inert electron pair The d orbitals are well shielded by the complete n shell so they have good orbital overlap with neighboring atoms In the d and d series a plot of cohesive energy vs number of valence electrons below left has a volcano shape that is peaked at the elements Mo and W sd and sd respectively The number of bonding electrons and therefore the bonding energy increases steadily going from Rb to Mo in the d series and from Cs to W in the d series Mo and W have the most bonding energy because they can use all six of their valence electrons in bonding without promotion Elements past Mo and W have more d electrons but some of them are spin paired and so some promotion energy is needed to prepare these electrons for bonding For example Pt metal must be promoted from the sd atomic ground state to sdp in order to make six bonds per atom and the energy cost of promoting electrons from the d to the p orbitals is reflected in the net bonding energy Because of their strong bonding energy elements in the middle of the d and d series have very high melting points We do not see magnetism in the d or d metals or their alloys because orbital overlap is strong and the bonding energy exceeds the electron pairing energy The heat of vaporization the cohesive energy of metals in the d and d series measured at the melting point of the metal The d elements Sc through Zn are distinctly different from the d and d elements in their bonding and consequently in their magnetic properties In the d series we see the expected increase in cohesive energy going from Ca s to Sc sd to Ti sd to V sd but then something very odd happens The d series has a crater in the cohesive energy plot where there was a peak in the d series The cohesive energy actually decreases going from V to Mn even though the number of valence electrons is increasing We can explain this effect by remembering that the d orbitals are progressively contracting as more protons are added to the nucleus For elements beyond V the orbital overlap is so poor that the d electrons are no longer effective in bonding and the valence electrons begin to unpair At this point the elements become magnetic Depending on the way the spins order metals and alloys in this part of the periodic table can be ferromagnetic spins on neighboring atoms aligned parallel as in the case of Fe or Ni or antiferromagnetic spins on neighboring atoms antiparallel as in the case of Mn We have seen the tradeoff between orbital overlap and magnetism before in Chapter in the context of paramagnetic transition metal complexes It is worth recalling that this behavior is predicted in the energy vs distance diagram of the hydrogen atom from Chapter At short interatomic distances or with strong overlap between atomic orbitals the spins of the electrons pair and a bond is formed Unpairing the electrons becomes favorable at larger interatomic distances where the overlap between orbitals is poor With strong overlap between orbitals of neighboring atoms the bonding energy exceeds the pairing energy and electrons spinpair With weaker overlap bonding is weak and spins unpair resulting in magnetic behavior Interestingly many alloys of the f elements the lanthanides are also magnetic because the f orbitals like the d orbitals are poorly shielded from the nuclear charge and are ineffective in bonding Strong permanent magnets often contain alloys of Nd Sm or Y usually with magnetic d elements such as Fe and Co Because the f orbitals are contracted and not very effective in bonding other physical properties of the lanthanides can also be affected For example it has been proposed that oxides of the f elements have weak surface interactions with polar molecules such as water because of forbital contraction Experimentally CeO ErO and HoO are observed to be hydrophobic whereas main group and early transition metal oxides eg AlO SiO TiO are quite hydrophilic Late transition metal alloys Although the bonding in the d series follows a normal volcano plot the situation is a bit more complex for alloys of Re Os Ir Pt and Au There is strong overlap between the d orbitals but because these elements contain more than five delectrons per atom they cannot make as many bonds as d or d elements with halffilled dshells such as Mo or W This progressive filling of the dband explains the steady decrease in bonding energy going from Os to Au Pt and Au are both soft metals with relatively low heats of vaporization However these metals especially Ir Pt and Au can combine with early transition metals to form stable alloys with very negative heats of formation and high melting points For example ZrC and Pt react to form a number of stable alloys ZrPt ZrPt ZrPt ZrPt plus carbon This reactivity is unusual because we normally think of Pt as a noble ie unreactive metal and because ZrC is a very stable refractory metal carbide The favorable combination of early and late transition metals has been interpreted as arising from a delectron acidbase interaction For example in HfPt Hf is the acid with an electron configuration of sd while Pt is the base with the electron configuration of sd They combine to create a stable salt product with a filled d electron configuration without promoting any electrons to higher orbitals The implication is that Pt donates delectrons to the dacid Zr or Hf However electronic structure calculations on model compounds show that much of the bonding energy in ZrPt and ZrPt arises from electron transfer from Zr to Pt not the other way around and the polarity of the resulting metalmetal bonds Regardless of the source of their stability some earlylate transition metal alloys are of particular interest for use in catalysis For example the alloy ScPt is a good catalyst for oxygen reduction in fuel cells Even though Sc is an active metal that is easily oxidized it is stabilized in the aqueous acid environment of the fuel cell by its strong interaction with Pt Filling of the d and sp bands In the d series we see magnetic behavior for elements and alloys between Cr and Ni Past Ni the elements Cu Zn Ga are no longer magnetic and they are very good electrical conductors implying that their valence electrons are highly delocalized We can understand this behavior by considering the overlap of s p and d orbitals all of which are close in energy The s and p have strong overlap and form a broad continuous band On the other hand the d electrons are contracted and form a relatively narrow band Progressing from the early d elements Sc Ti V we begin to fill the d orbitals which are not yet so contracted that they cannot contribute to bonding Thus the valence electrons in Sc Ti and V are all spinpaired except for a small number near the Fermi level that give rise to a weak Pauli paramagnetism Moving across the d series to the magnetic elements Fe Co Ni the dorbitals are now so contracted that their electrons unpair and we see cooperative ordering of spins ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism Referring to the band diagram at the right the d band is only partially filled and the Fermi level cuts through it For Cu Zn and Ga the d orbitals are even more contracted and the d band is thus more narrow but now it is completely filled and the Fermi level is in the sp band The strong orbital overlap in these bands results in spin pairing and a high degree of electron delocalization Consequently metals in this part of the periodic table Cu Ag are diamagnetic and are among the best electrical conductors at room temperature Finally at Ge the sp band is completely filled and the solid is a semiconductor Progressive filling of the d and sp bands going across the periodic table from Sc to Ge Materials are classified as diamagnetic if they contain no unpaired electrons Diamagnetic substances are very weakly repelled from an inhomogeneous magnetic field As we learned in Chapter molecules or ions that have unpaired spins are paramagnetic and are attracted to a magnet ie they move towards the high field region of an inhomogeneous field This attractive force results from the alignment of spins with the field but in the case of paramagnetism each molecule acts independently In metals alloys oxides and other solid state compounds the unpaired spins interact strongly with each other and can order spontaneously resulting in the cooperative magnetic phenomena described below
