and Robert Bunsen first used atomic absorption spectroscopyalong with atomic emissionin and as a means for identify atoms in flames and hot gases Although atomic emission continued to develop as an analytical technique progress in atomic absorption languished for almost a century Modern atomic absorption spectroscopy has its beginnings in as a result of the independent work of A C Walsh and C T J Alkemade Commercial instruments were in place by the early s and the importance of atomic absorption as an analytical technique was soon evident Instrumentation Atomic absorption spectrophotometers use the same singlebeam or doublebeam optics described earlier for molecular absorption spectrophotometers see Figure and Figure There is however an important additional need in atomic absorption spectroscopywe must covert the analyte into free atoms In most cases our analyte is in solution form If our sample is a solid then we must bring it into solution before the analysis When analyzing a lake sediment for Cu Zn and Fe for example we bring the analytes into solution as Cu Zn and Fe by extracting them with a suitable reagent For this reason only the introduction of solution samples is considered in this text What reagent we choose to use depends on our research goals If we need to know the total amount of metal in the sediment then we might use a microwave digestion using a mixture of concentrated acids such as HNO HCl and HF This destroys the sediments matrix and brings everything into solution On the other hand if our interest is biologically available metals we might extract the sample under milder conditions such as a dilute solution of HCl or CHCOOH at room temperature Atomization The process of converting an analyte to a free gaseous atom is called atomization Converting an aqueous analyte into a free atom requires that we strip away the solvent volatilize the analytes and if necessary dissociate the analyte into free atoms Desolvating an aqueous solution of CuCl for example leaves us with solid particulates of CuCl Converting the particulate CuCl to gas phases atoms of Cu and Cl requires thermal energy There are two common atomization methods flame atomization and electrothermal atomization although a few elements are atomized using other methods Flame Atomizer Figure shows a typical flame atomization assembly with closeup views of several key components In the unit shown here the aqueous sample is drawn into the assembly by passing a highpressure stream of compressed air past the end of a capillary tube immersed in the sample When the sample exits the nebulizer it strikes a glass impact bead converting it into a fine aerosol mist within the spray chamber The aerosol mist is swept through the spray chamber by the combustion gasescompressed air and acetylene in this caseto the burner head where the flames thermal energy desolvates the aerosol mist to a dry aerosol of small solid particles The flames thermal energy then volatilizes the particles producing a vapor consisting of molecular species ionic species and free atoms Compressed air is one of the two gases whose combustion produces the flame Figure Flame

shown here is from an older instrument the basic components of a modern flame AA spectrometer are the same Burner The slot burner in Figure a provides a long optical pathlength and a stable flame Because absorbance increases linearly with the path length a long path length provides greater sensitivity A stable flame minimizes uncertainty due to fluctuations in the flame The burner is mounted on an adjustable stage that allows the entire assembly to move horizontally and vertically Horizontal adjustments ensure that the flame is aligned with the instruments optical path Vertical adjustments adjust the height within the flame from which absorbance is monitored This is important because two competing processes affect the concentration of free atoms in the flame The more time the analyte spends in the flame the greater the atomization efficiency thus the production of free atoms increases with height On the other hand a longer residence time allows more opportunity for the free atoms to combine with oxygen to form a molecular oxide For an easily oxidized metal such as Cr the concentration of free atoms is greatest just above the burner head For metals such as Ag which are difficult to oxidize the concentration of free atoms increases steadily with height Figure Other atoms show concentration profiles that maximize at a characteristic height Figure Absorbance versus height profiles for Ag and Cr in flame atomic absorption spectroscopy Flame The flames temperature which affects the efficiency of atomization depends on the fueloxidant mixture several examples of which are listed in Table Of these the airacetylene and the nitrous oxideacetylene flames are the most popular Normally the fuel and oxidant are mixed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio however a fuelrich mixture may be necessary for easily oxidized analytes Table Fuels and Oxidants Used for Flame Combustion fuel oxidant temperature range oC natural gas air hydrogen air acetylene air acetylene nitrous oxide acetylene oxygen Figure shows a crosssection through the flame looking down the source radiations optical path The primary combustion zone is usually rich in gas combustion products that emit radiation limiting is usefulness for atomic absorption The interzonal region generally is rich in free atoms and provides the best location for measuring atomic absorption The hottest part of the flame is typically cm above the primary combustion zone As atoms approach the flames secondary combustion zone the decrease in temperature allows for formation of stable molecular species Figure Profile of typical flame using a slot burner The relative size of each zone depends on many factors including the choice of fuel and oxidant and their relative proportions Sample Introduction The most common means for introducing samples into a flame atomizer is a continuous aspiration in which the sample flows through the burner while we monitor the absorbance Continuous aspiration is sample intensive typically requiring from mL of sample Flame microsampling allows us to introduce a discrete sample of fixed volume and is useful when we have a limited amount of sample or when the samples matrix is incompatible with the flame atomizer For example continuously aspirating a sample that has a high concentration of dissolved solidssea water for example comes to mindmay buildup a solid deposit on the burner head that obstructs the flame and that lowers the absorbance Flame microsampling is accomplished using a micropipet to place μL of sample in a Teflon funnel connected to the nebulizer or by dipping the nebulizer tubing into the sample for a short time Dip sampling is usually accomplished with an automatic sampler The signal for flame microsampling is a transitory peak whose height or area is proportional to the amount of analyte that is injected Advantages and Disadvantages of Flame Atomization The principal advantage of flame atomization is the reproducibility with which the sample is introduced into the spectrophotometer A significant disadvantage to flame atomizers is that the efficiency of atomization may be quite poor There are two reasons for poor atomization efficiency First the majority of the aerosol droplets produced during nebulization are too large to be carried to the flame by the combustion gases Consequently as much as of the sample never reaches the flame A second reason for poor atomization efficiency is that the large volume of combustion gases significantly dilutes the sample Together these contributions to the efficiency of atomization reduce sensitivity because the analytes concentration in the flame may be a factor of less than that in solution This is the reason for the waste line shown at the bottom of the spray chamber in Figure Electrothermal Atomizers A significant improvement in sensitivity is achieved by using the resistive heating of a graphite tube in place of a flame A typical electrothermal atomizer also known as a graphite furnace consists of a cylindrical graphite tube approximately cm in length and mm in diameter As shown in Figure the graphite tube is housed in an sealed assembly that has optically transparent windows at each end A continuous stream of an inert gas is passed through the furnace protecting the graphite tube from oxidation and removing the gaseous products produced during atomization A power supply is used to pass a current through the graphite tube resulting in resistive heating Figure Diagram showing a crosssection of an electrothermal analyzer Samples of between μL are injected into the graphite tube through a small hole at the top of the tube Atomization is achieved in three stages In the first stage the sample is dried to a solid residue using a current that raises the temperature of the graphite tube to about oC In the second stage which is called ashing the temperature is increased to between oC At these temperatures any organic material in the sample is converted to CO and HO and volatile inorganic materials are vaporized These gases are removed by the inert gas flow In the final stage the sample is atomized by rapidly increasing the temperature to between oC The result is a transient absorbance peak whose height or area is proportional to the absolute amount of analyte injected into the graphite tube Together the three stages take approximately s with most of this time used for drying and ashing the sample Electrothermal atomization provides a significant improvement in sensitivity by trapping the gaseous analyte in the small volume within the graphite tube The analytes concentration in the resulting vapor phase may be as much as greater than in a flame atomization This improvement in sensitivityand the resulting improvement in detection limitsis offset by a significant decrease in precision Atomization efficiency is strongly influenced by the samples contact with the graphite tube which is difficult to control reproducibly Miscellaneous Atomization Methods A few elements may be atomized by a chemical reaction that produces a volatile product Elements such as As Se Sb Bi Ge Sn Te and Pb for example form volatile hydrides when reacted with NaBH in acid An inert gas carries the volatile hydrides to either a flame or to a heated quartz observation tube situated in the optical path Mercury is determined by the coldvapor method in which it is reduced to elemental mercury with SnCl The volatile Hg is carried by an inert gas to an unheated observation tube situated in the instruments optical path Quantitative Applications Atomic absorption is widely used for the analysis of trace metals in a variety of sample matrices Using Zn as an example atomic absorption methods have been developed for its determination in samples as diverse as water and wastewater air blood urine muscle tissue hair milk breakfast cereals shampoos alloys industrial plating baths gasoline oil sediments and rocks Developing a quantitative atomic absorption method requires several considerations including choosing a method of atomization selecting the wavelength and slit width preparing the sample for analysis minimizing spectral and chemical interferences and selecting a method of standardization Each of these topics is considered in this section Developing a Quantitative Method Flame or Electrothermal Atomization The most important factor in choosing a method of atomization is the analytes concentration Because of its greater sensitivity it takes less analyte to achieve a given absorbance when using electrothermal atomization Table which compares the amount of analyte needed to achieve an absorbance of when using flame atomization and electrothermal atomization is useful when selecting an atomization method For example flame atomization is the method of choice if our samples contain mg ZnL but electrothermal atomization is the best choice for samples containing μg ZnL

Varian Cookbook SpectraAA Software Version Pro b As mgL by hydride vaporization Hg mgL by coldvapor and Sn mgL by hydride vaporization Selecting the Wavelength and Slit Width The source for atomic absorption is a hollow cathode lamp consisting of a cathode and anode enclosed within a glass tube filled with a low pressure of Ne or Ar Figure Applying a potential across the electrodes ionizes the filler gas The positively charged gas ions collide with the negatively charged cathode sputtering atoms from the cathodes surface Some of the sputtered atoms are in the excited state and emit radiation characteristic of the metals from which the cathode was manufactured By fashioning the cathode from the metallic analyte a hollow cathode lamp provides emission lines that correspond to the analytes absorption spectrum Because atomic absorption lines are narrow we need to use a line source instead of a continuum source compare for example Figure with Figure The effective bandwidth when using a continuum source is roughly larger than an atomic absorption line thus PT P T and A Because a hollow cathode lamp is a line source PT and P have different values giving a T and A Figure Photo of a typical multielemental hollow cathode lamp The cathode in this lamp is fashioned from an alloy containing Co Cr Cu Fe Mn and Ni and is surrounded by a glass shield to isolate it from the anode The lamp is filled with Ne gas Also shown is the process leading to atomic emission See the text for an explanation Each element in a hollow cathode lamp provides several atomic emission lines that we can use for atomic absorption Usually the wavelength that provides the best sensitivity is the one we choose to use although a less sensitive wavelength may be more appropriate for a larger concentration of analyte For the Cr hollow cathode lamp in Table for example the best sensitivity is obtained using a wavelength of nm Another consideration is the intensity of the emission line If several emission lines meet our need for sensitivity we may wish to use the emission line with the largest relative P because there is less uncertainty in measuring P and PT When analyzing samples containing mg CrL for example the first three wavelengths in Table provide an appropriate sensitivity The wavelengths of nm and nm however have a greater P and will provide less uncertainty in the measured absorbance Table Atomic Emission Lines for a Cr Hollow Cathode Lamp wavelength nm slit width nm mg CrL giving A P relative The emission spectrum from a hollow cathode lamp includes besides emission lines for the analyte additional emission lines for impurities present in the metallic cathode and from the filler gas These additional lines are a source of stray radiation that leads to an instrumental deviation from Beers law The monochromators slit width is set as wide as possible improving the throughput of radiation while at the same time being narrow enough to eliminate the stray radiation Preparing the Sample Flame and electrothermal atomization require that the sample be in solution Solid samples are brought into solution by dissolving in an appropriate solvent If the sample is not soluble it may be digested either on a hotplate or by microwave using HNO HSO or HClO Alternatively we can extract the analyte using a Soxhlet extractor Liquid samples may be analyzed directly or extracted if the matrix is incompatible with the method of atomization A serum sample for instance is difficult to aspirate when using flame atomization and may produce an unacceptably high background absorbance when using electrothermal atomization A liquidliquid extraction using an organic solvent and a chelating agent is frequently used to concentrate analytes Dilute solutions of Cd Co Cu Fe Pb Ni and Zn for example can be concentrated by extracting with a solution of ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate in methyl isobutyl ketoneSee Chapter to review different methods for preparing samples for analysis Minimizing Spectral Interference A spectral interference occurs when an analytes absorption line overlaps with an interferents absorption line or band Because they are so narrow the overlap of two atomic absorption lines is seldom a problem On the other hand a molecules broad absorption band or the scattering of source radiation is a potentially serious spectral interference An important consideration when using a flame as an atomization source is its effect on the measured absorbance Among the products of combustion are molecular species that exhibit broad absorption bands and particulates that scatter radiation from the source If we fail to compensate for these spectral interference then the intensity of transmitted radiation decreases The result is an apparent increase in the samples absorbance Fortunately absorption and scattering of radiation by the flame are corrected by analyzing a blank Spectral interferences also occur when components of the samples matrix other than the analyte react to form molecular species such as oxides and hydroxides The resulting absorption and scattering constitutes the samples background and may present a significant problem particularly at wavelengths below nm where the scattering of radiation becomes more important If we know the composition of the samples matrix then we can prepare our samples using an identical matrix In this case the background absorption is the same for both the samples and standards Alternatively if the background is due to a known matrix component then we can add that component in excess to all samples and standards so that the contribution of the naturally occurring interferent is insignificant Finally many interferences due to the samples matrix can be eliminated by increasing the atomization temperature For example by switching to a higher temperature flame it may be possible to prevent the formation of interfering oxides and hydroxides If the identity of the matrix interference is unknown or if it is not possible to adjust the flame or furnace conditions to eliminate the interference then we must find another method to compensate for the background interference Several methods have been developed to compensate for matrix interferences and most atomic absorption spectrophotometers include one or more of these methods One of the most common methods for background correction is to use a continuum source such as a D lamp Because a D lamp is a continuum source absorbance of its radiation by the analytes narrow absorption line is negligible Only the background therefore absorbs radiation from the D lamp Both the analyte and the background on the other hand absorb the hollow cathodes radiation Subtracting the absorbance for the D lamp from that for the hollow cathode lamp gives a corrected absorbance that compensates for the background interference Although this method of background correction may be quite effective it does assume that the background absorbance is constant over the range of wavelengths passed by the monochromator If this is not true subtracting the two absorbances may underestimate or overestimate the background Other methods of background correction have been developed including Zeeman effect background correction and SmithHieftje background correction both of which are included in some commercially available atomic absorption spectrophotometers Consult the chapters additional resources for additional information Minimizing Chemical Interferences The quantitative analysis of some elements is complicated by chemical interferences occurring during atomization The two most common chemical interferences are the formation of nonvolatile compounds containing the analyte and ionization of the analyte One example of the formation of nonvolatile compounds is the effect of PO or Al on the flame atomic absorption analysis of Ca In one study for example adding ppm Al to a solution of ppm Ca decreased the calcium ions absorbance from to while adding ppm PO to a similar solution of Ca decreased the absorbance from to These interferences were attributed to the formation of nonvolatile particles of CaPO and an AlCaO oxide When using flame atomization we can minimize the formation of nonvolatile compounds by increasing the flames temperature either by changing the fueltooxidant ratio or by switching to a different combination of fuel and oxidant Another approach is to add a releasing agent or a protecting agent to the samples A releasing agent is a species that reacts with the interferent releasing the analyte during atomization Adding Sr or La to solutions of Ca for example minimizes the effect of PO and Al by reacting in place of the analyte Thus adding ppm SrCl to the CaPO and CaAl mixtures described in the previous paragraph increased the absorbance to A protecting agent reacts with the analyte to form a stable volatile complex Adding ww EDTA to the CaPO solution described in the previous paragraph increased the absorbance to Ionization interferences occur when thermal energy from the flame or the electrothermal atomizer is sufficient to ionize the analyte where M is the analyte Because the absorption spectra for M and M are different the position of the equilibrium in reaction affects absorbance at wavelengths where M absorbs To limit ionization we add a high concentration of an ionization suppressor which is simply a species that ionizes more easily than the analyte If the concentration of the ionization suppressor is sufficient then the increased concentration of electrons in the flame pushes reaction to the left preventing the analytes ionization Potassium and cesium are frequently used as an ionization suppressor because of their low ionization energy Standardizing the Method Because Beers law also applies to atomic absorption we might expect atomic absorption calibration curves to be linear In practice however most atomic absorption calibration curves are nonlinear or linear for only a limited range of concentrations Nonlinearity in atomic absorption is a consequence of instrumental limitations including stray radiation from the hollow cathode lamp and the variation in molar absorptivity across the absorption line Accurate quantitative work therefore often requires a suitable means for computing the calibration curve from a set of standards Most instruments include several different algorithms for computing the calibration curve The instrument in my lab for example includes five algorithms Three of the algorithms fit absorbance data using linear quadratic or cubic polynomial functions of the analytes concentration It also includes two algorithms that fit the concentrations of the standards to quadratic functions of the absorbance When possible a quantitative analysis is best conducted using external standards Unfortunately matrix interferences are a frequent problem particularly when using electrothermal atomization For this reason the method of standard additions is often used One limitation to this method of standardization however is the requirement that there be a linear relationship between absorbance and concentration The best way to appreciate the theoretical and practical details discussed in this section is to carefully examine a typical analytical method Although each method is unique the following description of the determination of Cu and Zn in biological tissues provides an instructive example of a typical procedure The description here is based on Bhattacharya S K Goodwin T G Crawford A J Anal Lett and Crawford A J Bhattacharya S K Varian Instruments at Work Number AA April Representative Method Determination of Cu and Zn in Tissue Samples Description of Method Copper and zinc are isolated from tissue samples by digesting the sample with HNO after first removing any fatty tissue The concentration of copper and zinc in the supernatant are determined by atomic absorption using an airacetylene flame Procedure Tissue samples are obtained by a muscle needle biopsy and dried for h at oC to remove all traces of moisture The fatty tissue in the dried samples is removed by extracting overnight with anhydrous ether After removing the ether the sample is dried to obtain the fatfree dry tissue weight FFDT The sample is digested at oC for h using mL of M HNO After centrifuging at rpm for minutes the supernatant is transferred to a mL volumetric flask The digestion is repeated two more times for hours each using mL aliquots of M HNO These supernatants are added to the mL volumetric flask which is diluted to volume with M HNO The concentrations of Cu and Zn in the diluted supernatant are determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy using an airacetylene flame and external standards Copper is analyzed at a wavelength of nm with a slit width of nm and zinc is analyzed at nm with a slit width of nm Background correction using a D lamp is necessary for zinc Results are reported as mg of Cu or Zn per gram of FFDT Questions Describe the appropriate matrix for the external standards and for the blank The matrix for the standards and the blank should match the matrix of the samples thus an appropriate matrix is M HNO Any interferences from other components of the sample matrix are minimized by background correction Why is a background correction necessary for the analysis of Zn but not for the analysis of Cu Background correction compensates for background absorption and scattering due to interferents in the sample Such interferences are most severe when using a wavelength less than nm This is the case for Zn but not for Cu A Cu hollow cathode lamp has several emission lines Explain why this method uses the line at nm wavelength nm slit width nm mg CuL for A P relative With mg CuL giving an absorbance of the emission line at nm has the best sensitivity In addition it is the most intense emission line which decreases the uncertainty in the measured absorbance Example To evaluate the method described in Representative Method a series of external standard is prepared and analyzed providing the results shown here μg CumL absorbance μg CumL absorbance A bovine liver standard reference material was used to evaluate the methods accuracy After drying and extracting the sample a mg FFDT tissue sample gives an absorbance of Report the amount of copper in the sample as μg Cug FFDT Solution Linear regression of absorbance versus the concentration of Cu in the standards gives a calibration curve with the following equation Substituting the samples absorbance into the calibration equation gives the concentration of copper as μgmL The concentration of copper in the tissue sample therefore is Evaluation of Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy Scale of Operation Atomic absorption spectroscopy is ideally suited for the analysis of trace and ultratrace analytes particularly when using electrothermal atomization For minor and major analyte sample can be diluted before the analysis Most analyses use a macro or a meso sample The small volume requirement for electrothermal atomization or flame microsampling however makes practical the analysis micro and ultramicro samples See Figure to review the meaning of macro and meso for describing samples and the meaning of major minor and ultratrace for describing analytes Accuracy If spectral and chemical interferences are minimized an accuracy of is routinely attainable When the calibration curve is nonlinear accuracy may be improved by using a pair of standards whose absorbances closely bracket the samples absorbance and assuming that the change in absorbance is linear over this limited concentration range Determinate errors for electrothermal atomization are often greater than that obtained with flame atomization due to more serious matrix interferences Precision For absorbance values greater than the relative standard deviation for atomic absorption is for flame atomization and for electrothermal atomization The principle limitation is the variation in the concentration of free analyte atoms resulting from variations in the rate of aspiration nebulization and atomization when using a flame atomizer and the consistency of injecting samples when using electrothermal atomization Sensitivity The sensitivity of a flame atomic absorption analysis is influenced strongly by the flames composition and by the position in the flame from which we monitor the absorbance Normally the sensitivity of an analysis is optimized by aspirating a standard solution of the analyte and adjusting operating conditions such as the fueltooxidant ratio the nebulizer flow rate and the height of the burner to give the greatest absorbance With electrothermal atomization sensitivity is influenced by the drying and ashing stages that precede atomization The temperature and time used for each stage must be optimized for each type of sample See Chapter for several strategies for optimizing experiments Sensitivity is also influenced by the samples matrix We have already noted for example that sensitivity can be decreased by chemical interferences An increase in sensitivity may be realized by adding a low molecular weight alcohol ester or ketone to the solution or by using an organic solvent Selectivity Due to the narrow width of absorption lines atomic absorption provides excellent selectivity Atomic absorption can be used for the analysis of over elements at concentrations at or below the level of μgL Time Cost and Equipment The analysis time when using flame atomization is short with sample throughputs of determinations per hour when using a fully automated system Electrothermal atomization requires substantially more time per analysis with maximum sample throughputs of determinations per hour The cost of a new instrument ranges from between for flame atomization and from for electrothermal atomization The more expensive instruments in each price range include doublebeam optics automatic samplers and can be programmed for multielemental analysis by allowing the wavelength and hollow cathode lamp to be changed automatically Contributors David Harvey DePauw University
