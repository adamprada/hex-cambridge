B Hard and Soft Metal Centers and Ligands Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Hard and Soft Acids and Bases Pearsons HSAB Hard and Soft Acids and Bases Pearsons HSAB This theory proposes that soft acids react faster and form stronger bonds with soft bases whereas hard acids react faster and form stronger bonds with hard bases all other factors being equal The classification in the original work was largely based on equilibrium constants for the reaction of two Lewis bases competing for a Lewis acid Hard acids and hard bases tend to have the following characteristics small atomicionic radius high oxidation state low polarizability high electronegativity bases Examples of hard acids are H light alkali ions Li through K are considered to have small ionic radii Ti Cr Cr BF Examples of hard bases are OH F Cl NH CHCOO CO The affinity of hard acids and hard bases for each other is mainly ionic in nature Soft acids and soft bases tend to have the following characteristics large atomicionic radius low or zero oxidation state bonding high polarizability low electronegativity Examples of soft acids are CHHg Pt Pd Ag Au Hg Hg Cd BH Examples of soft bases are H RP SCN I The affinity of soft acids and bases for each other is mainly covalent in nature HSAB acids and bases This provides a qualitative approach to looking at the reactions of metal ions with various ligands since from the diagram above it is expected that whereas AlIII and TiIII would prefer to react with Ospecies over Sspecies the reverse would be predicted for HgII
