B Oxidation States Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Rules for assigning oxidation numbers The oxidation number of a free element The oxidation number of a monatomic ion charge on the ion The oxidation number of hydrogen and rarely The oxidation number of oxygen and in peroxides The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion charge on the ion Elements in group and aluminum are always as indicated on the periodic table KCO The sum of all the oxidation numbers in this formula equal Multiply the subscript by the oxidation number for each element To calculate ON of C K O therefore C HSO To calculate ON of S The sum of all the oxidation numbers in this formula equal Multiply the subscript by the oxidation number for each element H O therefore S Calculate ON in following compounds Sb in SbO N in AlNO P in MgPO S in NHSO Cr in CrO Hg in HgClO B in NaBO Si in MgSiF I in IO N in NHS Mn in MnO Br in BrO Cl in ClO Cr in CrO Se in HSeO Reducing Agents and Oxidizing Agents Reducing agent the reactant that gives up electrons The reducing agent contains the element that is oxidized looses electrons If a substance gives up electrons easily it is said to be a strong reducing agent Oxidizing agent the reactant that gains electrons The oxidizing agent contains the element that is reduced gains electrons If a substance gains electrons easily it is said to be a strong oxidizing agent Example FeO cr COg Fel CO g Notice that the oxidation number of C goes from on the left to on the right The reducing agent is CO because it contains C which loses e Notice that the oxidation number of Fe goes from on the left to on the right The oxidizing agent is FeO because it contains the Fe which gains e Practice Problems In any Redox equation at least one particle will gain electrons and at least one particle will lose electrons This is indicated by a change in the particles oxidation number from one side of the equation to the other For each reaction below draw arrows and show electron numbers as in the example here The top arrow indicates the element that gains electrons reduction and the bottom arrow indicates the element that looses electrons oxidation An arrow shows what one atom of each of these elements gaines or looses Mg O MgO Cl I Cl I MnO CO Mn CO Cr NO CrO NO BrO MnO Br MnO Fe MnO Mn Fe Cr Sn Cr Sn NO S NO HSO IO II NO ClO NO Cl Balancing Redox Equations by the Halfreaction Method Decide what is reduced oxidizing agent and what is oxidized reducing agent Do this by drawing arrows as in the practice problems Write the reduction halfreaction The top arrow in step indicates the reduction halfreaction Show the electrons gained on the reactant side Balance with respect to atoms ions To balance oxygen add HO to the side with the least amount of oxygen THEN add H to the other side to balance hydrogen Write the oxidation halfreaction The bottom arrow in step indicates the oxidation halfreaction Show the electrons lost on the product side Balance with respect to atoms ions To balance oxygen add HO to the side with the least amount of oxygen THEN add H to the other side to balance hydrogen The number of electrons gained must equal the number of electrons lost Find the least common multiple of the electrons gained and lost In each halfreaction multiply the electron coefficient by a number to reach the common multiple Multiply all of the coefficients in the halfreaction by this same number Add the two halfreactions Write one equation with all the reactants from the halfreactions on the left and all the products on the right The order in which you write the particles in the combined equation does not matter Simplify the equation Cancel things that are found on both sides of the equation as you did in net ionic equations Rewrite the final balanced equation Check to see that electrons elements and total charge are balanced There should be no electrons in the equation at this time The number of each element should be the same on both sides It doesnt matter what the charge is as long as it is the same on both sides Practice Problems Identify the oxidizing agent and reducing agent in each equation HSO HI HS I HO CaC HO CH CaOH AuS H Au HS Zn HCl H ZnCl To make working with redox equations easier we will omit all physical state symbols However remember that they should be there An unbalanced redox equation looks like this MnO HSO H Mn HSO HO Study how this equation is balanced using the halfreaction method It is important that you understand what happens in each step Be prepared to ask questions about this process in class tomorrow
