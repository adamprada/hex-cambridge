B Structure Caesium Chloride CsCl Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionApplicationsReferencesContributors This page is going to discuss the structure of the molecule cesium chloride which is a white hydroscopic solid with a mass of gmol Cesium Chloride is a type of unit cell that is commonly mistaken as BodyCentered Cubic This misconception is easy to make since there is a center atom in the unit cell but CsCl is really a nonclosed packed structure type Introduction CsCl has a boiling point of degrees Celsius a melting point of degrees Celsius and is very soluble in water For the most part this molecule is stable but is not compatible with strong oxidizing agents and strong acids Although it is not hazardous one should not prolong their exposure to CsCl CsCl is an ionic compound that can be prepared by the reaction Figure Coordination Cubes Public Domain Solid State via Wikipedia CsCl crystallize in a primitive cubic lattice which means the cubic unit cell has nodes only at its corners The structure of CsCl can be seen as two interpenetrating cubes one of Cs and one of Cl The ions are not touching one another Touching would cause repulsion between the anion and cation Some may mistake the structure type of CsCl with NaCl but really the two are different CsCl is more stable than NaCl for it produces a more stable crystal and more energy is released Figure Unit Cell of CsCl httpenwikipediaorgwikiCaesium_chloride Anions and cations have similar sizes Each Cs is surrounded by Cl at the corners of its cube and each Cl is also surrounded by Cs at the corners of its cube The cations are located at the center of the anions cube and the anions are located at the center of the cations cube There is one atom in CsCl To determine this the following equation is given Corners of a given atom x of the given atoms unit cell atom Applications Cesium chloride is used in centrifugation a process that uses the centrifugal force to separate mixtures based on their molecular density It is also used in the preparation of electrically conducting glasses Radioactive CsCl is used in some types of radiation therapy for cancer patients although it is blamed for some deaths References Carter C Barry and M Grant Norton Binary Compounds Ceramic Materials Science and Engineering New York NY Springer pg Quéré Yves Stable Structure of Halides Physics of Materials Amsterdam Gordon and Breach Science Contributors Ana Popovich
