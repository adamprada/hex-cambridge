B The Zeeman Electronic Effect Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Quantum EffectsContributors and Attributions Magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles This property is demonstrated on a macroscopic scale by making an electromagnet from a coil of wire and a battery Electrons moving through the coil produce a magnetic field Figure which can be thought of as originating from a magnetic dipole or a bar magnet Figure Faradays apparatus for demonstrating that a magnetic field can produce a current A change in the field produced by the top coil induces an emf and hence a current in the bottom coil When the switch is opened and closed the galvanometer registers currents in opposite directions No current flows through the galvanometer when the switch remains closed or open CC BY OpenStax Magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles Electrons in atoms also are moving charges with angular momentum so they too produce a magnetic dipole which is why some materials are magnetic A magnetic dipole interacts with an applied magnetic field and the energy of this interaction is given by the scalar product of the magnetic dipole moment and the magnetic field Magnets are acted on by forces and torques when placed within an external applied magnetic field Figure In a uniform external field a magnet experiences no net force but a net torque The torque tries to align the magnetic moment of the magnet with the external field The magnetic moment of a magnet points from its south pole to its north pole Figure A magnet will feel a force to realign in an external field ie go from a higher energy to a lower energy The energy of this system is determined by Equation ref and classical can vary since the angle between and can vary continuously from low energy to high energy In a nonuniform magnetic field a current loop and therefore a magnet experiences a net force which tries to pull an aligned dipole into regions where the magnitude of the magnetic field is larger and push an antialigned dipole into regions where magnitude the magnetic field is smaller Quantum Effects As expected the quantum picture is different Pieter Zeeman was one of the first to observe the splittings of spectral lines in a magnetic field caused by this interaction Consequently such splittings are known as the Zeeman effect Lets now use our current knowledge to predict what the Zeeman effect for the p to s transition in hydrogen would look like and then compare this prediction with a more complete theory To understand the Zeeman effect which uses a magnetic field to remove the degeneracy of different angular momentum states we need to examine how an electron in a hydrogen atom interacts with an external magnetic field Since magnetism results from the circular motion of charged particles we should look for a relationship between the angular momentum and the magnetic dipole moment The relationship between the magnetic dipole moment also referred to simply as the magnetic moment and the angular momentum of a particle with mass m and charge is given by For an electron this equation becomes where the specific charge and mass of the electron have been substituted for and The magnetic moment for the electron is a vector pointing in the direction opposite to both of which classically are perpendicular to the plane of the rotational motion Exercise Will an electron in the ground state of hydrogen have a magnetic moment Why or why not The relationship between the angular momentum of a particle and its magnetic moment is commonly expressed as a ratio called the gyromagnetic ratio Gyro is Greek for turn so gyromagnetic simply relates turning angular momentum to magnetism Now you also know why the Greek sandwiches made with meat cut from a spit turning over a fire are called gyros In the specific case of an electron Exercise Calculate the magnitude of the gyromagnetic ratio for an electron To determine the energy of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field we need to include the operator form of the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian The Hamiltonian always consists of all the energy terms that are relevant to the problem at hand where is the Hamiltonian operator in the absence of the field and is written using the operator forms of Equations and The scalar product simplifies if the zaxis is defined as the direction of the external field because then and are automatically and Equation ref becomes where is the magnitude of the magnetic field which is along the zaxis We now can ask What is the effect of a magnetic field on the energy of the hydrogen atom orbitals To answer this question we will not solve the Schrödinger equation again we simply calculate the expectation value of the energy using the existing hydrogen atom wavefunctions and the new Hamiltonian operator where and Exercise Show that the expectation value The expectation value approach provides an exact result in this case because the hydrogen atom wavefunctions are eigenfunctions of both and If the wavefunctions were not eigenfunctions of the operator associated with the magnetic field then this approach would provide a firstorder estimate of the energy First and higher order estimates of the energy are part of a general approach to developing approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation This approach called perturbation theory is discussed in the next chapter The expectation value calculated for the total energy in this case is the sum of the energy in the absence of the field plus the Zeeman energy The factor defines the constant called the Bohr magneton which is taken to be the fundamental magnetic moment It has units of ergGauss or JouleTesla This factor will help you to relate magnetic fields measured in Gauss or Tesla to energies measured in ergs or Joules for any particle with a charge and mass the same as an electron Equation ref shows that the quantum number degeneracy of the hydrogen atom is removed by the magnetic field For example the three states and which are degenerate in zero field have different energies in a magnetic field as shown in Figure Figure The Zeeman effect Emission when an electron switches from a p orbital to a s orbital occurs at only one energy in the absence of a magnetic field but can occur at three different energies in the presence of a magnetic field The state for which the component of angular momentum and hence also the magnetic moment in the external field direction is zero experiences no interaction with the magnetic field The state for which the angular momentum in the zdirection is ħ and the magnetic moment is in the opposite direction against the field experiences a raising of energy in the presence of a field Maintaining the magnetic dipole against the external field direction is like holding a small bar magnet with its poles aligned exactly opposite to the poles of a large magnet Figure It is a higher energy situation than when the magnetic moments are aligned with each other Figure The effect of an external magnetic field on the energy of a magnetic dipole oriented a with and b against the applied magnetic field Exercise Carry out the steps going from Equation to Equation Exercise Consider the effect of changing the magnetic field on the magnitude of the Zeeman splitting Sketch a diagram where the magnetic field strength is on the xaxis and the energy of the three p orbitals is on the yaxis to show the trend in splitting magnitudes with increasing magnetic field Be quantitative calculate and plot the exact numerical values using a software package of your choice Exercise Based on your calculations in Exercise sketch a luminescence spectrum for the hydrogen atom in the n level in a
