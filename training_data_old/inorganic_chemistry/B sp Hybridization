geometrical shape and the inherent physicalchemical properties seen in molecules can be attributed to atomic and molecular orbitals Features of molecular structure can be explained by taking into consideration how orbitals interact within a single atom to form hybrid atomic orbitals and how atomic orbitals between different atoms interact giving rise to molecular orbitals This module will serve as a reminder of the fundamental concepts of bonding as they relate to molecular structure as well as an investigation into the complexities of hybridized atomic orbitals The Localized Electron Bonding ModelThe Heisenberg Uncertainty PrincipleOrbitals and HybridizationReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors The Localized Electron Bonding Model What is a chemical bond The most elementary way to understand the bonding between two or more atoms is to make use of Lewis dot structures a structure drawn where each valence electron surrounding an atom is symbolized by a dot and each bonding electron is symbolized by a pair of dots or a dash Wade p In accordance with the observations of G N Lewis atoms having or sharing valence electrons will tend to be in an arrangement of lowest energy ACS p A more sophisticated approach to understanding bonding is to consider how atomic orbitals within individual atoms interact with one another forming molecular orbitals and subsequent covalent bonding A complete understanding of the subject involves knowledge of quantum mechanics wave functions and molecular symmetry This module will focus on how atomic orbitals on an individual atom can give rise to hybrid atomic orbitals which define the geometry of the bond and how hybrid atomic atoms of different atoms come together to form molecular orbitals which define the geometry of the molecule Why do chemical bonds form The stability of a covalent bond the bond formed when atomic orbitals of separate atoms interact to form molecular orbitals results from there being a large amount of electron density in the region of space between the two nuclei Wade p This region is known as the bonding region and here the electrons are close to both nuclei subsequently lowering the overall energy The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle rationalizes the inability of chemists and physicists alike to simultaneously determine both the position and momentum of an atomic particle in space In lieu of this theoretical chemists had to develop methods of calculating the position of an electron in terms of probabilities rather than assigning electrons fixed location about a nucleus Barret p These calculations are collectively known as quantum mechanics with the Schrodinger wave equation ĤΨ iħ ddtΨ being the quantum mechanic calculation of greatest interest to orbital symmetry Solving the Schrodinger wave equation gives the shapes of atomic orbitals represented graphically as the probability of finding an electron residing in a region of space about an atom Orbitals and Hybridization Valence Bond theory describes the formation of a chemical bond in terms of overlapping between atomic orbitals The s orbital of hydrogen for example can overlap inphase and combine constructively to form a molecular orbital called a sigma bond Furthermore a s orbital is analogous to the fundamental vibration of a guitar string The wave function is seemingly positive and negative simultaneously The effect of squaring the wave function gives the distribution of electron density which can be used to graphically represent the spherical symmetry of an s orbital Atomic orbitals can interact to form new molecular orbitals but let us first consider that orbitals within an individual atom can interact amongst themselves giving rise to hybridized atomic orbitals Yielding a sp hybrid orbital with an electron density predominately concentrated toward one side of the atom Molecular orbital theory dictates that the number of hybrid orbitals produced must equal the sum of the orbitals that underwent hybridization and be it that we started with one s orbital and one p orbital for a total of two orbitals we must finish with a total of two hybrid sp orbitals The final result of this hybridization is a pair of directional sp hybrid orbitals pointed in opposite directions providing enough electron density in the bonding regions to provoke a sigma bond to both the left and the right of the atom These sp hybrid orbitals generate a bond angle of creating a bond formation with linear geometry Lastly the degree of orbital hybridization is governed by the number of attachments ligands found on a central atom lone pairs of electrons included Table provides a summary of orbital hybridization wherein the number of ligands attached to a central molecule correlates to the molecules geometry Table Summary of hybridization of attachments Hybridization Geometry angles sp Linear sp Trigonal planar sp Tetrahedral spd Trigonal bipyramidal and spd Octahedral sp Hybridization As discussed molecular orbitals form as a result of constructive destructive wave overlap of atomic orbitals between different atoms as well as the potential for atomic orbitals contained within an atom can combine amongst themselves giving rise to hybrid atomic orbitals It becomes prudent then to consider the spatial orientation of atomic orbitals during the interaction of orbitals on different atoms in the formation of chemical bonds The chemical bonding of compounds with triple bonds such as alkynes can be expounded by sp hybridization Inspection of the electron configuration of carbon reveals that the electrons in the s orbital mix with only one of the three available p orbitals This results in two hybrid sp orbitals and two unaltered p orbitals CH for instance is held together then by the overlap of adjacentapproaching spsp hybrid orbitals on each carbon atom The bond that ultimately forms is a sigma bond complemented by additional pi bonds formed by pp orbital overlap triple bonds are actually composed of two different types of bonds sigma and pi Each carbon also bonds to a hydrogen by means of a sigma bond formed this time by ssp
