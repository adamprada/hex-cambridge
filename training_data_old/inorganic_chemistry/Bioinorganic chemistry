essential elements although their roles in living organisms are not clear Bioinorganic chemistry the study of the functions of metals in biological systems using the knowledge and methods of inorganic chemistry has progressed remarkably in recent years The following list shows typical bioactive substances containing metals Electron carriers Fe cytochrome ironsulfur protein Cu blue copper protein Metal storage compound Fe ferritin transferrin Zn metallothionein Oxygen transportation agent Fe hemoglobin myoglobin Cu hemocyanin Photosynthesis Mg chlorophyll Hydrolase Zn carboxypeptidase Mg aminopeptidase Oxidoreductase Fe oxygenase hydrogenase Fe Mo nitrogenase Isomerase Fe aconitase Co vitamin B coenzyme The basis of chemical reactions of metalloenzymes are Coordinative activation coordination form electronic donating steric effect Redox metal oxidation state Information communication and in many cases reaction environments are regulated by biopolymers such as proteins and selective reactions are performed Examples of actions of metals other than by metalloenzymes include Mg MgATP energy transfer NaK ion pumping Ca transfer of hormone functions muscle contraction nerve transfer blood coagulation are some of the important roles of metals a Oxidation Oxidation reactions in living systems are fundamental to life and many studies of these systems have been performed In particular the mechanisms of oxygen gas transportation by hemoglobin and monooxygen oxidation by the iron porphyrin compounds named P have been studied at length Oxygen gas transportation which has been studied for many years is described below Iron porphyrins hemoglobin and myoglobin and the copper compound hemocyanin are involved in the transportation of oxygen gas in air to cells in living organisms The basis of this function is reversible bonding and dissociation of dioxygen to iron or copper ions In order to perform these functions metals must be in oxidation states and coordination environments suitable for the reversible coordination of dioxygen The iron porphyrin compound hemoglobin is found in red bloods of human beings and other animals Hemoglobin has the structure of heme iron with four iron porphyrin units combined with a globin protein Dioxygen is transported in blood by being coordinated to ferrous ions in the hem iron unit The Fe II ion is pentacoordinate with four nitrogen atoms of porphyrin and a nitrogen atom of the polypeptide histidine and becomes hexacoordinate when a dioxygen coordinates to it The spin state of Fe II changes from high spin to low spin upon the coordination of dioxygen The high spin FeII is above the plane of porphyrin because it is too large to fit in the available space When the FeII ion becomes low spin upon dioxygen coordination the size of the iron ion decreases and it just fits into the hole of the porphyrin molecule This molecularlevel movement has attracted interest as an allosteric effect because it affects the whole protein through the histidine coordinate bond and governs the specific bond of a dioxygen molecule Oxidation of the FeII ion of a hem molecule is prevented by a macromolecular protein and if the hem iron is taken out of the prote in FeII ion is oxidized to FeIII and two porphyrin rings are bridged by a peroxide O which finally changes to a bridging Ostructure When the hem is in this state it loses the ability to coordinate to the dioxygen molecule Based on this phenomenon a synthetic porphyrin that is able reversibly to coordinate to a dioxygen by suppressing dimerization of the iron porphyrin has been developed and was named the picket fence porphyrin after its three dimensional form b Nitrogen fixation The reaction which converts the nitrogen in air into ammonia is basic to all life Nitrogen fixation the reaction to fix atmospheric nitrogen to form ammonia is carried out by Rhizobium in the roots of legumes or by bacteria in algae in an anaerobic atmosphere All animals and plants including mankind were depended on biological nitrogen fixation as a source of nitrogen for protein and other compounds containing nitrogen before the invention of the HarberBosch process An enzyme named nitrogenase catalyzes this reaction Nitrogenase contains ironsulfur and ironmolybdenum sulfur proteins and reduces dinitrogen by coordination and cooperative proton and electron transfers while using MgATP as an energy source Because of the importance of this reaction attempts to clarify the structure of nitrogenase and to develop artificial catalysts for nitrogen fixation have continued for many years Recently the structure of an active center in nitrogenase called ironmolybdenum cofactor was clarified by single crystal Xray analysis Figure According to this analysis its structure has FeMoS and FeS clusters connected through S Figure Structure of FeMo cofactor in nitrogenase It is believed that dinitrogen is activated by coordination between the two clusters On the other hand the portion called P cluster consists of two FeS clusters The roles and reaction mechanism of both parts are not yet clear c Photosynthesis The formation of glucose and dioxygen by the reaction of carbon dioxide and water is a skillful reaction using photoenergy and in which chlorophyll Figure which is a magnesium porphyrin and a manganese cluster complex plays the central role A chloroplast contains photosystem I PSI and photosystem II PSII which use light energy to reduce carbon dioxide and to oxidize water Chlorophyll is a fundamental component of PSI Chlorophyll is a porphyrin complex of magnesium and is responsible for the green colors of leaves It plays an important role in receiving light energy and transferring it to redox reaction systems Chlorophyll is excited from the singlet ground state to the singlet excited state by light the energy of the excited state is transferred to an acceptor within ps and the resultant energy reduces an ironsulfur complex and is finally used for reduction of carbon dioxide in subsequent dark reactions Since charge separation by photochemical excitation is the most important first stage studies on photoinduced electron transfer are have been actively performed using various kinds of porphyrin compounds as models of chlorophylls PSI which obtains oxidizing energy by electron transfer converts ADP to ATP Figure Chlorophyll a On the other hand the oxidized form of PSII oxidizes water through a chain of redox reactions of oxo cluster complexes of manganese and generates oxygen Since four electrons shift in the reduction of MnIV to Mn II in this reaction at least two manganese species are involved Probably a cluster complex which contains two MnII and two MnIV species mediates the electron transfer via four step reactions However the details of this reaction are as yet unclear because it is very difficult to isolate this cluster and to analyze its structure The electron transfer stage is being studied at present by using various manganese complexes as model systems Photosynthesis is a very interesting research theme in bioinorganic chemistry as it involves a few metal ions a porphyrin sulfide and oxide clusters that constitute a cycle of subtle electron transfer and redox reactions and generate oxygen gas by photolysis of water and produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide by reductive dark reactions Recently the reaction center of a photosynthetic bacteria was crystallized and J Deisenhofer and his colleagues won a Nobel prize for its structural analysis Exercise Give
