Block classification of the periodic table and elements Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Starting from hydrogen over elements are constituted as electrons are successively accommodated into s s p s p s and d orbitals one by one from lower to higher energy levels When elements with similar properties are arranged in columns the periodic table of the elements is constructed The modern periodic table of the elements is based on one published by D I Mendeleev in and a variety of tables have since been devised The long periodic table recommended by IUPAC is the current standard and it has the group numbers arranged from Group alkali metals through Group rare gas elements Table Based on the composition of electron orbitals hydrogen helium and Group elements are classified as sblock elements Group through Group elements pblock elements Group through Group elements dblock elements and lanthanoid and actinoid elements fblock elements Figure sBlock pblock and Group elements are called main group elements and dblock elements other than Group and fblock elements are called transition elements The characteristic properties of the elements that belong to these four blocks are described in Chapter and thereafter Incidentally periodic tables that denote the groups of sblock and pblock elements with Roman numerals I II VIII are still used but they will be unified into the IUPAC system in the near future Since inorganic chemistry covers the chemistry of all the elements it is important to understand the features of each element through reference to the periodic table Figure Block classification of elements in the periodic table
