Bond Polarity and Bond Strength Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Linus Pauling introduced the concept of electronegativity in order to explain the extra stability of molecules with polar bonds The electronegativity of an atom represented by the Greek letter χ can be defined as the tendency of an atom to draw electrons to itself in a chemical bond On the Pauling scale the electronegativity difference between two atoms A and B was defined in terms of the dissociation energies Ed of the AA BB and AB bonds where the energies are expressed in electron volts Figure A water molecule a commonly used example of polarity The two charges are present with a negative charge in the middle red and a positive charge at the ends blue This definition while directly relevant to the strength of chemical bonds requires thermochemical input data from many compounds some of which were not available at the time Mulliken and later Pearson developed a scale of electronegativities based on the average of the electron affinity and ionization energy of the free A and B atoms which they correlated with thermochemical data and the Pauling scale On the Pauling scale the least electronegative elements are the alkali metals χ and the most electronegative are oxygen and fluorine at the upper right of the periodic table Carbon and hydrogen have intermediate electronegativities and on the Pauling scale respectively The general trend see table below is that electronegativities increase going up and to the right in the periodic table There are some interesting exceptions to this behavior most notably two islands of high electronegatvity at the bottom of the transition series peaking at tungsten χ and gold χ The first of these can be explained by the very high metalmetal bond energy of elements such as Mo and W which can use all six of their valence electrons in bonding as we will discuss in Chapter The second however occurs with more weakly bonded noble metals such as Pt and Au and is responsible for their low position in the activity series as well as their extraordinary properties as catalysts Table of Pauling electronegativities The polarity of bonds is determined by electronegativity differences As a guideline we define bonds as ionic if Δχ polar if Δχ nonpolar if Δχ The polarity of bonds helps us understand noncovalent forces between molecules such as hydrogen bonding and dipoledipole interactions It also helps us interpret the reactivity of molecules For example the SiH bond χSi χH is more hydridelike than the CH bond χC χH Therefore silanes react with acids to make H whereas phosphines χP and hydrocarbons do not Similarly electrophilic substitution reactions occur more readily on SiH and PH compounds than they do on CH compounds There is also a correlation between the strength of a chemical bond and the bond length longer bonds being weaker because of weaker orbital overlap Pauling introduced an empirical formula relating bond length to bond strength For a given pair of atoms for example two carbon atoms where Dn represents the bond length in Å and n is the bond order D in this case would be the length of a CC single bond which we can obtain from the average bond length in alkanes Å Using this formula we can predict that the bond lengths in ethylene CC double bond and acetylene CC triple bond should be and Å respectively which are close to the experimental values of and Å In a related form the Pauling formula can be used to calculate bond lengths when the single bond length D is not available Here n and m represent two different bond orders between the same kinds of atoms This tells for example that the difference in length between a triple and double bond DD should be log Å Some bond lengths and bond energies are anomalous For example the FF bond length in F is Å which is Å longer than twice the covalent radius of the F atom Å The FF bond is also quite weak bond dissociation energy kJmol relative to the ClCl bond kJmol By putting the extra bond length into the Pauling formula we calculate that the bond order in the F molecule is only ie substantially weaker than a FF single bond The physical reason for this is that the FF bond is stretched by repulsion of the lone pairs on the F atoms This crowding is caused by the fact that the He s core orbital as well as the valence orbitals of the fluorine atoms are contracted by the high nuclear charge The Cl atom with its larger Ne ssp core in contrast has a normal single bond length Å that is twice the covalent radius of the Cl atom Å A similar lone pair repulsion effect explains the anomalously long and weak NN and OO single bonds in hydrazine HNNH and hydrogen peroxide HOOH which are both highly reactive molecules Trends in covalent radii for pblock elements The covalent radius of F has been difficult to determine because of electron pair repulsion effects Early reports Shomaker and Stevenson Pauling overestimated the size of the F atomAccurate quantum chemical calculations place the F singlebond covalent radius at about Å The important roles of electronegativity differences and lone pair repulsion are evident when comparing trends in bond strengths The table below shows the average singlebond enthalpies of pblock elements with H and F H makes stronger bonds with nd row elements C N O F than with third row elements Si P S Cl because the p valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and thus make stronger bonds than electrons in p orbitals The bonds to H also follow the expected trend of increasing bond strength with increasing electronegativity difference Bonds between second row elements C N O F and F are however anomalously weak because of lone pair repulsion For this reason the SiF bond is substantially stronger than the CF bond whereas the CH bond is much stronger than the SiH bond The strong SiF bond is the reason that HF etches glass to produce the SiF anion and the strong CH bond is an important factor in the stability of hydrocarbons and other organic molecules Average EH and EF bond enthalpies kJmol CH NH OH HF SiH PH SH HCl CF NF OF FF SiF PF SF ClF The anomalously weak bond in F is responsible for the high electronegativity of fluorine as well as the legendary reactivity of elemental fluorine gas which reacts explosively with hydrogen and powdered metals Because of the instability of elemental fluorine and the polar nature of its bonds with more electropositive elements fluorine compounds tend to be very stable For example the noble gases Xe and Kr react with fluorine to make covalent compounds whereas other halogens do not react Fluorocarbon compounds contain strong CF bonds and have high thermal and chemical stability Perfluorocarbons such as Teflon polytetrafluoroethylene CFCFn PTFE are also highly hydrophobic The extraordinary hydrophobicity of perfluorocarbons arises from the fact that CF and CF groups are fatter than CH and CH groups dissolving them in water is therefore more disruptive to the hydrogen bonding network than is dissolving a hydrocarbon Fabric treated with fluorosurfactant
