Bonding in Metals and Semicondoctors Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers A Electrical Conductivity and ResistivityElectrical resistivity and conductivity is an important property for materials Different materials have different conductivity and resistivity Electrical conductivity is based on electrical transport properties These can be measured with multiple techniques by using a variety of instruments If electricity easily flows through a material that material has high conductivity Some materials that have high conductivity include copper and aluminumB Band Theory of Metals and InsulatorsBand Theory was developed with some help from the knowledge gained during the quantum revolution in science In Felix Bloch had the idea to take the quantum theory and apply it to solids In Walter Heitler and Fritz London discovered bands very closely spaced orbitals with not much difference in energyC The Fermi LevelD Band Theory of Semiconductors
