Bonding states of elements Last updated Save as PDF Page ID ElementMolecular compoundsSolidstate compoundsSuperheavy elements Organic compounds are molecular compounds that contain mainly carbon and hydrogen atoms Since inorganic chemistry deals with all compounds other than organic ones the scope of inorganic chemistry is vast Consequently we have to study the syntheses structures bondings reactions and physical properties of elements molecular compounds and solidstate compounds of elements In recent years the structures of crystalline compounds have been determined comparatively easily by use of single crystal Xray structural analysis and by through the use of automatic diffractometers This progress has resulted in rapid development of new areas of inorganic chemistry that were previously inaccessible Research on higher dimensional compounds such as multinuclear complexes cluster compounds and solidstate inorganic compounds in which many metal atoms and ligands are bonded in a complex manner is becoming much easier In this section research areas in inorganic chemistry will be surveyed on the basis of the classification of the bonding modes of inorganic materials Element Elementary substances exist in various forms For example helium and other rare gas elements exist as singleatom molecules hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen as twoatom molecules carbon phosphorus and sulfur as several solid allotropes and sodium gold etc as bulk metals A simple substance of a metallic element is usually called bulk metal and the word metal may be used to mean a bulk metal and metal atom or metal ion define the state where every particle is discrete Although elementary substances appear simple because they consist of only one kind of element they are rarely produced in pure forms in nature Even after the discovery of new elements their isolation often presents difficulties For example since the manufacture of ultra high purity silicon is becoming very important in science a purification processes have been developed in recent years Exercise Give examples of allotropes Answer Carbon graphite diamond Phosphorus white phosphorus red phosphorus Molecular compounds Inorganic compounds of nonmetallic elements such as gaseous carbon dioxide CO liquid sulfuric acid HSO or solid phosphorus pentoxide PO satisfy the valence requirements of the component atoms and form discrete molecules which are not bonded together The compounds of main group metals such as liquid tin tetrachloride SnCl and solid aluminum trichloride AlCl have definite molecular weights and do not form infinite polymers Most of the molecular compounds of transition metals are metal complexes and organometallic compounds in which ligands are coordinated to metals These molecular compounds include not only mononuclear complexes with a metal center but also multinuclear complexes containing several metals or cluster complexes having metalmetal bonds The number of new compounds with a variety of bonding and structure types is increasing very rapidly and they represent a major field of study in today inorganic chemistry see Chapter Solidstate compounds Although solidstate inorganic compounds are huge molecules it is preferable to define them as being composed of an infinite sequence of dimensional chain dimensional layer or dimensional arrays of elements and as having no definite molecular weight The component elements of an inorganic solid bond together by means of ionic covalent or metallic bonds to form a solid structure An ionic bond is one between electronically positive alkali metals etc and negative elements halogen etc and a covalent bond forms between elements with close electronegativities However in many compounds there is contribution from both ionic and covalent bonds see Section about bondings Exercise Give examples of solidstate inorganic compounds Answer Sodium chloride NaCl Silicon dioxide SiO Molybdenum disulfide MoS The first step in the identification of a compound is to know its elemental composition Unlike an organic compound it is sometimes difficult to decide the empirical formula of a solidstate inorganic compound from elemental analyses and to determine its structure by combining information from spectra Compounds with similar compositions may have different coordination numbers around a central element and different structural dimensions For example in the case of binary consisting of two kinds of elements metal iodides gold iodide AuI has a chainlike structure copper iodide CuI a zinc blende type structure sodium iodide NaI has a sodium chloride structure and cesium iodide CsI has a cesium chloride structure refer to Section e and the metal atoms are bonded to or iodine atoms respectively The minimum repeat unit of a solid structure is called a unit lattice and is the most fundamental information in the structural chemistry of crystals Xray and neutron diffraction are the most powerful experimental methods for determining a crystal structure and the bonds between atoms can only be elucidated by using them Polymorphism is the phenomenon in which different kinds of crystals of a solidstate compound are obtained in which the atomic arrangements are not the same Changes between different polymorphous phases with variations in temperature andor pressure or phase transitions are an interesting and important problem in solidstate chemistry or physics We should keep in mind that in solidstate inorganic chemistry the elemental composition of a compound are not necessarily integers There are extensive groups of compounds called nonstoichiometric compounds in which the ratios of elements are nonintegers and these nonstoichiometric compounds characteristically display conductivity magnetism catalytic nature color and other unique solidstate properties Therefore even if an inorganic compound exhibits nonintegral stoichiometry unlike an organic compound the compound may be a thermodynamically stable orthodox compound This kind of compound is called a nonstoichiometric compound or Berthollide compound whereas a stoichiometric compound is referred to as a Daltonide compound The law of constant composition has enjoyed so much success that there is a tendency to neglect nonstoichiometric compounds We should point out that groups of compounds in which there are slight and continuous changes of the composition of elements are not rare Problem Express the isotopes of hydrogen carbon and oxygen using the symbols of the elements with atomic and mass numbers and write the number of protons neutrons and electrons in parenthesis Superheavy elements The last element in the ordinary periodic table is an actinoid element lawrencium Lr Z However elements Z have already been synthesized in heavy ion reactions using nuclear accelerators These are d elements which come under the d transition elements from hafnium Hf to iridium Ir and it is likely that their electronic structures and chemical properties are similar As a matter of fact only the existence of nuclides with very short lives has been confirmed The trouble of naming the super heavy elements is that the countries of their discoverers the United States Russia and Germany have proposed different names The tentative names of these elements are unnilquadium Une Z unnilpentium Unp Z unnilhexium Unh Z unnilseptium Unq Z unniloctium Uno Z and unnilennium Une Z It has recently been settled that they be named Rutherfordium Rf Dubnium Db Seaborgium Sg Bohrium Bh Hassium Hs and Meitnerium Mt Synthesis of the element Z which should come under platinum was considered the technical limit but there is a recent report that even the element Z was synthesized In any case the superheavy elements will run out shortly It is natural that complications are caused by naming of a new element a scientist to have a new element named after him or her
