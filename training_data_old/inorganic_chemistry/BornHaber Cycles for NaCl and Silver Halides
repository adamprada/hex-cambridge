BornHaber Cycles for NaCl and Silver Halides Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Silver Halides Now that we have an equation for the lattice energy of an ionic crystal we can ask the question of how accurate it is Remember we made several approximations in arriving at this formula We assumed that the lattice was completely ionic we ignored the van der Waals attractive energy of the ions and we assumed that there was no covalent contribution to the bonding Lets consider the lattice energy of table salt NaCl To calculate the lattice energy we lump together the physical constants where ro is expressed in Å Now we can calculate the lattice energy for NaCl using ro Å as We can alternatively construct a BornHaber cycle for the formation of NaCl from the elements and calculate the lattice energy as the missing term in the cycle S Sublimation energy of Nas IP Ionization potential of Nag D Bond dissocation energy of Clg EA Electron affinity of Clg ELLattice energy of NaCl R Gas constant T Absolute temperature From Hess Law Here we have to subtract RT to convert our cycle of energies to a cycle of enthalpies because we are compressing two moles of gas in making NaCls and PΔV ΔnRT where Δn Experimentally ΔHf for NaCl is kJmol Because all the other numbers in the cycle are known accurately the error in our calculation is only about kJ about of EL The result is promising because we neglected the van der Waals term Buthow did we get away with neglecting the van der Waals term This is because we used energy minimization to obtain the repulsion energy in the BornMayer equation If we underestimate the attractive energy of the crystal lattice the energy minimization criterion ensures that the repulsion energy is underestimated as well The two errors partially compensate so the overall error in the calculation is small We can do better by explicitly including the shortrange van der Waals attractive energy between ions The table below shows results of more detailed lattice energy calculations for ionic fluorides in which the van der Waals term is explicitly included The errors in this case are only about of EL Compound Calculated Lattice Energy kJmol Experimental EL from BornHaber Cycle MgF rutile structure CaF fluorite structure BaF fluorite structure Silver Halides It is interesting to repeat this exercise for the silver halides which have either the NaCl structure AgF AgCl AgBr or zincblende structure AgI Silver Halide Calculated Cycle Difference kJmol AgF AgCl AgBr AgI Looking at the table we see that the error is small for AgF and becomes progressively larger for the heavier silver halides However we are still obtaining answers within about error even for AgI Should we interpret the good agreement with values calculated from the ionic model to mean that these compounds are ionic Clearly this description is inappropriate for AgI where the electronegativity difference Δχ is only compare this value to for a CH bond which we typically view as nonpolar A drop of siver nitrate solution when added to a dilute hydrochloric acid solution results in the immediate formation of a white silver chloride precipitate This reaction is used as a qualitative test for the presence of halide ions in solutions The covalent bonding contribution to the lattice energies of AgCl AgBr and AgI makes these salts sparingly soluble in water Again we can interpret the fortuitous agreement between the calculated and experimentally obtained energies in terms of compensating errors Our lattice energy calculation overestimates the ionic contribution in the case of the heavier silver halides but underestimates the covalent contribution Of these compounds only AgF is soluble in water and should be thought of as an ionic compound The others are progressively more insoluble in water Ksp is and for AgCl AgBr and AgI reflecting increasing covalency as Δχ decreases The moral of the story is that simple lattice energy calculations based on the ionic model work well but they do not necessarily imply that the compounds are ionic
