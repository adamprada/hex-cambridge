Building up the MOs of More Complex Molecules NH₃ P₄ Last updated Save as PDF Page ID MO diagram for NHP molecule and P ion MO diagram for NH We can now attempt the MO diagram for NH building on the result we obtained with triangular H Notes on the MO diagram for ammonia Viewed endon a porbital or an spx hybrid orbital looks just like an sorbital Hence we can use the solutions we developed with sorbitals for H to set up the σ bonding and antibonding combinations of nitrogen sp orbitals with the H s orbitals We now construct the sp hybrid orbitals of the nitrogen atom and orient them so that one is up and the other three form the triangular base of the tetrahedron The latter three by analogy to the H ion transform as one totally symmetric orbital a and an esymmetry pair The hybrid orbital at the top of the tetrahedron also has a symmetry The three hydrogen s orbitals also make one a and one doubly degenerate e combination We make bonding and antibonding combinations with the nitrogen orbitals of the same symmetry The remaining a orbital on N is nonbonding The dotted lines show the correlation between the basis orbitals of a and e symmetry and the molecular orbitals The result in the electron NH molecule is three NH bonds and one lone pair localized on N the same as the valence bond picture but much more work P molecule and P ion By analogy to NH we can construct the MO picture for one vertex of the P tetrahedron and then multiply the result by to get the bonding picture for the molecule An important difference is that there is relatively little sp hybridization in P so the lone pair orbitals have more scharacter and are lower in energy than the bonding orbitals which are primarily pσ Take away electrons to make P Highest occupied MO is a bonding orbital break one bond bonds left Square form relieves ring strain
