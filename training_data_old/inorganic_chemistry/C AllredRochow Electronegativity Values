Electronegativity is a measure that determines the values of the electrostatic force exerted by the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons The value of the effective nuclear charges is estimated from Slaters rules The higher charge the more likely it will attract electrons Although Slaters rule are partly empirical So the AllredRochow electronegativity is no more rigid than the Pauling Electronegativity Electronegativity Pauling established Electronegativity as the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electron to itself It is a measure of the atoms ability to attract electron to itself while the electron is still attached to another atom The higher the values the more likely that atom can pull electron from another atom and into itself Electronegativity correlates with bond polarity ionization energy electron affinity effective nuclear charge and atomic size Table Pauling Electronegativity Values H Li Be B C N O F Na Mg Al Si P S Cl K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni

and decreases as it go down the group The exception are Hydrogen and the noble gases because the noble gases are content with their filled outermost shells and hydrogen cannot bear to lose a valence electron unlike the rest of the group metals The elements in the halogen group usually have the highest electronegativity values because they only need to attract one valence electron to complete the octet in their outer shell Whereas the group elements except for Hydrogen are willing to give up their only valence electron so they can fulfill having a complete filled outer shell Slaters rules Slaters rules are rules that provides the values for the effective nuclear charge concept or These rules are based on experimental data for electron promotion and ionization energies and is determined from this equation Where is the nuclear charge is the effective nuclear charge and is the shielding constant Through this equation this tells us that electron may get reduced nuclear charge due to high shielding Allred and Rochow used because it is accurate due to the involvement of shielding that prevents electron to reach its true nuclear charge When an atom with filled sshell attracts electrons those electrons will go to the unfilled porbital Since the electrons have the same negative charge they will not only repel each other but also repel the electrons from the filled sshell This creates a shielding effect where the inner core electrons will shield the outer core electrons from the nucleus Not only would the outer core electrons experience effective nuclear charge but it will make them easily removed from the outer shell Thus It is easier for outer electrons to penetrate the p shell which has little likelihood of being near the nuclear rather than the s shell Consider this each of the outer electron in the ns np group contributes S S in the n shell and S in the n or lower shells Example Slaters Rules Lets consider this example of finding the for s electrons in Ca Since Ca has atomic number of Z Then we find the electron configuration for Ca which is sspsps Now we got that we can use Slaters rules So Ca has a of AllredRochow Electronegativity Allred and Rochow were two chemists who came up with the AllredRochow Electronegativity values by taking the electrostatic force exerted by effective nuclear charge Zeff on the valence electron To do so they came up with an equation At the time the values for the covalent radius were inaccurate Allred and Rochow added certain perimeters so that it would more closely correspond to Paulings electronegativity scale

Os Ir Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Po At In this table the electronegativities increases from left to right just like Paulings scale because the is increasing As we go down the group it decreases because of the larger atomic size that increases the distance between the electrons and nucleus References Gary Wulfsberg Inorganic Chemistry University Science Books February Housecroft Catherine E and Alan G
