C Reactions in Liquid NHâ‚ƒ Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions Comparison of the physical properties of with those of water shows has the lower melting point boiling point density viscosity dielectric constant and electrical conductivity this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in and because such bonding cannot form crosslinked networks since each molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each HO molecule Solvolysis synthesis of amides Metatheses reactions solubility reversals Sodamide as a base ce Na NH NaNH Hg useful reagent
