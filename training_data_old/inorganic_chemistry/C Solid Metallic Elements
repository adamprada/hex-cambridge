Greek μέταλλον métallon mine quarry metal is a material an element compound or alloy that is typically hard opaque shiny and has good electrical and thermal conductivity Metals are generally malleable that is they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible able to be fused or melted and ductile able to be drawn out into a thin wire About of the elements in the periodic table are metals some elements appear in both metallic and nonmetallic forms Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity While this flow of electrons occurs the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud This type of bond is called a metallic bond Cubic and hexagonal close packing Crystalline solids consist of repeating patterns of its components in three dimensions a crystal lattice and can be represented by drawing the structure of the smallest identical units that when stacked together form the crystal This basic repeating unit is called a unit cell Many metals adopt close packed structures ie cubic close packed face centred cubic and hexagonal close packed structures A simple model for both of these is to assume that the metal atoms are spherical and are packed together in the most efficient way close packing or closest packing For closest packing every atom has equidistant nearest neighbours and therefore a coordination number of If the close packed structures are considered as being built of layers of spheres then the difference between hexagonal close packing and cubic close packed is how each layer is positioned relative to others It can be envisaged that for a regular buildup of layers hexagonal close packing has alternate layers positioned directly abovebelow each other ABAB cubic close packed face centered cubic has every third layer directly abovebelow each other ABCABC Body centred cubic This is not a close packed structure Here each metal atom is at the centre of a cube with nearest neighbors however the atoms at the centres of the adjacent cubes are only approximately further away so the coordination number can therefore be considered to be when these are included Note that if the body centered cubic unit cell is compressed along one fold axis the structure becomes cubic close packed face centred cubic Cubic Hexagonal and Bodycentred Packing

a simple measure of the stability or strength of the metallic lattice Some simple trends can be noted The transition metals have generally higher melting points than the others In the alkali metals Group and alkaline earth metals Group the melting point decreases as atomic number increases but in transition metal groups with incomplete dorbital subshells the heavier elements have higher melting points For a given period the melting points reach a maximum at around Group and then fall with increasing atomic number Mercury caesium and gallium have melting points below C whereas all the other metals have sufficiently high melting points to be solids at room temperature The structures of the metals can be summarised by the table below which shows that most metals crystallise in roughly

configuration results in their characteristic properties The alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting wellcharacterized homologous behaviour The alkali metals have very similar properties they are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen Because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free element In the modern IUPAC nomenclature the alkali metals comprise the group elements excluding hydrogen H which is only nominally considered a group element Group Alkali Earth Metals extended structures of Li Mg Ca Lithium bcc Magnesium hcp
