C Vibrational Spectroscopy of Linear and Bent triatomic Molecules Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionLinear molecules Bent MoleculesReferencesContributors Vibrational spectroscopy AKA Infrared IR Spectroscopy is a highly useful and beneficial tool for determining structures and functional groups contained in compounds Although used for many different structure types of polyatomic molecules this particular Module is dedicated to triatomic molecules with bent and linear spacial molecular geometry Introduction Triatomic molecules are molecules that contain three atoms The atoms in triatomic molecules can all be the same as in I all be different as in HCN or can be a mix like CO Examples include HO which is a bent and has a bond angle of o and a linear triatomic molecule such as CO All bent triatomic molecules belong to the point group Cv while all the liner triatomic molecules with an inversion center belong to the Dinfinityh point group Those without an inversion center belong to the point group Cinfinityv This gives these two structures very different infrared spectrum even though they have the same number of atoms Linear molecules Using VESPR theory there are several ways to achieve a linear structure Triatomic molecules where the central atom is using ALL of its electrons in the bonds with the surrounding molecules or in other words the central atom does not have any lone pairs surrounding it will give rise to a linear molecule Examples include and This electronic configuration gives the central atom a sp hybridization Triatomic molecules where the central atom does not use all of its electron pairs in the bonds between the other two atoms will under certain circumstances also give rise to a linear species When the central atom is surrounded by three or four lone pairs in addition to the two elements already attached will also give rise to a linear molecule Examples include Bent Molecules There are also several ways to give rise to bent molecules using VESPR theory A triatomic molecule with one or two lone pair on the central atom will also give rise to bent species One lone pair examples include SO and two lone pair examples include HO References Volhardt and Schore Organic Chemistry Structure and Function th edition Bruice Paula and Yukanis organic chemistry th edition Contributors David Phinney UC Davis
