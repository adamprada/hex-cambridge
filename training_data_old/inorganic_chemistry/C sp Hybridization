C sp Hybridization Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionSP hybridized moleculesReferencesProblemsContributors The sp hybridization is the mixing of one s and two p atomic orbitals which involves the promotion of one electron in the s orbital to one of the p atomic orbitals The combination of these atomic orbitals creates three new hybrid orbitals equal in energylevel The hybrid orbitals are higher in energy than the s orbital but lower in energy than the p orbitals but they are closer in energy to the p orbitals The new set of formed hybrid orbitals creates trigonal structures creating a molecular geometry of degrees Introduction The combinaiton of an s orbital and two p orbitals from the same valence shell gives a set of three equivalent sp hybridized orbitals that point in directions separated by degrees The directions of these new hybridized orbitals are the dictators of the spatial arrangement for bonding the SP hybridized orbitals are the same in size energy shape but different in the spatial orientation This unique orientation is very important and is what characterized an SP hybridized orbital from other hybridized orbitals SP hybridized molecules References K Peter C Vollhardt Neil E shore Organic Chemistry Structure and Function Fifth edition WH Freeman and company New York Catherine E Housecroft Alan G Sharpe Inorganic Chemistry rd Ed Pearson Education Limited Brown W H Foote C S Iverson B L Anslyn E V Organic Chemistry th Ed BrooksCole Cengage Learning Zumdahl Steven S Zumdahl Susan A Chemistry fifth Edition Houghton Mifflin Company Boston Problems What is a sp hybridized atomic orbital What is the molecular geometry of an SP hybridized atom An sp hybridized atomic orbital is the mixing of S orbital and P orbitals a sp hybridized atom has sigma bonds so its molecular geometry is trigonal with degree bond angles What is the importance of correctly identifying the hybridization of atoms with trigonal structures It tells you the bond angle If they are sp they would have degree bond angles sp would have degree bond angles What is the hybridization of a benzene ring Benzene has a sp hybridization What is the hybridization of the carbon atom in the following structures a ketone baldehydes c carboxylic acids d alcohols e esters f ethers They all have sp hybridization Write the hybridization of an amide for the Carbon atom and for the neighbor Nitrogen atom Both atoms have sp hybridization Contributors Abel Silva Michael Dai Yicong
