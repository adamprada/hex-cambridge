Chalcogens and Chalcogenides Last updated Save as PDF Page ID a Simple substancesb Polyatomic chalcogen cations and anionsc Metal sulfidesChevrel phase compounds a Simple substances Sulfur selenium and tellurium are called chalcogens Simple substances and compounds of oxygen and of the elements of this group in the later periods have considerably different properties As a result of having much smaller electronegativities than oxygen they show decreased ionicity and increased bond covalency resulting in a smaller degree of hydrogen bonding Because they have available d orbitals chalcogens have increased flexibility of valence and can easily bond to more than two other atoms Catenation is the bonding between the same chalcogen atoms and both simple substances and ions of chalcogens take a variety of structures The major isotopes of sulfur are S abundance S S and S and there are also six radioactive isotopes Among these S I can be used for NMR Since the isotope ratio of sulfurs from different locations differs the accuracy of the atomic weight is limited to Because the electronegativity of sulfur is much smaller than that of oxygen and sulfur is a soft element the ionicity in the bonds of sulfur compounds is low and hydrogen bonding is not important Elemental sulfur has many allotropes such as S S S S S S S S S S S and S reflecting the catenation ability of sulfur atoms Elemental sulfur is usually a yellow solid with a melting point of C called orthorhombic sulfur sulfur Phasetransition of this polymorph produces monoclinic sulfur sulfur at C It was established in that these are crownlike cyclic molecules Figure Being molecular they dissolve well in organic solvents such as CS Not only membered rings but also S rings are known and the helix polymer of sulfur is an infinitely annular sulfur Diatomic molecular S and triatomic molecular S exist in the gaseous phase When sulfur is heated it liquifies and becomes a rubberlike macromolecule on cooling The diversity of structures of catenated sulfur is also seen in the structures of the polysulfur cations or anions resulting from the redox reactions of the catenated species Figure Structures of S S and S Selenium is believed to have six isotopes Se is the most abundant and Se with nuclear spin I is useful in NMR The accuracy of atomic weight of selenium is limited to two decimal places because of composition change of its isotopes Among many allotropes of selenium socalled red selenium is an Se molecule with a crownlike structure and is soluble in CS Gray metallic selenium is a polymer with a helical structure Black selenium which is a complicated polymer is also abundant Tellurium also has eight stable isotopes and an atomic weight of Te and Te are the most abundant isotopes and Te and Te with I can be used in NMR There is only one crystalline form of tellurium which is a spiral chain polymer that shows electric conductivity b Polyatomic chalcogen cations and anions Although it has long been recognized that solutions of chalcogen elements in sulfuric acid showed beautiful blue red and yellow colors the polycationic species that give rise to these colors S S S S S S or those of other chalcogen atoms have been isolated by the reaction with AsF etc and their structures determined For example unlike neutral S S takes a cyclic structure that has a weak coupling interaction between two transannular sulfur atoms Figure On the other hand alkali metal salts NaS KS and alkaline earth metal salt BaS a transitionmetal salt MoS a complex CpWS etc of polysulfide anions Sx x in which the sulfur atoms are bonded mutually have been synthesized and their structures determined As is evident from the fact that elemental sulfur itself forms S molecules sulfur unlike oxygen tends to catenate Therefore formation of polysulfide ions in which many sulfur atoms are bonded is feasible and a series of polysulfanes HSx x has actually been synthesized c Metal sulfides Stratified disulfides MS are important in transition metal sulfides They show two types of structures One has a metal in a triangular prismatic coordination environment and the other has a metal in an octahedral coordination environment MoS is the most stable black compound among the molybdenum sulfides L Pauling determined the structure of MoS in The structure is constructed by laminating two sulfur layers between which a molybdenum layer is intercalated Figure Alternatively two sulfur layers are stacked and a molybdenum layer is inserted between them Therefore the coordination environment of each molybdenum is a triangular prism of sulfur atoms Since there is no bonding interaction between sulfur layers they can easily slide resulting in graphitelike lubricity MoS is used as a solid lubricant added to gasoline and also as a catalyst for hydrogenation reactions Figure Structure of MoS ZrS TaS etc take the CdItype structure containing metal atoms in an octahedral coordination environment constructed by sulfur atoms Chevrel phase compounds There are superconducting compounds called Chevrel phases which are important examples of the chalcogenide compounds of molybdenum he general formula is described by MxMoX M Pb Sn and Cu X S Se and Te and six molybdenum atoms form a regular octahedral cluster and eight chalcogenide atoms cap the eight triangular faces of the cluster The cluster units are connected dimensionally Figure Since the cluster structure of molybdenum atoms is similar to that of molybdenum dichloride MoCl MoClClCl the structural chemistry of these compounds has attracted as much attention as their physical properties Figure Structure of SnMoS
