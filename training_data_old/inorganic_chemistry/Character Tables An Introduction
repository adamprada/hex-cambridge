Character Tables An Introduction Last updated Save as PDF Page ID DefinitionUnderstanding Character Tables Although the method of assigning a point group to a molecule depends on some knowledge of the symmetry elements the molecule has it does not require the consideration of all elements For example the molecule can be assigned the point group using the scheme in section by merely knowing that the molecule is linear and that it has the a center io inversion The point group assignment in this case did not require knowing that the molecule also has for example This type of knowledge is gained by examining character tables Definition A character table is a table that contains the symmetry information of the molecule This information can be used to analyze the molecules behavior in many application among which is spectroscopy Each point group has its own character table The following table is the character table of the point group Table The character table of the point group Understanding Character Tables Symbols under the first column of the character tables A Mulliken Symbol singly degenerate or one dimensional symmetric with respect to rotation of the principle axis B Mulliken Symbol singly degenerate or one dimensional antisymmetric with respect to rotation of the principle axis E Mulliken Symbol doubly degenerate or two dimensional T Mulliken Symbol thirdly degenerate or three dimensional Subscript symmetric with respect to the Cnprinciple axis if no perpendicular axis then it is with respect to σv Subscript antisymmetric with respect to the Cnprinciple axis if no perpendicular axis then it is with respect to σv Subscript g symmetric with respect to the inverse subscript u antisymmetric with respect to the inverse prime symmetric with respect to σhσh reflection in horizontal plane double prime antisymmetric with respect to σhσh opposite reflection in horizontal plane Symbols in the first row of the character tables E describes the degeneracy of the row A and B E T Cn pin number of turns in one circle on the main axis without changing the look of a molecule rotation of the molecule Cn πn number of turns in one circle perpendicular to the main axis without changing the structure of the molecule Cn πn number of turns in one circle perpendicular to the Cn and the main axis without changing the structure σ reflection of the molecule perpendicular to the other sigma σv vertical reflection of the molecule vertically compared to the horizontal highest fold axis σh or d horizontal reflection of the molecule horizontally compared to the horizontal highest fold axis i Inversion of the molecule from the center Sn rotation of πn and then reflected in a plane perpendicular to rotation axis Cn the stands for the number of irreducible representation for the Cn σ the stands for the number irreducible representations for the sigmas the number in superscript in the same rotation there is another rotation for instance Oh has CC other useful definitions RxRy the means they are the same and can be counted once xy z without means they are different and can be counted twice
