bondsSummary of molecular orbital theory so far Molecular orbital theory involves solving approximately the Schrödinger equation for the electrons in a molecule To review from Chapter this is a differential equation in which the first and second terms on the right represent the kinetic and potential energies While the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically for the hydrogen atom the potential energy function V becomes more complicated and the equation can then only be solved numerically when there are many mutually repulsive electrons in a molecule So as a first approximation we will assume that the s p d f etc orbitals of the atoms that make up the molecule are good solutions to the Schrödinger equation We can then allow these wavefunctions to interfere constructively and destructively as we bring the atoms together to make bonds In this way we use the atomic orbitals AO as our basis for constructing MOs LCAOMO linear combination of atomic orbitals In physics this is called this the tight binding approximation We have actually seen linear combinations of atomic orbitals before when we constructed hybrid orbitals in Chapter The basic rules we developed for hybridization also apply here orbitals are added with scalar coefficients c in such a way that the resulting orbitals are orthogonal and normalized The difference is that in the MO case the atomic orbitals come from different atoms The linear combination of atomic orbitals always gives back the same number of molecular orbitals So if we start with two atomic orbitals eg an s and a pz orbital as shown in Fig we end up with two molecular orbitals When atomic orbitals add in phase we get constructive interference and a lower energy orbital When they add out of phase we get a node and the resulting orbital has higher energy The lower energy MOs are bonding and higher energy MOs are antibonding Figure Sigma bonding and antibonding combinations of an s and p orbital Molecular orbitals are also called wavefunctions ψ because they are solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the molecule The atomic orbitals also called basis functions are labeled as φs for example φs and φpz or simply as φand φ In principle we need to solve the Schrödinger equation for all the orbitals in a molecule and then fill them up with pairs of electrons as we do for the orbitals in atoms In practice we are really interested only in the MOs that derive from the valence orbitals of the constituent atoms because these are the orbitals that are involved in bonding We are especially interested in the frontier orbitals ie the highest occupied molecular orbital the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital the LUMO Filled orbitals that are much lower in energy ie core orbitals do not contribute to bonding and empty orbitals at higher energy likewise do not contribute Those orbitals are however important in photochemistry and spectroscopy which involve electronic transitions from occupied to empty orbitals The fluorescent dyes that stain the cells shown in Fig absorb light by promoting electrons in the HOMO to empty MOs and give off light when the electrons drop back down to their original energy levels Figure Different components of endothelial cells are stained by blue green and red fluorescent dyes For each dye the color of emitted light corresponds to the energy given off when an electron drops from the LUMO to the HOMO of the molecule As an example of the LCAOMO approach we can construct two MOs ψ and ψ of the HCl molecule from two AOs φand φ Fig To make these two linear combinations we write and The coefficients c and c will be equal or nearly so when the two AOs from which they are constructed are the same eg when two hydrogen s orbitals combine to make bonding and antibonding MOs in H They will be unequal when there is an energy difference between the AOs for example when a hydrogen s orbital and a chlorine p orbital combine to make a polar HCl bond Nodes The wavefunctions φ and ψ are amplitudes that are related to the probability of finding the electron at some point in space They have lobes with or signs which we indicate by shading or color Wherever the wavefunction changes sign we have a node As you can see in Fig nodes in MOs result from destructive interference of and wavefunctions Generally the more nodes the higher the energy of the orbital In the example above we have drawn a simplified picture of the Cl pz orbital and the resulting MOs leaving out the radial node Recall that p orbitals have no radial nodes p orbitals have one as illustrated in Fig p orbitals have two radial nodes and so on The MOs we make by combining the AOs have these nodes too Figure Nodal structure of p and p orbitals Normalization We square the wave functions to get probabilities which are always positve or zero So if an electron is in orbital φ the probability of finding it at point xyz is the square of φxyz The total probability does not change when we combine AOs to make MOs so for the simple case of combining φ and φ to make ψand ψ Overlap integral The spatial overlap between two atomic orbitals φ and φ is described by the overlap integral S where the integration is over all space Figure The wavefunctions of atomic orbitals decrease exponentially with distance Orbital overlap is nonzero when two atoms are close together as illustrated for s orbitals in the upper figure The lower figure shows orbitals that are too far away to interact In this case both S and β are close to zero Energies of bonding and antibonding MOs The energies of bonding and antibonding orbitals depend strongly on the distance between atoms This is illustrated in Fig for the hydrogen molecule H At very long distances there is essentially no difference in energy between the inphase and outofphase combinations of H s orbitals As they get closer the inphase bonding combination drops in energy because electrons are shared between the two positively charged nuclei The energy reaches a minimum at the equilibrium bond distance Å and then rises again as the nuclei get closer together The antibonding combination has a node between the nuclei so its energy rises continuously as the atoms are brought together Figure Energy as a function of distance for the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the H molecule At the equilibrium bond distance the energies of the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals ψ ψ are lower and higher respectively than the energies of the atomic basis orbitals φ and φ This is shown in Fig for the MOs of the H molecule Figure Molecular orbital energy diagram for the H molecule The energy of an electron in one of the atomic orbitals is α the Coulomb integral where H is the Hamiltonian operator Essentially α represents the ionization energy of an electron in atomic orbital φ or φ The energy difference between an electron in the AOs and the MOs is determined by the exchange integral β β is an important quantity because it tells us about the bonding energy of the molecule and also the difference in energy between bonding and antibonding orbitals Calculating β is not straightforward for multielectron molecules because we cannot solve the Schrödinger equation analytically for the wavefunctions We can however make some approximations to calculate the energies and wavefunctions numerically In the Hückel approximation which can be used to obtain approximate solutions for π molecular orbitals in organic molecules we simplify the math by taking S and setting H for any porbitals that are not adjacent to each other The extended Hückel method developed by Roald Hoffmann and other semiempirical methods can be used to rapidly obtain relative orbital energies approximate wavefunctions and degeneracies of molecular orbitals for a wide variety of molecules and extended solids More sophisticated ab initio methods are now readily available in software packages and can be used to compute accurate orbital energies for molecules and solids We can get the coefficients c and c for the hydrogen molecule by applying the normalization criterion and In the case where S we can eliminate the S terms and both coefficients become Note that the bonding orbital in the MO diagram of H is stabilized by an energy βS and the antibonding orbital is destabilized by βS That is the antibonding orbital goes up in energy more than the bonding orbital goes down This means that H ψψ is energetically more stable than two H atoms but He with four electrons ψψ is unstable relative to two He atoms Bond order In any MO diagram the bond order can be calculated as ½ of bonding electrons of antibonding electrons For H the bond order is and for Hethe bond order is zero Heteronuclear case eg HCl Polar bonds Here we introduce an electronegativity difference between the two atoms making the chemical bond The energy of an electron in the H s orbital is higher it is easier to ionize than the electron in the chlorine pz orbital This results in a larger energy difference between the resulting molecular orbitals ψ and ψ as shown in Fig The bigger the electronegativity difference between atomic orbitals the larger Δα is the more φ character the bonding orbital has ie the more it resembles the Cl pz orbital in this case This is consistent with the idea that HCl has a polar single bond the two electrons reside in a bonding molecular orbital that is primarily localized on the Cl atom Figure Molecular orbital energy diagram for the HCl molecule The antibonding orbital empty has more Hcharacter The bond order is again because there are two electrons in the bonding orbital and none in the antibonding orbital Extreme case Ionic bonding NaF very large Δα In this case there is not much mixing between the AOs because their energies are far apart Fig The two bonding electrons are localized on the F atom so we can write the molecule as NaF Note that if we were to excite an electron from ψ to ψ using light the resulting electronic configuration would be ψψ and we would have NaF This is called a charge transfer transition Figure Molecular orbital energy diagram illustrating ionic bonding in the NaF molecule Summary of molecular orbital theory so far Add and subtract AO wavefunctions to make MOs Two AOs two MOs More generally the total number of MOs equals the number of AO basis orbitals We showed the simplest case only two basis orbitals More accurate calculations use a much larger basis set more AOs and solve for the matrix of cs that gives the lowest total energy using mathematically friendly approximations of the potential energy function that is part of the Hamiltonian operator H More nodes higher energy MO Bond order ½ of bonding electrons of antibonding electrons Bond polarity emerges in the MO picture as orbital character AOs that are far apart in energy do not interact much when they combine to make MOs
