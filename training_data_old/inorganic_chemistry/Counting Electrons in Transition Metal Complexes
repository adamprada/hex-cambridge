Counting Electrons in Transition Metal Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The dorbitals are the frontier orbitals the HOMO and LUMO of transition metal complexes Many of the important properties of complexes their shape color magnetism and reactivity depend on the electron occupancy of the metals dorbitals To understand and rationalize these properties it is important to know how to count the delectrons Because transition metals are generally less electronegative than the atoms on the ligands C N O Cl P that form the metalligand bond our convention is to assign both electrons in the bond to the ligand For example in the ferricyanide complex FeCN if the cyanide ligand keeps both of its electrons it is formulated as CN By difference iron must be Fe because the charges must add up to the overall charge on the complex The next step is to determine how many delectrons the Fe ion has The rule is to count all of irons valence electrons as delectrons Iron is in group so group charge d or d Structure of the octahedral ferricyanide anion Because the overall charge of the complex is Fe is in the oxidation state and its electron count is d The same procedure can be applied to any transition metal complex For example consider the complex CuNH Because ammonia is a neutral ligand Cu is in the oxidation state Copper II in group of the periodic table has electrons in its valence shell minus two leaving it with delectrons d In the neutral complex RhOHHO Rh is in the oxidation state and is in group so the electron count is d ZincII in group would have delectrons in ZnNH a full shell and manganese VII has zero delectrons in MnO Nickel carbonyl NiCO contains the neutral CO ligand and Ni in the zero oxidation state Since Ni is in group we count the electrons on Ni as d A frequent source of confusion about electron counting is the fate of the selectrons on the metal For example our electron counting rules predict that Ti is d in the octahedral complex TiHO But the electronic configuration of a free Ti atom according to the Aufbau principle is sd Why is the Ti ion d and not s Similarly why do we assign Mn as d rather than sd The short answer is that the metal s orbitals are higher in energy in a metal complex than they are in the free atom because they have antibonding character We will justify this statement with a MO diagram in Section Covalent Bond Classification CBC Method Although the electron counting rule we have developed above is useful and works reliably for all kinds of complexes the assignment of all the shared electrons in the complex to the ligands does not always represent the true bonding picture This picture would be most accurate in the case of ligands that are much more electronegative than the metal But in fact there all all kinds of ligands including those such as H alkyl cyclopentadienide and others where the metal and ligand have comparable electronegativity In those cases especially with late transition metals that are relatively electropositive we should regard the metalligand bond as covalent The CBC method also referred to as LXZ notation was introduced in by M L H Green in order to better describe the different kinds of metalligand bonds The molecular orbital pictures below summarize the difference between L X and Z ligands Of these L and X are the most common types Ltype ligands are Lewis bases that donate two electrons to the metal center regardless of the electron counting method being used These electrons can come from lone pairs pi or sigma donors The bonds formed between these ligands and the metal are dative covalent bonds which are also known as coordinate bonds Examples of this type of ligand include CO PR NH HO carbenes CRR and alkenes Xtype ligands are those that donate one electron to the metal and accept one electron from the metal when using the neutral ligand method of electron counting or donate two electrons to the metal when using the donor pair method of electron counting Regardless of whether it is considered neutral or anionic these ligands yield normal covalent bonds A few examples of this type of ligand are H CH halogens and NO bent Ztype ligands are those that accept two electrons from the metal center as opposed to the donation occurring with the other two types of ligands However these ligands also form dative covalent bonds like the Ltype This type of ligand is not usually used because in certain situations it can be written in terms of L and X For example if a Z ligand is accompanied by an L type it can be written as X Examples of these ligands are Lewis acids such as BR Cp Ferrocene Some multidentate ligands can act as a combination of ligand types A famous example is the cyclopentadienyl or Cp ligand CH We would classify this neutral ligand as LX with the two L functionalities corresponding to the two olefinic fragments while the X functionality corresponds to the CH radical carbon in the ring The addition of one electron makes the Cp anion which has six pi electrons and is thus planar and aromatic In the ferrocene complex CpFe using the standard donor pair counting method we can regard the two Cp ligands as each possessing six pi electrons and by difference Fe is in the oxidation state The Fe ion is d Thus the iron atom in the complex regardless of the counting method has electrons in its coordination environment which is a particularly stable electron count for transition metal complexes
