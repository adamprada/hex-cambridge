D A Bent Triatomic Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Molecular StructurePhysical and Chemical PropertiesReferencesOutside LinksProblems Water is a triatomic species with one oxygen atom for every two hydrogen atoms per molecule Through a combination of polarized bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms and a bent molecular geometry that gives the molecule an overall dipole moment water posesses several unique chemical and physical properties that are unlike any other species of its size Molecular Structure The classic model for the water molecule HO is a central oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms on either side Unlike other triatomic species that have a linear shape the bonds on a water molecule are tilted at a slight angle due to the presence of lonepair electrons on the oxygen atom Through VSEPR theory it is shown that HO has a steric number of with two lone pairs and two bond pairs making its molecular geometry bent As a result the angle between the two oxygenhydrogen bonds are approximately which is slightly smaller than the angle typically found in tetrahadralshaped molecules see above image This is due to the particularly strong repulsions by the lonepair electrons on the oxygen atom which pushes the hydrogens closer together than usual Each of the oxygenhydrogen bonds measure approximately pm in length This bent geometry due to the presence of lone pair electrons makes water different from typical linear triatomic species both on an atomic and a macroscopic level Physical and Chemical Properties Through its combination of bent geometry and polarized bonds HO has unique physical properties that are uncharacteristic of most other small molecules As a result of oxygen being more eletronegative than hydrogen the oxygenhydrogen bonds have an unequal sharing of electrons with a majority of the negative charge going to the oxygen atom and leaving the positive chage to the hydrogens With the bent structure of HO this creates a dipole on the overall molecule with the oxygen end being negatively charged and the hydrogen end being positively charged As a polar molecule with hydrogen atoms HO can undergo hydrogen bonding with neighboring HO atoms in which the oxygen atoms are weakly bonded to hydrogen atoms from other molecules due to the differences in electrical charge see image above This intermolecular attraction makes water a relatively stable substance and gives it physical properties such as a relatively high boiling point C and melting point C Compare this to other molecules of this size but are nonpolar such as methane CH with a boiling point of C and melting point of C References Housecroft Catherine E Sharpe Alan G Inorganic Chemisty rd ed United Kingdom Pearson Education Limited Petrucci Ralph H Harwood William S Herring Geoffrey F Madura Jeffry D General Chemistry Principles Modern Applications th ed New Jersey Pearson Education Inc Outside Links httpenwikipediaorgwikiWater httpenwikipediaorgwikiWater_model Problems Would you expect BeH to also be a bent triatomic molecule No because Be lacks the presence of lone pair electrons which would give the molecule a linear geometry What makes water highly unusual in its solid phase compared to its liquid phase Unlike most substances wherein the solid state is denser than the liquid state water is less dense in the solid state meaning its volume expands when freezing Would you expect ethanol to mix with water Why or why not Yes because both substances are polar the two liquids are miscible and will mix to form a single homogeneous solution
