D MO Applied to and Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions Molecular orbitals MO are constructed from atomic orbitals In O and F there is a crossover of the sigma and the pi ortbials the relative energies of the sigma orbitals drop below that of the pi orbitals Information from the MO diagram justify Os stability and show that its bonding order is The LUMO lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and HOMO highest occupied molecular orbital of difluorides MO diagram help explain why the molecule is very stable the diagram also tells us that the bond order is Contributors and Attributions Dieu Huynh
