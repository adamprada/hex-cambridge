D Recrystallization Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors Recrystallization is used to purify solids Usually this method works best when there is only a small amount of impurity in the solid The method involves addition of a cold solvent to the material The mixture that results is heated until the solids dissolve The mixture is slowly cooled again until a pure solid is obtained Recrystallization depends on different solubilities of the target compound and other compounds present in the impure mixture The goal of this method is to have one compound dissolved in a solvent while the other compound is not dissolved If one compound is an undissolved solid it can be filtered out of the solution in order to separate it from all the other things that are in solution Solubility in a solvent is a physical property of a material just like its boiling point or melting point Sodium chloride table salt has a particular solubility in cold water g will dissolve in mL while sodium oleate found in some soaps has a different solubility in cold water g per mL That difference can be exploited to separate these two compounds STOP AND THINK Suppose you were trying to go into the soap business Maybe you find you can easily produce a mixture of equal parts weightweight of sodium chloride and sodium oleate Describe how you could get pure sodium oleate Look at the structures of sodium chloride and sodium oleate Can you qualitatively explain the difference between their solubilities in water Its possible that a mixture of sodium chloride and sodium oleate could be purified through the addition of water If the right amount of water were added and the resulting slurry were stirred together and filtered much of the sodium chloride would be removed because it is more soluble in water than is sodium oleate Sodium oleate is less soluble in water than is sodium chloride so most of it would not dissolve It could be gathered or isolated by filtration The technique described above is not recrystallization It is referred to as washing The sodium oleate was washed with water to remove sodium chloride Washing is simple to do Sometimes it can increase the purity of a compound but it is not always very effective Sometimes in a mixture the two compounds are mixed very tightly together Suppose there is a pile of powder that contains sodium oleate and sodium chloride Instead of having individual grains of sodium chloride and individual grains of sodium oleate the grains of powder contain both compounds There might be a small nugget of sodium chloride surrounded by a coating of sodium oleate This situation is very common especially when the two compounds have formed together Washing might remove most of the exposed sodium chloride but it wouldnt touch the hidden or occluded sodium chloride that was surrounded by sodium oleate molecules STOP AND THINK How can you get all of the sodium chloride out of this mixture In other words how can you make sure there is no sodium chloride covered by sodium oleate It would be convenient if there were a switch that could be turned on and off to control dissolution When the switch is on all the sodium oleate dissolves and any sodium chloride trapped inside can get dissolved too When the switch is off the sodium oleate comes out of solution again so that you can filter it out This switch exists It is found on the front of your hot plate in the organic lab Solubility is temperaturedependent For example the solubility of sodium chloride is different in cold water g per mL at C than in hot water g per mL at C Its possible that in the right amount of hot water all the sodium oleate and all the sodium chloride dissolves If the resulting solution is cooled to room temperature the sodium oleate is no longer soluble The sodium oleate forms a solid again This solid can be filtered away from the water STOP AND THINK After filtration list the contents of the solution Instead of filtering can the solution be allowed to evaporate to leave the sodium oleate behind There is one more part of this process that would make it a complete recrystallization If the sodium oleate forms an amorphous solid when it comes back out of solution we have precipitation If the sodium oleate forms a crystalline solid when it comes back out of solution we have recrystallization An amorphous solid contains molecules that are packed together in random ways A crystalline solid contains molecules that are ordered in a specific way An amorphous solid is like a pile of boxes that were thrown across the room and piled in the corner A crystalline solid is like a set of boxes that were stacked neatly in the corner There are many open spaces between the boxes in the amorphous pile Impurities could get trapped in those spaces in that case we are back where we were at the beginning There are not really spaces between the boxes in the crystalline pile No impurities can be trapped Crystallization safeguards against the inclusion of impurities in the material STOP AND THINK There are many variations on most purification techniques One problem that could happen in a recrystallization is that there is a very insoluble impurity How could this very insoluble impurity be separated from the rest of the sample What precautions must be taken in doing so Suppose you are trying to recrystallize a sample of borneol You think it should be recrystallized from methanol You add a couple of mL of cold methanol and the sample all dissolves Evaluate the prognosis of your recrystallization is it working well If not what do you need to do Suppose you are trying to recrystallize a sample of borneol You think it should be recrystallized from methanol You add a couple of mL of cold methanol and only about half the sample dissolves Evaluate the prognosis of your recrystallization is it working well If not what do you need to do Suppose you are trying to recrystallize a sample of borneol You think it should be recrystallized from methanol You add a couple of mL of hot methanol and only about half the sample dissolves Evaluate the prognosis of your recrystallization is it working well If not what do you need to do Contributors Chris P Schaller PhD College of Saint Benedict Saint Johns University
