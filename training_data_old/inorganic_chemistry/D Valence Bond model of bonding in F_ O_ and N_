D Valence Bond model of bonding in and Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The bonding in simple homonuclear molecules such as F O and N is quite similar in principle but have fundamental differences in structure that can be described easily using Valence Bond models The three molecules are comprised of atoms that are adjacent to one another in their period and will thus have similar size and mass The atoms do reside in different columns of the table though and as such will have fundamentally different characteristics such as valence electron count and bond order in their respective diatomic molecules in which the elements are found naturally
