Diatomic Molecules Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Valence bond theory fails for a number of the second row diatomics most famously for O where it predicts a diamagnetic doubly bonded molecule with four lone pairs O does have a double bond but it has two unpaired electrons in the ground state a property that can be explained by the MO picture We can construct the MO energy level diagrams for these molecules as follows We get the simpler diatomic MO picture on the right when the s and p AOs are well separated in energy as they are for O F and Ne The picture on the left results from mixing of the σs and σp MOs which are close in energy for Li Be B C and N The effect of this mixing is to push the σs down in energy and the σpup to the point where the pπ orbitals are below the σp Asymmetric diatomic molecules and ions such as CO NO and NO also have the ordering of energy levels shown on the left because of sp mixing A good animation of the molecular orbitals in the CO molecule can be found on the University of Liverpool Structure and Bonding website Why dont we get sporbital mixing for O and F The reason has to do with the energies of the orbitals which are not drawn to scale in the simple picture above As we move across the second row of the periodic table from Li to F we are progressively adding protons to the nucleus The s orbital which has finite amplitude at the nucleus feels the increased nuclear charge more than the p orbital This means that as we progress across the periodic table and also as we will see later when we move down the periodic table the energy difference between the s and p orbitals increases As the s and p energies become farther apart in energy there is less interaction between the orbitals ie less mixing A plot of orbital energies is shown below Because of the very large energy difference between the s and sp orbitals we plot them on different energy scales with the s to the left and the sp to the right For elements at the left side of the nd period Li Be B the s and p energies are only a few eV apart The energy difference becomes very large more than electron volts for O and F Since single bond energies are typically about eV this energy difference would be very large on the scale of our MO diagrams For all the elements in the nd row of the periodic table the s core orbitals are very low in energy compared to the sp valence orbitals so we dont need to consider them in drawing our MO diagrams
