Discovery of elements Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The longheld belief that all materials consist of atoms was only proven recently although elements such as carbon sulfur iron copper silver gold mercury lead and tin had long been regarded as being atomlike Precisely what constituted an element was recognized as modern chemistry grew through the time of alchemy and about elements were known by the end of the th century About elements had been identified by the middle of the th century and the periodicity of their properties had been observed The element technetium Z which was missing in the periodic table was synthesized by nuclear reaction of Mo in and the last undiscovered element promethium Z was found in the fission products of uranium in Neptunium Z an element of atomic number larger than uranium Z was synthesized for the first time in There are named elements Although the existence of elements Z has been confirmed they are not significant in inorganic chemistry as they are produced in insufficient quantity All transuranium elements are radioactive and among the elements with atomic number smaller than Z technetium prometium and the elements after polonium are also radioactive The halflives refer to Section of polonium astatine radon actinium and protoactinium are very short Considerable amounts of technetium Tc are obtained from fission products Since it is a radioactive element handling Tc is problematic as it is for other radioactive isotopes and their general chemistry is much less developed than those of manganese and rhenium in the same group Atoms are equivalent to alphabets in languages and all materials are made of a combination of elements just as sentences are written using only letters
