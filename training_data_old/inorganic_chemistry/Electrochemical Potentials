Electrochemical Potentials Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Halfcell potentials Using the Nernst equationExample In electrochemical cells or in redox reactions that happen in solution the thermodynamic driving force can be measured as the cell potential Chemical reactions are spontaneous in the direction of ΔG which is also the direction in which the cell potential defined as Ecathode Eanode is positive A cell operating in the spontaneous direction for example a battery that is discharging is called a galvanic cell A cell that is being driven in the nonspontaneous direction is called an electrolytic cell For example let us consider the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to make water Thermodynamically this reaction is spontaneous in the direction shown and has an overall standard free energy change ΔG of kJ per mole of water produced When this reaction occurs electrochemically in the spontaneous direction eg in a hydrogenair fuel cell the two half cell reactions that occur are Anode Cathode Here the anode is the negative electrode and the cathode is the positive electrode under conditions of very low current density where there are minimal resistive losses and kinetic overpotentials the potential difference we would measure between the two electrodes would be V In an electrolytic cell this reaction is run in reverse That is we put in electrical energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules In this case the half reactions and their standard potentials reverse Og bubbles form at the anode and Hg is formed at the cathode Now the anode is the positive electrode and the cathode is negative Electrons are extracted from the substance at the anode water and pumped into the solution at the cathode to make hydrogen An animation of the cathode half reaction is shown below In both galvanic and electrolytic cells oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode Halfcell potentials As noted above the equilibrium voltage of an electrochemical cell is proportional to the free energy change of the reaction Because electrochemical reactions can be broken up into two halfreactions it follows that the potentials of half reactions like free energies can be added and subtracted to give an overall value for the reaction If we take the standard hydrogen electrode as our reference ie if we assign it a value of zero volts we can measure all the other half cells against it and thus obtain the voltage of each one This allows us to rank redox couples according to their standard reduction potentials or more simply their standard potentials as shown in the table below Note that when we construct an electrochemical cell and calculate the voltage we simply take the difference between the half cell potentials and do not worry about the number of electrons in the reaction For example for the displacement reaction in which silver ions are reduced by copper metal the reaction is The two halfcell reactions are and the standard potential The reason we dont need to multiply the Ag potential by is that Eo is a measure of the free energy change per electron Dividing the free energy change by the number of electrons see below makes Eo an intensive property like pressure temperature etc Relationship between E and ΔG For systems that are in equilibrium where n is number of moles of electrons per mole of products and F is the Faraday constant Cmol Here the o symbol indicates that the substances involved in the reaction are in their standard states For example for the water electrolysis reaction the standard states would be pure liquid water H at M concentration or more precisely at unit activity and O and Hg at atmosphere pressure More generally at any concentration or pressure where or at K where Q is the concentration ratio of products over reactants raised to the powers of their coefficients in the reaction This equation in either form is called the Nernst equation The second term in the equation when multiplied by nF is RTlnQ This is the free energy difference between ΔG and ΔG We can think of this as an entropic term that takes into account the positive entropy change of dilution or the negative entropy change of concentrating a reactant or product relative to its standard state Using the Nernst equation Example For the half reaction E V by definition What is E at pH and PH atm so H M Example What is the potential of a fuel cell a galvanic HO cell operating at pH Overall reaction In this reaction H is oxidized to H and O is reduced to HO According to our convention we write out and balance both halfcell reactions as reductions For convenience we do this in acid It is left as an exercise to the interested reader to try to work the problem in base Half cell reactions Toyota fuel cell hybrid bus The bus runs on electrical energy obtained directly from the HO reaction Individual fuel cells are connected in series to make a power train that charges a battery pack and drives an electric motor Although the standard potential of the reaction is V because of kinetic overpotentials each fuel cell in the power train operates at a voltage of about V Despite this energy loss the fuel cell system is still about twice as efficient as a combustion engine performing the same reaction To solve this problem we need to find the difference between the H H and OHO half cell potentials at pH E V Like all standard potentials this is written as a reduction We need to reverse it and change the sign of Eo since H is being oxidized E V and add the standard potential of the substance being reduced at the cathode E V The difference between the two standard half cell potentials is V Ecell Volts We now use the Nernst equation to account for the fact that H is not in its standard state Note that the value of Ecell does not change with pH since both couples shift mVpH according to the Nernst equation This is the consequence of the fact that the number of electrons equals the number of protons in each of the half cell reactions Another way to rationalize this result is to remember that the overall reaction H O HO does not involve H as a reactant or product so ΔG and E should be independent of pH We can plot the shift in the HH and OHO halfcell potentials with pH on a potentialpH diagram also called a Pourbaix diagram as shown below The pHdependent potentials of the H and O couples are shown as dotted lines Notice that the potential difference between them is always V The dark circles represent the standard potentials Pourbaix diagram for water Pourbaix diagrams are essentially electrochemical phase diagrams which plot regions of thermodynamic stability for redoxactive substances As in other kinds of phase diagrams the lines represent conditions under which two phases coexist in equilibrium The shaded area in the water Pourbaix diagram represents the conditions of potential and pH where liquid water is stable relative to hydrogen or oxygen Outside the shaded region water is thermodynamically unstable and is reduced to Hg or oxidized to Og Although these processes are spontaneous in the thermodynamic sense for example water is unstable in the presence of Pb Cl Fe Zn or Al they are kinetically slow and require catalysis to proceed
