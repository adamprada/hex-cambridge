Electronegativity Values Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers There are a few different types of electronegativity which differ only in their definitions and the system by which they assign values for electronegativity For example there is Mulliken electronegativity which is defined as the average of the ionization energy and electron affinity of an atom which as we will see differs slightly from Paulings definition of electronegativity Topic hierarchy
