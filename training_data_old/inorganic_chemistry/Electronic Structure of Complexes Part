necessary to learn a few concepts to understand the structure spectrum magnetism and reactivity of complexes which depend on d electron configurations In particular the theory of electronic structure is important Ligand field theory Ligand field theory is one of the most useful theories to account for the electronic structure of complexes It originated in the application of the crystal field theory of ionic crystals to metal complex systems Six coordinate octahedral complexes The five d orbitals of transition metal cations are degenerate and have equal energy Figure Change of electronic energy upon complex formation The spherical negative electric field around a metal cation results in the total energy level being lower than that of a free cation because the electrostatic interactions The repulsive interaction between the electrons in the metal orbitals and the negative electric field destabilizes the system and compensates for the stabilization to some extent Figure Figure Ligand positions in the Cartesian coordinate with a metal ion at the origin Let us assume that instead of a uniform spherical negative field the field is generated by six ligands coordinating octahedrally to a central metal The negative field of the ligands is called the ligand field Negative charge in the case of anionic ligands or a negative end lone pair in the case of neutral ligands exert a repulsive force on the metal d orbitals which is anisotropic depending on the direction of the orbitals The position of the metal cation is taken as the origin and Cartesian coordinates are constructed Figure Then dxy and dz orbitals are aligned along the directions of the axes and the dxy dyz and dxz orbitals are directed between the axes If ligands are placed on the axes the repulsive interaction is larger for the eg orbitals dxy dz than for the tg orbitals dxy dyz dxz and the eg orbitals are destabilized and the tg orbitals are stabilized to an equal extent In the following discussion only the energy difference between the tg and eg orbitals is essential and the average energy of these orbitals is taken as the zero of energy If the energy difference between the two eg and three tg orbitals is set to the energy level of the eg orbitals is and that of the tg orbitals is Figure may also be expressed as Dq In this case the energy level of the eg orbitals is Dq and that of the tg orbitals Dq Figure Ligand field splitting in tetrahedral and octahedral complexes Transition metal ions have to d electrons and when the split d orbitals are filled from a lower energy level the electron configuration tgxegy corresponding to each ion is obtained With the zero energy level chosen as the average energy level the energy of the electron configuration relative to zero energy becomes This value is called the ligand field stabilization energy The electron configuration with smaller value taking the minus sign into consideration is more stable LFSE is an important parameter to explain some properties of dblock transition metal complexes A condition other than the orbital energy level is required to explain the filling of electrons being populated into the split tg and eg orbitals Two electrons can occupy an orbital with antiparallel spins but a strong electrostatic repulsion occurs between two electrons in the same orbital This repulsive interaction is called pairing energy P When the number of d electrons is less than three the pairing energy is minimized by loading the electrons in the tg orbital with parallel spins Namely the electron configurations arising are tg tg or tg Two possibilities arise when the fourth electron occupies either of the tg or eg orbitals The lower energy orbital tg is favorable but occupation of the same orbital gives rise to pairing energy P The total energy becomes If the fourth electron occupies the energetically unfavorable eg orbital the total energy becomes The choice of the electron configuration depends on which of the above values is larger Therefore if P tg is favoured and this is called the strong field case or the low spin electron configuration If P tgeg is favoured and this is called the weak field case or the high spin electron configuration A similar choice is required for d d and d octahedral complexes and in the strong field case tg tg or tgeg configurations are favoured whereas in the weak field case tgeg tgeg or tgeg configurations are favoured The ligand field splitting parameter is decided by the nature of the ligands and metal whereas the pairing energy P is almost constant and shows only a slight dependence on the identity of the metal Square planar complexes Complexes with four ligands in a plane containing the central metal are termed square planar complexes It is easier to understand the electronic energy levels of the d orbitals in square planar complexes by starting from those for hexacoordinate octahedral complexes Placing the six ligands along the Cartesian axes the two ligands on the z axis are gradually removed from the central metal and finally only four ligands are left on the xy plane The interaction of the two z coordinate ligands with the dz dxz and dyz orbitals becomes smaller and the energy levels of these ligands lower On the other hand the remaining four ligands approach the metal and the dxy and dxy energy levels rise as a result of the removal of the two ligands This results in the order of the energy levels of five d orbitals being dxz dyz dz dxy dxy Figure Rh Ir Pd Pt and Au complexes with a d configuration tend to form square planar structures because eight electrons occupy the lower orbitals leaving the highest dxy orbital empty Figure Change of the orbital energy from octahedral to square planar complexes Tetrahedral complexes Tetrahedral complexes have four ligands on the apexes of a tetrahedron around the central metal CoX X Cl Br I NiCO etc are all examples of coordination complexes Figure When a metal is placed on the origin of the Cartesian axes as in the octahedral complexes e orbitals dxy dz are distant from ligands and t orbitals dxy dyz dxz are nearer ligands Consequently the electronic repulsion is larger for the t orbitals which are destabilized relative to the e orbitals The ligand field exerted by four ligands splits the fivefold degenerate orbitals of the central metal into twofold degenerate e and threefold degenerate t sets Figure The t set has energy of and the e set with a ligand field splitting of As the number of the ligands is of that in hexacoordinate octahedral complexes and overlap of the ligands with the orbitals is smaller and the ligand splitting is about a half of Consequently only highspin electron configurations are known in tetrahedral complexes The ligand field splitting energies calculated by the above method are shown in Table Table Ligand field stabilization energy LFSE Octahedral Tetrahedral Strong field LS Weak field HS dn Example n n n d Ti d V d CrV d Cr Mn d Mn Fe d Fe Co d Co d Ni d Cu d Cu JahnTeller Effect When orbitals of a highly symmetrical nonlinear polyatomic molecule are degenerate the degeneracy is resolved by distorting the molecular framework to attain lower symmetry and thus lower energy This is the JahnTeller effect and a typical example is seen in the tetragonal distortion of an octahedral coordination structure of hexacoordinate Cu complexes Figure JahnTeller splitting in a Cu ion Figure The relation between the metal and ligand orbitals during formation of bonds They have a d configurations and the eg orbitals in the octahedral structure are occupied by three electrons If the eg orbitals split and two electrons occupy the lower orbital and one electron the upper orbital the system gains energy of a half of the energy difference of two split orbitals Therefore a tetragonal distortion in the z axis becomes favorable
