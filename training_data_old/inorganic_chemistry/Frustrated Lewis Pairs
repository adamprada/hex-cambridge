Frustrated Lewis Pairs Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers A frustrated Lewis pair FLP is a compound or mixture that contains a Lewis acid and a Lewis base which because of steric hindrance cannot combine to form a classical adduct Many kinds of FLPs have been devised and their reactivity towards other molecules has been broadly developed The hydrogen adduct of the original FLP a phosphoniumborate salt can be prepared by combining a phenylene bridged phosphinoborane and dihydrogen The salt which is colorless is stable in the presence of air and moisture It releases molecular H when heated above C This reactivity is remarkable considering the strength of the HH bond kJmol Absorption and release of hydrogen from FLP The discovery that some FLPs can split H triggered the rapid growth of research into FLPs Because of their unquenched reactivity such systems are reactive toward substrates that can undergo heterolysis For example many FLPs split the hydrogen molecule This reactivity suggested that FLPs can be useful for hydrogenation reactions A sizable range of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic reactions have now been developed using FLPs Mixtures of sterically hindered Lewis acids and bases also can act as FLPs One successful strategy is to mix sterically hindered triarylphosphines with triarylboranes Small molecules such as CO and ethylene can then form a bridge between the phosphine Lewis base and borane Lewis acid eg Because FLPs behave at the same time as both nucleophiles and electrophiles they can effect the ringopening of cyclic ethers such as THF dihydrofuran coumaran and dioxane
