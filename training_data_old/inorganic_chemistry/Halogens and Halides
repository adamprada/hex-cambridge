chloride CuClCalcium chloride CaClCalcium fluoride CaFChromiumII chloride CrClChromiumIII chloride CrCl The origin of halogen is the Greek word meaning the production of salt by direct reaction with a metal Since their reactivity is very high halogens are found in nature only as compounds The basic properties of halogens are shown in Table and Table The electron configuration of each halogen atom is nsnp and they lack one electron from the closedshell structure of a rare gas Thus a halogen atom emits energy when it gains an electron Namely the enthalpy change of the reaction X g e rightarrow X gis negative Although electron affinity is defined as the energy change of gaining an electron a positive sign is customarily used In order to be consistent with the enthalpy change a negative sign would be appropriate Table Properties of halogens Ionization energy kJ mol Electronegativity Ionic radius rX pm F Cl Br I Table Properties of halogen molecules Interatomic distance rXX pm mp C bp C Color F Colorless gas Cl Yellow green gas Br Dark red liquid I Dark violet solid The electron affinity of chlorine kJ mol is the largest and fluorine kJ mol comes between chlorine and bromine kJ mol The electronegativity of fluorine is the highest of all the halogens Since halogens are produced as metal salts simple substances are manufactured by electrolysis Fluorine only takes the oxidation number in its compounds although the oxidation number of other halogens can range from to Astatine At has no stable nuclide and little is known about its chemical properties a Manufacture of halogen Fluorine has the highest reduction potential E V and the strongest oxidizing power among the halogen molecules It is also the most reactive nonmetallic element Since water is oxidized by F at much lower electrode potential V fluorine gas cannot be manufactured by the electrolysis of aqueous solutions of fluorine compounds Therefore it was a long time before elemental fluorine was isolated and F F H Moisson finally succeeded in isolating it by the electrolysis of KF in liquid HF Fluorine is still manufactured by this reaction Chlorine which is especially important in inorganic industrial chemistry is manufactured together with sodium hydroxide The basic reaction for the production of chlorine is electrolysis of an aqueous solution of NaCl using an ion exchange process In this process chlorine gas is generated in an anodic cell containing brine and Na moves through an ion exchange membrane to the cathodic cell where it pairs with OH to become an aqueous solution of NaOH Exercise Why can chlorine be manufactured by electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride Answer Despite the higher reduction potential of chlorine V than that of oxygen V the reduction potential of oxygen can be raised overvoltage depending on the choice of electrode used for the electrolysis process Bromine is obtained by the oxidation of Br with chlorine gas in saline water Iodine is similarly produced by passing chlorine gas through saline water containing I ions Since natural gas is found in Japan together with underground saline water containing I Japan is one of the main countries producing iodine Anomalies of fluorine Molecular fluorine compounds have very low boiling points This is due to the difficulty of polarization as a result of the electrons being strongly drawn to the nuclei of fluorine atoms Since the electronegativity of fluorine is highest and electrons shift to F resulting in the high acidity of atoms bonded to F Because of the small ionic radius of F high oxidation states are stabilized and hence low oxidation compounds like CuF are unknown in contrast with the compounds such as IF and PtF Pseudohalogens Since the cyanide ion CN the azide ion N and the thiocyanate ion SCN etc form compounds similar to those of halide ions they are called pseudohalide ions They form psudohalogen molecules such as cyanogene CN hydrogen cyanide HCN sodium thiocyanate NaSCN etc Finetuning electronic and steric effects that are impossible with only halide ions make pseudohalogens useful also in transition metal complex chemistry Polyhalogens Besides the usual halogen molecules mixed halogen and polyhalogen molecules such as BrCl IBr ICl ClF BrFIF etc also exist Polyhalogen anions and cations such as I I I and I are also known b Oxygen compounds Although many binary oxides of halogens consisting only of halogen and oxygen are known most are unstable Oxygen difluoride OF is the most stable such compound This is a very powerful fluorinating agent and can generate plutonium hexafluoride PuF from plutonium metal While oxygen chloride ClO is used for bleaching pulp and water treatment it is generated in situ from ClO since it is unstable Hypochlorous acid HClO chlorous acid HClO chloric acid HClO and perchloric acid HClO are oxoacids of chlorine and especially perchloric acid is a strong oxidizing agent as well as being a strong acid Although analogous acids and ions of other halogens had been known for many years BrO was synthesized as late as Once it was prepared it turned out to be no less stable than ClO or IO causing some to wonder why it had not been synthesized before Although ClO is often used for crystallizing transition metal complexes it is explosive and should be handled very carefully c Halides of nonmetals Halides of almost all nonmetals are known including fluorides of even the inert gases krypton Kr and xenon Xe Although fluorides are interesting for their own unique characters halides are generally very important as starting compounds for various compounds of nonmetals by replacing halogens in inorganic syntheses Table Table Typical chlorides and fluorides of main group elements LiCl BeCl BF CCl NF

more than one oxidation state especially in transition metals several kinds of halides are known for each transition metal These halides are most important as starting materials of the preparation of metal compounds and the inorganic chemistry of metal compounds depends on metal halides There are molecular dimensional chain dimensional layer and dimensional halides but few of them are molecular in crystalline states It should be noted that the anhydrous transition metal halides are usually solid compounds and hydrates are coordination compounds with water ligands As the dimensionality of structures is one of the most interesting facets of structural or synthetic chemistry typical halides are described in order of their dimensionality Table Typical chlorides and fluorides of transition
