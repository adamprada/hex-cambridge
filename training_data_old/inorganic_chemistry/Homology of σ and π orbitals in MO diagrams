Homology of σ and π orbitals in MO diagrams Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The ozone molecule and related e molecules that contain three nonH atoms such as NO and the allyl anion CHCHCH is an example of center electron πbonding Our MO treatment of ozone is entirely analogous to the electron H anion We map that solution onto this one as follows The nonbonding πorbital has a node at the central O atom This means that the nonbonding electron pair in the πsystem is shared by the two terminal O atoms ie that the formal charge is shared by those atoms This is consistent with the octet resonance structure of ozone This trick of mapping the solution for a set of sorbitals onto a πbonding problem is a simple example of a broader principle called the isolobal analogy This idea developed extensively by Roald Hoffmann at Cornell University has been used to understand bonding and reactivity in organometallic compounds In the isolobal analogy symmetry principles as illustrated above in the analogy between H and ozone are used to construct MO diagrams of complex molecules containing dfrontier orbitals from simpler molecular fragments Professor Roald Hoffmanns ideas about orbital symmetry have helped explain the bonding and reactivity of organic and organometallic molecules and also the structures and properties of extended solids The triiodide ion An analogous and seemingly more complicated case of center electron bonding is I Each I atom has valence orbitals s px py pz making a total of frontier orbitals and the I anion has electrons We can simplify the problem by recalling two periodic trends The sp orbital splitting is large relative to the bond energy after the second row of the periodic table Thus the s orbital is low in energy and too contracted to make bonds with its neighbors πoverlap of p orbitals is very weak so the px and py orbitals will also be nonbonding This leaves only the three pz orbitals to make bondingnonbondingantibonding combinations Again the problem is entirely analogous to ozone or H Counting orbitals we obtain lone pairs from the nonbonding s px and py orbitals as well as one bond and one lone pair from the pz orbital combinations above The total of nonbonding pairs and one bond accounts for the electrons in the ion The nonbonding pz pair is localized on the terminal I atoms giving each a formal charge This MO description is entirely consistent with the octet nobond resonance picture of I that we developed in Chapter
