Hydrogen and hydrides Last updated Save as PDF Page ID a Hydrogenb HydrideSaline hydridesMolecular hydridesMetallic hydridesHydride complexes a Hydrogen Hydrogen is the simplest element consisting of a proton and an electron and the most abundant element in the universe It is next to oxygen and silicon and about wt of all the elements on the Earth Needless to say most hydrogen exists as water on the Earth Since its polarity may change freely between hydride H atom H and proton H hydrogen also forms various compounds with many elements including oxygen and carbon Therefore hydrogen is highly important in chemistry Of the three kinds of isotopes of hydrogen deuterium D was discovered by H C Urey and others in and subsequently tritium T was prepared from deuterium in About of hydrogen is present as deuterium and this can be enriched by electrolysis of water Tritium is a radioactive isotope emitting particles with a halflife of years Since the mass of deuterium and tritium is about twice and three times that of hydrogen respectively the physical properties of the isotopes and compounds containing them differ considerably Some properties of the isotopes and water are listed in Table When the EH bond in a hydrogen compound is converted into the ED by deuterium substitution the EH stretching frequency in an infrared spectrum is reduced to about which is useful for determining the position of the hydrogen atom It is sometimes possible to conclude that scission of the bond with a hydrogen is the ratedetermining step when the deuterium substitution shows a marked effect on the rate of reaction of a hydrogencontaining compound Since the nuclear spin of hydrogen is and given its abundance it is the most important nuclide for NMR spectroscopy NMR is widely used not only for identification of organic compounds but also for medical diagnostic purposes using MRI magnetic resonance imaging of water in living bodies Human organs can now be observed with this noninvasive method Table Properties of isotopic hydrogen and water Properties H D T HO DO TO Melting point Boiling point Density g cm C Temp of maximum density C hydrogen K water C There are nuclearspin isomers in diatomic molecules of the nuclides whose spin is not zero Especially in the case of a hydrogen molecule the difference of properties is significant Spins of parahydrogen are antiparallel and the sum is leading to a singlet state Spins of orthohydrogen are parallel and the sum is resulting in a triplet state Since parahydrogen is in a lower energy state it is the stabler form at low temperatures The theoretical ratio of parahydrogen is at K but it decreases to about at room temperature since the ratio of orthohydrogen increases at higher temperatures Gas chromatography and rotational lines in the electronic band spectrum of H can distinguish two hydrogen isomers b Hydride Binary hydrides can be classified according to the position of the element in the periodic table and by the bond characters The hydrides of alkali and alkaline earth metals among sblock elements are ionic compounds structurally analogous to halides and are called saline hydrides The Group pblock elements form covalent molecular hydrides No hydride of rare gas elements has been reported Some of the dblock and fblock transition metals form metal hydrides exhibiting metallic properties Transition metals which do not give binary hydrides form many molecular hydride complexes coordinated by stabilization ligands such as carbonyl CO tertiaryphosphines PR or cyclopentadienyl CH refer to Section Typical hydrides of each class are given below Saline hydrides Lithium hydride LiH is a colorless crystalline compound mp melting point C Li and H form a lattice with a rock salt type structure Quantitative evolution of hydrogen gas at the anode during the electrolysis of the fused salt suggests the existence of H Water reacts vigorously with lithium hydride evolving hydrogen gas Since it dissolves in ethers slightly the hydride is used as a reducing agent in organic chemistry Calcium hydride CaH is a colorless crystalline compound mp C and reacts mildly with water evolving hydrogen gas This hydride is used as a hydrogen gas generator or a dehydrating agent for organic solvents It is used also as a reducing agent Lithium tetrahydridoaluminate LiAlH is a colorless crystalline compound decomposes above C usually called lithium aluminum hydride The hydride dissolves in ethers and reacts violently with water It is used as a reducing and hydrogenating agent and for dehydrating organic solvents Sodium tetrahydroborate NaBH is a white crystalline compound decomposes at C usually called sodium borohydride It is soluble in water and decomposes at high temperatures evolving hydrogen gas It is used as a reducing agent for inorganic and organic compounds for preparation of hydride complexes etc Molecular hydrides All hydrides other than those of carbon methane and oxygen water are poisonous gases with very high reactivity and should be handled very carefully Although there are methods of generating the gases in laboratories recently many are also available in cylinders Diborane BH is a colorless and poisonous gas mp C and bp C with a characteristic irritating odor This hydride is a powerful reducing agent of inorganic and organic compounds It is also useful in organic synthesis as a hydroboration agent that introduces functional groups to olefins after addition of an olefin followed by reactions with suitable reagents Silane SiH is a colorless and deadly poisonous gas mp C and bp C with a pungent smell and is called also monosilane Ammonia NH is a colorless and poisonous gas mp C and bp C with a characteristic irritating odor Although it is used in many cases as aqueous ammonia since it dissolves well in water liquid ammonia is also used as a nonaqueous solvent for special reactions Since the HarberBosch process of ammonia synthesis was developed in it has been one of the most important compounds in chemical industries and is used as a starting chemical for many nitrogenous compounds It is used also as a refrigerant Phosphine PH is a colorless and deadly poisonous gas mp C and bp C with a bad smell and is called also phosphorus hydride It burns spontaneously in air It is used in vapor phase epitaxial growth in transition metal coordination chemistry etc Hydrogen sulfide HS is a colorless and deadly poisonous gas mp C and bp C with a rotten egg odor Although often used with insufficient care it is very dangerous and should be handled only in an environment with good ventilation It is used in chemical analysis for the precipitation of metal ions preparation of sulfur compounds etc Hydrogen fluoride HF is a colorless fuming and low boiling point liquid mp C and bp C with an irritating odor It is used for preparing inorganic and organic fluorine compounds Because of its high permittivity it can be used as a special nonaqueous solvent The aqueous solution is called fluoric acid and is stored in polyethylene containers since the acid corrodes glass Metallic hydrides The hydrides MHx which show metallic properties are nonstoichiometric interstitialtype solids in which hydrogen occupies a part of the cavities of the metal lattice Usually x is not an integer in these compounds There are Group Sc Y Group Ti Zr Hf Group V Nb Ta Cr Ni Pd and Cu metallic hydrides among the d block elements but the hydrides of other metals in Group to are not known Palladium Pd reacts with hydrogen gas at ambient temperatures and forms hydrides that have the composition PdHx x Many metallic hydrides show metallic conductivity LaNi is an intermetallic compound of lanthanum and nickel It occludes nearly hydrogen atoms per unit lattice and is converted to LaNiH It is one of the candidates for use as a hydrogen storage material with the development of hydrogenfueled cars Exercise Write the oxidation number of the hydrogen atom in H NaH NH and HCl Answer H NaH NH and HCl Hydride complexes Complexes coordinated by hydride ligands are called hydride complexes The Group to transition metals that do not form binary hydrides give many hydride complexes with auxiliary ligands such as carbonyl and tertiaryphosphines Although it was only at the end of the s that hydride was accepted as a ligand thousands of hydride complexes are known at present Furthermore with the synthesis in the s of molecular hydrogen complexes the chemistry of transition metal hydrogen compounds took a new turn Research on the homogeneous catalysis of hydrocarbons in which hydride or dihydrogen complexes participate is also progressing
