JahnTeller Effect Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The JahnTeller effect sometimes also known as JahnTeller distortion describes the geometrical distortion of molecules and ions that is associated with certain electron configurations This electronic effect is named after Hermann Arthur Jahn and Edward Teller who proved using group theory that orbitally degenerate molecules cannot be stable The JahnTeller theorem essentially states that any nonlinear molecule with a spatially degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the molecule JahnTeller distortion of a d octahedral transition metal complex The tetragonal distortion lengthens the bonds along the zaxis as the bonds in the xy plane become shorter This change lowers the overall energy because the two electrons in the dz orbital go down in energy as the one electron in the dxy orbital goes up We can understand this effect in the context of octahedral metal complexes by considering delectron configurations in which the eg orbital set contains one or three electrons The most common of these are high spin d eg CrF low spin d egNaNiO and d eg Cu If the complex can distort to break the symmetry then one of the formerly degenerate eg orbitals will go down in energy and the other will go up More electrons will occupy the lower orbital than the upper one resulting in an overall lowering of the electronic energy A similar distortion can occur in tetrahedral complexes when the t orbitals are partially filled Such geometric distortions that lower the electronic energy are said to be electronically driven Similar electronically driven distortions occur in onedimensional chain compounds where they are called Peierls distortions and in twodimensionally bonded sheets where they are called charge density waves The JahnTeller effect is most often encountered in octahedral complexes especially sixcoordinate copperII complexes The d electronic configuration of this ion gives three electrons in the two degenerate eg orbitals leading to a doubly degenerate electronic ground state Such complexes distort along one of the molecular fourfold axes always labelled the z axis which has the effect of removing the orbital and electronic degeneracies and lowering the overall energy The distortion normally takes the form of elongating the bonds to the ligands lying along the z axis but occasionally occurs as a shortening of these bonds instead the JahnTeller theorem does not predict the direction of the distortion only the presence of an unstable geometry When such an elongation occurs the effect is to lower the electrostatic repulsion between the electronpair on the Lewis basic ligand and any electrons in orbitals with a z component thus lowering the energy of the complex If the undistorted complex would be expected to have an inversion center this is preserved after the distortion The JahnTeller effect is responsible for the tetragonal distortion of the hexaaquacopperII complex ion CuOH which might otherwise possess octahedral geometry The two axial CuO distances are Å whereas the four equatorial CuO distances are Å In octahedral complexes the JahnTeller effect is most pronounced when an odd number of electrons occupy the eg orbitals This situation arises in complexes with the configurations d lowspin d or highspin d complexes all of which have doubly degenerate ground states In such compounds the eg orbitals involved in the degeneracy point directly at the ligands so distortion can result in a large energetic stabilization Strictly speaking the effect also occurs when there is a degeneracy due to the electrons in the tg orbitals ie configurations such as d or d both of which are triply degenerate In such cases however the effect is much less noticeable because there is a much smaller lowering of repulsion on taking ligands further away from the tg orbitals which do not point directly at the ligands see the table below The same is true in tetrahedral complexes eg manganate distortion is very subtle because there is less stabilisation to be gained because the ligands are not pointing directly at the orbitals The expected effects for octahedral coordination are given in the following table JahnTeller effect Number of d electrons

blank no JahnTeller effect expected The JahnTeller effect is manifested in the UVVIS absorbance spectra of some compounds where it often causes splitting of bands It is readily apparent in the structures of many copperII complexes Additional detailed information about the anisotropy of such complexes and the nature of the ligand binding can be obtained from the fine structure of the lowtemperature electron spin resonance spectra The CuII ion can also coordinate five water molecules in an elongated square pyramid with four CuOeq bonds x Å and x Å and a long CuOax bond Å The four
