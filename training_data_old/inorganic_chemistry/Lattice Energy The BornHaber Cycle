Lattice Energy The BornHaber Cycle Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionLattice EnergyBornHaber CycleUsing the BornHaber CycleStep Step Step Step Step EquationReferencesProblemsSolutionsReferences Ionic solids tend to be very stable compounds The enthalpies of formation of the ionic molecules cannot alone account for this stability These compounds have an additional stability due to the lattice energy of the solid structure However lattice energy cannot be directly measured The BornHaber cycle allows us to understand and determine the lattice energies of ionic solids Introduction This module will introduce the idea of lattice energy as well as one process that allows us to calculate it the BornHaber Cycle In order to use the BornHaber Cycle there are several concepts that we must understand first Lattice Energy Lattice Energy is a type of potential energy that may be defined in two ways In one definition the lattice energy is the energy required to break apart an ionic solid and convert its component atoms into gaseous ions This definition causes the value for the lattice energy to always be positive since this will always be an endothermic reaction The other definition says that lattice energy is the reverse process meaning it is the energy released when gaseous ions bind to form an ionic solid As implied in the definition this process will always be exothermic and thus the value for lattice energy will be negative Its values are usually expressed with the units kJmol Lattice Energy is used to explain the stability of ionic solids Some might expect such an ordered structure to be less stable because the entropy of the system would be low However the crystalline structure allows each ion to interact with multiple oppositely charge ions which causes a highly favorable change in the enthalpy of the system A lot of energy is released as the oppositely charged ions interact It is this that causes ionic solids to have such high melting and boiling points Some require such high temperatures that they decompose before they can reach a melting andor boiling point BornHaber Cycle There are several important concept to understand before the BornHaber Cycle can be applied to determine the lattice energy of an ionic solid ionization energy electron affinity dissociation energy sublimation energy heat of formation and Hesss Law Ionization Energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom or an ion This process always requires an input of energy and thus will always have a positive value In general ionization energy increases across the periodic table from left to right and decreases from top to bottom There are some excepts usually due to the stability of halffilled and completely filled orbitals Electron Affinity is the energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or an ion Usually energy released would have a negative value but due to the definition of electron affinity it is written as a positive value in most tables Therefore when used in calculating the lattice energy we must remember to subtract the electron affinity not add it In general electron affinity increases from left to right across the periodic table and decreases from top to bottom Dissociation energy is the energy required to break apart a compound The dissociation of a compound is always an endothermic process meaning it will always require an input of energy Therefore the change in energy is always positive The magnitude of the dissociation energy depends on the electronegativity of the atoms involved Sublimation energy is the energy required to cause a change of phase from solid to gas bypassing the liquid phase This is an input of energy and thus has a positive value It may also be referred to as the energy of atomization The heat of formation is the change in energy when forming a compound from its elements This may be positive or negative depending on the atoms involved and how they interact Hesss Law states that the overall change in energy of a process can be determined by breaking the process down into steps then adding the changes in energy of each step The BornHaber Cycle is essentially Hesss Law applied to an ionic solid Using the BornHaber Cycle The values used in the BornHaber Cycle are all predetermined changes in enthalpy for the processes described in the section above Hess Law allows us to add or subtract these values which allows us to determine the lattice energy Step Determine the energy of the metal and nonmetal in their elemental forms Elements in their natural state have an energy level of zero Subtract from this the heat of formation of the ionic solid that would be formed from combining these elements in the appropriate ration This is the energy of the ionic solid and will be used at the end of the process to determine the lattice energy Step The BornHaber Cycle requires that the elements involved in the reaction are in their gaseous forms Add the changes in enthalpy to turn one of the elements into its gaseous state and then do the same for the other element Step Metals exist in nature as single atoms and thus no dissociation energy needs to be added for this element However many nonmetals will exist as polyatomic species For example Cl exists as Cl in its elemental state The energy required to change Cl into Cl atoms must be added to the value obtained in Step Step Both the metal and nonmetal now need to be changed into their ionic forms as they would exist in the ionic solid To do this the ionization energy of the metal will be added to the value from Step Next the electron affinity of the nonmetal will be subtracted from the previous value It is subtracted because it is a release of energy associated with the addition of an electron This is a common error due to confusion caused by the definition of electron affinity so be careful when doing this calculation Step Now the metal and nonmetal will be combined to form the ionic solid This will cause a release of energy which is called the lattice energy The value for the lattice energy is the difference between the value from Step and the value from Step The diagram below is another representation of the BornHaber Cycle Equation The BornHaber Cycle can be reduced to a single equation Heat of formation Heat of atomization Dissociation energy sum of Ionization energies sum of Electron affinities Lattice energy Note In this general equation the electron affinity is added However when plugging in a value determine whether energy is released exothermic reaction or absorbed endothermic reaction for each electron affinity If energy is released put a negative sign in front of the value if energy is absorbed the value should be positive Rearrangement to solve for lattice energy gives the equation Lattice energy Heat of formation Heat of atomization Dissociation energy sum of Ionization energies sum of Electron
