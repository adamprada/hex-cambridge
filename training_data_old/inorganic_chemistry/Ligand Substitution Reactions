Ligand Substitution Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Transition metal complexes can exchange one ligand for another and these reactions are important in their synthesis stereochemistry and catalytic chemistry The mechanisms of chemical reactions are intimately connected to reaction kinetics As in organic chemistry the mechanisms of transition metal reactions are typically inferred from experiments that examine the concentration dependence of the incoming and outgoing ligands on the reaction rate the detection of intermediates and the stereochemistry of the reactants and products Thermodynamic vs kinetics When we think about the reactions of transition metal complexes it is important to recall the distinction between their thermodynamics and kinetics Take for example the formation of the square planar tetracyanonickelate complex Thermodynamically NiCN is very stable meaning that the equilibrium above lies very far to the right Kinetically however the complex is labile meaning that it can exchange its ligands rapidly For example the exchange between a C labeled CN ion and a bound CN ligand occurs on the timescale of tens of milliseconds Conversely a compound can be thermodynamically unstable but kinetically inert meaning that it takes a relatively long time to react For example the CoNH ion is unstable in acid but its hydrolysis reaction with concentrated HCl takes about one week to go to completion at room temperature Henry Taube who studied the mechanisms of ligand exchange reactions in simple test tube experiments classified transition metal complexes as labile if their reaction halflife was one minute or less and inert if they took longer to react The dynamic range of ligand substitution rates is enormous spanning at least orders of magnitude On the timescale of most laboratory experiments the Taube definition of lability is a useful one for classifying reactions into those that have low and high activation energies As we will see the crystal field stabilization energy CFSE plays a key role in determining the activation energy and therefore the rate of ligand substitution Henry Taube Stanford University received the Nobel Prize for his work on the electron transfer and ligand exchange reactions of transition metal complexes Crystal field stabilization energy and ligand exchange rates Lets consider a very commmon and simple ligand exchange reaction which is the substitution of one water molecule for another in an octahedral MHOn complex Since the products except for the label are the same as the reactants we know that ΔG and Keq for this reaction The progress of the reaction can be monitored by NMR by using isotopically labeled water typically containing O or O The most striking thing about this otherwise boring reaction is the vast difference in rate constants about orders of magnitude for different metal ions and oxidation states Mn log k sec Cr V Cr Cu While at first it may seem strange that the same ion in two different oxidation states Cr vs Cr would be inert or labile respectively we can begin to rationalize the difference by drawing dorbital splitting diagrams for the complexes What we find is that octahedral complexes that have high CFSE Cr V tend to be inert Conversely ions with electrons in high energy eg orbitals Cr Cu tend to be labile In the case of Cr and V the energy penalty for distorting the complex away from octahedral symmetry to make for example a or coordinate intermediate is particularly high This activation energy for ligand substitution is lower for Cr and Cu which already have electrons in antibonding eg orbitals Based on the rules we developed for calculating the CFSE of transition metal complexes we can now predict the trends in ligand substitution rates Octahedral complexes with d and dlow spin configurations such as Cr d Co d Rh d Ru d and Os d tend to be substitutioninert because of their high CFSE Square planar d complexes especially those in the d and d series are also substitutioninert Examples are complexes of Pd Pt and Au Intermediate cases are complexes of Fe V V Ni and of main group ions Be Al that are hard Lewis acids These complexes make strong metaloxygen bonds and have water exchange rates in the range of s Ions with zero CFSE exchange water molecules on a timescale of nanoseconds k s These include ions with d d high spin and d electron counts including alkali metal Li Na K Rb Cs and alkali earth Mg Ca Sr Ba cations Zn Cd Hg and Mn In these cases the CFSE is zero and the energetic cost of breaking octahedral symmetry is relatively low For pblock elements faster exchange occurs with larger ions eg Ba Ca and Ga Al because Lewis acid strength decreases with increasing ion size The Cu ion d as a JahnTeller ion is already distorted away from octahedral symmetry and is therefore quite labile exchanging water ligands at a rate of about s Ligand Substitution Mechanisms For an MLn complex undergoing ligand substitution there are essentially three different reaction mechanisms In the dissociative mechanism a MLn complex first loses a ligand to form an MLn intermediate and the incoming ligand Y reacts with the MLn fragment This mechanism is illustrated below for ligand substitution on an octahedral ML complex The intermediate state in this example involves a trigonal bipyramidal ML fragment as well as free L and Y ligands If the rate determining step is the dissociation of L from the complex then the concentration of Y does not affect the rate of reaction leading to the firstorder rate law Illustration of the dissociative ligand substitution mechanism for an ML complex The reaction energy profile is shown at the right In the case of an octahedral complex this reaction would be first order in ML and zero order in Y but only if the highest energy transition state is the one that precedes the formation of the ML intermediate If the two transition states are close in energy as in the case of the animation at the right then the rate law becomes more complicated In this case we can simplify the problem by assuming a low steadystate concentration of the MLn intermediate The resulting rate law is which reduces to the simpler firstorder rate law when kY kL Because the formation of the transition state involves dissociation of a ligand the entropy of activation is always positive in the dissociative mechanism In the associative mechanism the incoming ligand Y attacks the MLn complex transiently forming an MLnY intermediate and the intermediate then loses a ligand L forming the MLnY product Complexes that undergo associative substitution are typically either coordinatively unsaturated or contain a ligand that can change its bonding to the metal eg a change in the hapticity or bending of a nitric oxide ligand NO In homogeneous catalysis the associative pathway is desirable because the binding event and hence the selectivity of the reaction depends not only on the nature of the metal catalyst but also on the molecule that is involved in the catalytic cycle Berry pseudorotation mechanism Examples of associative mechanisms are commonly found in the chemistry of d square planar metal complexes eg Vaskas complex IrClCOPCH and tetrachloroplatinateII These compounds ML bind the incoming substituting ligand Y to form pentacoordinate intermediates MLY which in a subsequent step dissociate one of their ligands Although the incoming ligand is initially bound at an equatorial site the Berry pseudorotation provides a low energy pathway for all ligands to sample both the equatorial and axial sites Ligand dissociation must occur from an equatorial site according to the principle of microscopic reversibility Dissociation of Y results in no reaction but dissociation of L results in net substitution yielding the d complex MLY The first step is typically rate determining Thus the entropy of activation is negative which indicates an increase in order in the transition state Associative reactions follow second order kinetics the rate of the appearance of product depends on the concentration of both ML and Y The Trans Effect which is connected with the associative mechanism controls the stereochemistry of certain ligand substitution reactions The trans effect refers to the labilization making more reactive of ligands that are trans to certain other ligands the latter being referred to as transdirecting ligands The labilization of trans ligands is attributed to electronic effects and is most notable in square planar complexes but it can also be observed with octahedral complexes The cis effect is most often observed in octahedral complexes In addition to the kinetic trans effect trans ligands also have an influence on the ground state of the molecule the most notable ones being bond lengths and stability Some authors prefer the term trans influence to distinguish this from the kinetic effect while others use more specific terms such as structural trans effect or thermodynamic trans effect The discovery of the trans effect is attributed to Ilya Ilich Chernyaev who recognized it and gave it a name in The intensity of the trans effect as measured by the increase in the rate of substitution of the trans ligand follows this sequence F HO OH NH py Cl Br I SCN NO SCNH Ph SO PR AsR SR CH H NO CO CN CH Note that weak field ligands tend to be poor transdirecting ligands whereas strong field ligands are strongly transdirecting The classic example of the trans effect is the synthesis of cisplatin and its trans isomer Starting from PtCl the first NH ligand is added to any of the four equivalent positions at random However since Cl has a greater trans effect than NH the second NH is added trans to a Cl and therefore cis to the first NH If on the other hand one starts from PtNH the trans product is obtained instead The trans effect in square complexes can be explained in terms of the associative mechanism described above which goes through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate Ligands with a high kinetic trans effect are in general those with high π acidity as in the case of phosphines or lowligand lonepairdπ repulsions as in the case of hydride which prefer the more πbasic equatorial sites in the intermediate The second equatorial position is occupied by the incoming ligand The third and final equatorial site is occupied by the departing trans ligand so the net result is that the kinetically favored product is the one in which the ligand trans to the one with the largest trans effect is eliminated The interchange mechanism is similar to the associative and dissociative pathways except that no distinct MLnY or MLn intermediate is formed This concerted mechanism can be thought of as analogous to nucleophilic substitution via the SN pathway at a tetrahedral carbon atom in organic chemistry The interchange mechanism is further classified as associative Ia or dissociative Id depending on the relative importance of MY and ML bonding in the transition state If the transition state is characterized by the formation of a strong MY bond then the mechanism is Ia Conversely if weakening of the ML bond is more important in reaching the transition state then the mechanism is Id An example of the Ia mechanism is the interchange of bulk and coordinated water in VHO In contrast the slightly more compact ion NiHO ion exchanges water via the Id mechanism Effects of ion pairing Highly charged cationic complexes tend to form ion pairs with anionic ligands and these ion pairs often undergo reactions via the Ia pathway The electrostatically held nucleophilic incoming ligand can exchange positions with a ligand in the first coordination sphere resulting in net substitution An illustrative process is the anation reaction with an anion of the chromiumIII hexaaquo complex
