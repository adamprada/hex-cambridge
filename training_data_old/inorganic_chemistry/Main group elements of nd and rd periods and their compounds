Boron Refined elemental boron is a black solid with a metallic luster The unit cell of crystalline boron contains or boron atoms and the B icosahedral structural units join together by center electron ce bonds and center electron ce bonds electron deficient bonds between boron atoms Figure Boron is very hard and shows semiconductivity Figure The structure of the elemental boron with B icosahedra The chemistry of boranes boron hydrides started from the research of A Stock reported during the period Although boron is adjacent to carbon in the periodic table its hydrides have completely different properties from those of hydrocarbons The structures of boron hydrides in particular were unexpected and could be explained only by a new concept in chemical bonding For his contribution to the very extensive new inorganic chemistry of boron hydrides W N Lipscomb won the Nobel prize in Another Nobel prize was awarded to H C Brown for the discovery and development of a very useful reaction in organic synthesis called hydroboration Because of the many difficulties associated with the low boiling points of boranes as well as their activity toxicity and airsensitivity Stock had to develop new experimental methods for handling the compounds in vacuo Using these techniques he prepared six boranes BH BH BH BH BH and BH by the reactions of magnesium boride MgB with inorganic acids and determined their compositions However additional research was necessary to determine their structures At present the original synthetic method of Stock using MgB as a starting compound is used only for the preparation of BH Since reagents such as lithium tetrahydroborate LiBH and sodium tetrahydroborate NaBH are now readily available and diborane BH is prepared according to the following equation higher boranes are synthesized by the pyrolysis of diborane A new theory of chemical bonding was introduced to account for the bonding structure of diborane BH Although an almost correct hydrogenbridged structure for diborane was proposed in many chemists preferred an ethanelike structure HBBH by analogy with hydrocarbons However H C LonguetHiggins proposed the concept of the electrondeficient center electron bond ce bond and it was proven by electron diffraction in that the structure was correct Figure Figure Structure of diborane It has been elucidated by electron diffraction single crystal Xray structure analysis infrared spectroscopy etc that boranes contain center electron bonds ce bond BHB and besides the usual center electron covalent bonds ce bond BH and BB Such structures can be treated satisfactorily by molecular orbital theory Boranes are classified into closo nido arachno etc according to the skeletal structures of boron atoms Closoborane BnHn has the structure of a closed polyhedron of n boron atoms bonded to n hydrogen atoms as seen in the examples of a regular octahedron BH and an icosahedron BH The boranes of this series do not contain BHB bonds Boranes BnHn such as BH form structures with BB BBB and BHB bonds and lack the apex of the polyhedron of closo boranes and are referred to as nido type boranes Borane BnHn such as BH have a structures that lacks two apexes from the closo type and are more open Skeletons are also built by BB BBB and BHB bonds and these are called arachno type boranes The structures of typical boranes are shown in Figure Figure Structures of boranes Not only diborane but also higher boranes are electrondeficient compounds that are difficult to explain using Lewis electronic structure based on simple center electron covalent bonds Exercise Why is diborane called an electron deficient compound Answer It is because there are only valence electrons of boron and hydrogen atoms although electrons are necessary to assign two electrons each to eight BH bonds K Wade summarized the relation of the number of valence electrons used for skeletal bonds and the structures of boranes and proposed an empirical rule called the Wade rule According to this rule when the number of boron atoms is n the skeletal valence electrons are n for a closo type n for a nido type and n for an arachno type borane The relationship between the skeletal structure of a cluster compound and the number of valence electrons is also an important problem in the cluster compounds of transition metals and the Wade rule has played a significant role in furthering our understanding of the structures of these compounds b Carbon Graphite diamond fullerene and amorphous carbon are carbon allotropes Usually a carbon atom forms four bonds using four valence electrons Graphite Graphite is structured as layers of honeycombshaped membered rings of carbon atoms that look like condensed benzene rings without any hydrogen atoms Figure The carboncarbon distance between inlayer carbon atoms is pm and the bonds have double bond character analogous to aromatic compounds Since the distance between layers is pm and the layers are held together by comparatively weak van der Waals forces they slide when subjected to an applied force This is the origin of the lubricating properties of graphite Various molecules such as alkali metals halogens metal halides and organic compounds intercalate between the layers and form intercalation compounds Graphite has semimetallic electrical conductivity about cm parallel to layers and about times more resistant in the perpendicular direction Figure Structure of graphite Diamond Its structure is called the diamondtype structure Figure A unit cell of diamond contains eight carbon atoms and each carbon atom is coordinate in a regular tetrahedron Diamond is the hardest substance known with a Mohs hardness Diamond has very high heat conductivity although it is an electrical insulator Although previously a precious mineral only formed naturally industrial diamonds are now commercially prepared in large quantities at high temperatures C or higher and under high pressures GPa or more from graphite using metal catalysts In recent years diamond thin films have been made at low temperatures about C and under low pressures about Pa by the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons and are used for coating purposes etc Figure Structure of diamond Fullerene Fullerene is the general name of the rd carbon allotrope of which the soccer ballshaped molecule C is a typical example Figure R E Smalley H W Kroto and others detected C in the mass spectra of the laser heating product of graphite in and fullerenes isolation from this socalled soot was reported in It has the structure of a truncated cornercuticosahedron and there is double bond character between carbon atoms It is soluble in organic solvents with benzene solutions being purple Usually it is isolated and purified by chromatography of fullerene mixtures Wideranging research on chemical reactivities and physical properties such as superconductivity is progressing rapidly Besides C C and carbon nanotubes are attracting interest Figure Structure of C c Silicon Silicon is the most abundant element in the earths crust after oxygen Most of this silicon exists as a component of silicate rocks and the element is not found as a simple substance Therefore silicon is produced by the reduction of quartz and sand with highgrade carbon using electric arc furnaces Highergrade silicon is obtained by hydrogen reduction of SiHCl which is produced by the hydrochlorination of low purity silicon followed by rectification The silicon used for semiconductor devices is further refined by the crystal Czochralski or zone melting methods The crystal mp o C has a metallic luster and the diamond type structure There are three isotopes of silicon Si Si and Si Because of its nuclear spin of I Si is used for NMR studies of organic silicon compounds or silicates solidstate NMR Silicates and organosilicon compounds show a wide range of structures in silicon chemistry Section c describes the properties of silicates Organosilicon chemistry is the most active research area in the inorganic chemistry of main group elements other than carbon Silicon chemistry has progressed remarkably since the development of an industrial process to produce organosilicon compounds by the direct reaction of silicon with methyl chloride CHCl in the presence of a copper catalyst This historical process was discovered by E G Rochow in Silicone resin silicone rubber and silicone oil find wide application In recent years silicon compounds have also been widely used in selective organic syntheses Although silicon is a congener of carbon their chemical properties differ considerably A wellknown example is the contrast of silicon dioxide SiO with its dimensional structure and gaseous carbon dioxide CO The first compound MesSiSiMes Mes is mesityl CHCH with a siliconsilicon double bond was reported in in contrast with the ubiquitous carboncarbon multiple bonds Such compounds are used to stabilize unstable bonds with bulky substituents kinetic stabilization Exercise Why are the properties of CO and SiO different Answer Their properties are very different because CO is a chainlike threeatom molecule and SiO is a solid compound with the three dimensional bridges between silicon and oxygen atoms d Nitrogen Nitrogen is a colorless and odorless gas that occupies of the atmosphere volume ratio It is produced in large quantities together with oxygen bp C by liquefying air bp C and fractionating nitrogen bp C Nitrogen is an inert gas at room temperatures but converted into nitrogen compounds by biological nitrogen fixation and industrial ammonia synthesis The cause of its inertness is the large bond energy of the NN triple bond The two isotopes of nitrogen are N and N Both isotopes are NMRactive nuclides e Phosphorus Simple phosphorus is manufactured by the reduction of calcium phosphate CaPO with quartz rock and coke Allotropes include white phosphorus red phosphorus and black phosphorus White phosphorus is a molecule of composition of P Figure It has a low meltingpoint mp C and is soluble in benzene or carbon disulfide Because it is pyrophoric and deadly poisonous it must be handling carefully Figure Structure of white phosphorus Red phosphorus is amorphous and its structure is unclear The principal component is assumed to be a chain formed by the polymerization of P molecules as the result of the opening of one of the PP bonds It is neither pyrophoric nor poisonous and used in large quantities for the manufacturing of matches etc Black phosphorus is the most stable allotrope and is obtained from white phosphorus under high pressure about GPa It is a solid with a metallic luster and a lamellar structure Although it is a semiconductor under normal pressures it shows metallic conductivity under high pressures GPa Phosphorus compounds as ligands Tertiary phosphines PR and phosphites POR are very important ligands in transition metal complex chemistry Especially triphenylphosphine PCH triethyl phosphine PCH and their derivatives are useful ligands in many complexes because it is possible to control precisely their electronic and steric properties by modifying substituents refer to Section c Although they are basically sigma donors they can exhibit some pi accepting character by changing the substituents into electron accepting Ph phenyl OR Cl F etc The order of the electronaccepting character estimated from the CO stretching vibrations and C NMR chemical shifts of the phosphine or phosphitesubstituted metal carbonyl compounds is as follows Ar is an aryl and R is an alkyl On the other hand C A Tolman has proposed that the angle at the vertex of a cone that surrounds the substituents of a phosphorus ligand at the van der Waals contact distance can be a useful parameter to assess the steric bulkiness of phosphines and phosphites This parameter called the cone angle is widely used Figure When the cone angle is large the coordination number decreases by steric hindrance and the dissociation equilibrium constant and dissociation rate of a phosphorus ligand become large Table The numerical expression of the steric effect is very useful and many studies have been conducted into this effect Figure Cone angle Table Cone angles of tertiary phosphines and phosphites Ligands Cone angles POEt PMe POPh PEt PMePh PPh PiPr PtBu
