Noble Gases and their Compounds Last updated Save as PDF Page ID b noble gas compoundsDiscovery of noble gas Compounds In the th century H Cavendish discovered an inert component in air In a line was discovered in the spectrum of sunlight that could not be identified and it was suggested to be due to a new element helium Based on these facts at the end of the th century W Ramsay isolated He Ne Ar Kr and Xe and by studying their properties demonstrated that they were new elements In spite of the nearly content of argon Ar in air the element had not been isolated until then and noble gases were completely lacking in Mendeleevs periodic table The Nobel prize was awarded to Ramsay in for his achievement Noble gases are located next to the halogen group in the periodic table Since noble gas elements have closedshell electronic configurations they lack reactivity and their compounds were unknown Consequently they were also called inert gases However after the discovery of noble gas compounds it was considered more suitable to call these elements noble gases as is mentioned in the following chapter Although the abundance of helium in the universe is next to that of hydrogen it is very rare on the Earth because it is lighter than air Helium originated from solar nuclear reactions and was locked up in the earths crust It is extracted as a byproduct of natural gas from specific areas especially in North America Since helium has the lowest boiling point K of all the substances it is important for lowtemperature science and superconductivity engineering Moreover its lightness is utilized in airships etc Since argon is separated in large quantities when nitrogen and oxygen are produced from liquid air it is widely used in metallurgy and in industries and laboratories that require an oxygenfree environment b noble gas compounds Xenon Xe reacts with elements with the largest electronegativities such as fluorine oxygen and chlorine and with the compounds containing these elements like platinum fluoride PtF Although the first xenon compound was reported as XePtF the discoverer N Bartlett later corrected that it was not a pure compound but a mixture of XePtFx x If this is mixed with fluorine gas and excited with heat or light fluorides XeF XeF and XeF and are generated XeF has chainlike XeF square XeF distorted octahedral structures Although preparation of these compounds is comparatively simple it is not easy to isolate pure compounds especially XeF Hydrolysis of the fluorides forms oxides XeO is a very explosive compound Although it is stable in aqueous solution these solutions are very oxidizing Tetroxide XeO is the most volatile xenon compound MXeF M is Rb and Cs are very stable and do not decompose even when heated at C Thus xenon forms divalent to octavalent compounds Fluorides can also be used as fluorinating reagents Although it is known that krypton and radon also form compounds the compounds of krypton and radon are rarely studied as both their instability and their radioactivity make their handling problematic Discovery of noble gas Compounds H Bartlett studied the properties of platinum fluoride PtF in the s and synthesized OPtF It was an epochmaking discovery in inorganic chemistry when analogous experiments on xenon which has almost equal ionization energy kJ mol to that of O kJ mol resulted in the dramatic discovery of XePtF noble gas compounds had not been prepared before this report but various attempts were made immediately after the discovery of noble gases W Ramsay isolated noble gases and added a new group to the periodic table at the end of the th century Already in F F H Moisson who is famous for the isolation of F reacted a cm argon offered by Ramsay with fluorine gas under an electric discharge but failed to prepare an argon fluoride At the beginning of this century A von Antoropoff reported the synthesis of a krypton compound KrCl but later he concluded that it was a mistake L Pauling also foresaw the existence of KrF XeF and HXeO and anticipated their synthesis In a post doctoral research fellow A L Kaye in the laboratory of D M L Yost of Caltech where Pauling was a member of faculty attempted to prepare noble gas compounds Despite elaborate preparations and eager experiments attempts to prepare xenon compounds by discharging electricity through a mixed gas of xenon fluorine or chlorine were unsuccessful It is said that Pauling no longer showed interest in noble gas compounds after this failure Although R Hoppe of Germany predicted using theoretical considerations that the existence of XeF and XeF was highly likely in advance of the discovery of Bartlett he prepared these compounds only after knowing of Bartletts discovery Once it is proved that a compound of a certain kind is stable analogous compounds are prepared one after another This has also been common in synthetic chemistry of the later period showing the importance of the first discovery problems Write a
