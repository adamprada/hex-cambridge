Nonoctahedral Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Energies of the dorbitals in nonoctahedral geometries Square planar complexes in catalysis The most important nonoctahedral geometries for transition metal complexes are coordinate square planar and tetrahedral coordinate square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal cisPtNHCl a d square planar complex Crystal field energy diagram showing the transition from octahedral to square planar geometry Energies of the dorbitals in nonoctahedral geometries The figure above shows what happens to the dorbital energy diagram as we progressively distort an octahedral complex by elongating it along the zaxis a tetragonal distortion by removing one of its ligands to make a square pyramid or by removing both of the ligands along the zaxis to make a square planar complex In all cases we keep the total bond order the same by making the bonds in the xy plane shorter as the bonds in the zdirection are stretched andor broken Barnett Rosenberg Michigan State University accidentally discovered the biological effects of square planar cisPtNHCl while researching bacterial growth in electric fields The Pt electrode he used reacted with chloride and ammonium ions in the electrolyte to produce the compound at ppm concentration Further experiments revealed that the cisisomer but not the transisomer is a potent anticancer drug which is especially effective against testicular cancer The drug works by crosslinking guaninecytosine rich regions of DNA thus inhibiting cell division The distortion away from octahedral symmetry breaks the degeneracy of the tg and eg orbitals dorbitals with a zcomponent dxz dyz dz go down in energy as orbitals that reside in the xy plane dxy dxy rise in energy The barycenter the weighted average orbital energy remains constant Also it is important to note that the splitting between the dxy and dxy orbitals stays constant at ΔO regardless of the nature of the distortion Why would a happy octahedral complex want to lose two of its ligands to make a square planar complex This occurs frequently in d and sometimes in d complexes with large ΔO ie d complexes with strong field ligands and d d complexes with any ligands Examples of such d complexes are NiCN the anticancer drug cisplatin cisPtNHCl PdHO and AuCl At the d electron count the lowest four orbitals are filled and the highest orbital the dxy is empty resulting in a large CFSE These complexes are diamagnetic and tend to be quite stable With weak field ligands d complexes are octahedral and paramagnetic eg NiHO which has two unpaired electrons in the eg orbitals Square planar complexes in catalysis Square planar d complexes can be oxidized by two electrons to become octahedral low spin d complexes which also have a large CFSE Because the loss of two electrons is accompanied by the gain of two ligands this process is called oxidative addition The reverse process is called reductive elimination Both processes function together in catalytic cycles such as the hydrogenation of olefins using Wilkinsons catalyst The catalytic cycle is shown below The catalyst cycles between coordinate RhI d and coordinate RhIII d The complex first adds H oxidatively to give a sixcoordinate complex in which the hydrogen is formally H An olefin molecule displaces a solvent molecule using its πelectrons to coordinate the metal The complex rearranges by inserting the olefin into the metalhydrogen bond a process called migratory insertion Finally the complex returns to the square planar geometry by eliminating the hydrogenated olefin reductive elimination Wilkinsons catalyst is highly active and is widely used for homogeneous hydrogenation hydroboration and hydrosilation reactions With chiral phosphine ligands the catalyst can hydrogenate prochiral olefins to give enantiomerically pure products Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson an inorganic chemist at Imperial College London developed Wilkinsons catalyst in Earlier as an Assistant Professor at Harvard University he had elucidated the sandwich structure of ferrocene which had been discovered a few years before but not understood Wilkinson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in for his contributions to organometallic chemistry
