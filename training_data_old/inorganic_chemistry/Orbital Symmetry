Orbital Symmetry Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The MO picture for a molecule gets complicated when many valence AOs are involved We can simplify the problem enormously by noting without proof here that orbitals of different symmetry with respect to the molecule do not interact The symmetry operations of a molecule which can include rotations mirror planes inversion centers etc and the symmetry classes of bonds and orbitals in molecules can be rigorously defined according to group theory Here we will take a simple approach to this problem based on our intuitive understanding of the symmetry of threedimensional objects as illustrated in Fig Figure Example of σ symmetry AOs must have the same nodal symmetry as defined by the molecular symmetry operations or their overlap is zero For example in the HCl molecule there is a unique symmetry axis which is typically defined as the Cartesian zaxis as shown in Fig Figure Orbitals of σ and π symmetry do not interact We can see from this figure that the H s orbital is unchanged by a rotation about the bond axis However the same rotation inverts the sign of the Cl pywavefunction Because these two orbitals have different symmetries the Cl py orbital is nonbonding and doesnt interact with the H s The same is true of the Cl pxorbital The px and py orbitals have π symmetry nodal plane containing the bonding axis and are labeled πnb in the MO energy level diagram Fig In contrast the H s and Cl pz orbitals both have σ symmetry which is also the symmetry of the clay pot shown in Fig Because these orbitals have the same symmetry in the point group of the molecule they can make the bonding and antibonding combinations shown in Fig The MO diagram of HCl that includes all the valence orbitals of the Cl atom is shown in Fig Two of the Cl valence orbitals px and py have the wrong symmetry to interact with the H s orbital The Cl s orbital has the same σ symmetry as H s but it is much lower in energy so there is little orbital interaction The energy of the Cl s orbital is thus affected only slightly by forming the molecule The pairs of electrons in the πnb and σnb orbitals are therefore nonbonding Figure Energy level diagram of the HCl molecule showing MOs derived from the valence AOs Note that the MO result in Fig bond and three pairs of nonbonding electrons is the same as we would get from valence bond theory for HCl The nonbonding orbitals are localized on the Cl atom just as we would surmise from the valence bond picture In order to differentiate it from the σ bonding orbital the σ antibonding orbital which is empty in this case is designated with an asterisk
