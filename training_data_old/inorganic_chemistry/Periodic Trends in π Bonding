Periodic Trends in π Bonding Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers As we noted in Section pπbonding almost always involves a secondrow element We encounter πbonding from the sideways overlap of porbitals in the MO diagrams of secondrow diatomics BO It is important to remember that πbonds are weaker than σ bonds made from the same AOs and are especially weak if they involve elements beyond the second row Example Ethylene Stable molecule doesnt polymerize without a catalyst Silylene Never isolated spontaneously polymerizes Calculations indicate kJmol stability in the gas phase relative to singlybonded triplet HSiSiH The large Ne core of Si atoms inhibits sideways overlap of p orbitals weak πbond Other examples P vs N P cannot make πbonds with itself so it forms a tetrahedral molecule with substantial ring strain This allotrope of P undergoes spontaneous combustion in air Solid white phosphorus very slowly converts to red phosphorus a more stable allotrope that contains sheets of pyramidal P atoms each with bonds to three neighboring atoms and one lone pair White phosphorus P is a soft waxy solid that ignites spontaneously in air burning with a bright flame and generating copious white PO smoke The sample shown here is photographed under water to prevent the oxidation reaction N can make πbonds so N has a very strong triple bond and is a relatively inert diatomic gas CHSiO vs CHCO RTV silicone polymer single bonds to Si vs acetone CO double bond Silicones are soft flexible polymers that can be heated to high temperatures C without decomposing Acetone is a flammable molecular liquid that boils at C Silicone polymers RSiOn are used in nonstick cookware like these muffin cups in Silly Putty soft robotics and many other applications Exceptions nd row elements can form reasonably strong πbonds with the smallest of the rd row elements P S and Cl Thus we find SN bonds in sulfurnitrogen compounds such as SN and SN PO bonds in phosphoric acid and PO shown above and a delocalized πmolecular orbital in SO as in ozone
