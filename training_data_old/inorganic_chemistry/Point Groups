Point Groups Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionEach point group is associated with a specific combination of symmetry elementsHow to determine a molecules point groupReferencesOutside LinksProblemsContributors Point groups are used to describe molecular symmetries and are a condensed representation of the symmetry elements a molecule may posses This includes both bond and orbital symmetry Knowing molecular symmetry allows for a greater understanding of molecular structure and can help to predict many molecular properties Introduction Point groups are a quick and easy way to gain knowledge of a molecule They not only contain a molecules symmetry elements but also give rise to a character table which is a complete set of irreducible representations for a point group A molecules point group can be determined by either elucidating each symmetry element contained in a molecule or by properly using the Schreiber chart see below Point groups usually consist of but are not limited to the following elements E The identity operator This operation leaves a molecule completely unchanged and exists for mathematical purposes Cn The Cn proper axis of rotation is a n rotation that when performed leaves a molecule the same A proper rotation with the highest value of n is known as the major axis of rotation σ The mirror plane The mirror plane can be described as a plane which produces a reflection of part of a molecule that is unnoticeable and can be labeled as either σh σv σd i The inversion center A molecule has a center of inversion if when inverted the molecule is unchanged See the section on symmetry elements for a more thorough explanation of each Each point group is associated with a specific combination of symmetry elements Each point group has its own combination of symmetry elements Listed below are some of the many point groups and their respective symmetry elements according to category followed by a representative example Non axial groups C E C E i Cn groups C E C notice the major axis of rotation is the point group C E C C HO C Dn groups D E Cz Cy Cx D E C C Cnv groups Cv E C σvxz σvyz Cv E C σv HO Cv Cnh groups Ch E C i σh Ch E C C σh S S BOH Dnh groups Dh E CH Dh How to determine a molecules point group A molecules point group can be determined by calculating all the symmetry elements of a molecule and matching them to a respective point group This process however is greatly simplified when the Schreiber chart is used References Housecroft Catherine E Sharpe Alan G Inorganic Chemistry rd Ed Pearson Education Limited Chapter Koster George F Wheeler Robert G Dimmock John O The Properties of ThirtyTwo Point Groups The MIT Press Bertolucci Michael D Harris Daniel C Symmetry and Spectroscopy An Introduction to Vibrational and Electronic Spectroscopy Dover Publications Outside Links Point groups in D Problems Determine the point group of BH by calculating all its symmetry elements then use the chart and determine which method is faster Determine the point groups of BH and NH Why is there a difference What is the point group of PPh Determine the point groups of CO and HO and then compare them Propose a molecule with no symmetry What is its point group Contributors
