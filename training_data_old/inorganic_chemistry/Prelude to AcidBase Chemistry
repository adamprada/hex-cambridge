Prelude to AcidBase Chemistry Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Acids and bases are important for a number reasons in inorganic chemistry Many industrially useful catalytic reactions involve inorganic acids and superacids such as zeolites anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and sulfated zirconia These acids are sufficiently strong in anhydrous media that they can protonate olefins and alcohols to produce carbocations Carbocations are key intermediates in the transformations of hydrocarbons Inorganic compounds are sometimes synthesized in strongly acidic or basic media For example ternary metal oxides can be synthesized and crystallized in molten NaOH or KOH which are strongly basic Organic fluorination reactions are often done in strongly acidic media such as anhydrous HF Understanding the familiar chemistry of acids and bases in water helps us understand how these nonaqueous media work The acidic or basic environment of metal ions affects the stability of their oxidation states We will learn more about this in Chapter Transition metal complexes coordination compounds and organometallic compounds are essentially Lewis acidbase complexes We can understand a great deal about their stability and reactivity by considering the acidbase character of metals and ligands We will learn about this in Chapter Solid acid catalysts such as zeolite Y are used to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil into gasoline Edith Flanigenbelow with President Barack Obama received the National Medal of Technology for her research on the synthesis of zeolite Y
