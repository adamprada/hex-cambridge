Prelude to Coordination Chemistry and Crystal Field Theory Last updated Save as PDF Page ID History Coordination compounds or complexes are molecules and extended solids that contain bonds between a transition metal ion and one or more ligands In forming these coordinate covalent bonds the metal ions act as Lewis acids and the ligands act as Lewis bases Typically the ligand has a lone pair of electrons and the bond is formed by overlap of the molecular orbital containing this electron pair with the dorbitals of the metal ion Ligands that are commonly found in coordination complexes are neutral molecules HO NH organic bases such as pyridine CO NO H ethylene and phosphines PR and anions halides CN SCN cyclopentadienide CH H etc The resulting complexes can be cationic eg CuNH neutral PtNHCl or anionic FeCN As we will see below ligands that have weak or negligible strength as Br√∏nsted bases for example CO CN HO and Cl can still be potent Lewis bases in forming transition metal complexes With ligands that are Lewis bases coordinate covalent bonds also called dative bonds are typically drawn as lines or sometimes as arrows to indicate that the electron pair belongs to the ligand X In counting electrons on the metal described below the convention is to assign both electrons in the dative bond to the ligand although in reality the bonds are typically polar covalent and electrons are shared between the metal and the ligand ZnOBDC also called MOF is a metalorganic framework in which benzenedicarboxylate BDC anions bridge between cationic ZnO clusters The rigid framework contains large voids represented by orange spheres MOFs can be made from many different transition metal ions and bridging ligands and are being developed for practical applications in storing gases especially H and CO MOF has a volumetric storage density of g HL close to that of liquid H When writing out the formulas of coordination compounds we use square brackets around the metal ions and ligands that are directly bonded to each other Thus the compound CoNHClCl contains octahedral CoNHCl ions in which five ammonia molecules and one chloride ion are directly bonded to the metal and two Cl anions that are not coordinated to the metal History Coordination compounds have been known for centuries but their structures were initially not understood For example Prussian Blue which has an empirical formula FeCNxHO is an insoluble deep blue solid that has been used as a pigment since its accidental discovery by Diesbach in Prussian Blue actually contains Fe cations and FeCN anions and a more descriptive formulation is FeFeCNxHO Simpler compounds such as the ammonia complex of Co were known to chemists but did not fit the expected behavior of ionic solids For example cobaltIIIhexammine chloride CoNHCl was formulated as CoClNH It had mysterious properties in that it dissolved in water like an ionic solid but it retained its six ammonia molecules when recrystallized Even more intriguing was the observation that chemically different forms isomers of transition metal complexes such as CoNHClCl could be made The puzzle was solved by Alfred Werner who proposed in that these Co complexes contained octahedrally coordinated metal ions that made primary covalent bonds to six ligands Werner showed through conductivity measurements that solutions of CoClNH contained three free Cl anions and one CoNH cation per formula unit Magnetic susceptibility measurements later confirmed the presence of diamagnetic Co in both the salt and its solutions Werners theory also explained the existence of two and only two structural isomers for CoNHCl cisCoNH Cl transCoNH Cl Like organic compounds transition metal complexes can vary widely in size shape charge and stability We will see that bonds formed from the dorbitals of the metal largely control these properties Alfred Werner was a Swiss chemist who received the Nobel prize in for elucidating the bonding in coordination compounds
