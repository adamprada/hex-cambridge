ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA at neutral pH the concentration of Feaq ions is on the order of M However in a solution of ethylenediamine and acetic acid at comparable concentration the Feaq concentration is about ie times higher Explain The complex TiHO is violet while the analogous complex with another monodentate neutral ligand L TiL is orange How many of the following statements are true Explain briefly a L is a stronger field ligand than HO b TiL is a highspin complex c TiL absorbs yellow and red light d Both complexes have two d electrons associated with the metal OH and CN are both Brønsted bases and both can form complexes with metal ions Explain how OH can be a much stronger Brønsted base than CN and at the same time much lower in the spectrochemical series A solution of NiHO is faint green and paramagnetic µ BM whereas a solution of NiCN is yellow and diamagnetic a Draw the molecular geometry and the dorbital energy level diagrams for each complex showing the electronic occupancy of the dorbitals b Explain the differences in magnetism and color W Deng and K W Hipps J Phys Chem B reported an STM study of the electronic properties of NiIItetraphenyl porphyrin NiTPP a redpurple neutral diamagnetic complex that is made by reacting NiII perchlorate with tetraphenylporphine When NiTPP is reacted with sodium thiocyanate it forms another complex that is paramagnetic Draw the structures of NiTPP and the product complex and the crystal field energy level diagram that explains each What value of the magnetic moment in units of μB would you expect for the paramagnetic complex One of the simplest reactions a coordination complex can do is ligand exchange For example metal aquo complexes can exchange a coordinated water molecule with a free solvent water molecule and the rate of the reaction can be measured by isotope labeling NMR and other techniques Interestingly these rates vary widely for water exchange with different metal ions over a range of orders of magnitude as shown in the figure below For some metal ions the rate is so slow that it takes weeks for one water molecule to exchange for another In other cases the timescale of the exchange is nanoseconds a There is an overall trend in which the rate of exchange decreases as the oxidation state of the metal increases Explain this trend in terms of crystal field stabilization energy CFSE How is the CFSE related to the activation energy of the water exchange reaction b Explain any trends you observe for the rate of water exchange among divalent metal ions c Cu has an anomalously fast ligand exchange rate Why d What are the geometries and delectron counts of the aquo complexes of the slowest divalent trivalent and tetravalent metal ions in the figure Do they have particularly high or low CFSEs Explain Ligand exchange rates for main group ions increase going down a group eg Al Ga In For transition metal ions we see the opposite trend eg Fe Ru Os Explain why these trends are different Seppelt and coworkers reported the very unusual ion AuXe in the salt AuXe SbF Science This was the first report of a compound containing a bond between a metal and a noble gas atom Draw a dorbital energy diagram for this ion and predict whether it should be diamagnetic or paramagnetic Would you expect to be able to form a similar complex using Cu in place of Au or Kr in place of Xe Why or why not For the reaction cisMoCOL CO MoCOL L the reaction rate is found to vary by a factor of for two different ligands L but it is relatively insensitive to the pressure of CO gas a What kind of mechanism does this reaction have b What are the signs of the activation volume and the activation entropy In Rosenbergs initial discovery of the biological effects of cisPtNHCl the compound was made accidentally by partial dissolution of a Pt anode in an electrolyte solution that contained glucose and magnesium chloride The electrolysis reaction also produced small amounts of ammonium ions Explain mechanistically why the cisisomer is formed selectively under these conditions
