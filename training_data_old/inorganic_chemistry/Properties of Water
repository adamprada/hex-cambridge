Properties of Water Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Water covers of the Earths surface and is vital for all known forms of life On Earth of the planets water is found in seas and oceans in groundwater in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland a small fraction in other large water bodies and in the air as vapour clouds formed from solid and liquid water particles suspended in air and precipitation Only of the Earths water is freshwater and of that water is in ice and groundwater Less than of all freshwater is in rivers lakes and the atmosphere and an even smaller amount of the Earths freshwater is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products The major chemical and physical properties of water are Water is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure It is tasteless and odourless The intrinsic colour of water and ice is a very slight blue hue although both appear colourless in small quantities Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas Water is the only substance occurring naturally in all three phases as solid liquid and gas on the Earths surface Water is transparent in the visible electromagnetic spectrum Thus aquatic plants can live in water because sunlight can reach them Infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrogenoxygen or OH bonds Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge whereas the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges As a result water is a polar molecule with an electrical dipole moment Water can form an unusually large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds four for a molecule of its size These factors lead to strong attractive forces between molecules of water giving rise to waters high surface tension and capillary forces The capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity This property is relied upon by all vascular plants such as trees The boiling point of water like all other liquids is dependent on the barometric pressure For example on the top of Mount Everest water boils at C compared to C at sea level at a similar latitude since latitude modifies atmospheric pressure slightly Conversely water deep in the ocean near geothermal vents can reach temperatures of hundreds of degrees and remain liquid Water has a high specific heat capacity J kg K as well as a high heat of vaporization kJ mol both result from the extensive hydrogen bonding between its molecules These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earths climate by buffering large fluctuations in temperature Solid ice has a density of kg m The maximum density of liquid water occurs at C where it is kg m Elements that are more electropositive than hydrogen such as lithium sodium calcium potassium and caesium displace hydrogen from water forming hydroxides Since hydrogen is a flammable gas when given off it is dangerous and the reaction of water with the more electropositive of these elements can be violently explosive so they are often stored in oil Most known pure substances display simple behaviour when they are cooled they shrink Liquids contract as they are cooled because the molecules move slower and they are less able to overcome the attractive intermolecular forces drawing them closer to each other Once the freezing temperature is reached the substances solidify causing them to contract even more because crystalline solids are usually tightly packed Water however water has the anomalous property of becoming less dense when it is cooled to its solid form ice When liquid water is cooled it initially contracts as expected until a temperature of C is reached C After that it expands slightly until it reaches the freezing point and then when it freezes it expands by approximately Just above the freezing point the water molecules begin to locally arrange into icelike structures with an extended hydrogen bonded network This creates some openness in the liquid water accounting for the decrease in its density This is in opposition to the usual tendency for cooling to increase the density At C these opposing tendencies cancel out producing the density maximum Since water expands to occupy a greater volume in the form of ice and is less dense it floats on liquid water as in icebergs Fortunately this happens since in colder climates where water is susceptible to freezing if it all turned solid during the winter it would kill all the life within it The extended structure of the water molecule in liquid and solid form seen in the models below provides the explanation for the variation of density with temperature Topic hierarchy
