Resonance Energy of Metals Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The solution to the problem above must consider the quantum mechanical nature of the electron The valence electrons in Na metal are in orbitals that are delocalized over the entire crystal However in the Na e salt form the electrons are localized on specific anion sites This localization imparts an additional kinetic energy via the particle in a box effect that adds to the total energy From the quantum mechanical result for a particle in a onedimensional box we obtain where h Planks constant x J s n energy level assumed to be the lowest n m electron mass x kg L size of the box If we approximate the size of the electron box as Å x m we obtain This extra kinetic energy makes the Nae salt unstable relative to the electrondelocalized metal Sodium owes its metallic properties to the resonance stabilization of its delocalized valence electrons The calculation is not very accurate because the electron kinetic energy is not zero in the metal and because the box size is not so well defined However it does illustrate that electron delocalization has a substantial effect in thermodynamically stabilizing metals The situation is entirely analogous to the stabilization of aromatic molecules by electron delocalization In molecules like benzene resonance is also a quantummechanical kinetic energy effect In general the resonance stabilization energy is significantly larger in metals than it is in πdelocalized organic molecules For example the resonance energy of the six πelectrons in benzene is approximately kJmol less than half of the value we have calculated per electron in sodium metal Interestingly several of the alkali metals and other metallic elements transform at ultrahigh pressures to optically transparent insulating phases in which the valence electrons are localized These high pressure electride phases defy the general rule which we will encounter in Chapter that insulators transform to metals at sufficiently high density They illustrate how the stable structure of an element can depend on the tradeoff between the lattice energy of an ionic electride structure and the resonance energy of an electrondelocalized metal Crystal structure of CaN with D electron layers shown schematically in blue In addition to the saltlike electrides that are formed by complexing alkali metals with crown ether ligands there are a number of recently discovered solid state nitrides and oxides such as CaN and CaAlO that are more properly formulated as electrides ie as CaNe and CaAlOe In these compounds the Ca Al O and N atoms have their ordinary octet oxidation states and respectively and electrons act as anions filling in cagelike voids or layers in the crystal For example CaN adopts the antiCdCl structure as shown at the right with void spaces between layers that are occupied by a D gas of electrons Like other layered materials CaN can be easily delaminated into thin nanosheets while retaining its structure and properties as an electride These compounds are powerful reducing agents and also have interesting activity as catalysts
