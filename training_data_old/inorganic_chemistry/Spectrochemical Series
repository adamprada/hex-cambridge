Spectrochemical Series Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Orbital overlapEnergy unitsImportant trends in ΔOColors of transition metal complexes Strong and weak field ligands The spectrochemical series ranks ligands according the energy difference ΔO between the tg and eg orbitals in their octahedral complexes This energy difference is measured in the spectral transition between these levels which often lies in the visible part of the spectrum and is responsible for the colors of complexes with partially filled dorbitals Ligands that produce a large splitting are called strong field ligands and those that produce a small splitting are called weak field ligands An abbreviated spectrochemical series is Weak field I Br Cl NO F OH HO Pyridine NH NO CN CO Strong field Orbital overlap Referring to the molecular orbital diagram above we see that the splitting between delectron levels reflects the antibonding interaction between the eg metal orbitals and the ligands Thus we expect ligand field strength to correlate with metalligand orbital overlap Ligands that bind through very electronegative atoms such as O and halogens are thus expected to be weak field and ligands that bind through C or P are typically strong field Ligands that bind through N are intermediate in strength Another way to put this is that hard bases tend to be weak field ligands and soft bases are strong field ligands Water is a weak field ligand The electronegative O atom is strongly electronwithdrawing so there is poor orbital overlap between the electron pair on O and a metal dorbital The more electropositive C atom in the strong field ligand CN allows better orbital overlap and sharing of the electron pair Note that CN typically coordinates metal ions through the C atom rather than the N atom Cobalt II complexes have different colors depending on the nature of the ligand In crystals of the red compound cobaltII nitrate dihydrate each cobalt ion is coordinated by six water molecules The CoHO cations and NO anions crystallize to make a salt When the complex is dissolved in water CoII retains its coordination shell of six water molecules and the solution has the same red color as the crystal Energy units Energy can be calculated in a number of ways and it is useful to try to relate the splitting energy ΔO to more familiar quantities like bond energies Here ν is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation h is Plancks constant x Js and c is the speed of light is called the wavenumber and is the inverse of the wavelength usually measured in cm Energy gaps are often expressed by spectroscopists in terms of wavenumbers For example a red photon has a wavelength of about nm and a wavenumber of about cm In other energy units the same red photon has an energy of eV eV nm or kJmol eV kJmol If we compare this to the dissociation energy of a carboncarbon single bond kJmol we see that the CC bond has about twice the energy of a red photon We would need an ultraviolet photon E kJmol eV nm cm to break a CC bond We will see that ΔO varies widely for transition metal complexes from nearinfrared to ultraviolet wavelengths Thus the energy difference between the tg and eg orbitals can range between the energy of a rather weak to a rather strong covalent bond ΔO depends on both the metal and the ligand We can learn something about trends in ΔO by comparing a series of d metal complexes Complex ΔO cm CoHO CoHO CoCN RhHO RhCN Important trends in ΔO Co complexes have larger ΔO than Co complexes with the same ligand This reflects the electrostatic nature of the crystal field splitting Rh complexes have larger ΔO than Co complexes In general elements in the nd and rd transition series the d and d elements have larger splitting than those in the d series For a given metal in one oxidation state eg Co the trend in ΔO follows the spectrochemical series Thus ΔO is larger for CoCN which contains the strong field CN ligand than it is for CoHO with the weak field ligand HO The d and d elements are similar in their size and their chemistry In comparing ΔO values for complexes in the d d and d series eg comparing elements in the triads CoRhIr or FeRuOs we always find d d d This trend reflects the spatial extent of the dorbitals and thus their overlap with ligand orbitals The d orbitals are smaller and they are less effective in bonding than the d or d The d and d orbitals are similar to each other because of the lanthanide contraction At the beginning of the d series between Ba and Hf are the fourteen lanthanide elements La Lu Although the valence orbitals of the d elements are in a higher principal quantum shell than those of the d elements the addition of protons to the nucleus in crossing the lanthanide series contracts the sizes of the atomic orbitals The important result is that the valence orbitals of the d and d elements have similar sizes and thus the elements resemble each other in their chemistry much more than they resemble their cousins in the d series For example the chemistry of Ru is very similar to that of Os as illustrated below but quite different from that of Fe Both Os and Ru form volatile molecular tetroxides MO OsO is used in epoxidation reactions and as a stain in electron microscopy In contrast the highest binary oxide of iron is FeO Colors of transition metal complexes A simple qualitative way to see the relative crystal field splitting energy ΔO is to observe the color of a transition metal complex The higher the energy of the absorbed photon the larger the energy gap However the color a complex absorbs is complementary to the color it appears ie the color of light it reflects which is opposite the absorbed color on the color wheel Complementary colors are across the color wheel from each other Examples all d Co complexes CoHO looks purple in its salts and in concentrated solution because it absorbs in the green range CoNH is strawcolored because it absorbs in the blue range CoCN looks red absorbs in the violet and ultraviolet part of the spectrum This is consistent with the idea that CN is a stronger field ligand than NH because the energy of a UV photon is higher than that of a redorange photon This method is applicable to most transition metal complexes as the majority of them absorb somewhere in the visible range nm to cm or have UV transitions that tail into the visible making them appear yellow however there are complexes such as RhCN that appear colorless because their dd transitions are in the ultraviolet Other complexes such as MnHO are weakly colored because their dd transitions involve a change in the spin state of the complex
