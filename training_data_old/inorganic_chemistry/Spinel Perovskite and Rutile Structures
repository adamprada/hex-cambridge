Spinel Perovskite and Rutile Structures Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Normal vs inverse spinel structureMagnetism of ferrite spinelsFerroelectric perovskites There are three more structures which are derived from closepacked lattices that are particularly important because of the material properties of their compounds These are the spinel structure on which ferrites and other magnetic oxides are based the perovskite structure which is adopted by ferroelectric and superconducting oxides and the rutile structure which is a common binary structure adopted by oxides and fluorides The spinel structure is formulated MMX where M and M are tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated cations respectively and X is an anion typically O or F The structure is named after the mineral MgAlO and oxide spinels have the general formula ABO In the normal spinel structure there is a closepacked array of anions The Asite cations fill of the tetrahedral holes and the Bsite cations fill of the octahedral holes A polyhedral view of the normal spinel unit cell is shown at the left and a simplified view with the contents of the back half of the cell removed for clarity is shown above Each unit cell contains eight formula units and has a composition ABO Inverse spinels have a closely related structure with the same large unit cell in which the Asite ions and half of the Bsite ions switch places Inverse spinels are thus formulated BABO where the AB ions in parentheses occupy octahedral sites and the other B ions are on tetrahedral sites There are also mixed spinels which are intermediate between the normal and inverse spinel structure Some spinel and inverse spinel AB combinations are AB eg MgAlO normal spinel AB eg PbO PbIIPbIIPbIVO inverse spinel AB eg NaWO normal spinel Many magnetic oxides such as FeO and CoFeO are spinels Normal vs inverse spinel structure For transition metal oxide spinels the choice of the normal vs inverse spinel structure is driven primarily by the crystal field stabilization energy CFSE of ions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites For spinels that contain d elements such as Cr Mn Fe Co and Ni the electron configuration is typically high spin because O is a weak field ligand As an example we can consider magnetite FeO This compound contains one Fe and two Fe ions per formula unit so we could formulate it as a normal spinel FeFeO or as an inverse spinel FeFeFeO Which one would have the lowest energy dorbital energy diagram for Fe First we consider the crystal field energy of the Fe ion which is d Comparing the tetrahedral and high spin octahedral diagrams we find that the CFSE in an octahedral field of O ions is In the tetrahedral field the CFSE is Since Δo is about times larger than Δt the octahedral arrangement has a larger CFSE and is preferred for Fe dorbital energy diagram for Fe In contrast it is easy to show that Fe which is d would have a CFSE of zero in either the octahedral or tetrahedral geometry This means that Fe has a preference for the octahedral site but Fe has no preference Consequently we place Fe on octahedral sites and FeO is an inverse spinel FeFeFeO Ferrites are compounds of general formula MIIFeO We can see that magnetite is one example of a ferrite with M Fe Other divalent metals M Mg Mn Co Ni Zn also form ferrites Ferrites can be normal or inverse spinels or mixed spinels depending on the CFSE of the MII ion Based on their CFSE Fe Co and Ni all have a strong preference for the octahedral site so those compounds are all inverse spinels ZnFeO is a normal spinel because the small Zn ion d fits more easily into the tetrahedral site than Fe d and both ions have zero CFSE MgFeO and MnFeO in which all ions have zero CFSE and no site preference are mixed spinels Chromite spinels MIICrO are always normal spinels because the d Cr ion has a strong preference for the octahedral site Examples of normal and inverse spinel structures MgAlO is a normal spinel since both Mg and Al are nontransition metal ions and thus CFSE The more highly charged Al ion prefers the octahedral site where it is surrounded by six negatively charged oxygen atoms MnO is a normal spinel since the Mn ion is a high spin d system with zero CFSE The two Mn ions are high spin d with higher CFSE on the octahedral sites ΔO than on the tetrahedral site Δt ΔO FeO is an inverse spinel since the Fe ion is a high spin d system with zero CFSE Fe is a high spin d system with more CFSE on an octahedral site than on a tetrahedral one NiFeO is again an inverse spinel since Ni a d ion prefers the octahedral site and the CFSE of Fe a d ion is zero FeCrO is a normal spinel since Fe is high spin d ion with on an octahedral site and Cr is a d ion with CFSE ΔO ΔO Hence it is more energetically favorable for Cr to occupy both of the octahedral sites CoO is a normal spinel Even in the presence of weak field oxo ligands Co is a low spin d ion with very high CFSE on the octahedral sites because of the high charge and small size of the Co ion Hence the Co ions occupy both octahedral sites and Co occupies the tetrahedral site Magnetism of ferrite spinels Ferrite spinels are of technological interest because of their magnetic ordering which can be ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the structure normal or inverse and the nature of the metal ions FeO CoFeO and NiFeO are all inverse spinels and are ferrimagnets The latter two compounds are used in magnetic recording media and as deflection magnets respectively Illustration of antiferromagnetic superexchange between two transition metal cations through a shared oxygen atom In order to understand the magnetism of ferrites we need to think about how the unpaired spins of metal ions are coupled in oxides If an oxide ion is shared by two metal ions it can mediate the coupling of spins by superexchange as shown at the right The coupling can be antiferromagnetic as shown or ferromagnetic depending on the orbital filling and the symmetry of the orbitals involved The GoodenoughKanamori rules predict the local magnetic ordering ferromagnetic vs antiferromagnetic that results from superexchange coupling of the electron spins of transition metal ions For ferrites the strongest coupling is between ions on neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral sites and the ordering of spins between these two sites is reliably antiferromagnetic Because all the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in a spinel or inverse spinel crystal are coupled together identically it works out that ions on the tetrahedral sites will all have one orientation eg spin down and ions on all the octahedral sites will have the opposite orientation eg spin up If the number of spins on the two sites is the same then the solid will be antiferromagnetic However if the number of spins is unequal as in the case of FeO CoFeO and NiFeO then the solid will be ferrimagnetic This is illustrated above for FeO The spins on the Fe sites cancel because half of them are up and half are down However the four unpaired electrons on the Fe ions are all aligned the same way in the crystal so the compound is ferrimagnetic Perovskites are ternary oxides of general formula ABO More generally the perovskite formula is ABX where the anion X can be O N or halogen The A ions are typically large ions such as Sr Ba Rb or a lanthanide ion and the B ions are smaller transition metal ions such as Ti Nb Ru etc The mineral after which the structure is named has the formula CaTiO The perovskite structure has simple cubic symmetry but is related to the fcc lattice in the sense that the A site cations and the three O atoms comprise a fcc lattice The Bsite cations fill of the octahedral holes and are surrounded by six oxide anions ABX perovskite structure A B and X are white blue and red respectively The coordination of the A ions in perovsite and the arrangement of BO octahedra is best understood by looking at the ReO structure which is the same structure but with the Asite cations removed In the polyhedral representation of the structure shown at the right it can be seen that the octahedra share all their vertices but do not share any octahedral edges This makes the ReO and perovskite structures flexible like threedimensional wine racks in that the octahedra can rotate and tilt cooperatively Eight such octahedra surround a large cuboctahedral cavity which is the site of the A ions in the perovskite structure Cations in these sites are coordinated by oxide ions as expected from the relationship between the perovskite and fcc lattices Polyhedral representation of the ReO structure showing the large cuboctahedral cavity that is surrounded by oxygen atoms Because the Asite is empty in the ReO structure compounds with that structure can be reversibly intercalated by small ions such as Li or H which then occupy sites in the cuboctahedral cavity For example smart windows that darken in bright sunlight contain the electrochromic material WO which has the ReO structure In the sunlight a photovoltaic cell drives the reductive intercalation of WO according to the reaction WO is a light yellow compound containing d WVI In contrast HxWO which is mixedvalent WVWVI dd has a deep blue color Such coloration is typical of mixedvalence transition metal complexes because their delectrons can be excited to delocalized conduction band levels by red light Because the electrochemical intercalationdeintercalation process is powered by a solar cell the tint of the windows can adjust automatically to the level of sunlight Ferroelectric perovskites The flexibility of the network of cornersharing BO octahedra is also very important in ferroelectric oxides that have the perovskite structure In some perovsites with small Bsite cations such as Ti and Nb the cation is too small to fit symmetrically in the BO octahedron The octahedron distorts allowing the cation to move offcenter These distortions can be tetragonal as in the example shown at the right rhombohedral or orthorhombic depending on whether the cation moves towards a vertex face or edge of the BO octahedron Moving the cation offcenter in the octahedron creates an electric dipole In ferroelectrics these dipoles align in neighboring unit cells through cooperative rotation and tilting of octahedra The crystal thus acquires a net electrical polarization Tetragonal distortion of the perovskite unit cell in the ferroelectric oxide PZT PbTixZrx Ferroelectricity behaves analogously to ferromagnetism except that the polarization is electrical rather than magnetic In both cases there is a critical temperature Tc above which the spontaneous polarization of the crystal disappears Below Tc the electric polarization of a ferroelectric can be switched with a coercive field and hysteresis loop of polarization vs field resembles that of a ferromagnet Above Tc the crystal is paraelectric and has a high dielectric permittivity Ferroelectric and paraelectric oxides along with piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics have a wide variety of applications as switches actuators transducers and dielectrics for capacitors Ferroelectric capacitors are important in memory devices FRAM and in the tuning circuits of cellular telephones Multiferroics which are materials that are simultaneously ferroelectric and ferromagnetic are rare and are being now intensively researched because of their potential applications in electrically adressable magnetic memory Halide perovskites ABX X Cl Br I can be made by combining salts of monovalent A ions A Cs NH RNH and divalent metal salts such as PbCl or PbI These compounds have sparked recent interest as light absorbers for thin film solar cells that produce electricity from sunlight Lead and tin halide perovskites can be grown as thin films from solution precursors or by thermal evaporation at relatively low temperatures In some lead halide perovskites the mobility of electrons and holes is very high comparable to that of more expensive IIIV semiconductors such as GaAs which must be grown as very pure single crystals at high temperatures for use in solar cells Because of their high carrier mobility some lead halide perovskites are also electroluminescent and are of interest as inexpensive materials for lightemitting diodes LEDs Tin and lead halide perovskites were first studied in the s as materials for thin film electronics and more recently as light absorbers in dyesensitized solar cells Soon after the results on dyesensitized perovskite cells were reported it was discovered that halide perovskites could also be used in thin film solid state solar cells The structures of these solar cells are shown schematically at the right The highest reported solar power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have jumped from in to in and a certified in The highest performing cells to date contain divalent lead in the perovskite B cation site and a mixture of methylammonium and formamidinium ions in the perovskite A cation site a Solar cell architecture in which a lead halide perovskite absorber coats a layer of

d in the thinfilm architecture Despite their very impressive efficiency perovskite solar cells are stable for relatively short periods of time and are sensitive to air and moisture Current research is focused on understanding the degradation mechanisms of these solar cells and improving their stability under operating conditions The rutile structure is an important MX X O F structure It is a structure in which the cations are octahedrally coordinated by anions and as such is intermediate in polarity between the CaF and SiO structures The mineral rutile is one of the polymorphs of TiO the others anatase and brookite also being structures The rutile structure can be described as a distorted version of the NiAs structure with half the cations removed Recall that compounds with the NiAs structure were typically metallic because the metal ions are eclipsed along the stacking axis and thus are in relatively close contact In rutile the MO octahedra share edges along the tetragonal caxis and so some rutile oxides such as NbO RuO and IrO are also metallic because of dorbital overlap along that axis These compounds are important as electrolyzer catalysts and catalyst supports because they combine high catalytic activity with good electronic conductivity View down the tetragonal caxis of the rutile lattice showing edgesharing MO octahedra Rutile TiO because of its high refractive index is the base pigment for white paint It is a wide bandgap semiconductor that has also been extensively researched as an electrode for water splitting solar cells and as a photocatalyst primarily as the anatase polymorph for degradation of pollutants in air and water Selfcleaning glass exploits the photocatalytic properties of a thin film of TiO to remove oily substances from the glass surface and improve the wetting properties of the glass
