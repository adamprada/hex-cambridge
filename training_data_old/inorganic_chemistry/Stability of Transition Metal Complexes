Stability of Transition Metal Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Hardsoft interactions The crystal field stabilization energy CFSE is an important factor in the stability of transition metal complexes Complexes with high CFSE tend to be thermodynamically stable ie they have high values of Ka the equilibrium constant for metalligand association and are also kinetically inert They are kinetically inert because ligand substitution requires that they dissociate lose a ligand associate gain a ligand or interchange gain and lose ligands at the same time in the transition state These distortions in coordination geometry lead to a large activation energy if the CFSE is large even if the product of the ligand exchange reaction is also a stable complex For this reason complexes of Pt Ir both low spin d and Pt square planar d have very slow ligand exchange rates There are two other important factors that contribute to complex stability Hardsoft interactions of metals and ligands which relate to the energy of complex formation The chelate effect which is an entropic contributor to complex stability Hardsoft interactions Hard acids are typically small high charge density cations that are weakly polarizable such as H Li Na Be Mg Al Ti and Cr Electropositive metals in high oxidation states are typically hard acids These elements are predominantly found in oxide minerals because O is a hard base Some hard bases include HO OH O F NO Cl and NH The hard acidbase interaction is primarily electrostatic Complexes of hard acids with hard bases are stable because of the electrostatic component of the CFSE Soft acids are large polarizable electronegative metal ions in low oxidation states such as Ni Hg Cd Cu Ag and Au Soft bases are anionsneutral bases such as H CH CO PR RS and CN Soft acids typically occur in nature as sulfide or arsenide minerals The bonding between soft acids and soft bases is predominantly covalent For example metal carbonyls bind through a covalent interaction between a zero or lowvalent metal and neutral CO to form NiCO FeCO CoCO MnCO WCO and related compounds The preference for hardhard and softsoft interactions like binds like is nicely illustrated in the properties of the copper halides CuF unstable CuI stable CuF stable CuI unstable The compounds CuF and CuI have never been isolated and are thermodynamically unstable to disproportionation We will learn more about quantifying the energetics of these compounds in Chapter
