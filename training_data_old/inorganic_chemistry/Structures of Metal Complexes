coordinate complexesSix coordinate complexesHigher coordinate complexes Transition elements are metallic elements that have incomplete d or f shells in the neutral or cationic states They are called also transition metals and make up of the elements These transition metals are classified into the dblock metals which consist of d elements from Sc to Cu d elements from Y to Ag and d elements from Hf to Au and fblock metals which consist of lanthanoid elements from La to Lu and actinoid elements from Ac to Lr Although Sc and Y belong to the dblock their properties are similar to those of lanthanoids The chemistry of dblock and fblock elements differs considerably This chapter describes the properties and chemistry of mainly dblock transition metals Central Metals Properties of dblock transition metals differ considerably between the first d and the second series metals d although the differences in properties between the second and the third series d metals is not pronounced Metallic radii of elements from scandium Sc to copper Cu to pm are significantly smaller than those of yttrium Y to silver Ag to pm or those of lanthanum La to gold Au to pm Further metal compounds of the first series transition metals are rarely coordinate whereas transition metals from the second and third series may be to coordinate Cerium Ce radius pm lutetium Lu radius pm fall between La and Hf and because of the lanthanide contraction metallic radii of the second and third series transition metals show little variation Higher oxidation states in the second and third series transition metals are considerably more stable than those in the first series transition metals Examples include tungsten hexachloride WCl osmium tetroxide OsO and platinum hexafluoride PtF Compounds of the first series transition metals in higher oxidation states are strong oxidants and thus are readily reduced On the other hand whereas MII and MIII compounds are common among the first series transition metals these oxidation states are generally uncommon in compounds of second and third series metals For example there are relatively few MoIII or WIII compounds compared with many CrIII ones Aqua ions ions with water ligands are very common among compounds of first series metals but few are known amongst the second and third metal compounds Metal carbonyl cluster compounds of first series transition metals with MM bonds in low oxidation states exist but halide or sulfide cluster compounds are rare In general metalmetal bonds are formed much more easily in the d and d metals than in the d ones Magnetic moments of the first series transition metal compounds can be explained in terms of spinonly values cf Chapter d but it is difficult to account for the magnetic moments of the second and third series compounds unless complex factors such as spinorbital interactions are taken into account Thus it is necessary to acknowledge and understand the significant differences in chemical properties that exist between metals of the first and later series metal compounds even for elements in the same group Properties of the dblock transition metals are different not only in the upper and lower positions in the periodic table but also in the left and right groups The Group to metals are now often referred to as early transition metals and they are generally oxophilic and halophilic Smaller numbers of d electrons and the hardness of these elements explain their affinity toward hard oxygen and halogens In the absence of bridging ligands the formation of metalmetal bonds is difficult for these elements Organometallic compounds of these metals are known strongly to activate CH bonds in hydrocarbons Late transition metals in the groups to the right of the periodic table are soft and have a high affinity toward sulfur or selenium The dblock transition metals have s p and d orbitals and those with n electrons in the d orbitals are termed ions with a dn configuration For example Ti is a d ion and Co a d ion The number of electrons occupying the orbitals split by the ligand field cf a is denoted by a superscript on the orbital symbol For example an ion with electrons in tg and electrons in eg is described as tgeg Ligands Compounds of metal ions coordinated by ligands are referred to as metal complexes Most ligands are neutral or anionic substances but cationic ones such as the tropylium cation are also known Neutral ligands such as ammonia NH or carbon monoxide CO are independently stable molecules in their free states whereas anionic ligands such as Cl or CH are stabilized only when they are coordinated to central metals Representative ligands are listed in Table according to the ligating elements Common ligands or those with complicated chemical formula are expressed in abbreviated forms Those ligands with a single ligating atom are called monodentate ligands and those with more than one ligating atoms referred to as polydentate ligands which are also called chelate ligands The number of atoms bonded to a central metal is the coordination number Table Representative ligands Name Abbreviation Formula hydrido H carbonyl CO cyano CN methyl Me CH cyclopentadienyl Cp CH carbonato CO ammine NH pyridine py CHN bipyridine bipy CHN triphenylphosphine PPh PCH aqua aq HO acetylacetonato acac CHCOCHCOCH thiocyanato SCN chloro Cl ethylenediaminetetraacetato edta OOCCHNCHCHNCHCOO Coordination number and structures Molecular compounds which consist of dblock transition metals and ligands are referred to as complexes or coordination compounds The coordination number is determined by the size of the central metal the number of d electrons or steric effects arising from the ligands Complexes with coordination numbers between and are known In particular to coordination are the most stable electronically and geometrically and complexes with these coordination numbers are the most numerous Figure Complexes with the respective coordination numbers are described below Figure Structure of coordination Two coordinate complexes Many electronrich d ions viz Cu Ag and Au form linear complexes such as ClAgCl or HNAuNH A zerovalent complex PdPCy with very bulky tricyclohexylphosphine ligands is also known Generally stable coordinate complexes are known for the late transition metals Three coordinate complexes Although FeNSiMe is one example very few coordinate complexes are known Four coordinate complexes When four ligands coordinate to a metal tetrahedral Td coordination is the least congested geometry although a number of square planar Dh complexes are known CoBr NiCO Cupy AuCl are all examples of tetrahedral complexes There are a few known examples of square planar complexes with identical ligands such as NiCN or PdCl In the case of mixed ligand complexes a number of square planar complexes of d ions Rh Ir Pd Pt and Au have been reported Examples include RhClPMe IrClCOPMe NiClPEt and PtClNH Et CH Cis and trans geometrical isomers are possible for complexes with two different kinds of ligands and were first noted when A Werner synthesized coordinate PtClNH As tetrahedral complexes do not give geometrical isomers Werner was able to conclude that his coordinate complexes were square planar Recently cisPtClNH Cisplatin has been used for the treatment of tumors and it is noteworthy that only the cis isomer is active Exercise Write the formal name of cisPtClNH Answer cisdiamminedichloroplatinum Five coordinate complexes Trigonal bipyramidal Dh FeCO or square pyramid Cv VOOH are examples of coordinate complexes Previously coordinate complexes were rare but the number of new complexes with this coordination is increasing The energy difference between the two coordination modes is not large and structural transformation readily occurs For example the molecular structure and infrared spectrum of FeCO are consistent with a trigonal bipyramid structure but the C NMR spectrum shows only one signal at the possible lowest temperature which indicates that the axial and equatorial carbonyl ligands are fluxional in the NMR time scale s Structural transformation takes place via a square pyramid structure and the mechanism is well known as Berrys pseudorotation Figure Berrys pseudorotation Six coordinate complexes When six ligands coordinate to a central metal octahedral Oh coordination is the most stable geometry and the majority of such complexes assume this structure In particular there are a number of Cr and Co complexes which are inert to ligand exchange reactions represented by CrNH or CoNH They have been particularly important in the history of the development of coordination chemistry MoCO RhCl etc are also octahedral complexes In the case of mixed ligands cis and transMAB and mer and facMAB geometrical isomers and for chelate ligands MAA and MAA optical isomers Figure are possible The octahedral structure shows tetragonal Dh rhombic Dh or trigonal Dh distortions caused by electronic or steric effects The tetragonal distortion of CuNH by an electronic factor is a typical example of the JahnTeller effect refer to a Figure Geometrical isomers of coordination Six ligating atoms can assume trigonal prism coordination Although this coordination is seen in ZrCH or ReSCCF few metal complexes with this coordination structure are known because octahedral coordination is sterically less strained This notwithstanding it has long been known that the bonding mode of sulfur atoms around a metal is trigonal prism in solidstate MoS and WS Exercise Write the chemical formula of potassium diamminetetraisothiocyanatochromateIII Answer KCrNCSNH Higher coordinate complexes Metal ions of the second and third transition metal series can sometimes bond with more than seven ligating atoms and examples are MoCN or ReH In these cases smaller ligands are favorable to reduce steric congestion
