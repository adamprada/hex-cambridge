Successive Operations Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Sometimes new symmetry operations form by carrying out two or more simpler operations successively to result in an indistinguishable configuration For example the improper rotation axis that was introduced in the last section results from rotation about an axis of rotation Cn followed by reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis h Note also that Cn in this case need not be a symmetry element for the molecule For example staggered ethane has an S symmetry element although it does not have a C Another example of a symmetry element that results from a combination of two different elements is the inversion center i which results from a C rotation followed by a reflection about a plane perpendicular to that axis h Note that an inversion center is a special case of an improper rotation axis because it results when in the first equation That is In fact any symmetry operation can be carried out multiple time in a row For example when BH is rotated twice by the twostep operation can be symboled by When the C operation is performed a third time the molecule returns to its original configuration ie In general
