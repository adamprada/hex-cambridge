Superacids Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers The term superacid was originally coined by James Bryant Conant in to describe acids that were stronger than conventional mineral acids George A Olah prepared the socalled magic acid sonamed for its ability to attack hydrocarbons by mixing antimony pentafluoride SbF and fluorosulfonic acid FSOH The name was coined after a candle was placed in a sample of magic acid The candle dissolved showing the ability of the acid to protonate hydrocarbons which under aqueous acidic conditions cannot be protonated At C FSOHSbF converts methane into the tertiarybutyl carbocation a reaction that begins with the protonation of methane Fluoroantimonic acid HSbF can produce solutions with H down to Fluoroantimonic acid is made by combining HF and SbF In this system HF releases its proton H concomitant with the binding of F by antimony pentafluoride which as described below is a Lewis acid The resulting anion SbF is both a weak nucleophile and an extraordinarily weak base Superacids are useful in reactions such as the isomerization of alkanes Industrially anhydrous acidexchanged zeolites which are superacid catalysts are used on a massive scale to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil to gasoline Superbases such as lithium diethylamide LiNEt alkyllithium compounds RLi and Grignard reagents RMgX useful in a broad range of organic reactions LiNEt deprotonates CH bonds to generate reactive carbanions RLi and RMgX are powerful nucleophiles The use of superbases in nonaqueous media allows us to rank the acidities and measure the pKas of different classes of molecules This ranking is particularly important in understanding the reactions of organic molecules Note that the order of acidities for hydrocarbons is alkynes alkenes aromatics alkanes This ordering has to do with the hybridization of the carbon atom that forms the carbanion The negatively charged lone pair of the carbanion is stabilized in orbitals that have high s character eg sp vs sp or sp This is because s orbitals have finite probability density at the nucleus and feel the positive nuclear charge thereby stabilizing the extra negative charge on carbon more than p orbitals Resonance effects also stabilize carbanions Thus cyclopentadiene is more acidic than even an alkyne because the negative charge is delocalized over the entire aromatic CH ring when the CH is deprotonated Table Carbon acid acidities in pKa in DMSO Reference acids in bold name formula structural formula pKa Methane CH Propene CH Benzene CH Acetylene CH Cyclopentadiene CH httpsenwikipediaorgwikiSuperacid
