operation is an operation that is performed to a molecule which leaves it indistinguishable and superimposable on the original position Symmetry operations are performed with respect to symmetry elements points lines or planes An example of a symmetry operation is a rotation of a water molecule in which the resulting position of the molecule is indistinguishable from the original position see Figure In this example the symmetry operation is the rotation and the symmetry element is the axis of rotation There are five types of symmetry operations including identity reflection inversion proper rotation and improper rotation The improper rotation is the sum of a rotation followed by a reflection The symmetry elements that correspond to the five types of symmetry operations are listed in Table Table Table of elements and operations Element Operation Symbol Identity identity E Proper axis rotation by no Cn Symmetry plane reflection in the plane σ Inversion center inversion of a point at xyz to xyz i Improper axis rotation by no followed by reflection in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis Sn Symmetry Operations and Elements Identity E All molecules have the identity element The identity operation is doing nothing to the molecule it doesnt rotate reflect or invertit just is Proper Rotation and Proper Axis Cn A proper rotation is just a simple rotation operation about an axis The symbol for any proper rotation or proper axis is Cn where n is the degree of rotation Thus a rotation is a C rotation around a C axis and a rotation is a C rotation about a C axis PRINCIPLE AXIS The principle axis of a molecule is the highest order proper rotation axis For example if a molecule had C and C axes the C is the principle axis Reflection and Symmetry Planes σ Symmetry planes are mirror planes within the molecule A reflection operation occurs with respect to a plane of symmetry There are three classes of symmetry elements σh horizontal horizontal planes are perpendicular to principal axis σv vertical vertical planes are parallel to the principal axis σd dihedral dihedral planes are parallel to the principle axis and bisecting two C axes Inversion and Inversion Center i The inversion operation requires a point of symmetry a center of symmetry within a molecule In other words a point at the center of the molecule that can transform xyz into xyz coordinate Structures of tetrahedron triangles and pentagons lack an inversion center Improper rotation Sn Improper rotation is a combination of a rotation with respect to an axis of rotation Cn followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to that Cn axis In short and Sn operation is equivalent to Cn followed by References Introduction to Molecular Symmetry by J S Ogden Inorganic Chemistry by Catherine Housecroft And Alan G Sharpe Problems Water molecule HO was used as an example and was mentioned that water was rotated degree around an axis bisecting the oxygen then the molecule was superimposable on the original water molecule how about CO Is it going to be like the water molecule since CO also has atoms of oxygen Of course not because every molecule has different molecular shape To recognize the symmetry of any molecule the structure and the molecular shape of that molecule should be defined The water molecule is bent but CO is not and if CO is rotated degree around the axis bisecting the C atom then it can be superimposed on the original molecule We then see the symmetry for the CO Why should all of the five symmetry elements be done on a molecule in order to find the point group the molecule belongs to why is performing only one or two of the symmetry elements not enough for recognizing the point group One or two of the symmetry elements will not be able to tell us everything about the molecules symmetry since those one or two properties do not tell us everything about the molecule Also while different molecules may have one or two symmetrical properties in common the five properties will not be the same for all molecules What does the symbol Cn stand for and what does n represent Why is it important to identify n C is the axis of rotation and n is the order of the axis How are the character tables helpful The character table tells us about all the operational elements performed on the molecule and indicates if we have forgotten to perform any of the symmetry elements The tables serve as a checklist because all the operational elements should be done on the molecule in order to find the point group of the molecule Why is important to find symmetry in molecules Symmetry tells us about bounding for that molecular bonding
