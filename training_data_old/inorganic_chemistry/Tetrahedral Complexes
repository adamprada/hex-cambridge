Tetrahedral Complexes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Tetrahedral complexes are formed with late transition metal ions Co Cu Zn Cd and some early transition metals Ti Mn especially in situations where the ligands are large In these cases the small metal ion cannot easily accommodate a coordination number higher than four Examples of tetrahedal ions and molecules are CoCl MnCl and TiX X halogen Tetrahedral coordination is also observed in some oxoanions such as FeO which exists as discrete anions in the salts NaFeO and SrFeO and in the neutral oxides RuO and OsO The metal carbonyl complexes NiCO and CoCO are also tetrahedral The splitting of the dorbitals in a tetrahedral crystal field can be understood by connecting the vertices of a tetrahedron to form a cube as shown in the picture at the left The tetrahedral ML bonds lie along the body diagonals of the cube The dz and dxy orbitals point along the cartesian axes ie towards the faces of the cube and have the least contact with the ligand lone pairs Therefore these two orbitals form a low energy doubly degenerate e set The dxy dyz and dxz orbitals point at the edges of the cube and form a triply degenerate t set While the t orbitals have more overlap with the ligand orbitals than the e set they are still weakly interacting compared to the eg orbitals of an octahedral complex The resulting crystal field energy diagram is shown at the right The splitting energy Δt is about the splitting of an octahedral complex formed with the same ligands For d elements Δt is thus small compared to the pairing energy and their tetrahedral complexes are always high spin Note that we have dropped the g subscript because the tetrahedron does not have a center of symmetry Tetrahedral complexes often have vibrant colors because they lack the center of symmetry that forbids a dd transition Because the low energy transition is allowed these complexes typically absorb in the visible range and have extinction coefficients that are orders of magnitude higher than the those of the corresponding octahedral complexes An illustration of this effect can be seen in Drierite which contains particles of colorless anhydrous calcium sulfate gypsum that absorbs moisture from gases The indicator dye in Drierite is cobalt II chloride which is is a light pink when wet octahedral and deep blue when dry tetrahedral The reversible hydration reaction is deep blue tetrahedral CoCl light pink octahedral CoHO
