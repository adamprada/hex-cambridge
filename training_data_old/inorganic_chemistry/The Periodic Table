can be introduced into this potential chaos by relating the properties of the elements to their position in the periodic table or as was originally done by Mendeleev et al arranging the elements into the periodic table according to their properties Heavier Elements There is little chemistry to learn about for many of the transuranium elements especially the newest because of their extremely short halflives In some cases only one or two atoms have been made The rest of the chapter is divided into secions A and B which respectively describe the pure elements themselves and then the general group trends and nontrends Part A The Nature and types of the Elements Monatomic Elements Includes all the noble gases and many metal vapours The noble gases do not form bonds to each other because of their closed valence shell configuration and the metals have their own kind of bonding which does not work in the gas phase see below Diatomic Elements These are H the simplest of all neutral molecules the halogens which also have single bonds and N and O which have multiple pppp bonding Discrete Small Polyatomic Molecules Sn and Se P Since pppp bonding is not a very useful option for elements below the first short period because of corecore repulsion at useful pbonding distances P S and Se can form clusters or chains see the next group Sulphur which can form two single bonds to itself comes in various ring sizes up to S S being the most stable orthorhombic sulphur White phosphorus which can form three comes as P with PP at Ã… which is more or less normal A particularly strained PP ie bent would be longer Nevertheless P is the most reactive form of phosphorus for example spontaneously inflaming in air Boron and carbon capable of forming and bonds respectively could have been included here too but see below Elements with Extended Structures Boron is a somewhat anomalous case because it is electron deficient The allotropic forms of boron are all hased on the icosahedral B unit In this unit each boron has nearest neighbours and since the units are weakly bonded to form more extended frameworks the borons that will have more remote neighbours as well There are nowhere near enough electrons and atomic orbitals to do this using localized electron centre Lewis type bonds As usual molecular orbital theory comes to the rescue but the B cage alone is a rather complex system to use as an example The topic of the boranes boron hydrides to be covered later might help shed some light on how the molecular orbitals might be set up The allotropes of crystalline boron are the most complex of the structures of the elements and their study has been futher complicated by the presence of small but stoichiometric amounts of carbon or nitrogen leading to some false ones The basic icosohedral B unit Depending on the number of bonds that they can form the following elements can form chain sheet or three dimensional structures C P S Si As Se Ge Sb Te Sn Bi Plastic sulphur Sn has a rubbery texture and is thermally unstable at room temperature with respect to conversion to S Selenium also forms chains but infinite spirals in an ordered crystalline structure Tellurium is similar and the solid has semiconductor propeties Crystalline black phosphorus has a double sheet structure This structure is shared by its cogeners members of the same group but they are metals Red phosporus the other common form contains chains of phosphorus tetrahedra Graphite has dimensional sheets of trigonal sp carbon atom arranged in aromatic six membered rings Because of the extended delocalized orbitals graphite is a conductor especially parallel to the sheets Diamond is a dimensional lattice of tetrahedral sp carbon atoms arranged in saturated sixmembered rings all in the chair form Diamond is an insulator A number of additional carbon structures have been discovered quite recently Buckmeisterfullerene C the simplest of the bucky balls is shown on the right It was discovcerd in soot Its shape like an international soccer ball is an icosahedron with all corners cut off to of the way along each edge which generates new pentagonal faces and converts the old triangular ones to hexagons There are a number of elongated spheroidal structures and tubes capped by hemispheres known all made by cooling carbon vapour from and arc or plasma discharge Chemists are still trying to make them do something useful Heats of formation for carbon forms are Graphite diamond and C kJ mol Metals The structures of many metals are based on hexagonal or cubic close packing Chapter section or the less efficient bodycentered cubic Fig Figure shows the distribution of these structures Metals are sometimes described as a regular array of cations immersed in a sea of valence electrons which are completely delocalized and free to roam through the entire mass A simplified theoretical picture of this follows In the molecule Li the bond results from overlap of the s orbitals each of which contains electrons The diagram below shows several representations of this The part of the diagram on the left shows the energy levels at the observed internuclear distance marked with a vertical dotted line on the right hand diagram A crude representation of the two molecular orbitals is also shown The internal spherical nodes that the s orbitals possess are omitted The next four diagrams show orbital energies and orbitals for hypothetical linear molecules Li Li Li and Li Variation of orbital enery with internuclear separation for a hypothetical linear Li molecule Variation of orbital enery with internuclear separation for a hypothetical linear Li molecule Variation of orbital enery with internuclear separation for a hypothetical linear Li molecule At the left is the diagram for the hypothetical Li The infinite number of morse curves merge together to give the band shown Because lithium has the s valence shell configuration only half of this band will be filled and electrons can easily move into the empty orbitals accounting for the metallic conduction observed The occupied levelsorbitals are shown by the shaded area in the diagram below The situation described above is not real Real crystals are threedimensional and in addition to the molecular orbitals formed by the atomic sorbitals there will be another set formed by overlap of the atomic porbitals The text figures and are a more realistic representation Cohesive Energies of the Metals See figure Note that the main group metals have relatively low enthalpies of atomization correlating roughly with the number of valence electrons Maxima occur at the halffilled shell after which antibonding parts of the conduction bands begin to be populated Part B The Chemistry of the Elements in Relation to their Position in the Periodic Table Hydrogen s With an intermediate electronegativity and one valence electron hydrogen might range from H to H in its compounds The proton radius x cm cannot exist in condensed states liquid or solids because it exerts too powerful a polarizing influence on molecules near to itself Therefore it is always complexed for example as HO Covalent compounds are the normal situation When combined with very electropositive elements eg Na K Ca it behaves as H hydride ion and is a very powerful reducing agent Helium s and the noble gases nsnp The energy necessary to make a valence state is not compensated by bond formation above krypton which forms a few flourides The rest of the group have fairly extensive chemistry with fluorine chlorine and oxygen The first noble gas compound originally thought to be XePtF by analogy with OPtF was made by Bartlett in Prior to that they had been thought to be inert Elements of the First Short Period Li F They are poor representatives of their groups The second short period elements are much better for this The reason is connected to their small size and lack of empty dorbitals which limits their coordination number to in the absence of multicentre bonding To achieve their normal valencies Be B and C use a valence state where one of the s electrons is promoted to the psubshell Electron deficient Li Be and B compounds are Lewis acids This involves a change in hybridization The extent to which the coordination number can be increased is limited by negative charge buildup on the acceptor Li Be and B also tend to be involved in molecules featuring centre e bonding as a way to reduce their electron deficiency N O and perhaps F compounds can be Lewis bases because of the available electon pairs on these atoms The sharing of more than one pair is opposed by positive charge buildup on the donor atom and sometimes steric factors Li exists in rather few compounds because of its small size Covalent and multicenter bonding is common eg the lithium alkyls Be would be even more polarizing than Li so no compounds containing it exist Covalency is the norm eg BeF and BeHO which hydrolyses extensively to BeOH containing species for Li Be and B there is a marked similarity to the diagonally related Mg Al and C Although the valencies differ the chemical behaviour such as covalency of halides or coordination chemistry tends to be somewhat similar For example there are close parallels between the lithium alkyls and the magnesium alkyls or between beryllium halides and the aluminium halides For B C and N there are no longlived compounds in which the elements are cationic Covalency dominates the chemistry of these elements There are compounds containing anions eg C acetylide and N which is a major product when Mg burns in air The chemistry of O and F is dominated by anion formation and covalency Remember O is too strong a base to exist in water though solid compounds are known Fluoride F is only a weak base and so known in solids and aqueous solution C N and O commonly participate in multiple bonding by the use of porbitals N is a rather unreactive molecule because of the great strength of the triple bond O is much more reactive partly because it is a biradical F is very reactive because the filled porbitals perpendicular to the bond repel each other Covalent Bonds Covered as part of the previous section Elements of the Second Short Period Na to Ar These elements are much more representative of the chemistry of the elements below them in their groups This specially true for the nonmetalic elements The elements of this period and those below it do not tend to use their porbitals for pbonding Rather the empty dorbitals are used if pbonding occcurs For example aside from special sterically encumbered cases there are few compounds containing SiSi PP or SS bonds An example of an exception is CHCPPCCH ppppbonding is not stable with respect to addition reactions a kinetic effect Multiple bonding that does occur usually involves a first short period element such as oxygen or nitrogen Examples include ClPO SO or ClO Such molecules may contain ppdpbonding and the octet rule is often violated On the other hand there is no analogue in silicon chemistry of OCO SiO is a network solid although the SiOSi groupings are linear which does hint and pinteractions The dobitals can be invoked to explain valence states where the coordination number exceeds and the octet is exceeded also Examples include PCl SF and IF The possibility of higher coordination numbers lead also to different reactivity eg CCl which is inert to hydrolysis and SiCl The metals differ from the first memeber of their group eg sodium does not form covalent compounds aluminum is a cationforming metal quite unlike boron and the coordination numbers are often rather than for these second row elements The Remainder of the NonTransition Elements This section contains a groupbygroup summary of the properties characterizing each group and indicating again how the top member of each group differs The following is list of key properties appropriate for comparisions Metallic character Properties of the oxides Ionic vs covalent Acidic vs basic Properties of the halides Ionic vs molecular Ease of hydrolysis General trends in electrovalence and covalence Trends in structure Coordination numbers for discrete species Aggregation in the solid state to increase coordination number Properties of the hydrides Tendency to catenate The relative importance of pppp vs ppdp vs dpdp bonding The general strength of covalent bonding The relative importance of the lower valent states vs the hight valent states Group IA or See text Table The elements have chemistry dominated by the ionic state The behaviour going down a group is wellbehaved The following decrease down a group melting points and heats of sublimation lattice energies mostly Effective hydrated radii and hydration energies Ionization Enthalpies Group IIA or and IIB or See text Table For group IIA Mg Ca Sr Ba and Ra which all form the ionic state there are again wellbehaved trends including those mentioned for group IA and adding Solubility of the sulphates and carbonates Thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrates which decrease going down the group Group IIB metals Zn Cd and Hg have two selectrons outside filled dsubshells In Zn and Cd the delectrons do a somewhat poorer screening job than the closed shells of the group IIA so that the ions which are more polarizing are more inclined to form complex ions with NH halides and CN Mercuric ion Hg where the fsubshell also has been filled is quite different in that it is even more inclined to form complexes The oxidation potential for mercury is positive whereas the others are all negative which means that mercury metal is rather easily produced in its reactions It also readily forms the mercurous ion Hg Group IIIA or and IIIB or See text Table The text includes the group IIIA elements and the rest of the lanthanides among the nontransition metals because of the relative simplicity of their chemistry They all behave as quite electropositive elements and form the ion Scandium behaves as if it falls somewhere between aluminum and gallium in terms of its covalency The lanthanides are so similar to each another that separation is difficult Cation exchange chromatography is used All the group IIIB elements form compounds containing the ion but there is a marked tendency towards covalency especially for aluminum eg its alkyls are volatile liquids and its chloride sublimes Group IIIB is the first group to clearly demonstrate the inert pair effect On descending the group there is a tendency for the ions to become more and more stable Tl is more stable than Tl and its chemistry is complicated by its redox behaviour The unusual stability of Hg could also be ascribed to the inert pair effect Group IVB or See text Table This is the group in which the property differences between the first member carbon and the rest is perhaps most marked Knowing the chemistry of carbon is almost useless for predicting the chemistry of the remaining elements The chemistry of carbon is dominated by its extraordinary ability to catenate While silicon can form analogues to the hydrocarbons multiple bonding is not viable and the SiO bond is the important bond in silicon chemistry The chemistry of the group IVB elements in their IV oxidation state is predominantly covalent SiCl is a liquid as is PbCH the infamous antiknock gasoline additive The covalent bonds generally weaken on descending the group The divalent state of carbon in carbenes is very reactive and it comes in both singlet and triplet forms Silicon has virtually no chemistry in this state For the rest of the group the II state becomes successively more stable going down the group The inert pair is usually stereoactive in both molecular and solid state aggregated compounds The MII compounds can never be considered truly ionic The trend is probably associated with decreasing covalent bond strengths compared to the energy needed to obtain the valence state because the ionization potential differences are small GeCl Cl GeCl Rapid at oC SnCl Cl SnCl Slow at oC PbCl Cl PbCl Does not go except at higher temperature and pressure PbBr and PbI cannot be made Group VB or See text Table The oxidation states V and III are normal for this group Phosphorus compounds are all covalent but the tendency towards ionic behaviour increases down the group especially for the III state but the only species that can be considered as predominantly cations are SbOand BiO and Bi in its fluoride Group VIB or See text Table This group is relatively wellbehaved so that its features can be tablulated The ions exist in salts with electropositive elements There are also anions containing one covalent bond eg RS or HS There are covalent compounds of type for example RE or XE R is organic X is a halogen and E is the group VIB element There are monocations of type RE There are anionic ompounds where the group VI element is in the IV or VI state and with coordination numbers and eg SCl SeF TeF There are stereoactive lone pairs to worry about The hydrides HE decrease in stability down the group The elements themselves become gradually more metallic The tendency to form anionic complexes increases eg SeBr TeBr and even PoI Group VIIB or See text Table With the elements of group IA this group is the most wellbehaved The properties progress nicely down the group The elements all form th X ion and compounds with one covalent bond eg RX or HX Interhalogens eg ClF have properties somewhat intermediate between the parent dihalogens but they are polar in the expected sense The higher oxidation states are II V and VII There are no simple cationic ions X but Br I Cl Br and several larger iodine cations have been prepared The
