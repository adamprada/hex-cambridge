Threecenter Bonding Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Many but not all of the problems we will solve with MO theory derive from the MO diagram of the H molecule Fig which is a case of twocenter bonding The rest we will solve by analogy to the H ion which introduces the concept of threecenter bonding We can draw the H ion and also H and H in either a linear or triangular geometry Walsh correlation diagram for H A few important points about this diagram For the linear form of the ion the highest and lowest MOs are symmetric with respect to the inversion center in the molecule Note that the central s orbital has g symmetry so by symmetry it has zero overlap with the u combination of the two s orbitals on the ends This makes the σu orbital a nonbonding orbital In the triangular form of the molecule the orbitals that derive from σu and σg become degenerate ie they have identically the same energy by symmetry The term symbol e means doubly degenerate We will see later that t means triply degenerate Note that we drop the g and u for the triangular orbitals because a triangle does not have an inversion center The triangular form is most stable because the two electrons in H have lower energy in the lowest orbital Bending the molecule creates a third bonding interaction between the s orbitals on the ends MO diagram for XH X Be B C Some key points about this MO diagram In the linear form of the molecule which has inversion symmetry the s and p orbitals of the X atom factor into three symmetry classes s σg pz σu px py πu Similarly we can see that the two H s orbitals make two linear combinations one with σg symmetry and one with σu symmetry They look like the bonding and antibonding MOs of the H molecule which is why we say we use that problem to solve this one The πu orbitals must be nonbonding because there is no combination of the H s orbitals that has πu symmetry In the MO diagram we make bonding and antibonding combinations of the σgs and the σus For BeH we then populate the lowest two orbitals with the four valence electrons and discover not surprisingly that the molecule has two bonds and can be written HBeH The correlation diagram shows that a bent form of the molecule should be less stable An interesting story about this MO diagram is that it is difficult to predict a priori whether CH should be linear or bent In Charles Bender and Henry Schaefer using quantum chemical calculations predicted that the ground state should be a bent triplet with an HCH angle of The best experiments at the time suggested that methylene was a linear singlet and the theorists argued that the experimental result was wrong Later experiments proved them right A theory is something nobody believes except the person who made it An experiment is something everybody believes except the person who made it Einstein
