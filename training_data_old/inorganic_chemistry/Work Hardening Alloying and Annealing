Work Hardening Alloying and Annealing Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers One of the questions we would like to ask is why are the yield stresses of normal polycrystalline metal samples so much lower by a factor of than they are in perfect single crystals The answer has to do with the motion of dislocations Consider the picture below which shows planes of metal atoms near a dislocation the individual atoms are numbered to help you see which bonds are broken and which are formed The arrows indicate force applied under shear stress Notice how the dislocation moves by breakingmaking metalmetal bonds The key point here is that we can induce plastic deformation shear by breaking only one line of metalmetal bonds at a time along the dislocation line This involves far less force than breaking an entire plane of bonds as we would need to do to shear a perfect crystal In a given polycrystalline sample there are many dislocation lines that run perpendicular to all possible shear directions so their motion can be used to tear the metal apart Turbine rotors on large jets are made of very expensive single crystal nickeltitanium alloys so that these shearing deformations can be avoided We can see that motion of dislocations is basically bad news if we want a metal to be strong and hard eg if we want a structural material or a knife that can hold a decent edge There are several ways we can overcome to some extent this problem Use single crystals and anneal out all the dislocations expensive especially with large items like turbine blades and impossible with very large items like airplane wings or bridges Work hardening of the metal this moves all dislocations to grain boundaries the dislocation essentially becomes part of the grain boundary Since a grain boundary is a planar defect it is much less responsive to stress than a line defect Introduce impurity atoms that is alloying elements or impurity phases that pin the motion of defects An impurity atom stops the motion because it is a different size or makes stronger bonds than the other metal atoms the line defect has a hard time moving away from rows of such atoms An impurity phase like FeC in iron makes extra grain boundaries that can stop the motion of defects This effect is analogous to the graphite fibers in fiberreinforced crosslinked polymers used eg in tennis rackets that stop the propagation of cracks A simple illustration of work hardening can be done with a piece of copper wire When struck many times with a hammer the copper wire becomes stiffer and it is possible to hang a weight from it Dislocations move to the crystal grain boundaries during work hardening effectively halting their motion and at the same time making the individual crystal grains smaller Because the crystal grains are now smaller the amount of grain boundary area has increased and with it the free energy of the material Annealing reverses the process by lowering the free energy When the wire is annealed in a flame heated so that atoms can move and rearrange the crystal grains grow and the dislocations reappear The copper again becomes ductile and bends easily Coldworking work hardening of metals is important for strengthening structural materials eg iron beams and for making brittle hard edges this is why blacksmiths hammer on knives and swords when they are making them If you have ever watched them they do the same thing to horseshoes when they cool down to make them stiff Blacksmith
