σ π and δ orbitals Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Inorganic compounds use s p and d orbitals and more rarely f orbitals to make bonding and antibonding combinations These combinations result in σ π and δ bonds and antibonds You are already familiar with σ and π bonding in organic compounds In inorganic chemistry π bonds can be made from p andor dorbitals δ bonds are more rare and occur by facetoface overlap of dorbitals as in the ion ReCl The fact that the Cl atoms are eclipsed in this anion is evidence of δ bonding Figure The octachlorodirhenateIII anion ReCl which has a quadruple ReRe bond Some possible σ top row π bottom row and δ bonding combinations right of s p and d orbitals are sketched below In each case we can make bonding or antibonding combinations depending on the signs of the AO wavefunctions Because pπpπ bonding involves sideways overlap of porbitals it is most commonly observed with secondrow elements C N O πbonded compounds of heavier elements are rare because the larger cores of the atoms prevent good πoverlap For this reason compounds containing CC double bonds are very common but those with SiSi bonds are rare δ bonds are generally quite weak compared to σ and π bonds Compounds with metalmetal δ bonds occur in the middle of the transition series Transition metal dorbitals can also form σ bonds typically with sp hybrid orbitals of appropriate symmetry on ligands For example phosphines RP are good σ donors in complexes with transition metals as shown below pπdπ bonding is also important in transition metal complexes In metal carbonyl complexes such as NiCO and MoCO there is sideways overlap between filled metal dorbitals and the empty πantibonding orbitals the LUMO of the CO molecule as shown in the figure below This interaction strengthens the metalcarbon bond but weakens the carbonoxygen bond The CO infrared stretching frequency is diagnostic of the strength of the bond and can be used to estimate the degree to which electrons are transferred from the metal dorbital to the CO πantibonding orbital The same kind of backbonding occurs with phosphine complexes which have empty π orbitals as shown at the right Transition metal complexes containing halide ligands can also have significant pπdπ bonding in which a filled pπ orbital on the ligand donates electron density to an unfilled metal dπ orbital We will encounter these bonding situations in Chapter
