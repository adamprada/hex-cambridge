have been identified for this section Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below enzyme Study Notes This section is a brief but perhaps interesting overview of some of the key differences between reactions performed in the lab and those in living systems At this point do not concern yourself with memorizing large biological molecules and reactions The active site A critical element in the threedimensional structure of any enzyme is the presence of an active site which is a pocket usually located in the interior of the protein that serves as a docking point for the enzymes substrates substrate is the term that biochemists use for a reactant molecule in an enzymecatalyzed reaction It is inside the active site pocket that enzymatic catalysis occurs Shown below is an image of the glycolytic enzyme fructosebisphosphate aldolase with its substrate bound inside the active site pocket When the substrate binds to the active site a large number of noncovalent interactions form with the amino acid residues that line the active site The shape of the active site and the enzymesubstrate interactions that form as a result of substrate binding are specific to the substrateenzyme pair the active site has evolved to fit one particular substrate and to catalyze one particular reaction Other molecules do not fit in this active site nearly so well as fructose bisphosphate Here are two closeup views of the same active site pocket showing some of the specific hydrogenbonding interactions between the substrate and active site amino acids The first image below is a threedimensional rendering directly from the crystal structure data The substrate is shown in spacefilling style while the active site amino acids are shown in the ball and stick style Hydrogens are not shown The color scheme is grey for carbon red for oxygen blue for nitrogen and orange for phosphorus Below is a twodimensional picture of the substrate colored red surrounded by hydrogenbonding active site amino acids Notice that both main chain and side chain groups contribute to hydrogen bonding in this figure main chain Hbonding groups are colored blue and side chain Hbonding groups are colored green Looking at the last three images should give you some appreciation for the specific manner in which a substrate fits inside its active site Transition state stabilization One of the most important ways that an enzyme catalyzes any given reaction is through entropy reduction by bringing order to a disordered situation remember that entropy is a component of Gibbs Free Energy and thus a component of the activation energy Lets turn again to our previous example from section C of a biochemical nucleophilic substitution reaction the methylation of adenosine in DNA The reaction is shown below with nonreactive sections of the molecules depicted by variously shaped bubbles for the sake of simplicity In order for this reaction to occur the two substrates reactants must come into contact in precisely the right way If they are both floating around free in solution the likelihood of this occurring is very small the entropy of the system is simply too high In other words this reaction takes place very slowly without the help of a catalyst Heres where the enzymes active site pocket comes into play It is lined with various functional groups from the amino acid main and side chains and has a very specific threedimensional architecture that has evolved to bind to both of the substrates If the SAM molecule for example diffuses into the active site it can replace its favorable interactions with the surrounding water molecules with even more favorable new interactions with the functional groups lining the active site In a sense SAM is moving from one solvent water to another solvent the active site where many new energetically favorable interactions are possible Remember these new contacts between SAM and the active site groups are highly specific to SAM and SAM alone no other molecule can fit so well in this precise active site environment and thus no other molecule will be likely to give up its contacts to water and bind to the active site The second substrate also has a specific spot reserved in the active site Because in this case the second substrate is a small segment of a long DNA molecule the DNAbinding region of the active site is more of a groove than a pocket So now we have both substrates bound in the active site But they are not just bound in any random orientation they are specifically positioned relative to one another so that the nucleophilic nitrogen is held very close to the electrophilic carbon with a free path of attack What used to be a very disordered situation two reactants diffusing freely in solution is now a very highly ordered situation with everything set up for the reaction to proceed This is what is meant by entropy reduction the entropic component of the energy barrier has been lowered Looking a bit deeper though it is not really the noncovalent interaction between enzyme and substrate that are responsible for catalysis Remember all catalysts enzymes included accelerate reactions by lowering the energy of the transition state With this in mind it should make sense that the primary job of an enzyme is to maximize favorable interactions with the transition state not with the starting substrates This does not imply that enzymesubstrate interactions are not strong rather that enzymeTS interactions are far stronger often by several orders of magnitude Think about it this way if an enzyme were to bind to and stabilize its substrates more tightly than it bound to and stabilized the transition state it would actually slow down the reaction because it would be increasing the energy difference between starting state and transition state The enzyme has evolved to maximize favorable noncovalent interactions to the transition state in our example this is the state in which the nucleophilic nitrogen is already beginning to attack the electrophilic carbon and the carbonsulfur bond has already begun to break In many enzymatic reactions certain active site amino acid residues contribute to catalysis by increasing the reactivity of the substrates Often the catalytic role is that of acid andor base In our DNA methylation example the nucleophilic nitrogen is deprotonated by a nearby aspartate side chain as it begins its nucleophilic attack on the methyl group of SAM We will study nucleophilicity in greater detail in chapter but it should make intuitive sense that deprotonating the amine increases the electron density of the nitrogen making it more nucleophilic Notice also in the figure below that the main chain carbonyl of an active site proline forms a hydrogen bond with the amine which also has the effect of increasing the nitrogens electron density and thus its nucleophilicity Nucleic Acids Res How does our picture of enzyme catalysis apply to multistep reaction mechanisms Although the twostep nucleophilic substitution reaction between tertbutyl chloride and hydroxide section C is not a biologically relevant process lets pretend just for the sake of illustration that there is a hypothetical enzyme that catalyzes this reaction The same basic principles apply here the enzyme binds best to the transition state But therein lies the problem there are two transition states To which TS does the enzyme maximize its contacts Recall that the first step the loss of the chloride leaving group to form the carbocation intermediate is the slower ratelimiting step It is this step that our hypothetical enzyme needs to accelerate if it wants to accelerate the overall reaction and it is thus the energy of TS that needs to be lowered By Hammonds postulate we also know that the intermediate I is a close approximation of TS So the enzyme by stabilizing the intermediate will also stabilize TS as well as TS and thereby accelerate the reaction If you read scientific papers about enzyme mechanisms you will often see researchers discussing how an enzyme stabilizes a reaction intermediate By virtue of Hammonds postulate they are at the same time talking about how the enzyme lowers the energy of the transition state An additional note although we have in this section been referring to SAM as a substrate of the DNA methylation reaction it is also often referred to as a coenzyme or cofactor These terms are used to describe small relative to protein and DNA biological organic molecules that bind specifically in the active site of an enzyme and help the enzyme to do its job In the case of SAM the job is methyl group donation In addition to SAM we will see many other examples of coenzymes in the coming chapters a number of which like ATP adenosine triphosphate coenzyme A thiamine and flavin you have probably heard of before The full structures of some common coenzymes are shown in
