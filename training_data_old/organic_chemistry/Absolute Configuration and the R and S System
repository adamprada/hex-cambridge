sure the lowest priority is pointing away from you Then determine the direction from the highest priority substituent to the lowest clockwise R or counterclockwise S IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MODELING KIT remember that the dashes mean the bond is going into the screen and the wedges means that bond is coming out of the screen If the lowest priority bond is not pointing to the back mentally rotate it so that it is However it is very useful when learning organic chemistry to use models If you have a modeling kit use it as you read through this section and work the practice problems Introduction and the CahnIngoldPrelog rules of Priority To name the enantiomers of a compound unambiguously their names must include the handedness of the molecule The letters R and S are determined by applying the CahnIngoldPrelog CIP rules The optical activity can also be communicated in the name but must be empirically derived There are also biochemical conventions for carbohydrates sugars and amino acids the building blocks of proteins The method of unambiguously assigning the handedness of molecules was originated by three chemists RS Cahn C Ingold and V Prelog and as such is also often called the CahnIngoldPrelog rules In addition to the CIP system there are two ways of experimentally determining the absolute configuration of an enantiomer Xray diffraction analysis Note that there is no correlation between the sign of rotation and the structure of a particular enantiomer Chemical correlation with a molecule whose structure has already been determined via Xray diffraction However for nonlaboratory purposes it is beneficial to focus on the RS system The sign of optical rotation although different for the two enantiomers of a chiral moleculeat the same temperature cannot be used to establish the absolute configuration of an enantiomer this is because the sign of optical rotation for a particular enantiomer may change when the temperature changes The CahnIngoldPrelog rules of priority are based on the atomic numbers of the atoms of interest For chirality the atoms of interest are the atoms bonded to the chiral carbon The atom with higher atomic number has higher priority I Br Cl S P F O N C H When comparing isotopes the atom with the higher mass number has higher priority O O or N N or C C or T H D H H When there is a tie in above establish relative priority by proceeding to the next atoms along the chain until the first difference is observed Multiple bonds are treated as if each bond of the multiple bond is bonded to a unique atom For example the ethenyl group CHCH has higher priority than the ethyl group CHCH The ethenyl carbon priority is two bonds to carbon atoms and one bond to a hydrogen atom compared with the ethyl carbon that has only one bond to a carbon atom and two bonds to two hydrogen atoms Similarly the carboncarbon triple bond of acetylene would give it higher CIP priority than the ethenyl group as summarized below Stereocenters are labeled R or S The right hand and left hand nomenclature is used to name the enantiomers of a chiral compound The stereocenters are labeled as R or S Consider the diagram above on the left a curved arrow is drawn counterclockwise ccw from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent in the Sconfiguration Sinister Latin left The counterclockwise direction can be recognized by the movement left when leaving the o clock position Now consider the diagram above on the right where a curved arrow is drawn clockwise cw from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent in the R configuration Rectus Latin right The R or S is then added as a prefix in parenthesis to the name of the enantiomer of interest A locator number is required if there is more than one chiral center Otherwise the person reading the name is expected to recognize the chiral center Example The two chiral compounds below are drawn to emphasize the chiral carbon with the full chemical name below each structure Absolute Configurations of Perspective Formulas Chemists need a convenient way to distinguish one stereoisomer from another The CahnIngoldPrelog system is a set of rules that allows us to unambiguously define the stereochemical configuration of any stereocenter using the designations R from the Latin rectus meaning righthanded or S from the Latin sinister meaning lefthanded The rules for this system of stereochemical nomenclature are on the surface fairly simple Rules for assigning an RS designation to a chiral center Assign priorities to the four substituents with being the highest priority and the lowest Priorities are based on the atomic number Trace a circle from to to Determine the orientation of the priority group If it is oriented into the plane of the page away from you go to step a If it is oriented out of the plane of the page toward you go to step b a group pointing away from you a clockwise circle in part corresponds to the R configuration while a counterclockwise circle corresponds to the S configuration b group pointing toward you a clockwise circle in part corresponds to the S configuration while a counterclockwise circle corresponds to the R configuration Well use the carbon sugar glyceraldehyde as our first example The first thing that we must do is to assign a priority to each of the four substituents bound to the chiral center We first look at the atoms that are directly bonded to the chiral center these are H O in the hydroxyl C in the aldehyde and C in the CHOH group Assigning RS configuration to glyceraldehyde Two priorities are easy hydrogen with an atomic number of is the lowest priority and the hydroxyl oxygen with atomic number is priority Carbon has an atomic number of Which of the two C groups is priority the aldehyde or the CHOH To determine this we move one more bond away from the chiral center for the aldehyde we have a double bond to an oxygen while on the CHOH group we have a single bond to an oxygen If the atom is the same double bonds have a higher priority than single bonds Therefore the aldehyde group is assigned priority and the CHOH group the priority With our priorities assigned we look next at the priority group the hydrogen and see that it is pointed back away from us into the plane of the page thus step a from the procedure above applies Then we trace a circle defined by the and priority groups in increasing order The circle is clockwise which by step a tells us that this carbon has the R configuration and that this molecule is Rglyceraldehyde Its enantiomer by definition must be Sglyceraldehyde Next lets look at one of the enantiomers of lactic acid and determine the configuration of the chiral center Clearly H is the substituent and OH is Owing to its three bonds to oxygen the carbon on the acid group takes priority and the methyl group takes The group hydrogen happens to be drawn pointing toward us out of the plane of the page in this figure so we use step b The circle traced from to to is clockwise which means that the chiral center has the S configuration The drug thalidomide is an interesting but tragic case study in the importance of stereochemistry in drug design First manufactured by a German drug company and prescribed widely in Europe and Australia in the late s as a sedative and remedy for morning sickness in pregnant women thalidomide was soon implicated as the cause of devastating birth defects in babies born to women who had taken it Thalidomide contains a chiral center and thus exists in two enantiomeric forms It was marketed as a racemic mixture in other words a mixture of both enantiomers Lets try to determine the stereochemical configuration of the enantiomer on the left Of the four bonds to the chiral center the priority is hydrogen The nitrogen group is the carbonyl side of the ring is and the CH side of the ring is The hydrogen is shown pointing away from us and the prioritized substituents trace a clockwise circle this is the R enantiomer of thalidomide The other enantiomer of course must have the S configuration Although scientists are still unsure today how thalidomide works experimental evidence suggests that it was actually the R enantiomer that had the desired medical effects while the S enantiomer caused the birth defects Even with this knowledge however pure Rthalidomide is not safe because enzymes in the body rapidly convert between the two enantiomers we will see how that happens in chapter As a historical note thalidomide was never approved for use in the United States This was thanks in large part to the efforts of Dr Frances Kelsey a Food and Drug officer who at peril to her career blocked its approval due to her concerns about the lack of adequate safety studies particularly with regard to the drugs ability to enter the bloodstream of a developing fetus Unfortunately though at that time clinical trials for new drugs involved widespread and unregulated distribution to doctors and their patients across the country so families in the US were not spared from the damage caused Very recently a close derivative of thalidomide has become legal to prescribe again in the United States with strict safety measures enforced for the treatment of a form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma In Brazil thalidomide is used in the treatment of leprosy but despite safety measures children are still being born with thalidomiderelated defects Exercise Determine the stereochemical configurations of the chiral centers in

of Fischer Projections To determine the absolute configuration of a chiral center in a Fisher projection use the following twostep procedure Step Assign priority numbers to the four ligands groups bonded to the chiral center using the CIP priority system Step vertical option If the lowest priority ligand is on a Vertical bond then it is pointing away from the viewer Trace the three highestpriority ligands starting at the highestpriority ligand ① ② ③ in the direction that will give a Very correct answer In the compound below the movement is clockwise indicating an Rconfiguration The complete IUPAC name for this compound is Rbutanol Step horizontal option If the lowestpriority ligand is on a Horizontal bond then it is pointing toward the viewer Trace the three highestpriority ligands starting at the highestpriority ligand ① ② ③ in the direction that will give a Horribly wrong answer Note in the table below that the configurations are reversed from the first example In the compound below the movement is clockwise R which is Horribly wrong so the actual configuration is S The complete IUPAC name for this compound is Sbutanol Manipulating Fischer Projections with NO Change to Configuration A Fischer projection restricts a threedimensional molecule into two dimensions Consequently there are limitations as to the operations that can be performed on a Fischer projection without changing the absolute configuration at chiral centers The operations that do not change the absolute configuration at a chiral center in a Fischer projections can be summarized as two rules Rule Rotation of the Fischer projection by º in either direction without lifting it off the plane of the paper does not change the absolute configuration at the chiral center Rule Rotation of three ligands on the chiral center in either direction keeping the remaining ligand in place does not change the absolute configuration at the chiral center Manipulating Fischer Projections with Change to Configuration The operations that do change the absolute configuration at a chiral center in a Fischer projection can be summarized as two rules Rule Rotation of the Fischer projection by º in either direction changes the absolute configuration at the chiral center Rule Interchanging any two ligands on the chiral center changes the absolute configuration at the chiral center The above rules assume that the Fischer projection under consideration contains only one chiral center However with care they can be applied to Fischer projections containing any number of chiral centers Exercise Classify the following compounds as R or S Solution S I Br F H The lowest priority substituent H is already going towards the back It turns left going from I to Br to F so its a S R Br Cl CH H You have to switch the H and Br in order to place the H the lowest priority in the back Then going from Br to Cl CH is turning to the right giving you a R Neither R or S This molecule is achiral Only chiral molecules can be named R or S R OH CN CHNH H The H the lowest priority has to be switched to the back Then going from OH to CN to CHNH you are turning right giving you a R S Then going from to to you are turning left giving you a S configuration Exercises Orient the following so that the least priority atom is paced behind then assign stereochemistry R or S Draw Rbromobutanol Assign
