Absolute and Relative Configuration the distinction Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Absolute ConfigurationRelative ConfigurationContributors and Attributions Learning Objective compare and contrast absolute configuration with relative configuration Absolute Configuration The absolute configuration at a chiral center in a molecule is a timeindependent and unambiguous symbolic description of the spatial arrangement of ligands groups bonded to the chiral center The chiral centers in and bear the same ligands abd and e However and are not superimposable on each other meaning that the arrangement of ligands around the chiral center in and in is different and are mirror images of each other meaning that the arrangement of ligands around the chiral center in is the exact opposite of that in Chiral centers in and are said to have opposite absolute configurations According to RS convention if the absolute configuration at the chiral center in is R that at the chiral center in is S or vice versa Relative Configuration The relative configuration is the experimentally determined relationship between two enantiomers even though we may not know the absolute configuration The sign of rotation of planepolarized light by an enantiomer is not easily related to its configuration This is true even for substances with very similar structures Thus given lactic acid with a specific rotation and methyl lactate with a specific rotation we cannot tell from the rotation alone whether the acid and ester have the same or a different arrangement of groups about the chiral center Their relative configurations have to be obtained by other means If we convert lactic acid into its methyl ester we can be reasonably certain that the ester will be related in configuration to the acid because esterification should not affect the configuration about the chiral carbon atom It happens that the methyl ester so obtained is levorotatory so we know that lactic acid and methyl lactate have the same relative configuration at the asymmetric carbon even if they possess opposite signs of optical rotation However we still do not know the absolute configuration that is we are unable to tell which of the two possible configurations of lactic acid or corresponds to the dextro or acid and which to the levo or acid Until the absolute configuration of no optically active compound was known Instead configurations were assigned relative to a standard glyceraldehyde which originally was chosen by E Fischer around for the purpose of correlating the configuration of carbohydrates Fischer arbitrarily assigned the configuration to dextrorotatory glyceraldehyde which was known as glyceraldehyde The levorotatory enantiomer is designated as glyceraldehyde If you are unsure of the terminology and or of the rules for writing Fischer projection formulas review Sections C and The configurations of many compounds besides sugars now have been related to glyceraldehyde including amino acids terpenes steroids and other biochemically important substances Compounds whose configurations are related to glyceraldehyde are said to belong to the series and those related to glyceraldehyde belong to the series At the time the choice of absolute configuration for glyceraldehyde was made there was no way of knowing whether the configuration of glyceraldehyde was in reality or However the choice had a chance of being correct and we now know that the configuration is in fact the correct configuration of glyceraldehyde This was established through use of a special xray crystallographic technique which permitted determination of the absolute disposition of the atoms in space of sodium rubidium tartrate The configuration of tartaric acid Section previously had been shown by chemical means to be opposite to that of glyceraldehyde Consequently the absolute configuration of any compound now is known once it has been correlated directly or indirectly with glyceraldehyde For example Figure below whereby the configuration of lactic acid is related to the amino acid alanine Because lactic acid has been related to glyceraldehyde it follows that the absolute configurations are lactic acid and alanine Chemical transformation showing how the configuration of natural alanine has been related to lactic acid and hence to glyceraldehyde The transformations shown involve two reactions each of which is stereospecific and inverts the configuration Section Reduction of the azide group leaves the configuration unchanged When there are several chiral carbons in a molecule the configuration at one center usually is related directly or indirectly to glyceraldehyde and the configurations at the other centers are determined relative to the first Thus in the aldehyde form of the important sugar glucose there are four chiral centers and so there are possible stereoisorners The projection formula of the isomer that corresponds to the aldehyde form of natural glucose is By convention for sugars the configuration of the highestnumbered chiral carbon is referred to glyceraldehyde to determine the overall configuration of the molecule For glucose this atom is next to the group and has the hydroxyl group on the right Therefore naturally occurring glucose which has a rotation belongs to the series and is properly called glucose However the configurations of amino acids possessing more than one chiral carbon are determined by the lowestnumbered chiral carbon which is the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group Thus even though the natural amino acid threonine has exactly the same kind of arrangement of substituents as the natural sugar threose threonine by the aminoacid convention belongs to the series whereas threose by the sugar convention belongs to the series A serious ambiguity arises for compounds such as the active tartaric acids If the aminoacid convention is used tartaric acid falls in the series by the sugar convention it has the configuration One way out of this dilemma is to use the subscripts and to denote the aminoacid or carbohydrate conventions respectively Then the absolute configuration of tartaric acid can be designated as either tartaric acid of tartaric acid Contributors and Attributions Gamini Gunawardena from the OChemPal site Utah Valley University John D Robert and Marjorie C
