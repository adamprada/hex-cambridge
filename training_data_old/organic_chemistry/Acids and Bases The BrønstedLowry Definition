of an acid and identify the conjugate acid of a base Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below BrønstedLowry acid BrønstedLowry base conjugate acid conjugate base Study Notes You should already be familiar with the BrønstedLowry concept of acidity and the differences between strong and weak acids You may wish to review this topic before proceeding In chemists Johannes Brønsted and Martin Lowry independently developed definitions of acids and bases based on compounds abilities to either donate or accept protons H ions Here acids are defined as being able to donate protons in the form of hydrogen ions whereas bases are defined as being able to accept protons This took the Arrhenius definition one step further as water is no longer required to be present in the solution for acid and base reactions to occur BrønstedLowry Definition JN Brønsted and TM Lowry independently developed the theory of proton donors and proton acceptors in acidbase reactions coincidentally in the same region and during the same year The Arrhenius theory where acids and bases are defined by whether the molecule produces hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion when dissolved in water was too limiting because not all chemical reactions especially organic reactions occur in water The BrønstedLowry Theory defines an acid a proton donor while a base is a proton acceptor This is illustrated in the following reactions HAZAHZ Acid Base Donates hydrogen ions Accepts hydrogen ions HOH HO Cl HOH NH NH OH The determination of a substance as a BrønstedLowry acid or base can only be done by examining the reaction since many chemicals can be either an acid or a base For example HOH is a base in the first reaction and an acid in the second reaction To determine whether a substance is an acid or a base count the hydrogens on each substance before and after the reaction If the number of hydrogens has decreased then that substance is the acid donates hydrogen ions If the number of hydrogens has increased then that substance is the base accepts hydrogen ions These definitions are normally applied to the reactants on the left If the reaction is viewed in reverse a new acid and base can be identified The substances on the right side of the equation are called the conjugate acid and conjugate base compared to those on the left Also note that an acid turns into a conjugate base and the base turns into the conjugate acid after the reaction is over Conjugate AcidBase Pairs In aqueous solutions acids and bases can be defined in terms of the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base Thus for every acidic species in an aqueous solution there exists a species derived from the acid by the loss of a proton These two species that differ by only a proton constitute a conjugate acidbase pair For example in the reaction of HCl with water shown below HCl the parent acid donates a proton to a water molecule the parent base thereby forming Cl Thus HCl and Cl constitute a conjugate acidbase pair By convention we always write a conjugate acidbase pair as the acid followed by its conjugate base In the reverse reaction the Cl ion in solution acts as a base to accept a proton from HO forming HO and HCl Thus HO and HO constitute a second conjugate acidbase pair In general any acidbase reaction must contain two conjugate acidbase pairs which in this case are HClCl and HOHO All acidbase reactions contain two conjugate acidbase pairs Similarly in the reaction of acetic acid with water acetic acid donates a proton to water which acts as the base In the reverse reaction HO is the acid that donates a proton to the acetate ion which acts as the base Once again we have two conjugate acidbase pairs the parent acid and its conjugate base CHCOHCHCO and the parent base and its conjugate acid HOHO In the reaction of ammonia with water to give ammonium ions and hydroxide ions ammonia acts as a base by accepting a proton from a water molecule which in this case means that water is acting as an acid In the reverse reaction an ammonium ion acts as an acid by donating a proton to a hydroxide ion and the hydroxide ion acts as a base The conjugate acidbase pairs for this reaction are NHNH and HOOH Example Aniline CHNH is slightly soluble in water It has a nitrogen atom that can accept a hydrogen ion from a water molecule just like the nitrogen atom in ammonia does Write the chemical equation for this reaction and identify the BrønstedLowry acid and base Solution CHNH and HO are the reactants When CHNH accepts a proton from HO it gains an extra H and a positive charge and leaves an OH ion behind The reaction is as follows Because CHNH accepts a proton it is the BrønstedLowry base The HO molecule because it donates a proton is the BrønstedLowry acid Example Identify the conjugate acidbase pairs in this equilibrium Solution One pair is HO and OH where HO has one more H and is the conjugate acid while OH has one less H and is the conjugate base The other pair consists of CHN and CHNH where CHNH is the conjugate acid it has an additional proton and CHN is the conjugate base Some common conjugate acidbase pairs are shown in Figure The strongest acids are at the bottom left and the strongest bases are at the top right The conjugate base of a strong acid is a very weak base and conversely the conjugate acid of a strong base is a very weak acid Figure The Relative Strengths of Some Common Conjugate AcidBase Pairs Exercises Identify the BrønstedLowry acids and bases in the reactions given below cesfCHCHO HO CHCHOH OH
