Aldehydes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions The suffix al is appended to the name of the hydrocarbon corresponding to the longest carbon chain that includes the aldehyde carbon Remember that alkane al becomes alkanal with the e omitted and because the al function is necessarily at the is redundant and is omitted Dialdehydes are named as dials Thus is hexanedial The simplest aldehyde is methanal which is familiarly known as formaldehyde However when aldehydes are named as derivatives of methanal they usually are called carbaldehydes and the suffix carbaldehyde refers to the group This system is used where the hydrocarbon group is not a chain but a ring and the group can be thought of as a onecarbon chain When the group is a substituent on the parent chain or ring and it ranks below another functional group it properly is designated by the prefix methanoyl However the prefix formyl also is used The naming of acids will be discussed more in detail in Section Trivial names are used for many simple aldehydes some of which are shown below in parentheses Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
