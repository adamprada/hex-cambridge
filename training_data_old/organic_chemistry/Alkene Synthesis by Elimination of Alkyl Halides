Alkene Synthesis by Elimination of Alkyl Halides Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Alkene Synthesis by Elimination of Alkyl Halides Learning Objective interpret and draw reaction energy diagrams for dehydrohalogenation of RXs propose mechanisms for a dehydrohalogenation reactions predict the products and specify the reagents for alkene synthesis from dehydrohalogenation of RXs predict and explain the stereochemistry of E eliminations to form alkenes especially from cyclohexanes Alkene Synthesis by Elimination of Alkyl Halides is discussed in detail in chapter sections The major learning objectives are summarized briefly in this section Alkene Synthesis by Elimination of Alkyl Halides When considering whether an elimination reaction is likely to occur via an E or E mechanism we really need to consider three factors The base strong bases favor the E mechanism whereas E mechanisms only require a weak base The solvent good ionizing xolvents polar protic favor the E mechanism by stabilizing the carbocation intermediate The alkyl halide primary alkyl halides have the only structure useful in distinguishing between the E and E pathways Since primary carbocations do not form only the E mechanism is possible Reaction Parameter E E alkyl halide structure tertiary secondary primary tertiary secondary primary nucleophile high concentration of a strong base weak base mechanism step step rate limiting step anticoplanar bimolecular transition state carbocation formation rate law rate kRXBase rate kRX stereochemisty retained configuration mixed configuration solvent not important polar protic
