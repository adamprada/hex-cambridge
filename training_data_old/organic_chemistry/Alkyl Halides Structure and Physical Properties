in an alkane have been replaced by halogen atoms fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine We will only look at compounds containing one halogen atom like th compounds below Alkyl halides fall into different classes depending on how the halogen atom is positioned on the chain of carbon atoms Alkyl halides can be classified as primary secondary or tertiary The chemical reactivity of alkyl halides is frequently discussed using alkyl halide classifications to help discern patterns and trends Because the neutral bonding pattern for halogens is one bond and three lone pairs the carbon and halogen always share a single bond Alkyl halide classification is determined by the bonding pattern of the carbon atom bonded to the halogen as shown in the diagram below Primary alkyl halides In a primary haloalkane the carbon bonded to the halogen atom is only attached to one other alkyl group Some examples of primary alkyl halides include thecompounds below Notice that it doesnt matter how complicated the attached alkyl group is In each case there is only one linkage to an alkyl group from the CH group holding the halogen There is an exception to this CHBr and the other methyl halides are often counted as primary alkyl halides even though there are no alkyl groups attached to the carbon with the halogen on it Secondary alkyl halides In a secondary haloalkane the carbon bonded with the halogen atom is joined directly to two other alkyl groups that can be the same or different Some examples of secondary alkyl halides include thecompounds below Tertiary alkyl halides In a tertiary halogenoalkane the carbon atom holding the halogen is attached directly to three alkyl groups which may be any combination of same or different Some examples of tertiary alkyl halides include thecompounds below Common Names Many organic compounds are closely related to the alkanes and this similarity is incorporated into many common names The reactions of alkanes with halogens produce halogenated hydrocarbons compounds in which one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon have been replaced by halogen atoms The replacement of only one hydrogen atom gives an alkyl halide or haloalkane The common names of alkyl halides consist of two parts the name of the alkyl group plus the stem of the name of the halogen with the ending ide Examples Give the common and IUPAC names for each compound CHCHCHBr CHCHCl Give the IUPAC name for each compound a b SolutionS The alkyl group CHCHCH is a propyl group and the halogen is bromine Br The common name is therefore propyl bromide For the IUPAC name the prefix for bromine bromo is combined with the name for a threecarbon chain propane preceded by a number identifying the carbon atom to which the Br atom is attached so the IUPAC name is bromopropane The alkyl group CHCH has three carbon atoms with a chlorine Cl atom attached to the middle carbon atom The alkyl group is therefore isopropyl and the common name of the compound is isopropyl chloride For the IUPAC name the Cl atom prefix chloro attached to the middle second carbon atom of a propane chain results in chloropropane a The parent alkane has five carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain it is pentane A bromo Br group is attached to the second carbon atom of the chain The IUPAC name is bromopentane b The parent alkane is hexane Methyl CH and bromo Br groups are attached to the second and fourth carbon atoms respectively Listing the substituents in alphabetical order gives the name bromomethylhexane Exercise Give common and IUPAC names for each compound CHCHI CHCHCHCHF Give the IUPAC name for each compound a b Answer a ethyl iodide and iodoethane respectively Note the IUPAC name does not need a locator number because there is only one possible structure with two carbons and one iodine b butyl fluoride and fluorobutane a chloromethylbutane b bromochloromethylpentane Halogens and the Character of the CarbonHalogen Bond With respect to electronegativity halogens are more electronegative than carbons This results in a carbonhalogen bond that is polarized As shown in the image below carbon atom has a partial positive charge while the halogen has a partial negative charge The following image shows the relationship between the halogens and electronegativity Notice as we move up the periodic table from iodine to fluorine electronegativity increases The following image shows the relationships between bond length bond strength and molecular size As we progress down the periodic table from fluorine to iodine molecular size increases As a result we also see an increase in bond length Conversely as molecular size increases and we get longer bonds the strength of those bonds decreases Haloalkanes Have Higher Boiling Points than Alkanes When comparing alkanes and haloalkanes we will see that haloalkanes have higher boiling points than alkanes containing the same number of carbons London dispersion forces are the first of two types of forces that contribute to this physical property You might recall from general chemistry that London dispersion forces increase with molecular surface area In comparing haloalkanes with alkanes haloalkanes exhibit an increase in surface area due to the substitution of a halogen for hydrogen The incease in surface area leads to an increase in London dispersion forces which then results in a higher boiling point Dipoledipole interaction is the second type of force that contributes to a higher boiling point As you may recall this type of interaction is a coulombic attraction between the partial positive and partial negative charges that exist between carbonhalogen bonds on separate haloalkane molecules Similar to London dispersion forces dipoledipole interactions establish a higher boiling point for haloalkanes in comparison to alkanes with the same number of carbons The table below illustrates how boiling points are affected by some of these properties Notice that the boiling point increases when hydrogen is replaced by a halogen a consequence of the increase in molecular size as well as an increase in both London dispersion forces and dipoledipole attractions The boiling point also increases as a result of increasing the size of the halogen as well as increasing the size of the carbon chain Solubility Solubility in water Alkyl halides have little to no solubility in water in spite of the polar carbonhalogen bond The attraction between the alkyl halide molecules is stronger than the attraction between the alkyl halide and water Alkyl halides have little to no solubility in water but be aware of densities Polyhalogenated alkanes such as dichloromethane can have densities greater than water Solubility in organic solvents Alkyl halides are soluble in most organic solvents The London Dispersion forces play a dominant role in solubility Exercises Exercise Classify primary secondary tertiary vicinal or geminal and give
