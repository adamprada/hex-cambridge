Alkylation of Acetylide Anions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of AcetylidesNucleophilic Addition of Acetylides to CarbonylsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to write an equation to describe the reaction of an acetylide ion with an alkyl halide discuss the importance of the reaction between acetylide ions and alkyl halides as a method of extending a carbon chain identify the alkyne and hence the acetylide ion and the alkyl halide needed to synthesize a given alkyne determine whether or not the reaction of an acetylide ion with a given alkyl halide will result in substitution or elimination and draw the structure of the product formed in either case Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below alkylation Study Notes The alkylation of acetylide ions is important in organic synthesis because it is a reaction in which a new carboncarbon bond is formed hence it can be used when an organic chemist is trying to build a complicated molecule from much simpler starting materials The alkyl halide used in this reaction must be primary Thus if you were asked for a suitable synthesis of dimethylhexyne you would choose to attack iodoethane with the anion of dimethylbutyne rather than to attack iodomethylpropane with the anion of butyne The reasons will be made clear in Chapter Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of Acetylides Acetylide anions are strong bases and strong nucleophiles Therefore they are able to displace halides and other leaving groups in substitution reactions The product is a substituted alkyne Because the ion is a very strong base the substitution reaction is most efficient with methyl or primary halides without substitution near the reaction center Secondary tertiary or even bulky primary substrates will give elimination by the E mechanism Nucleophilic Addition of Acetylides to Carbonyls Acetylide anions will add to aldehydes and ketones to form alkoxides which upon protonation give propargyl alcohols With aldehydes and nonsymmetric ketones in the absence of chiral catalyst the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers Exercises The pKa of ammonia is Estimate the equilibrium constant for the deprotonation of pentyne by amide as shown above Answers Assuming the pKa of pentyne is about then the difference in pKas is Since pentyne is more acidic the formation of the acetylide will be favored at equilibrium so the equilibrium constant for the reaction is about Questions Q Give the possible reactants for the following formations Q Propose a synthetic route to produce pentene from propyne and an alkyl halide Solutions S S Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Prof Paul G Wenthold Purdue University
