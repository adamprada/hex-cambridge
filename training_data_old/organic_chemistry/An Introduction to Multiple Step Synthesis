regiochemistry and stereochemistry using the reactions studied to date Introduction The study of organic chemistry introduces students to a wide range of interrelated reactions Alkenes for example may be converted to structurally similar alkanes alcohols alkyl halides epoxides glycols and boranes cleaved to smaller aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids and enlarged by carbocation and radical additions as well as cycloadditions Most of these reactions are shown in the Alkene Reaction Map below All of these products may be subsequently transformed into a host of new compounds incorporating a wide variety of functional groups Consequently the logical conception of a multistep synthesis for the construction of a designated compound from a specified starting material becomes one of the most challenging problems that may be posed Functional group reaction maps like the one below for alkenes can be helpful in designing multistep syntheses It can be helpful to build and design your own reaction maps for each functional group studied Alkene Reaction Map Please note The reagents for each chemical transformation have been intentionally omitted so that this map can be used as a study tool The answers are provided at the end of this section as part of the exercises Simple MultiStep Syntheses A one or two step sequence of simple reactions is not that difficult to deduce For example the synthesis of mesohexanediol from hexyne can occur by more than one multistep pathway One approach would be to reduce the alkyne to cis or transhexene before undertaking glycol formation Permanaganate or osmium tetroxide hydroxylation of cishexene would form the desired meso isomer From transhexene it would be necessary to first epoxidize the alkene with a peracid followed by ring opening with acidic or basic hydrolysis Longer multistep syntheses require careful analysis and thought since many options need to be considered Like an expert chess player evaluating the long range pros and cons of potential moves the chemist must appraise the potential success of various possible reaction paths focusing on the scope and limitations constraining each of the individual reactions being employed The skill is acquired by practice experience and often trial and error Thinking it Through with Examples The following three examples illustrate strategies for developing multistep syntheses from the reactions studied in the first ten chapters of this text It is helpful to systematically look for structural changes beginning with the carbon chain and brainstorm relevant functional group conversion reactions Retrosynthesis is the approach of working backwards from the product to the starting material In the first example we are asked to synthesize butanol from acetylene The carbon chain doubles in size indicating an acetylide SN reaction with an alkyl halide Primary alcohol formation from an antiMarkovnikov alkene hydration reaction hydroborationoxidation is more likely than a substitution reaction Applying retrosynthesis we work backwards from the alcohol to the alkene to the alkyne from an acetylide reaction that initially builds the carbon chain RetroSynthesis Working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each transformation identified from the retrosynthesis The ethylbromide must also be derived from acetylene so multiple reaction pathways are combined as shown below In the second example we are asked to synthesize dibromobutane from acetylene Once again there is an increase in the carbon chain length indicating an acetylide SN reaction with an alkyl halide similar to the first example The hydrohalogenation can be subtle to discern because the hydrogen atoms are not shown in bondline structures Comparing the chemical formulas of butyne with dibromobutane there is a difference of two H atoms and two Br atoms indicating hydrohalogenation and not halogenation The addition of both bromine atoms to the same carbon atom also supports the idea that hydrohalogenation occurs on an alkyne and not an alkene The formation of the geminal dihalide also indicates hydrohalogenation instead of halogenatioin because halogenation produces vicinal dihalides With this insight the retrosynthesis indicates the following series of chemical transformations RetroSynthesis Working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each transformation In the third example we are asked to produce oxoheptanal from methylcyclohexane Counting the carbons the starting material and product both contain seven carbon atoms and there is a cleavage reaction of an alkene under reductive conditions One important missing aspect of this reaction is a good leaving group LG Alkanes are chemically quite boring We can burn them as fuel or perform freeradical halogenation to create alkyl halides with excellent leaving groups With these observations the following retrosynthesis is reasonable RetroSynthesis Working forwards we specify the reagents needed for each reaction For the initial freeradical halogenation of the alkane we have the option of chlorine Cl or bromine Br Because methylcyclohexane has several different classifications of carbons the selectivity of Br is more important than the faster reactivity of Cl An strong base with heat can be used for the second step to follow an E mechanism and form methylcyclohexene The aldhyde group on the final product indicates gentle oxidative cleavage by any of several reaction pathways These reactions can be combined in to the following multistep synthesis Reaction Maps to Build Functional Group Conversion Mastery After working through the examples above we can see how important it is to memorize all of the functional group reactions studied in the first ten chapters We can apply the knowledge of these reactions to the wisdom of multistep syntheses Please note The reagents for each chemical transformation have been intentionally omitted so that these maps can be used as a study tools The answers are provided at the end of this section as part of the exercises Alkane and Alkyl Halide Reaction Map Alkyne Reaction Map Exercise Starting at hexyne predict synthetic
