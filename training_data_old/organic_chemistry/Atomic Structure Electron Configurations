groundstate electron configuration for each of the elements up to and including atomic number Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below groundstate electronic configuration Hunds rule Pauli exclusion principle aufbau principle The electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells Commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Electron Configurations The electron configuration of an atom is the

but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Before assigning the electrons of an atom into orbitals one must become familiar with the basic concepts of electron configurations Every element on the periodic table consists of atoms which are composed of protons neutrons and electrons Electrons exhibit a negative charge and are found around the nucleus of the atom in electron orbitals defined as the volume of space in which the electron can be found within probability The four different types of orbitals spd and f have different shapes and one orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons The p d and f orbitals have different sublevels thus can hold more electrons As stated the electron configuration of each element is unique to its position on the periodic table The energy level is determined by the period and the number of electrons is given by the atomic number of the element Orbitals on different energy levels are similar to each other but they occupy different areas in space The s orbital and s orbital both have the characteristics of an s orbital radial nodes spherical volume probabilities can only hold two electrons etc but as they are found in different energy levels they occupy different spaces around the nucleus Each orbital can be represented by specific blocks on the periodic table The sblock is the region of the alkali metals including helium Groups the dblock are the transition metals Groups to the pblock are the main group elements from Groups to and the fblock are the lanthanides and actinides series Figure The Periodic Table Using the periodic table to determine the electron configurations of atoms is key but also keep in mind that there are certain rules to follow when assigning electrons to different orbitals The periodic table is an incredibly helpful tool in writing electron configurations For more information on how electron configurations and the periodic table are linked visit the Connecting Electrons to the Periodic Table module Rules for Assigning Electron Orbitals Pauli Exclusion Principle The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers The first three n l and ml may be the same but the fourth quantum number must be different A single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons which must have opposing spins otherwise they would have the same four quantum numbers which is forbidden One electron is spin up ms and the other would spin down ms This tells us that each subshell has double the electrons per orbital The s subshell has orbital that can hold up to electrons the p subshell has orbitals that can hold up to electrons the d subshell has orbitals that hold up to electrons and the f subshell has orbitals with electrons Example Hydrogen and Helium The first three quantum numbers of an electron are n l ml Only two electrons can correspond to these which would be either ms or ms As we already know from our studies of quantum numbers and electron orbitals we can conclude that these four quantum numbers refer to the s subshell If only one of the ms values are given then we would have s denoting hydrogen if both are given we would have s denoting helium Visually this is be represented as As shown the s subshell can hold only two electrons and when filled the electrons have opposite spins Hunds Rule When assigning electrons in orbitals each electron will first fill all the orbitals with similar energy also referred to as degenerate before pairing with another electron in a halffilled orbital Atoms at ground states tend to have as many unpaired electrons as possible When visualizing this processes think about how electrons are exhibiting the same behavior as the same poles on a magnet would if they came into contact as the negatively charged electrons fill orbitals they first try to get as far as possible from each other before having to pair up Example Oxygen and Nitrogen If we look at the correct electron configuration of the Nitrogen Z atom a very important element in the biology of plants s s p We can clearly see that p orbitals are halffilled as there are three electrons and three p orbitals This is because Hunds Rule states that the three electrons in the p subshell will fill all the empty orbitals first before filling orbitals with electrons in them If we look at the element after nitrogen in the same period oxygen Z its electron configuration is s s p for an atom Oxygen has one more electron than nitrogen and as the orbitals are all half filled the electron must pair up Occupation of Orbitals Electrons fill orbitals in a way to minimize the energy of the atom Therefore the electrons in an atom fill the principal energy levels in order of increasing energy the electrons are getting farther from the nucleus The relative energy of the orbitals is shown in Figure Figure The relative potential energy of atomic orbitals The order of levels filled is then s s p s p s d p s d p s f d p s f d and p The general order in which orbitals are filled is depicted in Figure Subshells corresponding to each value of n are written from left to right on successive horizontal lines where each row represents a row in the periodic table The order in which the orbitals are filled is indicated by the diagonal lines running from the upper right to the lower left Accordingly the s orbital is filled prior to the d orbital because of shielding and penetration effects Consequently the electron configuration of potassium which begins the fourth period is Ars and the configuration of calcium is Ars Five d orbitals are filled by the next elements the transition metals followed by three p orbitals Notice that the last member of this row is the noble gas krypton Z Arsdp Kr which has filled s d and p orbitals The fifth row of the periodic table is essentially the same as the fourth except that the s d and p orbitals are filled sequentially Figure Predicting the Order in Which Orbitals Are Filled in Multielectron Atoms If you write the subshells for each value of the principal quantum number on successive lines the observed order in which they are filled is indicated by a series of diagonal lines running from the upper right to the lower left The Aufbau Process Aufbau comes from the German word aufbauen meaning to build When writing electron configurations orbitals are built up from atom to atom When writing the electron configuration for an atom orbitals are filled in order of increasing atomic number However there are some exceptions to this rule Example rd row elements Following the pattern across a period from B Z to Ne Z the number of electrons increases and the subshells are filled This example focuses on the p subshell which fills from boron to neon B Z configuration s s p C Z configurations s p N Z configurations s p O Z configurations s p F Z configurations s p Ne Z configurations s p The Number of Valence Electrons The number of valence electrons of an element can be determined by the periodic table group vertical column in which the element is categorized With the exception of groups the transition metals the units digit of the group number identifies how many valence electrons are associated with a neutral atom of an element listed under that particular column For example in group the units digit is and elements in this group have valence electrons Table Valence electrons derived from periodic table group Periodic table group Valence electrons Group alkali metals Group alkaline earth metals Groups transition metals The s shell is complete and cannot hold any more electrons Group boron group Group carbon group Group pnictogens Group chalcogens Group halogens Group noble gases The general method for counting valence electrons is generally not useful for transition metals Instead the modified d electron count method is used Except for helium which has only two valence electrons The electron configuration of an element is the arrangement of its electrons in its atomic orbitals By knowing the electron configuration of an element we can predict and explain a great deal of its chemistry Example Draw an orbital diagram and use it to derive the electron configuration of phosphorus Z What is its valence electron configuration Given atomic number Asked for orbital diagram and valence electron configuration for phosphorus Strategy Locate the nearest noble gas preceding phosphorus in the periodic table Then subtract its number of electrons from those in phosphorus to obtain the number of valence electrons in phosphorus Referring to Figure draw an orbital diagram to represent those valence orbitals Following Hunds rule place the valence electrons in the available orbitals beginning with the orbital that is lowest in energy Write the electron configuration from your orbital diagram Ignore the inner orbitals those that correspond to the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas and write the valence electron configuration for phosphorus Solution A Because phosphorus is in the third row of the periodic table we know that it has a Ne closed shell with electrons We begin by subtracting electrons from the in phosphorus B The additional five electrons are placed in the next available orbitals which Figure tells us are the s and p orbitals Because the s orbital is lower in energy than the p orbitals we fill it first Hunds rule tells us that the remaining three electrons will occupy the degenerate p orbitals separately but with their spins aligned The electron configuration is Nesp C We obtain the valence electron configuration by ignoring the inner orbitals which for phosphorus means that we ignore the Ne closed shell This gives a valenceelectron configuration of sp Exercise Draw an orbital diagram and use it to derive the electron configuration of chlorine Z What is its valence electron configuration Answer Nesp sp The sixth row of the periodic table will be different from the preceding two because the f orbitals which can hold electrons are filled between the s and the d orbitals The elements that contain f orbitals in their valence shell are the lanthanides When the p orbitals are finally filled we have reached the next and last known noble gas radon Z Xesfdp Rn In the last row the f orbitals are filled between the s and the d orbitals which gives the actinide elements Because the large number of protons makes their nuclei unstable all the actinides are radioactive Example Write the electron configuration of mercury Z showing all the inner orbitals Given atomic number Asked for complete electron configuration Strategy Using the orbital diagram in Figure and the periodic table as a guide fill the orbitals until all electrons have been placed Solution By placing the electrons in orbitals following the order shown in Figure and using the periodic table as a guide we obtain s row electrons sp row electrons sp row electrons sdp row electrons sdp row electrons row electrons After filling the first five rows we still have more electrons to accommodate According to Figure we need to fill the s electrons f electrons and d electrons orbitals The result is mercurys electron configuration sspspsdpsdpsfd Hg Xesfd with a filled d subshell a sfd valence shell configuration and a total of electrons You should always check to be sure that the total number of electrons equals the atomic number Summary Based on the Pauli principle and a knowledge of orbital energies obtained using hydrogenlike orbitals it is possible to construct the periodic table by filling up the available orbitals beginning with the lowestenergy orbitals the aufbau principle which gives rise to a particular arrangement of electrons for each element its electron configuration Hunds rule says that the lowestenergy arrangement of electrons is the one that places them in degenerate orbitals with their spins parallel For chemical purposes the most important electrons are those in the outermost principal shell the valence electrons Exercises Write the electron configuration for carbon and draw the orbital diagram How many valence electrons do Nitrogen Carbon and Chlorine have
