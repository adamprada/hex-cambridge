able to describe the physical significance of an orbital list the atomic orbitals from s to d in order of increasing energy sketch the shapes of s and p orbitals Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below nodal plane node orbital quantum mechanics wave function For a refresher on quantum numbers view this text Atomic Orbitals An orbital is the quantum mechanical refinement of Bohrs orbit In contrast to his concept of a simple circular orbit with a fixed radius orbitals are mathematically derived regions of space with different probabilities of having an electron One way of representing electron probability distributions was illustrated in Figure for the s orbital of hydrogen Because Ψ gives the probability of finding an electron in a given volume of space such as a cubic picometer a plot of Ψ versus distance from the nucleus r is a plot of the probability density The s orbital is spherically symmetrical so the probability of finding a s electron at any given point depends only on its distance from the nucleus The probability density is greatest at r at the nucleus and decreases steadily with increasing distance At very large values of r the electron probability density is very small but not zero In contrast we can calculate the radial probability the probability of finding a s electron at a distance r from the nucleus by adding together the probabilities of an electron being at all points on a series of x spherical shells of radius r r r rx rx In effect we are dividing the atom into very thin concentric shells much like the layers of an onion part a in Figure and calculating the probability of finding an electron on each spherical shell Recall that the electron probability density is greatest at r part b in Figure so the density of dots is greatest for the smallest spherical shells in part a in Figure In contrast the surface area of each spherical shell is equal to πr which increases very rapidly with increasing r part c in Figure Because the surface area of the spherical shells increases more rapidly with increasing r than the electron probability density decreases the plot of radial probability has a maximum at a particular distance part d in Figure Most important when r is very small the surface area of a spherical shell is so small that the total probability of finding an electron close to the nucleus is very low at the nucleus the electron probability vanishes part d in Figure Figure Most Probable Radius for the Electron in the Ground State of the Hydrogen Atom a Imagine dividing the atoms total volume into very thin concentric shells as shown in the onion drawing b A plot of electron probability density Ψ versus r shows that the electron probability density is greatest at r and falls off smoothly with increasing r The density of the dots is therefore greatest in the innermost shells of the onion c The surface area of each shell given by πr increases rapidly with increasing r d If we count the number of dots in each spherical shell we obtain the total probability of finding the electron at a given value of r Because the surface area of each shell increases more rapidly with increasing r than the electron probability density decreases a plot of electron probability versus r the radial probability shows a peak This peak corresponds to the most probable radius for the electron pm which is exactly the radius predicted by Bohrs model of the hydrogen atom For the hydrogen atom the peak in the radial probability plot occurs at r Å pm which is exactly the radius calculated by Bohr for the n orbit Thus the most probable radius obtained from quantum mechanics is identical to the radius calculated by classical mechanics In Bohrs model however the electron was assumed to be at this distance of the time whereas in the quantum mechanical Schrödinger model it is at this distance only some of the time The difference between the two models is attributable to the wavelike behavior of the electron and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle Figure compares the electron probability densities for the hydrogen s s and s orbitals Note that all three are spherically symmetrical For the s and s orbitals however and for all other s orbitals as well the electron probability density does not fall off smoothly with increasing r Instead a series of minima and maxima are observed in the radial probability plots part c in Figure The minima correspond to spherical nodes regions of zero electron probability which alternate with spherical regions of nonzero electron probability Figure Probability Densities for the s s and s Orbitals of the Hydrogen Atom a The electron probability density in any plane that contains the nucleus is shown Note the presence of circular regions or nodes where the probability density is zero b Contour surfaces enclose of the electron probability which illustrates the different sizes of the s s and s orbitals The cutaway drawings give partial views of the internal spherical nodes The orange color corresponds to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is positive and the blue color corresponds to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is negative c In these plots of electron probability as a function of distance from the nucleus r in all directions radial probability the most probable radius increases as n increases but the s and s orbitals have regions of significant electron probability at small values of r s Orbitals Three things happen to s orbitals as n increases Figure They become larger extending farther from the nucleus They contain more nodes This is similar to a standing wave that has regions of significant amplitude separated by nodes points with zero amplitude For a given atom the s orbitals also become higher in energy as n increases because of their increased distance from the nucleus Orbitals are generally drawn as threedimensional surfaces that enclose of the electron density as was shown for the hydrogen s s and s orbitals in part b in Figure Although such drawings show the relative sizes of the orbitals they do not normally show the spherical nodes in the s and s orbitals because the spherical nodes lie inside the surface Fortunately the positions of the spherical nodes are not important for chemical bonding p Orbitals Only s orbitals are spherically symmetrical As the value of l increases the number of orbitals in a given subshell increases and the shapes of the orbitals become more complex Because the p subshell has l with three values of ml and there are three p orbitals Figure the colors correspond to regions of space where the phase of the wave function is positive orange and negative blue The electron probability distribution for one of the hydrogen p orbitals is shown in Figure Because this orbital has two lobes of electron density arranged along the z axis with an electron density of zero in the xy plane ie the xy plane is a nodal plane it is a pz orbital As shown in Figure the other two p orbitals have identical shapes but they lie along the x axis px and y axis py respectively Note that each p orbital has just one nodal plane In each case the phase of the wave function for each of the p orbitals is positive for the lobe that points along the positive axis and negative for the lobe that points along the negative axis It is important to emphasize that these signs correspond to the phase of the wave that describes the electron motion not to positive or negative charges Figure The Three Equivalent p Orbitals of the Hydrogen Atom The surfaces shown enclose of the total electron probability for the px py and pz orbitals Each orbital is oriented along the axis indicated by the subscript and a nodal plane that is perpendicular to that axis bisects each p orbital The phase of the wave function is positive orange in the region of space where x y or z is positive and negative blue where x y or z is negative Just as with the s orbitals the size and complexity of the p orbitals for any atom increase as the principal quantum number n increases The shapes of the probability surfaces of the p p and higherenergy p orbitals are however essentially the same as those shown in Figure The electron configuration of an atom is the representation of the arrangement of electrons distributed among the orbital shells and subshells Commonly the electron configuration is used to describe the orbitals of an atom in its ground state but it can also be used to represent an atom that has ionized into a cation or anion by compensating with the loss of or gain of electrons in their subsequent orbitals Many of the physical and chemical properties of elements can be correlated to their unique electron configurations The valence electrons electrons in the outermost shell are the determining factor for the unique chemistry of the element Exercises What Kind of orbital is show below Of s s or s which is furthest from the nucleus Of s s or s which is the lowest in energy What is the l value for a p orbital Solutions Pz There are three p orbitals each of which is orientated on a line in a d coordinate system This orbial has one node so it is a p orbital and it is orientated on the Z axis so it is a Pz orbial s As the N value of an orbital inreases its distance from the nucleus also increases s As the N value of an orbital decreases the electrons in the orbial come closer to the nucleus This makes the orbital lower in energy l is equal to for all p orbitals Q Label the following
