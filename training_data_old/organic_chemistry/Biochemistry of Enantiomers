Biochemistry of Enantiomers Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Some Chiral Organic BiomoleculesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective recognize and explain biochemical applications of chirality Some Chiral Organic Biomolecules There are a number of important biomolecules that could occur as enantiomers including amino acids and sugars In most cases only one enantiomer occurs although some fungi for example are able to produce mirrorimage forms of these compounds We will look later at some of these biomolecules but first we will look at a compound that occurs naturally in both enantiomeric forms Carvone is a secondary metabolite That means it is a naturallyoccurring compound that is not directly connected to the very basic functions of a cell such as selfreplication or the production of energy The role of secondary metabolites in nature is often difficult to determine However these compounds often play roles in selfdefense acting as deterrents against competitor species in a sort of smallscale chemical warfare scenario They are also frequently used in communications this role has been studied most extensively among insects which use lots of compounds to send information to each other The two naturallyoccurring enantiomers of carvone Carvone is produced in two enantiomeric forms One of these forms called carvone is found in mint leaves and it is a principal contributor to the distinctive odor of mint The other form carvone is found in caraway seeds This form has a very different smell and is typically used to flavor rye bread and other Eastern European foods Note that carvone is the same thing as Scarvone The designation is based on its positive optical rotation value which is experimentally measured The S designation is determined by the CahnIngoldPrelog rules for designating stereochemistry which deal with looking at the groups attached to a chiral center and assigning priority based on atomic number However carvones chiral center actually has three carbons attached to it they all have the same atomic number We need a new rule to break the tie If two substituent groups have the same atomic number go one bond further to the next atom If there is a difference among the second tier of atoms stop The group in which you have encountered a higher atomic number gets the highest priority If there is not a clear difference proceed one additional bond to the next set of atoms and so on until you find a difference In carvone this decision tree works as follows The chiral center is connected to a H a C a C and a C The H is lowest priority One C eventually leads to a CO However at the second bond from the chiral center this C is connected to a C and two Hs A second C is also part of the sixmembered ring but the CO is farther away in this direction At the second bond from the chiral center this C is connected to a C and two Hs just like the first one The third C is part of a little threecarbon group attached to the sixmembered ring At the second bond from the chiral center it is connected to only one H and has two bonds to another C this is counted as two bonds to C and one to H Those first two carbon groups are identical so far However the third group is different it has an extra bond to C whereas the others have an extra bond to H C has a higher atomic number than H so this group has higher priority The secondhighest priority is the branch that reaches the oxygen at the third bond from the chiral center Comparing atoms stepbystep to assign configuration How different exactly are these two compounds and carvone Are they completely different isomers with different physical properties In most ways the answer is no These two compounds have the same appearance colorless oil the same boiling point C the same refractive index and specific gravity However they have optical rotations that are almost exactly opposite values Two enantiomers have the same physical properties Enantiomers have opposite optical rotations Clearly they have different biological properties since they have slightly different odors they must fit into slightly different nasal receptors signaling to the brain whether the person next to you is chewing a stick of gum or a piece of rye bread This different shape complimentarity is not surprising just as it isnt surprising that a left hand only fits into a left handed baseball glove and not into a right handed one Thalidomide There are other reasons that we might concern ourselves with an understanding of enantiomers apart from dietary and olfactory preferences Perhaps the most dramatic example of the importance of enantiomers can be found in the case of thalidomide Thalidomide was a drug commonly prescribed during the s and s in order to alleviate nausea and other symptoms of morning sickness In fact only one enantiomer of thalidomide had any therapeutic effect in this regard The other enantiomer apart from being therapeutically useless in this application was subsequently found to be a teratogen meaning it produces pronounced birth defects This was obviously not a good thing to prescribe to pregnant women Workers in the pharmaceutical industry are now much more aware of these kinds of consequences although of course not all problems with drugs go undetected even through the extensive clinical trials required in the United States Since the era of thalidomide however a tremendous amount of research in the field of synthetic organic chemistry has been devoted to methods of producing only one enantiomer of a useful compound and not the other This effort probably represents the single biggest aim of synthetic organic chemistry through the last quarter century Enantiomers may have very different biological properties Obtaining enantiomerically pure compounds is very important in medicine and the pharmaceutical industry Exercises Draw the two enantiomeric forms of butanol CHCHOHCHCH Label their configurations Sometimes compounds have many chiral centers in them For the following compounds identify four chiral centers in each mark them with asterisks and identify each center as R or S configuration The following is the structure of dysinosin A a potent thrombin inhibitor that consequently prevents blood clotting Ginkgolide B below is a secondary metabolite of the ginkgo tree extracts of which are used in Chinese medicine Sanglifehrin A shown below is produced by a bacteria that may be found in the soil of coffee plantations in Malawi It is also a promising candidate for the treatment of organ transplant patients owing to its potent immunosuppressant activity Solution Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State
