Biological Substitution Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Leaving Groups in Biochemical ReactionsSAM Methyltransferases Objective discuss the importance of leaving groups in biological substitution reactions Leaving Groups in Biochemical Reactions In biological reactions we do not often see halides serving as leaving groups in fact outside of some marine organisms halogens are fairly unusual in biological molecules More common leaving groups in biochemical reactions are phosphates water alcohols and thiols In many cases the leaving group is protonated by an acidic group on the enzyme as bondbreaking occurs For example hydroxide ion itself seldom acts as a leaving group it is simply too high in energy too basic Rather the hydroxide oxygen is generally protonated by an enzymatic acid before or during the bondbreaking event resulting in a very stable water leaving group More often however the hydroxyl group of an alcohol is first converted enzymatically to a phosphate ester in order to create a better leaving group This phosphate ester can take the form of a simple monophosphate arrow in the figure below a diphosphate arrow or a nucleotide monophosphate arrow Due to resonance delocalization of the developing negative charge phosphates are excellent leaving groups Heres a specific example from DNA nucleotide biosynthesis Here the OH group on ribofuranose is converted to a diphosphate a much better leaving group Ammonia is the nucleophile in the second step of this SNlike reaction What is important for now is that in each case an alcohol has been converted into a much better leaving group and is now primed for a nucleophilic substitution reaction SAM Methyltransferases Some of the most important examples of SN reactions in biochemistry are those catalyzed by Sadenosyl methionine SAM dependent methyltransferase enzymes We have already seen in chapter and again in chapter how a methyl group is transferred in an SN reaction from SAM to the amine group on the nucleotide base adenosine Nucleic Acids Res Another SAMdependent methylation reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called catecholOmethyltransferase The substrate here is epinephrine also known as adrenaline Notice that in this example the attacking nucleophile is an alcohol rather than an amine thats why the enzyme is called an Omethyltransferase In both cases though a basic amino acid side chain is positioned in the active site in just the right place to deprotonate the nucleophilic group as it attacks increasing its nucleophilicity The electrophile in both reactions is a methyl carbon so there is little steric hindrance to slow down the nucleophilic attack The methyl carbon is electrophilic because it is bonded to a positivelycharged sulfur which is a powerful electron withdrawing group The positive charge on the sulfur also makes it an excellent leaving group as the resulting product will be a neutral and very stable sulfide All in all in both reactions we have a reasonably good nucleophile an electronpoor unhindered electrophile and an excellent leaving group Because the electrophilic carbon in these reactions is a methyl carbon a stepwise SNlike mechanism is extremely unlikely a methyl carbocation is very high in energy and thus is not a reasonable intermediate to propose We can confidently predict that this reaction is SN Does this SN reaction occur as expected with inversion of stereochemistry Of course the electrophilic methyl carbon in these reactions is achiral so inversion is not apparent To demonstrate inversion the following experiment has been carried out with catecholOmethyltransferase Here the methyl group of SAM was made to be chiral by incorporating hydrogen isotopes tritium H T and deuterium H D The researchers determined that the reaction occurred with inversion of configuration as expected for an SN displacement J Biol Chem Example Contributors Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
