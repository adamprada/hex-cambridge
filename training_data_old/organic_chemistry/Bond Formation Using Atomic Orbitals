Bond Formation Using Atomic Orbitals Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions In writing the conventional Lewis structures for molecules we assume that a covalent chemical bond between two atoms involves sharing a pair of elections one from each atom Figure shows how atomic orbitals can be considered to be used in bond formation Here we postulate that a single bond is formed by the pulling together of two atomic nuclei by attractive forces exerted by the nuclei for the two paired electrons in overlapping atomic orbitals Because two atomic orbitals can hold a maximum of four electrons it is reasonable to ask why it is that two rather than one three or four electrons normally are involved in a bond The answer is that two overlapping atomic Figure Representation of the formation of an bond by sharing of electrons in overlapping orbitals orbitals can be considered to combine to give one lowenergy bonding molecular orbital and one highenergy antibonding molecular orbital see the top part of Figure a Orbitals that overlap as shown in Figure a are said to overlap in the sigma manner and the bonding orbital is called a sigma orbital the antibonding orbital is called a orbital read sigma star Two paired electrons suffice to fill the orbital Any additional electrons must go into the highenergy orbital and contribute not to bonding but to repulsion between the atoms The hydrogen moleculeion can be regarded as having one electron in a orbital It has been studied in the vapor state by spectroscopic means and found to have a dissociation energy to and of compared to the bond energy for Several possible combinations of two hydrogen orbitals and from one to four electrons are shown in Figure b Figure a Schematic representation of formation of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals by overlap of two atomic orbitals b Some of the various electronic configurations that are possible with these orbitals More about the difference between bonding and antibonding orbitals is given in Section For now we will say that the property of orbitals that leads to bonding or antibonding is a property analogous to phase An inphase combination of two orbitals is bonding and an outofphase combination is antibonding The designation sigma denotes that orbital overlap and electron density are greatest along the internuclear axis Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
