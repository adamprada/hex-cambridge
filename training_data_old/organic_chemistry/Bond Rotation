Bond Rotation Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Pi Bonds are rigidDouble and Triple Bonds cannot Rotate Learning Objective distinguish between bonds that can rotate and those that cannot Sigma Bonds can Rotate We learned in section that single bonds in organic molecules are free to rotate due to the endtoend sigma nature of their orbital overlap Consider the carbonoxygen bond in ethanol for example with a o rotation about this bond the shape of the molecule would look quite different For ethane rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond results in many different possible threedimensional arrangements of the atoms Pi Bonds are rigid Pi bonds are created from overlapping p orbitals The lobes of the p orbitals prevent the atoms sharing pi bonds from rotating as shown in the diagram below Double and Triple Bonds cannot Rotate The pi bonds in double and triple bonds prevent these bonds from rotating This rigidity has an effect on the physical structure of compounds and can influence chemical reactivity For now we want to build the habit of looking at static drawings and diagrams of organic compounds and visualizing their dynamic nature For ethene there is no rotation about the carboncarbon double bond because of the pi bond Exercise Label the selected bonds in the compound below as Rotates or Rigid Answer Arrows for a and c are pointing to single bonds that can rotate Arrow b is pointing to a double bond that is rigid because of the pi bond
