DoUReferencesProblemsAnswersExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to determine the degree of unsaturation of an organic compound given its molecular formula and hence determine the number of double bonds triple bonds and rings present in the compound draw all the possible isomers that correspond to a given molecular formula containing only carbon up to a maximum of six atoms and hydrogen draw a specified number of isomers that correspond to a given molecular formula containing carbon hydrogen and possibly other elements such as oxygen nitrogen and the halogens Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below degree of unsaturation saturated unsaturated There are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule Although nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and infrared radiation IR are the primary ways of determining molecular structures calculating the degrees of unsaturation is useful information since knowing the degrees of unsaturation make it easier for one to figure out the molecular structure it helps one doublecheck the number of bonds andor cyclic rings Saturated and Unsaturated Molecules In the lab saturation may be thought of as the point when a solution cannot dissolve anymore of a substance added to it In terms of degrees of unsaturation a molecule only containing single bonds with no rings is considered saturated CHCHCH methyoxypentane Unlike saturated molecules unsaturated molecules contain double bonds triple bonds andor rings CHCHCHCH chlorooctyne Calculating The Degree of Unsaturation DoU If the molecular formula is given plug in the numbers into this formula is the number of carbons is the number of nitrogens is the number of halogens F Cl Br I is the number of hydrogens As stated before a saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings Another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane Thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by C which is the general molecular representation of an alkane As an example for the molecular formula CH the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is Cx The compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens Degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated Hence the DoB formula divides by The formula subtracts the number of Xs because a halogen X replaces a hydrogen in a compound For instance in chloroethane CHCl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane CH For a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present Therefore we add the number of nitrogens N This can be seen with CHN compared to CH Oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements As seen in alcohols the same number of hydrogens in ethanol CHOH matches the number of hydrogens in ethane CH The following chart illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for a given degree of unsaturation Each row corresponds to a different combination One degree of unsaturation is equivalent to ring or double bond bond Two degrees of unsaturation is equivalent to double bonds ring and double bond rings or triple bond bonds DoU Possible combinations of rings bonds of rings of double bonds of triple bonds Remember the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor rings For instance a degree of unsaturation of can contain rings rings double bond ring double bonds ring triple bond double bond triple bond or double bonds Example Benzene What is the Degree of Unsaturation for Benzene Solution The molecular formula for benzene is CH Thus DoU where C NX and H DoB can equal ring or double bond This corresponds to benzene containing ring and double bonds However when given the molecular formula CH benzene is only one of many possible structures isomers The following structures all have DoB of and have the same molecular formula as benzene References Vollhardt K PC Shore N Organic Chemistry thEd New York W H
