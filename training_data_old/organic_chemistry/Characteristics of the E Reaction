stereochemistry propose mechanisms for E reactions draw and interpret Reaction Energy Diagrams for E reactions General Reaction Unimolecular Elimination E is a reaction in which loss of the leaving group followed by removal of he betahydrogen results in the formation of a double bond It is similar to a unimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction SN in various ways One being the formation of a carbocation intermediate as the rate determining slow step hence the name unimolecular Alkyl halides that can ionize to form stable carbocations are more reactive via the E mechanism Because carbocation stability is the primary energetic consideration stabilization of the carbocation via solvation is also an important consideration Because carbocations are highly reactive the strength of the base is not important and weak bases can be used Since SN and E reactions behave similarly they often compete against each other Many times both these reactions will occur simultaneously to form different products from a single reaction However one can be favored over another through thermodynamic control Heating the reaction favors elimination over substitution In order of decreasing importance the factors impacting E reaction pathways are structure of the alkyl halide stability of the carbocation type of solvent strength of the base Mechanism for Alkyl Halides As can be seen in the E mechanism below the preliminary step is the leaving group LG leaving on its own Because it takes the electrons in the bond along with it the carbon that was attached to it loses its electron making it a carbocation Once it becomes a carbocation a Lewis Base B deprotonates the intermediate carbocation at the beta position which then donates its electrons to the neighboring CC bond to form a double bond Unlike E reactions which require the proton to be anti to the leaving group E reactions only require a neighboring hydrogen This is due to the fact that the leaving group has already left the molecule The final product is an alkene along with the HB byproduct and leaving group salt Once again we see the two steps of the E mechanism A base deprotonates a beta carbon to form a pi bond In this case we see a mixture of products rather than one discrete one This is the case because the carbocation has two nearby carbons that are capable of being deprotonated but that only one forms a major product more stable Reactivity Due to the fact that E reactions create a carbocation intermediate rules present in reactions still apply As expected tertiary carbocations are favored over secondary primary and methyls This is due to the phenomena of hyperconjugation which essentially allows a nearby CC or CH bond to interact with the p orbital of the carbon to bring the electrons down to a lower energy state Thus this has a stabilizing effect on the molecule as a whole In general primary and methyl carbocations do not proceed through the E pathway for this reason unless there is a means of carbocation rearrangement to move the positive charge to a nearby carbon Secondary and Tertiary carbons form more stable carbocations thus this formation occurs quite rapidly Secondary carbocations can be subject to the E reaction pathway but this generally occurs in the presence of a good strong base Adding a weak base to the reaction disfavors E essentially pushing towards the E pathway In many instances solvolysis occurs rather than using a base to deprotonate This means heat is added to the solution and the solvent itself deprotonates a hydrogen The medium can effect the pathway of the reaction as well Polar protic solvents may be used to hinder nucleophiles thus disfavoring E Sn from occurring Regiochemistry Stereochemistry of the E Reaction The E reaction is regiospecific because it follows Zaitsevs rule that states the more substituted alkene is the major product This infers that the hydrogen on the most substituted carbon is the most probable to be deprotonated thus allowing for the most substituted alkene to be formed Unlike E reactions the E reaction is not stereospecific Thus a hydrogen is not required to be anticoplanar to the leaving group because the leaving group is gone In the mechanism below we can see two possible pathways for the reaction Either one leads to a plausible resultant product however only one forms a major product As stated by Zaitsevs rule deprotonation of the most substituted carbon results in the most substituted alkene This then becomes the most stable product due to hyperconjugation and is also more common than the minor product Exercises Which of these steps is the rate determining step A or B What is the major product formed C or D In order to produce the most stable alkene product from which carbon should the base deprotonate A B or C If the carbocation were to rearrange on which carbon would the positive charge go onto without sacrificing stability A B or C Predict the major product of the following reaction True or False There is no way of controlling the product ratio of E Sn reactions Explain why the presence of a weak base nucleophile favors E reactions over E Answer A C B B False They can be thermodynamically controlled to favor a certain product over another By definition an E reaction is a Unimolecular Elimination reaction This means the only rate determining step is that of the dissociation of the leaving group to form a carbocation Since E is bimolecular and the nucleophilic attack is part of the rate determining step a weak basenucleophile disfavors it and ultimately allows E to dominate Dont forget about SN which still pertains to this reaction simaltaneously Outside Links E reaction background httpenWikipediaorgwikiE_elimination Outside Sources McMurry J Simanek
