Chemical Reactions of Alkanes Combustion of Alkanes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions As a class alkanes generally are unreactive The names saturated hydrocarbon or paraffin which literally means not enough affinity L parum not enough affins affinity arise because their chemical affinity for most common reagents may be regarded as saturated or satisfied Thus none of the or bonds in a typical saturated hydrocarbon for example ethane are attacked at ordinary temperatures by a strong acid such as sulfuric acid or by an oxidizing agent such as bromine in the dark oxygen or potassium permanganate Under ordinary conditions ethane is similarly stable to reducing agents such as hydrogen even in the presence of catalysts such as platinum palladium or nickel However all saturated hydrocarbons are attacked by oxygen at elevated temperatures and if oxygen is in excess complete combustion to carbon dioxide and water occurs Vast quantities of hydrocarbons from petroleum are utilized as fuels for the production of heat and power by combustion although it is becoming quite clear that few of the nations of the world are going to continue to satisfy their needs or desires for energy through the use of petroleum the way it has been possible in the past Petroleums differ considerably in composition depending on their source However a representative petroleum on distillation yields the following fractions Gas fraction boiling up to contains normal and branched alkanes from to Natural gas is mainly methane and ethane Bottled gas liquefied petroleum gas is mainly propane and butane Gasoline boiling point from to contains mostly hydrocarbons from to Over compounds have been identified in gasoline and these include continuouschain and branched alkanes cycloalkanes and alkylbenzenes arenes The branched alkanes make better gasoline than their continuouschain isomers because they give less knock in highcompression gasoline engines Kerosine boiling point to contains hydrocarbons from to Much of this fraction is utilized as jet engine fuels or is cracked to simpler alkanes and alkenes Light gas oil boiling point to to is utilized as diesel and furnace fuels Heavy gas oil and light lubricating distillate boiling point to to Lubricants boiling point to to familiarly encountered as paraffin was and petroleum jelly Vaseline The distillation residues known as asphalts The way in which petroleum is refined and the uses for it depend very much on supply and demand which always are changing However the situation for the United States in is summarized in Figure which shows roughly how much of one barrel of oil liters is used for specific purposes Figure Sources and uses of petroleum in the United States in In the past three decades petroleum technology has outpaced coal technology and we now are reliant on petroleum as the major source of fuels and chemicals Faced with dwindling oil reserves however it is inevitable that coal again will become a major source of raw materials When coal is heated at high temperatures in the absence of air it carbonizes to coke and gives off a gaseous mixture of compounds Some of these gases condense to a black viscous oil coal tar others produce an aqueous condensate called ammoniacal liquors and some remain gaseous coal gas The residue is coke which is used both as a fuel and as a source of carbon for the production of steel The major component in coal gas is methane Coal tar is an incredible mixture of compounds mostly hydrocarbons a substantial number of which are arenes Coal and coal tar can be utilized to produce alkanes but the technology involved is more complex and costly than petroleum refining It seems inevitable that the cost of hydrocarbon fuel will continue to rise as supply problems become more difficult And there is yet no answer to what will happen when the worlds limited quantities of petroleum and coal are exhausted See F D Rossini Hydrocarbons in Petroleum J Chem Educ Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
