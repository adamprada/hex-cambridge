as chiral or achiral and identify planes of symmetry Stereoisomers are isomers that differ in spatial arrangement of atoms rather than order of atomic connectivity One of their most interesting type of isomer is the mirrorimage stereoisomers a nonsuperimposable set of two molecules that are mirror image of one another The existence of these molecules are determined by concept known as chirality Introduction Organic compounds molecules created around a chain of carbon atom more commonly known as carbon backbone play an essential role in the chemistry of life These molecules derive their importance from the energy they carry mainly in a form of potential energy between atomic molecules Since such potential force can be widely affected due to changes in atomic placement it is important to understand the concept of an isomer a molecule sharing same atomic make up as another but differing in structural arrangements This article will be devoted to a specific isomers called stereoisomers and its property of chirality Figure Figure Two enantiomers of a tetrahedral complex The concepts of steroisomerism and chirality command great deal of importance in modern organic chemistry as these ideas helps to understand the physical and theoretical reasons behind the formation and structures of numerous organic molecules the main reason behind the energy embedded in these essential chemicals In contrast to more wellknown constitutional isomerism which develops isotopic compounds simply by different atomic connectivity stereoisomerism generally maintains equal atomic connections and orders of building blocks as well as having same numbers of atoms and types of elements What then makes stereoisomers so unique To answer this question the learner must be able to think and imagine in not just twodimensional images but also threedimensional space This is due to the fact that stereoisomers are isomers because their atoms are different from others in terms of spatial arrangement Spatial Arrangement First and foremost one must understand the concept of spatial arrangement in order to understand stereoisomerism and chirality Spatial arrangement of atoms concern how different atomic particles and molecules are situated about in the space around the organic compound namely its carbon chain In this sense spatial arrangement of an organic molecule are different another if an atom is shifted in any threedimensional direction by even one degree This opens up a very broad possibility of different molecules each with their unique placement of atoms in threedimensional space Stereoisomers Stereoisomers are as mentioned above contain different types of isomers within itself each with distinct characteristics that further separate each other as different chemical entities having different properties Type called entaniomer are the previouslymentioned mirrorimage stereoisomers and will be explained in detail in this article Another type diastereomer has different properties and will be introduced afterwards The Many Synonyms of the Chiral Carbon Be aware all of the following terms can be used to describe a chiral carbon chiral carbon asymmetric carbon optically active carbon stereo carbon Enantiomers This type of stereoisomer is the essential mirrorimage nonsuperimposable type of stereoisomer introduced in the beginning of the article Figure provides a perfect example note that the gray plane in the middle demotes the mirror plane Figure Comparison of Chiral and Achiral Molecules a Bromochlorofluoromethane is a chiral molecule whose stereocenter is designated with an asterisk Rotation of its mirror image does not generate the original structure To superimpose the mirror images bonds must be broken and reformed b In contrast dichlorofluoromethane and its mirror image can be rotated so they are superimposable Note that even if one were to flip over the left molecule over to the right the atomic spatial arrangement will not be equal This is equivalent to the left hand right hand relationship and is aptly referred to as handedness in molecules This can be somewhat counterintuitive so this article recommends the reader try the hand example Place both palm facing up and hands next to each other Now flip either side over to the other One hand should be showing the back of the hand while the other one is showing the palm They are not same and nonsuperimposable This is where the concept of chirality comes in as one of the most essential and defining idea of stereoisomerism Chirality Chirality essentially means mirrorimage nonsuperimposable molecules and to say that a molecule is chiral is to say that its mirror image it must have one is not the same as it self Whether a molecule is chiral or achiral depends upon a certain set of overlapping conditions Figure shows an example of two molecules chiral and achiral respectively Notice the distinct characteristic of the achiral molecule it possesses two atoms of same element In theory and reality if one were to create a plane that runs through the other two atoms they will be able to create what is known as bisecting plane The images on either side of the plan is the same as the other Figure Figure In this case the molecule is considered achiral In other words to distinguish chiral molecule from an achiral molecule one must search for the existence of the bisecting plane in a molecule All chiral molecules are deprive of bisecting plane whether simple or complex As a universal rule no molecule with different surrounding atoms are achiral Chirality is a simple but essential idea to support the concept of stereoisomerism being used to explain one type of its kind The chemical properties of the chiral molecule differs from its mirror image and in this lies the significance of chilarity in relation to modern organic chemistry Exercise Identify the following as either a constitutional isomer or stereoisomer If stereoisomer determine if it is an enantiomer or diastereomer Explain the reason behind the answer Also mark chirality for each molecule a b c Solutions a achiral b chiral c chiral Exercise Identify the chiral centers in each of the
