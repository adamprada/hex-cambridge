Chirality at Nitrogen Phosphorus and Sulfur Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Stereogenic NitrogenContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to recognize that atoms other than carbon can be chiral centres explain why enantiomers of compounds such as ethylmethylamine cannot normally be isolated Study Notes The first example of a resolvable compound containing a chiral nitrogen atom was resolved by William Pope and Stanley Peachey in It had the structure shown below Chiral sulfoxides find application in certain drugs such as esomeprazole and armodafinil and are a good example of a stereogenic sulfur center Stereogenic Nitrogen Singlebonded nitrogen is pyramidal in shape with the nonbonding electron pair pointing to the unoccupied corner of a tetrahedral region Since the nitrogen in these compounds is bonded to three different groups its configuration is chiral The nonidentical mirrorimage configurations are illustrated in the following diagram the remainder of the molecule is represented by R and the electron pair is colored yellow If these configurations were stable there would be four additional stereoisomers of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine However pyramidal nitrogen is normally not configurationally stable It rapidly inverts its configuration equilibrium arrows by passing through a planar sphybridized transition state leading to a mixture of interconverting R and S configurations If the nitrogen atom were the only chiral center in the molecule a racemic mixture of R and S configurations would exist at equilibrium If other chiral centers are present as in the ephedrin isomers a mixture of diastereomers will result The takehome message is that nitrogen does not contribute to isolable stereoisomers Asymmetric quaternary ammonium groups are also chiral Amines however are not chiral because they rapidly invert or turn inside out at room temperature The phosphorus center of phosphate ion and organic phosphate esters for example is tetrahedral and thus is potentially a stereocenter We will see in chapter how researchers in order to investigate the stereochemistry of reactions at the phosphate center incorporated sulfur andor O and O isotopes of oxygen the normal isotope is O to create chiral phosphate groups Phosphate triesters are chiral if the three substituent groups are different Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
