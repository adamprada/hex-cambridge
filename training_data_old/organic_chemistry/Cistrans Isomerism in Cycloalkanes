Cistrans Isomerism in Cycloalkanes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Geometric Isomerism of CycloalkanesContributors and Attributions Learning Objective identify draw the geometric cistrans isomers of cycloalkanes Geometric Isomerism of Cycloalkanes The carbon ring of cycloalkanes forms a pseudoplane that can be used to assign the relative orientation of atoms or substituents bonded to the ring stereochemistry One side of the ring is called up while the other side is called down By agreement chemists use heavy wedgeshaped bonds to indicate a substituent located above the average plane of the ring up and a hatched line for bonds to atoms or groups located below the ring down Disubstituted cycloalkane stereoisomers may be designated by nomenclature prefixes such as cis and trans Cis and trans isomers are also called geometric isomers For the cis isomer both substituents are aobe or below the carbon ring For the trans isomer one substituent is above the ring while the other substituent is below the ring The cis and trans isomers for dibromocyclopentane are shown as an example below While the carboncarbon single bonds of the rings can rotate partially there is NO way to interconvert between the cis and trans isomers Cis and trans isomers are unique compounds with their own unique melting points boiling points densities etc Further explanation In general if any two sp carbons in a ring have two different substituent groups not counting other ring atoms stereoisomerism is possible This is similar to the substitution pattern that gives rise to stereoisomers in alkenes indeed one might view a double bond as a twomembered ring Four other examples of this kind of stereoisomerism in cyclic compounds are shown below If more than two ring carbons have different substituents not counting other ring atoms the stereochemical notation distinguishing the various isomers becomes more complex However we can always state the relationship of any two substituents using cis or trans For example in the trisubstitutued cyclohexane below we can say that the methyl group is cis to the ethyl group and trans to the chlorine We can also say that the ethyl group is trans to the chlorine We cannot however designate the entire molecule as a cis or trans isomer Exercise Draw the following molecules transdimethylcyclohexane transdibromocyclopentane cisdichlorocyclobutane Answer Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
