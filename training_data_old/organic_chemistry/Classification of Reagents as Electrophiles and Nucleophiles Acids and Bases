Classification of Reagents as Electrophiles and Nucleophiles Acids and Bases Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions To understand ionic reactions we need to be able to recognize whether a particular reagent will act to acquire an electron pair or to donate an electron pair Reagents that acquire an electron pair in chemical reactions are said to be electrophilic electronloving We can picture this in a general way as a heterolytic bond breaking of compound by an electrophile such that becomes bonded to by the electron pair of the bond Thus Reagents that donate an electron pair in chemical reactions are said to be nucleophilic nucleus loving Thus the bond also can be considered to be broken by the nucleophile which donates its electron pair to while leaves as with the electrons of the bond Thus by definition electrophiles are electronpair acceptors and nucleophiles are electronpair donors These definitions correspond closely to definitions used in the generalized theory of acids and bases proposed by G N Lewis According to Lewis an acid is any substance that can accept an electron pair and a base is any substance that can donated an electron pair to form a covalent bond Therefore acids must be electrophiles and bases must be nucleophiles For example the methyl cation may be regarded as a Lewis acid or an electrophile because it accepts electrons from reagents such as chloride ion or methanol In turn because chloride ion and methanol donate electrons to the methyl cation they are classified as Lewis bases or nucleophiles The generalized Lewis concept of acids and bases also includes common protontransfer reactions Thus water acts as a base because one of the electron pairs on oxygen can abstract a proton from a reagent such as hydrogen fluoride Alternatively the hydronium ion is an acid because it can accept electrons from another reagent eg fluoride ion by donating a proton A proton donor can be classified as an electrophile and a proton acceptor as a nucleophile For example hydrogen chloride can transfer a proton to ethene to form the ethyl cation Therefore hydrogen chloride functions as the electrophile or acid and ethene functions as the nucleophile or base What then is the difference between an acid and an electrophile or between a base and nucleophile No great difference until we try to use the terms in a quantitative sense For example if we refer to acid strength or acidity this means the position of equilibrium in an acidbase reaction The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid or the is a quantitative measure of acid strength The larger the value of or the smaller the the stronger the acid A summary of the relationships between and follow where the quantities in brackets are concentrations or By definition and hence or However in referring to the strength of reagents as electrophiles or nucleophiles we usually are not referring to chemical equilibria but to reaction rates A good nucleophile is a reagent that reacts rapidly with a particular electrophile In contrast a poor nucleophile reacts only slowly with the same electrophile Consequently it should not then be taken for granted that there is a parallel between the acidity or basicity of a reagent and its reactivity as an electrophile or nucleophile For instance it is incorrect to assume that the strengths of a series of bases in aqueous solution will necessarily parallel their nucleophilicities toward a carbon electrophile such as methyl chloride The important difference is that the strength of the base is determined in an equilibrium reaction whereas its nucleophilicity is determined by its reactivity in slow substitution reactions To put it another way the base strength corresponds to the overall energy change of a reaction while the nucleophilicity corresponds to the activation energy of a reaction see Figure Even so it turns out that most strong bases are good nucleophiles and that most strong proton acids are good electrophiles We will see that the converse may not be true Good nucleophiles are not always strong bases examples are and and good electrophiles are not always strong acids by either the BronstedLowry or Lewis definitions examples are In what follows we will be concerned with the rates of ionic reactions under nonequilibrium conditions We shall use the term nucleophilic repeatedly and we want you to understand that a nucleophile is any neutral or charged reagent that supplies a pair of electrons either bonding or nonbonding to form a new covalent bond In substitution reactions the nucleophile usually is an anion or a neutral molecule or The operation of each of these is illustrated in the following equations for reactions of the general compound and some specific examples An electrophile is any neutral or charged reagent that accepts an electron pair from a nucleophile to form a new bond In the preceding substitution reactions the electrophile is The electrophile in other reactions may be a carbon cation or a proton donor as in the following examples The concept of an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor is due to Bronsted and Lowry Previous to this time acids and bases generally were defined as substances that functioned by forming or in water solutions The BronstedLowry concept was important because it liberated acidbase phenomena from the confines of watercontaining solvents by focusing attention on proton transfers rather than the formation of or The Lewis concept of generalized acids and bases further broadened the picture by showing the relationship between proton transfers and reactions where an electronpair acceptor is transferred from one electronpair donor to another Contributors and
