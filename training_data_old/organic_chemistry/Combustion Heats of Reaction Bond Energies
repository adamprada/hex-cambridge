Combustion Heats of Reaction Bond Energies Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions All hydrocarbons are attacked by oxygen at elevated temperatures and if oxygen is in excess complete combustion occurs to carbon dioxide and water The heat evolved in this process the heat of the combustion reaction is a measure of the amount of energy stored in the and bonds of the hydrocarbon compared to the energy stored in the products carbon dioxide and water It can be measured experimentally with considerable accuracy and generally is reported as the amount of heat in kilocalories liberated on complete combustion of one mole of hydrocarbon when the reactants and the products are in standard states and at the same temperature usually Not all chemical reactions that occur spontaneously liberate heat some actually absorb heat By convention is given a negative sign when heat is evolved exothermic reaction and a positive sign when heat is absorbed endothermic reaction The heat evolved or absorbed also is called the enthalpy change For the combustion of of methane at we find by experiment corrected from constant volume to constant pressure if necessary that the reaction is exothermic by This statement can be expressed as follows with The symbol denotes that the reactants and products are in the gaseous state except for the water which is liquid If we wish to have with gaseous water as the product we have to make a correction for the heat of vaporization of water at The task of measuring the heats of all chemical reactions is a formidable one and about as practical as counting grains of sand on the beach However it is of practical interest to be able to estimate heats of reaction and this can be done quite simply with the aid of bond energies The necessary bond energies are given in Table and it is important to notice that they apply only to complete dissociation of gaseous substances to gaseous atoms at Also they do not apply without suitable corrections to many compounds such as benzene that have more than one double bond This limitation will be discussed in Chapters and To calculate for the combustion of one mole of methane first we break bonds as follows using for the energy of each of the bonds and then for the energy of the double bond in oxygen Then we make bonds using for each bond in carbon dioxide and for each of the bonds in water The net sum of these values is which is reasonably close to the value of for the heat of combustion of one mole of methane determined experimentally The same type of procedure can be used to estimate values for many other kinds of reactions of organic compounds in the vapor phase at Moreover if appropriate heats of vaporization are available it is straightforward to compute for vaporphase reactions of substances which are normally liquids or solids at The special problems that arise when solutions and ionic substances are involved are considered in Chapters and It is important to recognize that the bond energies listed in Table for all molecules other than diatomic molecules are average values That the bond energy is stated to be does not mean that if the hydrogens of methane were detached one by one would have to be put in at each step Actually the experimental evidence is in accord with quite different energies for the separate dissociation steps The moral is that we should try to avoid using the bond energies in Table as a measure of for the dissociation of just one bond in a polyatomic molecule For this we need what are called bonddissociation energies some of which are given in Table The values given have been selected to emphasize how structure influences bond energy Thus bond energies in alkanes decrease in the order primary secondary tertiary likewise bonds decrease in strength along the series How accurate are values calculated from bond energies Generally quite good provided nonbonded interactions between the atoms are small and the bond angles and distances are close to the normal values Section B A few examples of calculated and experimental heats of combustion of some hydrocarbons are given in Table Negative discrepancies represent heats of combustion smaller than expected from the average bond energies and positive values correspond to larger than expected heats of combustion Comparing isomers in Table we see that methylpropane and tetramethylbutane give off less heat when burned than do butane and octane and this is a rather general characteristic result of chain branching Cyclopropane has a of combustion of greater than expected from bond energies and this clearly is associated with the abnormal bond angles in the ring These matters will be discussed in detail in Chapter For cyclohexane which has normal bond angles the heat of combustion is close to the calculated value In this book we use kilocalories in place of the presently recommended SI joules for units of energy As of the date of writing it is not clear just how general the use of the joule will become among chemists To convert calories to joules or to multiply by You may wonder how a reaction such as combustion of methane can occur at The fact is that the reaction can be carried out at any desired temperature The important thing is that the value we are talking about here is the heat liberated or absorbed when you start with the reactants at and finish with the products at As long as is defined this way it does not matter at what temperature the reaction actually occurs Standard states for gases are partial pressure Standard states for liquids or solids usually are the pure liquid or solid at external pressure Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second
