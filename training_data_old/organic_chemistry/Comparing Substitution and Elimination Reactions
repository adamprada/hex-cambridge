stereochemistry propose mechanisms for SN SN E and E reactions draw interpret and apply Reaction Energy Diagrams for SN SN E and E reactions Summary of Reaction Patterns Having discussed the many factors that influence nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions of alkyl halides we must now consider the practical problem of predicting the most likely outcome when a given alkyl halide is reacted with a given nucleophile As we noted earlier several variables must be considered the most important being the structure of the alkyl group and the nature of the nucleophilic reactantIn general in order for an SN or E reaction to occur the relevant carbocation intermediate must be relatively stable Strong nucleophile favor substitution and strong bases especially strong hindered bases such as tertbutoxide favor elimination The nature of the halogen substituent on the alkyl halide is usually not very significant if it is Cl Br or I In cases where both SN and E reactions compete chlorides generally give more elimination than do iodides since the greater electronegativity of chlorine increases the acidity of betahydrogens Indeed although alkyl fluorides are relatively unreactive when reactions with basic nucleophiles are forced elimination occurs note the high electronegativity of fluorine The following table summarizes the expected outcome of alkyl halide reactions with nucleophiles It is assumed that the alkyl halides have one or more betahydrogens making elimination possible and that low dielectric solvents eg acetone ethanol tetrahydrofuran ethyl acetate are used When a high dielectric solvent would significantly influence the reaction this is noted in red Note that halogens bonded to sp or sp hybridized carbon atoms do not normally undergo substitution or elimination reactions with nucleophilic reagents Nucleophile Anionic Nucleophiles Weak Bases I Br SCN N CHCO RS CN etc pKas from to left to right Anionic Nucleophiles Strong Bases HO RO pKas Neutral Nucleophiles HO ROH RSH RN pKas ranging from to Alkyl Group Primary RCH Rapid SN substitution The rate may be reduced by substitution of βcarbons as in the case of neopentyl Rapid SN substitution E elimination may also occur eg ClCHCHCl KOH CHCHCl SN substitution N S O Secondary RCH SN substitution and or E elimination depending on the basicity of the nucleophile Bases weaker than acetate pKa give less elimination The rate of substitution may be reduced by branching at the βcarbons and this will increase elimination E elimination will dominate SN substitution N S O In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be formed slowly Tertiary RC E elimination will dominate with most nucleophiles even if they are weak bases No SN substitution due to steric hindrance In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be expected E elimination will dominate No SN substitution will occur In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed E elimination with nitrogen nucleophiles they are bases No SN substitution In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Allyl HCCHCH Rapid SN substitution for º and ºhalides For ºhalides a very slow SN substitution or if the nucleophile is moderately basic E elimination In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be observed Rapid SN substitution for º halides E elimination will compete with substitution in ºhalides and dominate in the case of ºhalides In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles will give SN substitution in the case of º and ºhalides ºhalides will probably give E elimination with nitrogen nucleophiles they are bases In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Water hydrolysis will be favorable for º ºhalides Benzyl CHCH Rapid SN substitution for º and ºhalides For ºhalides a very slow SN substitution or if the nucleophile is moderately basic E elimination In high dielectric ionizing solvents such as water dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile SN and E products may be observed Rapid SN substitution for º halides note there are no β hydrogens E elimination will compete with substitution in ºhalides and dominate in the case of ºhalides In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles will give SN substitution in the case of º and ºhalides ºhalides will probably give E elimination with nitrogen nucleophiles they are bases In high dielectric ionizing solvents SN and E products may be formed Water hydrolysis will be favorable for º ºhalides Experimental Observations Experimental observations are reported for the following reactions These reactions include a range of alkyl halide structures in a variety of reaction conditions to illustrate the reaction patterns summarized above In describing these it is useful to designate the halogenbearing carbon as alpha and the carbon atoms adjacent to it as beta as noted in the first four equations shown below Replacement or substitution of the halogen on the αcarbon colored maroon by a nucleophilic reagent is a commonly observed reaction as shown in equations below Also since the electrophilic character introduced by the halogen extends to the βcarbons and since nucleophiles are also bases the possibility of base induced HX elimination must also be considered as illustrated by equation Finally there are some combinations of alkyl halides and nucleophiles that fail to show any reaction over a hour period such as the example in equation For consistency alkyl bromides have been used in these examples Similar reactions occur when alkyl chlorides or iodides are used but the speed of the reactions and the exact distribution of products will change In order to understand why some combinations of alkyl halides and nucleophiles give a substitution reaction whereas other combinations give elimination and still others give no observable reaction we must investigate systematically the way in which changes in reaction variables perturb the course of the reaction The following general equation summarizes the factors that will be important in such an investigation Friendly Reminder One conclusion relating the structure of the Rgroup to possible products should be immediately obvious If R has no betahydrogens an elimination reaction is not possible unless a structural rearrangement occurs first The first four halides shown on the left below do not give elimination reactions on treatment with base because they have no βhydrogens The two halides on the right do not normally undergo such reactions because the potential elimination products have highly strained double or triple bonds It is also worth noting that sp hybridized CX compounds such as the three on the right do not normally undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions unless other functional groups perturb the double bonds Exercise Identify the dominant reaction mechanism SN SN E or E
