Comparison of E and E Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Comparing E and E mechanisms Learning Objective distinguish st or nd order elimination reactions Elimination reactions of alkyl halides can occur via the bimolecular E mechanism or unimolecular E mechanism as shown in the diagram below Comparing E and E mechanisms When considering whether an elimination reaction is likely to occur via an E or E mechanism we really need to consider three factors The base strong bases favor the E mechanism whereas E mechanisms only require a weak base The solvent good ionizing xolvents polar protic favor the E mechanism by stabilizing the carbocation intermediate The alkyl halide primary alkyl halides have the only structure useful in distinguishing between the E and E pathways Since primary carbocations do not form only the E mechanism is possible Reaction Parameter E E alkyl halide structure tertiary secondary primary tertiary secondary primary nucleophile high concentration of a strong base weak base mechanism step step rate limiting step anticoplanar bimolecular transition state carbocation formation rate law rate kRXBase rate kRX stereochemisty retained configuration mixed configuration solvent not important polar protic Exercises Predict the dominant elimination mechanism E or E for each reaction below Explain your reasoning Which one of the following groups of compounds would eliminate most readily on reaction with potassium hydroxide Explain your reasoning draw the bondline structure and give the IUPAC name of the product a b c Specify the reaction conditions to favor the indicated elimination mechanism Answer a strong base such as hydroxide an alkoxide or equivalent b water or alcohol or equivalent weak base with heat c strong base such as hydroxide an alkoxide or equivalent Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
