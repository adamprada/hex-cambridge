Comparison of SN and SN Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Predicting SN vs SN mechanismsComparison between SN and SN Reactions Learning Objective distinguish st or nd order substitution reactions Predicting SN vs SN mechanisms When considering whether a nucleophilic substitution is likely to occur via an SN or SN mechanism we really need to consider three factors The electrophile when the leaving group is attached to a methyl group or a primary carbon an SN mechanism is favored here the electrophile is unhindered by surrounded groups and any carbocation intermediate would be highenergy and thus unlikely When the leaving group is attached to a tertiary allylic or benzylic carbon a carbocation intermediate will be relatively stable and thus an SN mechanism is favored These patterns of reactivity of summarized below Alkyl Halide Structure Possible Substitution Reactions methyl and primary SN only secondary SN and SN tertiary SN only primary and secondary benzylic and allylic SN and SN tertiary benzylic and allylic SN only vinyl and aryl NO reaction The nucleophile powerful nucleophiles especially those with negative charges favor the SN mechanism Weaker nucleophiles such as water or alcohols favor the SN mechanism The solvent Polar aprotic solvents favor the SN mechanism by enhancing the reactivity of the nucleophile Polar protic solvents favor the SN mechanism by stabilizing the transition state and carbocation intermediate SN reactions are called solvolysis reactions when the solvent is the nucleophile These patterns of reactivity are summarized in the table below Comparison between SN and SN Reactions Reaction Parameter SN SN alkyl halide structure methyl primary secondary tertiary tertiary secodary primary methyl nucleophile high concentration of a strong nucleophile poor nucleophile often the solvent mechanism step stp rate limiting step bimolecular transition state carbocation formation rate law rate kRXNu rate kRX stereochemisty inversion of configuration mixed configuration solvent polar aprotic polar protic For example the reaction below has a tertiary alkyl bromide as the electrophile a weak nucleophile and a polar protic solvent well assume that methanol is the solvent Thus wed confidently predict an SN reaction mechanism Because substitution occurs at a chiral carbon we can also predict that the reaction will proceed with racemization In the reaction below on the other hand the electrophile is a secondary alkyl bromide with these both SN and SN mechanisms are possible depending on the nucleophile and the solvent In this example the nucleophile a thiolate anion is strong and a polar protic solvent is used so the SN mechanism is heavily favored The reaction is expected to proceed with inversion of configuration Exercise Determine whether each substitution reaction shown below is likely to proceed by an SN or SN mechanism and explain your reasoning Answer a SN bc primary alkyl halide with a strong nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent b SN bc tertiary alkyl halide with a weak nucleophile that is also the solvent solvolysis c SN bc secondary alkyl halides favor this mechanism when reacted with a strong nucleophile and weak base in a polar aprotic solvent
