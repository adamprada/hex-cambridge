defined isomers in a very general way as nonidentical molecules that possess the same number and kind of atoms However there are several ways in which isomers can be nonidentical Among the alkenes and butene are position isomers because in these compounds the double bond has a different position in the carbon chain Most but not all alkenes have stereoisomers that are not identical because of different spatial arrangements of the component atoms Thus there are two stereoisomers of butene that differ in the geometric arrangement of the groups attached to the double bond In one isomer both methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond cisbutene and in the other the methyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond transbutene The two isomers clearly have the same structural framework but they differ in the arrangement of this framework in space hence the designation stereoisomers They owe their separate existence to the fact that the double bond is rigid and the parts of the molecule are not free to rotate with respect to each other about this bond Therefore the isomers do not interconvert without breaking the double bond and they exist as different compounds each with its own chemical and physical properties Ballandstick models of cis and transbutene are shown in Figure and the rigidity of the double bond is simulated in the model by a pair of stiff springs or bent sticks connecting the two carbons of the double bond It should be clear to you that there will be no cistrans isomers of alkenes in which one end of the double bond carries identical groups Thus we don not expect there to be cistrans isomers of butene or methylpropene and Figure Ballandstick models of cis and transbutene indeed none are known You may wish to verify this by making ballandstick models of these substances Ring formation also confers rigidity on molecular structure such that rotation about the ring bonds is prevented As a result stereoisomerism of the cistrans type is possible For example dimethylcyclopropane exists in two forms that differ in the arrangement of the two methyl groups with Figure Ballandstick models of cis and trans isomers of dimethylcyclopropane respect to the ring In the cis isomer the methyl groups both are situated above or below the plane of the ring and in the trans isomer they are situated one above and one below as shown in Figure Interconversion of these isomers does not occur without breaking one or more chemical bonds Stereoisomers that do not interconvert rapidly under normal conditions and therefore are stable enough to be separated specifically are called configurational isomers Thus cis and transbutene are configurational isomers as are cis and transdimethylcyclopropane The terms cistrans isomerism or geometric isomerism commonly are used to describe configurational isomerism in compounds with double bonds and rings When referring to the configuration of a particular isomer we mean to specify its geometry For instance the isomer of dichloroethene shown below has the trans configuration the isomer of dichlorocyclobutane has the cis configuration Cistrans isomerism is encountered very frequently By one convention the configuration of a complex alkene is taken to correspond to the configuration of the longest continuous chain as it passes through the double bond Thus the following compound is transethylmethylheptene despite the fact that two identical groups are cis with respect to each other because the longest continuous chain is trans as it passes through the double bond Notice that cistrans isomerism is not possible at a carboncarbon triple bond as for butyne because the bonding arrangement at the triply bonded carbons is linear Many compounds have more than one double bond and each may have the potential for the cis or trans arrangement For example hexadiene has three different configurations which are designated as transtrans ciscis and transcis Because the two ends of this molecule are identically substituted the transcis becomes identical with cistrans B Chirality The most important type of stereoisomerism is that which arises when molecules possess two structures that are not identical and also are mirror images of one another This is not a difficult or unfamiliar concept Many things around us such as our hands and pairs of shoes are not identical and also are mirror images of one another In the same way nonidentical molecules exist in which the only distinction between them is that one is the mirror image of the other A common statement is that such isomers are mirror images of one another but these images are not superimposable A simple example of this type of stereoisomerism is chlorobutane which can exist in two spatial configurations and that correspond to reflections of each other These isomers are specifically called enantiomers To be convinced that there really are two nonidentical forms of this molecule you should construct molecular models of both configurations and try to superimpose them as in Figure If you put and together and and together you find that and are on opposite sides and and are on opposite sides No matter how you turn the models around they cannot be superimposed unless you break bonds at the number carbon and interchange the positions of any two atoms or groups Compounds that lack reflection symmetry meaning that they are not identical with their mirror images are said to be chiral pronounced kirall rhymes with spiral This term is derived from the Greek word hand and handedness or chirality is a property of dissymmetric molecules such that two configurational isomers are possible that are nonidentical mirror images Compounds that possess reflection symmetry meaning that they are identical with their mirror images are said to be achiral Enantiomers are not possible for achiral compounds An enantiomeric pair is a pair of substances whose molecules are nonidentical mirror images The pressing question at this point is how can we tell whether a substances will be chiral or achiral The most common origin of chirality in molecules and the one originally recognized by vant Hoff and Le Bel is the presence of one or more atoms usually carbon atoms each of which forms coplanar bonds to four different atoms or groups This is the case for chlorobutane because the second tetrahedral carbon along the chain is bonded to four different groups hydrogen chlorine methyl and ethyl Therefore there is a pair of enantiomers and Another example is bromochlorotrifluoroethane which is a widely used inhalation anaesthetic The four different groups in this case are hydrogen chlorine bromine and trifluoromethyl the pair of enantiomers is shown in Structures and The atom that carries the four different substituents in and or and is called a chiral atoms or chiral center The latter is the more general term because as we shall see later Section A dissymmetry in molecules need not be centered at an atom Figure Use of ballandstick models to show nonidentity of the enantiomers of chlorobutane and In evaluating a chemical structure for chirality you should look for carbons carrying four different attached groups There may be more than one chiral carbon and you should be alert to the fact that structural differences in the attached groups do not necessarily show up at the first or even the second position along a chain As an example consider the chirality of trimethylcyclohexane Carbons and are clearly achiral because each is connected to two identical groups which for these atoms are hydrogens The same is true for because it is connected to two groups You might conclude that also is an achiral position because it is connected to two groups But this would be wrong If you look farther you will see that the groups attached to actually are different and are and Therefore trimethylcyclohexane has a chiral center at In contrast the isomer has no chiral centers because the groups attached to the ring at are identical Several other terms that we shall use frequently in addition to chirality are racemic mixture resolution and racemization A mixture of equal amounts of both enantiomers is a racemic mixture separation of a racemic mixture into its component enantiomers is a resolution and the conversion of either enantiomer into equal parts of both is called racemization C Optical Activity Until recently the phenomenon of chirality has been better known as optical isomerism and configurational isomers that are enantiomers were referred to as optical antipodes The reasons for this are mainly historical It was discovered early in the nineteenth century that many compounds whether solid liquid or gas have the property of rotating the plane of polarization of polarized light and can be said to be optically active A satisfactory explanation of the origin of optical activity came much later and developed in its modern form from the classic researches of Louis Pasteur and from the concept of the threedimensional carbon atoms expressed independently by J H vant Hoff and J A Le Bel Pasteurs contribution to stereochemistry came as a result of his studies of the shapes of crystals of tartaric acid and its salts Tartaric acid a byproduct of wine production was known to be optically active and Pasteur showed that it and nineteen different salts of it all formed crystals that were not identical with their mirror images A different substance known as racemic acid for which we can write the same condensed formula was known to be optically inactive and Pasteur expected that when he crystallized this acid or its salts he would obtain crystals that would be identical with their mirror images However crystallization of the sodium ammonium salt of racemic acid from water at temperatures below gave crystals of two different shapes and these shapes were mirror images of one another Pasteur carefully picked apart the two kinds of crystals and showed that one of them was identical with the corresponding salt of tartaric acid except that it rotated the plane of polarization of polarized light in the opposite direction This separation of racemic acid into two optically active forms now is called a resolution of racemic acid On the basis of his discoveries Pasteur postulated that optical isomerism had to be related to the molecular dissymmetry of substances such that nonidentical mirrorimage forms could exist However it remained for vant Hoff and Le Bel to provide almost simultaneously a satisfactory explanation at the molecular level In his first published work on tetrahedral carbon vant Hoff said it appears more and more that the present constitutional formulae are incapable of explaining certain cases of isomerism the reason for this is perhaps the fact that we need a more definite statement about the actual positions of the atoms He goes on to discuss the consequences of the tetrahedral arrangements of atoms about carbon explicitly in connection with optical isomerism and geometric or cistrans isomerism It is not easy for the chemist of today to appreciate fully the contributions of these early chemists because we have long accepted the tetrahedral carbon as an experimentally established fact At the time the concept was enunciated however even the existence of atoms and molecules was questioned openly by many scientists and to ascribe shapes to what in the first place seemed like metaphysical conceptions was too much for many to accept D Properties of Enantiomers Optical activity is an experimentally useful property and usually is measured as the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization of polarized light passing through solutions of the substances under investigation Figure Where measurable optical activity is present it is found that one enantiomer rotates the plane of polarization in one direction whereas the other causes the plane to rotate equally but in the opposite direction With reference to the plane of incident light the enantiomer that rotates the plane to the right is called dextrorotatory and is symbolized by either d or the enantiomer that rotates the plane to the left is levorotatory symbolized by l or A racemic mixture then can be designated as dl or and will have no net optical rotation It is very important to know that d l or do not designate configurations Thus although butanol actually has configuration and butanol has configuration there is no simple way to predict that a particular sign of rotation will be associated with a particular configuration Methods used in assigning the true configurations to enantiomers will be discussed later Figure Schematic representation of the rotation of the plane of polarization of polarized light by an optically active compound Planepolarized light is different from ordinary light in that its electrical component vibrates in a plane rather than in all directions The angle is the angle between the plane of polarization of light entering the sample and the plane of polarization of the emerging light A very important point to keep in mind about any pair of enantiomers is that they will have identical chemical and physical properties except for the signs of their optical rotations with one important proviso All of the properties to be compared must be determined using achiral reagents in a solvent made up of achiral molecules or in short in an achiral environment Thus the melting and boiling points but not the optical rotations of and will be identical in an achiral environment How a chiral environment or chiral reagents influence the properties of substances such as and will be considered in Chapter In the older literature chiral centers often are called asymmetric centers and you may be confused by the difference between asymmetric and dissymmetric Both asymmetric and dissymmetric molecules or objects are chiral An asymmetric object has no symmetry at all and looks different from all angles of view Formulas and represent asymmetric molecules A dissymmetric molecule is chiral but looks the same from more than one angle of view A helical spring is dissymmetric it looks the same from each end We will encounter dissymmetric molecules later The tetrahedral carbon was first proposed by E Paterno in see SectionE but he apparently did not recognize its implications for chirality These implications were recognized first by vant Hoff and Le Bel with vant Hoff proceeding on the basis of bonds to carbon being directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron Le Bel was opposed to such a rigid formulation of the bonds to carbon An interesting account and references to vant Hoffs early work can be found in The Reception of J H vant Hoffs Theory of the Asymmetric Carbon by H A M Snelders J Chem Educ A century has passed since vant Hoff first published his theory which he did before he obtained his doctoral degree from the University of Utrecht vant Hoff was the first
