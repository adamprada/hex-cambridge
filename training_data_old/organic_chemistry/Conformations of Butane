Conformations of Butane Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Learning Objective interpret and draw the rotation about a carboncarbon single bond using Newman projections and sawhorse structures correlate energies of conformations with rotational energy diagrams and predict the most stable conformations for butane Butane Conformations Now lets consider butane with its fourcarbon chain There are now three rotating carboncarbon bonds to consider but we will focus on the middle bond between C and C Below are two representations of butane in a conformation which puts the two CH groups C and C in the eclipsed position with the two CC bonds at a o dihedral angle If we rotate the front blue carbon by clockwise the butane molecule is now in a staggered conformation This is more specifically referred to as the gauche conformation of butane Notice that although they are staggered the two methyl groups are not as far apart as they could possibly be A further rotation of gives us a second eclipsed conformation B in which both methyl groups are lined up with hydrogen atoms One more rotation produces another staggered conformation called the anti conformation where the two methyl groups are positioned opposite each other a dihedral angle of o As with ethane the staggered conformations of butane are energy valleys and the eclipsed conformations are energy peaks However in the case of butane there are two different valleys and two different peaks The gauche conformation is a higher energy valley than the anti conformation due to steric strain which is the repulsive interaction caused by the two bulky methyl groups being forced too close together Clearly steric strain is lower in the anti conformation In the same way steric strain causes the eclipsed A conformation where the two methyl groups are as close together as they can possibly be to be higher in energy than the two eclipsed B conformations The diagram below summarizes the relative energies for the various eclipsed staggered and gauche conformations The following diagram illustrates the change in potential energy that occurs with rotation about the CC bond at smaller rotational increments Potential curve vs dihedral angle of the CC bond of butane Because the anti conformation staggered is lowest in energy and also simply for ease of drawing it is conventional to draw openchain alkanes in a zigzag form which implies anti conformation at all carboncarbon bonds The figure below shows as an example a Newman projection looking down the CC bond of octane Exercise Draw Newman projections of the lowest and highest energy conformations of propane Draw a Newman projection looking down the CC bond of butene in the conformation shown below C should be your front carbon Solutions to exercises Online lectures from Kahn Academy Newman projections part I Newman projections part II Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
