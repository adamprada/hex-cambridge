Objectives After completing this section you should be able to explain the concept of free rotation about a carboncarbon single bond explain the difference between conformational isomerism and structural isomerism draw the conformers of ethane using both sawhorse representation and Newman projection sketch a graph of energy versus bond rotation for ethane and discuss the graph in terms of torsional strain Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below conformation conformer conformational isomer dihedral angle eclipsed conformation Newman projection staggered conformation strain energy torsional strain eclipsing strain Study Notes You should be prepared to sketch various conformers using both sawhorse representations and Newman projections Each method has its own advantages depending upon the circumstances Notice that when drawing the Newman projection of the eclipsed conformation of ethane you cannot clearly draw the rear hydrogens exactly behind the front ones This is an inherent limitation associated with representing a D structure in two dimensions Conformational isomerism involves rotation about sigma bonds and does not involve any differences in the connectivity of the atoms or geometry of bonding Two or more structures that are categorized as conformational isomers or conformers are really just two of the exact same molecule that differ only in rotation of one or more sigma bonds Ethane Conformations Although there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule rotation about the six carbonhydrogen bonds does not result in any change in the shape of the molecule because the hydrogen atoms are essentially spherical Rotation about the carboncarbon bond however results in many different possible molecular conformations In order to better visualize these different conformations it is convenient to use a drawing convention called the Newman projection In a Newman projection we look lengthwise down a specific bond of interest in this case the carboncarbon bond in ethane We depict the front atom as a dot and the back atom as a larger circle The six carbonhydrogen bonds are shown as solid lines protruding from the two carbons at angles which is what the actual tetrahedral geometry looks like when viewed from this perspective and flattened into two dimensions Interactive Element Figure A D Model of Staggered Ethane The lowest energy conformation of ethane shown in the figure above is called the staggered conformation In the staggered conformation all of the CH bonds on the front carbon are positioned at an angle of relative to the CH bonds on the back carbon This angle between a sigma bond on the front carbon compared to a sigma bond on the back carbon is called the dihedral angle In this conformation the distance between the bonds and the electrons in them is maximized Maximizing the distance between the electrons decreases the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons and results in a more stable structure If we now rotate the front CH group clockwise the molecule is in the highest energy eclipsed conformation and the hydrogens on the front carbon are as close as possible to the hydrogens on the back carbon This is the highest energy conformation because of unfavorable electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the front and back CH bonds The energy of the eclipsed conformation is approximately kcalmol kJmol higher than that of the staggered conformation Torsional strain or eclipsing strain is the name give to the energy difference caused by the increased electrostatic repulsion of eclipsing bonds Another rotation returns the molecule to a second eclipsed conformation This process can be continued all around the circle with three possible eclipsed conformations and three staggered conformations in addition to an infinite number of variations in between We will focus on the staggered and eclipsed conformers since they are respectively the lowest and highest energy conformers Unhindered Free Rotations Do Not Exist in Ethane The carboncarbon bond is not completely free to rotate the kcalmol torsional strain in ethane creates a barrier to rotation that must be overcome for the bond to rotate from one staggered conformation to another This rotational barrier is not large enough to prevent rotation except at extremely cold temperatures So at normal temperatures the carboncarbon bond is constantly rotating However at any given moment the molecule is more likely to be in a staggered conformation one of the rotational energy valleys than in any other conformer The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds as shown in Figure Figure The potential energy associated with the various conformations of ethane varies with the dihedral angle of the bonds Valleys in the graph represent the low energy staggered conformers while peaks represent the higher energy eclipsed conformers Although the conformers of ethane are in rapid equilibrium with each other the kcalmol energy difference leads to a substantial preponderance of staggered conformers at any given time The animation below illustrates the relationship between ethanes potential energy and its dihedral angle Figure Animation of potential energy vs dihedral angle in ethane Exercises What is
