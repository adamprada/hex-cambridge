Conformations of Higher Alkanes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions Learning Objective interpret and draw the rotation about a carboncarbon single bond using Newman projections and sawhorse structures correlate energies of conformations with rotational energy diagrams and predict the most stable conformations for higher alkanes Pentane and Higher Alkanes Pentane and higher alkanes have conformational preferences similar to ethane and butane Each dihedral angle tries to adopt a staggered conformation and each internal CC bond attempts to take on an anti conformation to minimize the potential energy of the molecule The most stable conformation of any unbranched alkane follows these rules to take on zigzag shapes Figure The zigzag shapes of unbranched alkanes in their most stable conformations Lets analyze the staggered conformations of pentane in more detail considering conformations about the C_ C_ and C_ C_ bonds shows a few possible permutations The most stable conformation is anti at both bonds whereas less stable conformations contain gauche interactions One gauchegauche conformer is particularly unfavorable because methyl groups are aligned with parallel bonds in close proximity This conformation is called syn This type of steric hindrance across five atoms is called a synpentane interaction Synpentane interactions have an energetic cost of about kcalmol relative to the antianti conformation and are therefore disfavored Figure Staggered conformations of pentane Exercises Draw Newman projections of the eclipsed and staggered conformations of propane Draw a Newman projection looking down the CC bond of butene in the conformation shown below Draw the energy diagram for the rotation of the bond highlighted in pentane Answer Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris Jim Clark Chemguidecouk William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry
