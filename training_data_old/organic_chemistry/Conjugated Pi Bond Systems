Conjugated Pi Bond Systems Last updated Save as PDF Page ID MO theory and conjugated pi bondsAromaticity The Ultimate Conjugated System Learning Objective recognize conjugated pi bond systems recognize that benzene is aromatic Introduction It is important to train our eye to recognize structural features that have stabilizing effects Alternating single and double bonds create a conjugated pi bond system across multiple atoms that lowers the energy and stabilizes the molecule or ion When we look at carboncarbon double bonds CC we need to look and see if they are isolated or conjugated To understand the source of this stabilization we will use molecular orbital MO theory Valence bond theory does a remarkably good job at explaining the bonding geometry of many of the functional groups in organic compounds however it fails to adequately account for the stability contained in alternating double and single bonds In order to understand these properties we will use the ideas of MO theory Lets go back and consider again the simplest possible covalent bond the one in molecular hydrogen H When we described the hydrogen molecule using valence bond theory we said that the two s orbitals from each atom overlap allowing the two electrons to be shared and thus forming a covalent bond In molecular orbital theory we make a further statement we say that the two atomic s orbitals mathematically combine to form two new orbitals Recall that an atomic orbital such as the s orbital of a hydrogen atom describes a region of space around a single atom inside which electrons are likely to be found A molecular orbital describes a region of space around two or more atoms inside which electrons are likely to be found Mathematical principles tell us that when orbitals combine the number of orbitals before the combination takes place must equal the number of new orbitals that result from the combination orbitals dont just disappear We saw this previously when we discussed hybrid orbitals one s and three p orbitals make four sp hybrids When two atomic s orbitals combine in the formation of H the result is two sigma σ orbitals Molecular orbitals for H According to MO theory one sigma orbital is lower in energy than either of the two isolated atomic s orbitals this lower sigma orbital is referred to as a bonding molecular orbital The second sigma star orbital is higher in energy than the two atomic s orbitals and is referred to as an antibonding molecular orbital The bonding sigma orbital which holds both electrons in the ground state of the molecule is eggshaped encompassing the two nuclei and with the highest likelihood of electrons being in the area between the two nuclei The highenergy antibonding sigma orbital can be visualized as a pair of droplets with areas of higher electron density near each nucleus and a node area of zero electron density midway between the two nuclei Remember that we are thinking here about electron behavior as wave behavior When two separate waves combine they can do so with constructive interference where the two amplitudes build up and reinforce one another or destructive interference where the two amplitudes cancel one another out Bonding MOs are the consequence of constructive interference between two atomic orbitals which results in an attractive interaction and an increase in electron density between the nuclei Antibonding MOs are the consequence of destructive interference which results in a repulsive interaction and a region of zero electron density between the nuclei in other words a node Following the same aufbau building up principle you learned in General Chemistry for writing out electron configurations we place the two electrons in the H molecule in the lowest energy molecular orbital which is the bonding sigma orbital The bonding attracting MO is full and the antibonding repulsing MO is empty MO theory and conjugated pi bonds The advantage of using MO theory to understand bonding in organic molecules becomes more apparent when we think about pi bonds Lets first consider the pi bond in ethene from an MO theory standpoint in this example we will be disregarding the s bonds in the molecule and thinking only about the π bond We start with two atomic orbitals one unhybridized p orbital from each carbon Each contains a single electron In MO theory the two atomic combine mathematically to form two pi molecular orbitals one a lowenergy pi bonding orbital and one a highenergy pi antibonding orbital Molecular orbitals for ethene ethylene In the bonding pi orbital the two shaded lobes of the p orbitals interact constructively with each other as do the two unshaded lobes remember the arbitrary shading choice represents mathematical and signs for the mathematical wavefunction describing the orbital There is increased electron density between the two carbon nuclei in the molecular orbital it is a bonding interaction In the higherenergy antibonding pi orbital the shaded lobe of one p orbital interacts destructively with the unshaded lobe of the second p orbital leading to a node between the two nuclei and overall repulsion between the carbon nuclei Again using the building up principle we place the two electrons in the lowerenergy bonding pi molecular orbital The antibonding pi orbital remains empty Next well consider the butadiene molecule From valence orbital theory alone we might expect that the CC bond in this molecule because it is a sigma bond would be able to rotate freely Experimentally however it is observed that there is a significant barrier to rotation about the CC bond and that the entire molecule is planar In addition the CC bond is pm long shorter than a typical carboncarbon single bond about pm though longer than a typical double bond about pm Molecular orbital theory accounts for these observations with the concept of delocalized pi bonds In this picture the four p atomic orbitals combine mathematically to form four pi molecular orbitals of increasing energy Two of these the bonding pi orbitals are lower in energy than the p atomic orbitals from which they are formed while two the antibonding pi orbitals are higher in energy The lowest energy molecular orbital pi has only constructive interaction and zero nodes Higher in energy but still lower than the isolated p orbitals the pi orbital has one node but two constructive interactions thus it is still a bonding orbital overall Looking at the two antibonding orbitals pi has two nodes and one constructive interaction while pi has three nodes and zero constructive interactions By the aufbau principle the four electrons from the isolated pz atomic orbitals are placed in the bonding pi and pi MOs Because pi includes constructive interaction between C and C there is a degree in the butadiene molecule of pibonding interaction between these two carbons which accounts for its shorter length and the barrier to rotation The valence bond picture of butadiene shows the two pi bonds as being isolated from one another with each pair of pi electrons stuck in its own pi bond However molecular orbital theory predicts accurately that the four pi electrons are to some extent delocalized or spread out over the whole pi system spacefilling view butadiene is the simplest example of a system of conjugated pi bonds To be considered conjugated two or more pi bonds must be separated by only one single bond in other words there cannot be an intervening sphybridized carbon because this would break up the overlapping system of parallel p orbitals In the compound below for example the CC and CC double bonds are conjugated while the CC double bond is isolated from the other two pi bonds by sphybridized C A very important concept to keep in mind is that there is an inherent thermodynamic stability associated with conjugation This stability can be measured experimentally by comparing the heat of hydrogenation of two different dienes Hydrogenation is a reaction type that we will learn much more about in chapter essentially it is the process of adding a hydrogen molecule two protons and two electrons to a p bond When the two conjugated double bonds of pentadiene are hydrogenated to produce pentane about kJ is released per mole of pentane formed Compare that to the approximately kJmol released when the two isolated double bonds in pentadiene are hydrogenated also forming pentane The conjugated diene is lower in energy in other words it is more stable In general conjugated pi bonds are more stable than isolated pi bonds Conjugated pi systems can involve oxygen and nitrogen atoms as well as carbon In the metabolism of fat molecules some of the key reactions involve alkenes that are conjugated to carbonyl groups In chapter we will see that MO theory is very useful in explaining why organic molecules that contain extended systems of conjugated pi bonds often have distinctive colors betacarotene the compound responsible for the orange color of carrots has an extended system of conjugated pi bonds Exercise Identify all conjugated and isolated double bonds in the structures below For each conjugated pi system specify the number of overlapping p orbitals and how many pi electrons are shared among them Exercise Identify all isolated and conjugated pi bonds in lycopene the redcolored compound in tomatoes How many pi electrons are contained in the conjugated pi system Solutions to exercises Aromaticity The Ultimate Conjugated System Molecular orbital theory is especially helpful in explaining the unique properties of aromatic compounds such as benzene D interactive model of benzene Although benzene is most often drawn with three double bonds and three single bonds in fact all of the carboncarbon bonds iare exactly the same length pm In addition the pi bonds in benzene are significantly less reactive than normal pi bonds either isolated or conjugated Something about the structure of benzene makes its pi bonding arrangement especially stable This something has a name it is called aromaticity What exactly is this aromatic property that makes the pi bonds in benzene so stable In large part the answer to this question lies in the fact that benzene is a cyclic molecule in which all of the ring atoms are sphybridized This allows the pi electrons to be delocalized in molecular orbitals that extend all the way around the ring above and below the plane For this to happen of course the ring must be planar otherwise the p orbitals couldnt overlap properly Benzene is indeed known to be a flat molecule Do all cyclic molecules with alternating single and double bonds have this same aromatic stability The answer in fact is no The eightmembered cyclooctatetraene ring shown below is not flat and its π bonds react like normal alkenes Clearly it takes something more to be aromatic and this can best be explained with molecular orbital theory Lets look at an energy diagram of the pi molecular orbitals in benzene Quantum mechanical calculations tell us that the six pi molecular orbitals in benzene formed from six atomic p orbitals occupy four separate energy levels pi and pi have unique energy levels while the pi pi and pi pi pairs are degenerate meaning they are at the same energy level When we use the aufbau principle to fill up these orbitals with the six pi electrons in benzene we see that the bonding orbitals are completely filled and the antibonding orbitals are empty This gives us a good clue to the source of the special stability of benzene a full set of bonding MOs is similar in many ways to the full shell of electrons in the atomic orbitals of the stable noble gases helium neon and argon Now lets do the same thing for cyclooctatetraene which we have already learned is not aromatic The result of molecular orbital calculations tells us that the lowest and highest energy MOs pi and pi have unique energy levels while the other six form degenerate pairs Notice that pi and pi are at the same energy level as the isolated pz atomic orbitals these are therefore neither bonding nor antibonding rather they are referred to as nonbonding MOs Filling up the MOs with the eight pi electrons in the molecule we find that the last two electrons are unpaired and fall into the two degenerate nonbonding orbitals Because we dont have a perfect filled shell of bonding MOs our molecule is not aromatic As a consequence each of the double bonds in cyclooctatetraene acts more like an isolated double bond For now the important learning objective is to recognize conjugated pi bonds systems and understand the benzene is exceptionally stable exhibiting a property called aromaticity Aromaticity and chemistry of aromatic compounds is relatively complex and is discussed in greater detail in subsequent chapters of this text Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota
