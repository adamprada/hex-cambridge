Degrees of Unsaturation Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Saturated and Unsaturated MoleculesCalculating The Degree of Unsaturation DUReferencesContributors and Attributions Learning Objectives calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation DU and apply it to alkene structure Saturated and Unsaturated Molecules In the lab saturation may be thought of as the point when a solution cannot dissolve anymore of a substance added to it In terms of degrees of unsaturation a molecule only containing single bonds with no rings is considered saturated CHCHCH methyoxypentane Unlike saturated molecules unsaturated molecules contain double bonds triple bonds andor rings CHCHCHCH chlorooctyne There are many ways one can go about determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule Although nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and infrared radiation IR are the primary ways of determining molecular structures these techniques require expensive instrumentation and are not always readily available Fortunately calculating the degrees of unsaturation provides useful information about the structure The degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings within a molecule which makes it easier for one to figure out the molecular structure DU Degrees of Unsaturation number of pi bonds number of rings Alkenes RCCR and alkynes RCCR are called unsaturated hydrocarbons because they have fewer hydrogen atoms than does an alkane with the same number of carbon atoms as is indicated in the following general formulas Calculating The Degree of Unsaturation DU If the molecular formula is given plug in the numbers into this formula is the number of carbons is the number of nitrogens is the number of halogens F Cl Br I is the number of hydrogens The molecular formula of a hydrocarbon provides information about the possible structural types it may represent A saturated molecule contains only single bonds and no rings Another way of interpreting this is that a saturated molecule has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible to be an acyclic alkane Thus the number of hydrogens can be represented by C which is the general molecular representation of an alkane As an example for the molecular formula CH the number of actual hydrogens needed for the compound to be saturated is Cx The compound needs more hydrogens in order to be fully saturated expected number of hydrogensobserved number of hydrogens Degrees of unsaturation is equal to or half the number of hydrogens the molecule needs to be classified as saturated Hence the DoB formula divides by The formula subtracts the number of Xs because a halogen X replaces a hydrogen in a compound For instance in chloroethane CHCl there is one less hydrogen compared to ethane CH For example consider compounds having the formula CH The formula of the fivecarbon alkane pentane is CH so the difference in hydrogen content is This difference suggests such compounds may have a triple bond two double bonds a ring plus a double bond or two rings Some examples are shown here and there are at least fourteen others For a compound to be saturated there is one more hydrogen in a molecule when nitrogen is present Therefore we add the number of nitrogens N This can be seen with CHN compared to CH Oxygen and sulfur are not included in the formula because saturation is unaffected by these elements As seen in alcohols the same number of hydrogens in ethanol CHOH matches the number of hydrogens in ethane CH The following chart illustrates the possible combinations of the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings for a given degree of unsaturation Each row corresponds to a different combination One degree of unsaturation is equivalent to ring or double bond bond Two degrees of unsaturation is equivalent to double bonds ring and double bond rings or triple bond bonds When the DU is or greater the presence of benzene rings is very likely DU Possible combinations of rings bonds of rings of double bonds of triple bonds Remember the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor rings For instance a degree of unsaturation of can contain rings rings double bond ring double bonds ring triple bond double bond triple bond or double bonds Example Benzene What is the Degree of Unsaturation for Benzene Solution The molecular formula for benzene is CH Thus DU where C NX and H DoB can equal ring or double bond This corresponds to benzene containing ring and double bonds However when given the molecular formula CH benzene is only one of many possible structures isomers The following structures all have DU of and have the same molecular formula as benzene However these compounds are very rare unlike benzene We will learn more about the reasons for benzens high stability when we studey aromaticity in later chapters Exercises Are the following molecules saturated or unsaturated b c d CHN Using the molecules from above give the degrees of unsaturation for each Calculate the degrees of unsaturation classify the compound as saturated or unsaturated and list all the ringpi bond combination possible for the following molecular formulas a CH b CH c CHCl d CHNO Calculate degrees of unsaturation DoU for the following and propose a structure for each a CH b CH Calculate the degree of unsaturation DoU for the following molecules a CHN b CHNO c CHBr The following molecule is caffeine CHNO determine the degrees of unsaturation DoU Answer a unsaturated Even though rings only contain single bonds rings are considered unsaturated b unsaturated c saturated d unsaturated If the molecular structure is given the easiest way to solve is to count the number of double bonds triple bonds andor rings However you can also determine the molecular formula and solve for the degrees of unsaturation by using the formula a b one double bond and the double bond from the carbonyl c d a DU saturated Remembera saturated molecule only contains single bonds b DU unsaturated The molecule can contain any of these combinations of rings and pi bonds that add up to such as i double bonds ii rings iii double bonds rings iv double bond rings v double bonds ring vi triple bond rings vii triple bonds viii triple bond double bond ring ix triple bond double bonds c DU unsaturated i triple bond ii ring double bond iii rings iv double bonds d DU i triple bonds ii triple bonds double bonds iii triple bonds double bond ring iv As you can see the degrees of unsaturation only gives the sum of double bonds triple bonds andor ring Thus the formula may give numerous possible structures for a given molecular formula a b c DU References Vollhardt K PC Shore N Organic Chemistry thEd New York W H Freeman Shore N Study Guide and Solutions Manual for
