differences in bond length and strength in terms of the efficiency with which atomic orbitals overlap draw simple molecular orbital diagrams eg for the H molecule showing the formation of bonding and antibonding orbitals Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below antibonding molecular orbital bonding molecular orbital molecular orbital MO theory As we have seen valence bond theory does a remarkably good job of explaining the bonding geometry and properties of many organic compounds There are some areas however where the valence bond theory falls short It fails to adequately account for example for some interesting properties of compounds that contain alternating double and single bonds In order to understand these properties we need to think about chemical bonding in a new way using the ideas of molecular orbital MO theory Another look at the H molecule bonding and antibonding sigma molecular orbitals Lets consider again the simplest possible covalent bond the one in molecular hydrogen H When we described the hydrogen molecule using valence bond theory we said that the two s orbitals from each atom overlap allowing the two electrons to be shared and thus forming a covalent bond In molecular orbital theory we make a further statement we say that the two atomic s orbitals dont just overlap they actually combine to form two completely new orbitals These two new orbitals instead of describing the likely location of an electron around a single nucleus describe the location of an electron pair around two or more nuclei The bonding in H then is due to the formation of a new molecular orbital MO in which a pair of electrons is delocalized around two hydrogen nuclei An important principle of quantum mechanical theory is that when orbitals combine the number of orbitals before the combination takes place must equal the number of new orbitals that result orbitals dont just disappear We saw this previously when we discussed hybrid orbitals one s and three p orbitals make four sp hybrids When two atomic s orbitals combine in the formation of H the result is two molecular orbitals called sigma σ orbitals According to MO theory the first sigma orbital is lower in energy than either of the two isolated atomic s orbitals thus this sigma orbital is referred to as a bonding molecular orbital The second sigmastar σ orbital is higher in energy than the two atomic s orbitals and is referred to as an antibonding molecular orbital In MO theory a star sign always indicates an antibonding orbital Following the aufbau building up principle we place the two electrons in the H molecule in the lowest energy molecular orbital which is the bonding sigma orbital The bonding sigma orbital which holds both electrons in the ground state of the molecule is eggshaped encompassing the two nuclei and with the highest likelihood of electrons being in the area between the two nuclei The highenergy antibonding sigmastar orbital can be visualized as a pair of droplets with areas of higher electron density near each nucleus and a node area of zero electron density midway between the two nuclei Remember that we are thinking here about electron behavior as wave behavior When two separate waves combine they can do so with what is called constructive interference where the two amplitudes reinforce one another or destructive interference where the two amplitudes cancel one another out Bonding MOs are the consequence of constructive interference between two atomic orbitals which results in an attractive interaction and an increase in electron density between the nuclei Antibonding MOs are the consequence of destructive interference which results in a repulsive interaction and a canceling out of electron density between the nuclei in other words a node MO theory and pi bonds In p orbitals the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases analogous to how a twodimensional wave has both parts above and below the average We indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors When orbital lobes of the same phase overlap constructive wave interference increases the electron density When regions of opposite phase overlap the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes When p orbitals overlap end to end they create σ and σ orbitals If two atoms are located along the xaxis in a Cartesian coordinate system the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx bonding and σpx antibonding read as sigmapx and sigmapx star respectively Just as with sorbital overlap the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei which is a higherenergy antibonding orbital The advantage of MO theory becomes more apparent when we think about pi bonds especially in those situations where two or more pi bonds are able to interact with one another Lets first consider the pi bond in ethene from an MO theory standpoint in this example we will be disregarding the various sigma bonds and thinking only about the pi bond According to MO theory the two atomic pz orbitals combine to form two pi π molecular orbitals one a lowenergy π bonding orbital and one a highenergy πstar π antibonding molecular orbital These are sometimes denoted in MO diagrams like the one below with the Greek letter psi Ψ instead of π In the bonding Ψ orbital the two shaded lobes of the pz orbitals interact constructively with each other as do the two unshaded lobes remember the shading choice represents mathematical and signs for the wavefunction Therefore there is increased electron density between the nuclei in the molecular orbital this is why it is a bonding orbital In the higherenergy antibonding Ψ orbital the shaded lobe of one pz orbital interacts destructively with the unshaded lobe of the second pz orbital leading to a node between the two nuclei and overall repulsion By the aufbau principle the two electrons from the two atomic orbitals will be paired in the lowerenergy Ψorbital when the molecule is in the ground state Exercises Draw a simple molecular orbital diagram for each of the following molecules nitrogen N oxygen O Answers Answers
