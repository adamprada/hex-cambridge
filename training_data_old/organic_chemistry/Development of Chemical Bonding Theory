the key terms below bond strength covalent bond ionic bond Lewis structure lonepair electron nonbonding electron Study Notes To draw Lewis structures successfully you need to know the number of valence electrons present in each of the atoms involved Memorize the number of valence electrons possessed by each of the elements commonly encountered in organic chemistry C H O N S P and the halogens When drawing any organic structure you must remember that a neutral carbon atom will almost always have four bonds Similarly hydrogen always has one bond neutral oxygen atoms have two bonds and neutral nitrogen atoms have three bonds By committing these simple rules to memory you can avoid making unnecessary mistakes later in the course The wedgeandbrokenline type of representation which helps to convey the threedimensional nature of organic compounds will be used throughout the course Bonding Overview Why are some substances chemically bonded molecules and others are an association of ions The answer to this question depends upon the electronic structures of the atoms and nature of the chemical forces within the compounds Although there are no sharply defined boundaries chemical bonds are typically classified into three main types ionic bonds covalent bonds and metallic bonds In this chapter each type of bond and the general properties found in typical substances in which the bond type occurs will be discussed Ionic bonds results from electrostatic forces that exist between ions of opposite charge These bonds typically involve a metal with a nonmetal Covalent bonds result from the sharing of electrons between two atoms The bonds typically involve one nonmetallic element with another Metallic bonds are found in solid metals copper iron aluminum with each metal atom bonded to several neighboring metal atoms and the bonding electrons are free to move throughout the dimensional structure Each bond classification is discussed in detail in subsequent sections of the chapter Lets look at the preferred arrangements of electrons in atoms when they form chemical compounds Figure G N Lewis and the Octet Rule a Lewis is working in the laboratory b In Lewiss original sketch for the octet rule he initially placed the electrons at the corners of a cube rather than placing them as we do now Lewis Symbols At the beginning of the th century the American chemist G N Lewis devised a system of symbolsnow called Lewis electron dot symbols often shortened to Lewis dot symbolsthat can be used for predicting the number of bonds formed by most elements in their compounds Each Lewis dot symbol consists of the chemical symbol for an element surrounded by dots that represent its valence electrons Lewis Dot symbols provide a convenient representation of valence electrons allows you to keep track of valence electrons during bond formation consists of the chemical symbol for the element plus a dot for each valence electron To write an elements Lewis dot symbol we place dots representing its valence electrons one at a time around the elements chemical symbol Up to four dots are placed above below to the left and to the right of the symbol in any order as long as elements with four or fewer valence electrons have no more than one dot in each position The next dots for elements with more than four valence electrons are again distributed one at a time each paired with one of the first four Fluorine for example with the electron configuration Hesp has seven valence electrons so its Lewis dot symbol is constructed as follows Figure Lewis Dot Symbols for the Elements in Period Lewis used the unpaired dots to predict the number of bonds that an element will form in a compound Consider the symbol for nitrogen in Figure The Lewis dot symbol explains why nitrogen with three unpaired valence electrons tends to form compounds in which it shares the unpaired electrons to form three bonds Boron which also has three unpaired valence electrons in its Lewis dot symbol also tends to form compounds with three bonds whereas carbon with four unpaired valence electrons in its Lewis dot symbol tends to share all of its unpaired valence electrons by forming compounds in which it has four bonds Lewis symbols are a tool to help draw structures We will see why bonding in molecular compounds follow Lewis theory in the next seciont Elements in the same period have the same number of valence electrons and similar Lewis symbols For example the electron configuration for atomic sulfur is Nesp thus there are six valence electrons Its Lewis symbol would therefore be similar oxygen and look like The Octet Rule Lewiss major contribution to bonding theory was to recognize that atoms tend to lose gain or share electrons to reach a total of eight valence electrons called an octet This socalled octet rule explains the stoichiometry of most compounds in the s and p blocks of the periodic table We now know from quantum mechanics that the number eight corresponds to one ns and three np valence orbitals which together can accommodate a total of eight electrons Remarkably though Lewiss insight was made nearly a decade before Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of the atom Common exceptions to the octet rule are helium whose s electron configuration gives it a full n shell and hydrogen which tends to gain or share its one electron to achieve the electron configuration of helium Lewiss idea of an octet explains why noble gases rarely form compounds They have the stable sp configuration full octet no charge so they have no reason to react and change their configuration All other elements attempt to gain lose or share electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration This explains why atom combine together to form compounds By forming bond the makes the atoms more stable and lower in energy Making bonds releases energy and represents a driving force for the formation of compounds Atoms often gain lose or share electrons to achieve the same number of electrons as the noble gas closest to them in the periodic table Lewis Structures Lewis structures represent how Lewis symbols gain lose or share electrons to obtain an octet by forming compounds Lewis Structures of Ionic Compounds Whenever there is a metal present in the structure of an organic compound there is a high likelihood that at least one ionic bond is present Ionic bonds are represented differently in Lewis structures than covalent bonds Great care should be taken whenever drawing the Lewis structure of an organic compounds which contains and ionic bond Ionic bonds typically are formed when a metal and a nonmetal are part of a compound Some atoms achieve an octet by fully gaining or losing electrons to form ions Ionic bonds form through the eletrostatic attraction of the created ions The formula for table salt is NaCl It is the result of Na ions and Cl ions bonding together If sodium metal and chlorine gas mix under the right conditions they will form salt The sodium loses an electron and the chlorine gains that electron In the process a great amount of light and heat is released The resulting salt is mostly unreactive it is stable It will not undergo any explosive reactions unlike the sodium and chlorine that it is made of Why Referring to the octet rule atoms attempt to get a noble gas electron configuration which is eight valence electrons Sodium ssps has one valence electron so giving it up would result in the same electron configuration as neon ssp Chlorine sspsphas seven valence electrons so if it takes one it will have eight an octet Chlorine has the electron configuration of argon sspsp when it gains an electron The Lewis structure of an ionic compound show the movement of electrons For NaCl sodium is in group and has one valence electron and chlorine is in group and has seven valence electrons Sodium loses its sole valence electron thereby becomes positively charged Chlorine gains this electron gaining a full octet and a negative charge After the gainloss of an electron the new Lewis structures of Na and Cl are written next to each other representing the ionic bond in NaCl Examples of Lewis Structures of Ionic Compounds Covalent Bonds and the Lewis Structures of Molecular Compounds While alkali metals such as sodium and potassium alkaline earth metals such as magnesium and calcium and halogens such as fluorine and chlorine often form ions in order to achieve a full octet the principle elements of organic chemistry carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen instead tend to fill their octet by sharing electrons with other atoms forming covalent bonds Consider the simplest case of hydrogen gas An isolated hydrogen atom has only one electron located in the s orbital If two hydrogen atoms come close enough so that their respective s orbitals overlap the two electrons can be shared between the two nuclei and a covalently bonded H molecule is formed In the Lewis structure of H each pair of electrons that is shared between two atoms is drawn as a single line designating a single covalent bond Hydrogen represents a special case because a hydrogen atom cannot fulfill the octet rule it needs only two electrons to have a full shell This is often called the doublet rule for hydrogen One of the simplest organic molecules is methane with the molecular formula CH Methane is the natural gas burned in home furnaces and hot water heaters as well as in electrical power generating plants To illustrate the covalent bonding in methane using a Lewis structure we first must recognize that although a carbon atom has a total of six electrons its Lewis symbol has four unpaired electrons Following Lewis theory the carbon atom wants to form four covalent bonds to fill its octet In a methane molecule the central carbon atom shares its four valence electrons with four hydrogen atoms thus forming four bonds and fulfilling the octet rule for the carbon and the doublet rule for each of the hydrogens The next relatively simple organic molecule to consider is ethane which has the molecular formula CH If we draw each atoms Lewis symbol separately we can see that the octetdoublet rule can be fulfilled for all of them by forming one carboncarbon bond and six carbonhydrogen bonds The same approach can be used for molecules in which there is no carbon atom In a water molecule the Lewis symbol of the oxygen atom has two unpaired electrons These are paired with the single electron in the Lewis symbols of the hydrogens two OH covalent bonds The remaining four nonbonding electrons on oxygen called lone pairs Since the lone pair electrons are often NOT shown in chemical structures it is important to see mentally add the lone pairs In the beginning it can be helpful to physically add the lone pair electrons Exercise For the following structure please fill in all of the missing lone pair electrons Answer When two or more electrons are shared between atoms a multiple covalent bond is formed The molecular formula for ethene also known as ethylene a compound found in fruits such as apples that signals them to ripen is CH Arranging Lewis symbols of the atoms you can see that the octetdoublet rule can be fulfilled for all atoms only if the two carbons share two pairs of electrons between them Ethene contains a carboncarbon double bond Following this pattern the triple bond in ethyne molecular formula CH also known as acetylene the fuel used in welding torches is formed when the two carbon atoms share three pairs of electrons between them Exercise Draw the Lewis structure for ammonia NH Answer Molecular Shape A stick and wedge drawing of methane shows the tetrahedral anglesThe wedge is coming out of the paper and the dashed line is going behind the paper The solid lines are in the plane of the paper The following examples make use of this notation and also illustrate the importance of including nonbonding valence shell electron pairs when viewing such configurations Methane Ammonia Water Bonding configurations are readily predicted by valenceshell electronpair repulsion theory commonly referred to as VSEPR in most introductory chemistry texts This simple model is based on the fact that electrons repel each other and that it is reasonable to expect that the bonds and nonbonding valence electron pairs associated with a given atom will prefer to be as far apart as possible The bonding configurations of carbon are easy to remember since there are only three categories Configuration Bonding Partners Bond Angles Example Tetrahedral º Trigonal Planar º Linear º Figure In the three examples shown above the central atom carbon does not have any nonbonding valence electrons consequently the configuration may be estimated from the number of bonding partners alone However for molecules of water and ammonia the nonbonding electrons must be included in the calculation In each case there are four regions of electron density associated with the valence shell so that a tetrahedral bond angle is expected The measured bond angles of these compounds HO º NH º show that they are closer to being tetrahedral than trigonal planar or linear Of course it is the configuration of atoms not electrons that defines the the shape of a molecule and in this sense ammonia is said to be pyramidal not tetrahedral The compound boron trifluoride BF does not have nonbonding valence electrons and the configuration of its atoms is trigonal Nice treatments of VSEPR theory have been provided by Oxford and Purdue The best way to study the threedimensional shapes of molecules is by using molecular models Many kinds of model kits are available to students and professional chemists Two Electron Groups Our first example is a molecule with two bonded atoms and no lone pairs of electrons BeH AX BeH The central atom beryllium contributes two valence electrons and each hydrogen atom contributes one The Lewis electron structure is Figure Lewis Structure for BeH There are two electron groups around the central atom We see from Figure that the arrangement that minimizes repulsions places the groups apart Both groups around the central atom are bonding pairs BP Thus BeH is designated as AX From Figure we see that with two bonding pairs the molecular geometry that minimizes repulsions in BeH is linear AX CO The central atom carbon contributes four valence electrons and each oxygen atom contributes six The Lewis electron structure is The carbon atom forms two double bonds Each double bond is a group so there are two electron groups around the central atom Like BeH the arrangement that minimizes repulsions places the groups apart Once again both groups around the central atom are bonding pairs BP so CO is designated as AX VSEPR only recognizes groups around the central atom Thus the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms do not influence the molecular geometry With two bonding pairs on the central atom and no lone pairs the molecular geometry of CO is linear Figure Three Electron Groups AX BCl The central atom boron contributes three valence electrons and each chlorine atom contributes seven valence electrons The Lewis electron structure is There are three electron groups around the central atom To minimize repulsions the groups are placed apart Figure All electron groups are bonding pairs BP so the structure is designated as AX From Figure we see that with three bonding pairs around the central atom the molecular geometry of BCl is trigonal planar AX CO The central atom carbon has four valence electrons and each oxygen atom has six valence electrons As you learned previously the Lewis electron structure of one of three resonance forms is represented as The structure of CO is a resonance hybrid It has three identical bonds each with a bond order of We minimize repulsions by placing the three groups apart Figure All electron groups are bonding pairs BP With three bonding groups around the central atom the structure is designated as AX We see from Figure that the molecular geometry of CO is trigonal planar In our next example we encounter the effects of lone pairs and multiple bonds on molecular geometry for the first time AXE SO The central atom sulfur has valence electrons as does each oxygen atom With valence electrons the Lewis electron structure is shown below There are three electron groups around the central atom two double bonds and one lone pair We initially place the groups in a trigonal planar arrangement to minimize repulsions Figure There are two bonding pairs and one lone pair so the structure is designated as AXE This designation has a total of three electron pairs two X and one E Because a lone pair is not shared by two nuclei it occupies more space near the central atom than a bonding pair Figure Thus bonding pairs and lone pairs repel each other electrostatically in the order BPBP LPBP LPLP In SO we have one BPBP interaction and two LPBP interactions The molecular geometry is described only by the positions of the nuclei not by the positions of the lone pairs Thus with two nuclei and one lone pair the shape is bent or V shaped which can be viewed as a trigonal planar arrangement with a missing vertex Figures and Figure The Difference in the Space Occupied by a Lone Pair of Electrons and by a Bonding Pair As with SO this composite model of electron distribution and negative electrostatic potential in ammonia shows that a lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space around the nitrogen atom than does a bonding pair of electrons that is shared with a hydrogen atom Like lone pairs of electrons multiple bonds occupy more space around the central atom than a single bond which can cause other bond angles to be somewhat smaller than expected This is because a multiple bond has a higher electron density than a single bond so its electrons occupy more space than those of a single bond For example in a molecule such as CHO AX whose structure is shown below the double bond repels the single bonds more strongly than the single bonds repel each other This causes a deviation from ideal geometry an HCH bond angle of rather than Four Electron Groups One of the limitations of Lewis structures is that they depict molecules and ions in only two dimensions With four electron groups we must learn to show molecules and ions in three dimensions AX CH The central atom carbon contributes four valence electrons and each hydrogen atom has one valence electron so the full Lewis electron structure is There are four electron groups around the central atom As shown in Figure repulsions are minimized by placing the groups in the corners of a tetrahedron with bond angles of All electron groups are bonding pairs so the structure is designated as AX With four bonding pairs the molecular geometry of methane is tetrahedral Figure AXE NH In ammonia the central atom nitrogen has five valence electrons and each hydrogen donates one valence electron producing the Lewis electron structure There are four electron groups around nitrogen three bonding pairs and one lone pair Repulsions are minimized by directing each hydrogen atom and the lone pair to the corners of a tetrahedron With three bonding pairs and one lone pair the structure is designated as AXE This designation has a total of four electron pairs three X and one E We expect the LPBP interactions to cause the bonding pair angles to deviate significantly from the angles of a perfect tetrahedron There are three nuclei and one lone pair so the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal In essence this is a tetrahedron with a vertex missing Figure However the HNH bond angles are less than the ideal angle of because of LPBP repulsions AXE HO Oxygen has six valence electrons and each hydrogen has one valence electron producing the Lewis electron structure There are four groups around the central oxygen atom two bonding pairs and two lone pairs Repulsions are minimized by directing the bonding pairs and the lone pairs to the corners of a tetrahedron Figure With two bonding pairs and two lone pairs the structure is designated as AXE with a total of four electron pairs Due to LPLP LPBP and BPBP interactions we expect a significant deviation from idealized tetrahedral angles With two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electrons the structure has significant lone pair interactions There are two nuclei about the central atom so the molecular shape is bent or V shaped with an HOH angle that is even less than the HNH angles in NH as we would expect because of the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the central atom rather than one This molecular shape is essentially a tetrahedron with two missing vertices Exercises Questions Q List the bond angles for each of the following compounds BH CF HO Q Why is sulfur dioxide a bent molecule bond angle less than Solutions S HBH FCF OHO S This deviation is due to the lone pairs on the sulfur These force the molecule to exhibit a bent geometry and therefore a deviation from the
