Objective predict the productsspecify the reagents for dihydroxylation of alkenes Dihydroxylation of alkenes Alkenes can be dihydroxylated by two different stereochemical pathways antidihydroxylation or syndihydroxylation The opening of epoxides follows the antidihydroxylation mechanism while potassium permanganate or osmium tetroxide produce the syndihydroxylated products The osmium tertroxide reaction can also take place by a twostep process OsO in pyridine followed by HS or NaHSO It is important to note that different professors will emphasize different reagent systems to accomplish the same chemical reaction In these situations it can be helpful to recognize the role of each reagent to discern patterns Anti Dihydroxylation Epoxides may be cleaved by aqueous acid to give glycols that are often diastereomeric with those prepared by the synhydroxylation reaction described above Proton transfer from the acid catalyst generates the conjugate acid of the epoxide which is attacked by nucleophiles such as water in the same way that the cyclic bromonium ion described above undergoes reaction The result is antihydroxylation of the double bond in contrast to the synstereoselectivity of the earlier method In the following equation this procedure is illustrated for a cisdisubstituted epoxide which of course could be prepared from the corresponding cisalkene This hydration of an epoxide does not change the oxidation state of any atoms or groups The mechanism for the ring opening of epoxides depends on the reaction conditions and is discussed in more detail in the next section of this chapter Syn Dihydroxylation Osmium tetroxide oxidizes alkenes to give glycols through syn addition A glycol also known as a vicinal diol is a compound with two OH groups on adjacent carbons Dihydroxylated products glycols are obtained by reaction with aqueous potassium permanganate pH or osmium tetroxide in pyridine solution Both reactions appear to proceed by the same mechanism shown below the metallocyclic intermediate may be isolated in the osmium reaction In basic solution the purple permanganate anion is reduced to the green manganate ion providing a nice color test for the double bond functional group From the mechanism shown here we would expect synstereoselectivity in the bonding to oxygen and regioselectivity is not an issue When viewed in context with the previously discussed addition reactions the hydroxylation reaction might seem implausible Permanganate and osmium tetroxide have similar configurations in which the metal atom occupies the center of a tetrahedral grouping of negatively charged oxygen atoms How then would such a species interact with the nucleophilic pielectrons of a double bond A possible explanation is that an empty dorbital of the electrophilic metal atom extends well beyond the surrounding oxygen atoms and initiates electron transfer from the double bond to the metal in much the same fashion noted above for platinum Backbonding of the nucleophilic oxygens to the antibonding Ï€orbital completes this interaction The result is formation of a metallocyclic intermediate as shown above The reaction with is a concerted process that has a cyclic intermediate and no rearrangements Vicinal syn dihydroxylation complements the epoxidehydrolysis sequence which constitutes an anti dihydroxylation of an alkene When an alkene reacts with osmium tetroxide stereocenters can form in the glycol product Cis alkenes give meso products and trans alkenes give racemic mixtures is formed slowly when osmium powder reacts with gasoues at ambient temperature Reaction of bulk solid requires heating to C Since Osmium tetroxide is expensive and highly toxic the reaction with alkenes has been modified Catalytic amounts of OsO and stoichiometric amounts of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide are now used to eliminate some hazards Also an older reagent that was used instead of OsO was potassium permanganate Although syn diols will result from the reaction of KMnO and an alkene potassium permanganate is less useful since it gives poor yields of the product because of overoxidation Chemical Highlight Antitumor drugs have been formed by using dihydroxylation This method has been applied to the enantioselective synthesis of ovalicin which is a class of fungalderived products called antiangiogenesis agents These antitumor products can cut off the blood supply to solid tumors A derivative of ovalicin TNP is chemically stable nontoxic and noninflammatory TNP has been used in research to determine its effectiveness in treating cancer of the breast brain cervix liver and prostate Exercise Give the major product What is the product in the dihydroxylation of Zhexene What is the product in the dihydroxylation of Ehexene Draw the intermediate of this reaction Fill in the missing reactants reagents and product Answer A synethanediol is formed There is no stereocenter in this particular reaction The OH groups are on the same side Mesohexanediol is formed There are stereocenters in this reaction A racemic mixture of hexanediol is formed There are stereocenters in both products A cyclic osmic ester is formed The DielsAlder cycloaddition reaction is needed in the first box to form the cyclohexene The second box needs a reagent to reduce the intermediate cyclic ester not shown The third box has the product cyclohexanediol References Dehestani Ahmad et al Ligandassisted reduction of osmium tetroxide with molecular hydrogen via a mechanism Journal of the American Chemical
