that exhibit delocalization determine the relative stability of resonance structures using a set of rules use the concept of resonance to explain structural features of molecules and ions key words resonance structure resonance hybrid Curved Arrows Communicate Electron Flow movement Organic chemistry has developed a system to show how electrons move between resonance structures This system will also be used to help describe how electrons from in reactions Curved double barbed arrows indicates the flow of two electrons The base of the curved arrow is placed at the source of the electrons that are moving The head of the arrow is placed at the destination of the electrons It is also important to consciously use the correct type of arrow There are four primary types of arrows used by chemists to communicate one of the following completion reaction equilibrium reaction electron movement and resonance forms The three other types of arrows are shown below to build discernment between them Note the electron movement arrows are the only ones that are curved Using Curved Arrows to Show Electron Movement Because the double barbed arrow represents the movement of two electrons they usually involve lone pair electrons or pi bonds There are only three types of electron motion in resonance They are A lone pair forms a pi bond to an adjacent atom A pi bond forms a new pi bond to an adjacent atom A pi bond forms a lone pair on adjacent atom Lets look at the resonance within acrylic acid to demonstrate these three types of resonance The curved arrow in structure A represents the type resonance motion the pi bond between the carbon and oxygen breaks to form another lone pair on the oxygen The curved arrow in structure B represents type resonance motion the pi bond breaks to form a new pi bond to the carbocation carbon In structure C there are two curved arrows The curved arrow from the oxygen lone pair is type resonance motion the lone pairs forms a new pi bond between the oxygen and carbon The other arrow in structure C moves the pi bond to the end of the chain and represents resonance type By combining these three basic types of electron movement we can describe virtually any type of resonance Example Below are a few more examples of legal resonance expressions Confirm for yourself that the octet rule is not exceeded for any atoms that formal charges are correct and identify which type of electron movement is being represented by each arrow Exercise Draw the resonance contributors that correspond to the curved twoelectron movement arrows in the resonance expressions below Then identify the type of resonance motion in each structure below Answer Exercise In each resonance expression identify the type of resonance motion Then draw curved arrows on the leftside contributor that shows how we get to the rightside contributor Answer Recognizing Common Patterns of Resonance If you examine a large number of resonance examples you will begin to notice that they nearly always match common patterns of which there are only three It is important to be able to identify atoms that participate in resonance In complex resonance cases multiple types of resonance may occur simultaneously Type I The electrons of a pi bond move to become a set of lone pair electrons on a electronegative atom The resonance structure made has a carbon with a violated octet which make it a minor contributor This type of resonance is commonly used to the polarity in certain double bonds Type I Example Type II Type II resonance is only seen with a charge and usually involves a positive charge on oxygen or nitrogen being shared onto a carbon the carbocation form has only six valence electrons on the carbon so it is a less stable form than the major form which has complete octets Type II Example Type III Type III resonance is very common and important because is serves to stabilize positive charges negative charges or lone pairs It is sometimes referred to as allylic resonance especially in cases with all carbon This type of resonance can be identified by a threeatom group of atoms each with sp hybridization and a p orbital Type III Example Atoms with lone pair electrons next to a pi bond can be sp hybridized and have the lone pair of electrons in a p orbital despite the fact that they are surrounded by four electron groups The lone pair electrons contained in the p orbital cause the ion to be stabilized due to resonance Similarly carbocations are sphybridized with an empty p orbital oriented perpendicular to the plane formed by three sigma bonds If a carbocation is adjacent to a double bond then three p orbitals can overlap and share the two pi electrons another kind of conjugated pi system in which the positive charge is shared over two carbons Exercise Each of the illegal resonance expressions below contains one or more mistakes Explain what is incorrect in each Answer The first pair are not resonance structures since there is an additional hydrogen on the second structure oxygen The second pair pushed electrons toward nitrogen which already has a lone pair and would exceed its octet The third pair includes a structure with bonds to carbon The fourth pair requires moving carbonhydrogen bonds therefore is not resonance The fifth pair show electrons moving toward the negatively charged oxygen which would exceed an octet The fifth pair shows a sigma bond breaking on the ring rather than pi bond Exercise a Draw three additional resonance contributors for the carbocation below Include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how one contributor is converted to the next b Fill in the blanks the conjugated pi system in this carbocation is composed of ______ p orbitals sharing ________ delocalized pi electrons Answer a b The conjugated pi system in this carbocation is composed of seven p orbitals containing six delocalized pi electrons Example Draw the major resonance contributor of the structure below Include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how you got from the given structure to your structure Explain why your contributor is the major one In what kind of orbitals are the two lone pairs on the oxygen Solution In the structure above the carbon with the positive formal charge does not have a complete octet of valence electrons Using the curved arrow convention a lone pair on the oxygen can be moved to the adjacent bond to the left and the electrons in the double bond shifted over to the left see the rules for drawing resonance contributors to convince yourself that these are legal moves The resulting resonance contributor in which the oxygen bears the formal charge is the major one because all atoms have a complete octet and there is one additional bond drawn resonance rules and both apply This system can be thought of as four parallel p orbitals one each on C C and C plus one on oxygen sharing four pi electrons One lone pair on the oxygen is in an unhybridized p orbital and is part of the conjugated pi system and the other is located in an sp orbital Also note that one additional contributor can be drawn but it is also minor because it has a carbon with an incomplete octet Exercise The figure below shows how the negative formal charge on an oxygen of an enol can be delocalized to the carbon indicated by an arrow More resonance contributors can be drawn in which negative charge is delocalized to three other atoms on the molecule a Circle these atoms that can also have a resonance structure with a negative charge b Draw the two most important resonance contributors for the enolate ion Answer The two major contributors are those in which the negative formal charge is located on an oxygen rather than on a carbon Exercise a Draw three additional resonance contributors for the carbocation below Include in your figure the appropriate curved arrows showing how one contributor is converted to the next b Fill in the blanks the conjugated pi system in this carbocation is composed of ______ p orbitals sharing ________ delocalized pi electrons Exercise Draw the major resonance contributor for each of the anions below c Fill in the blanks the conjugated pi system in part a is composed of ______ p orbitals containing ________ delocalized pi electrons Exercise The figure below shows how the negative formal charge on the oxygen can be delocalized to the carbon indicated by an arrow More resonance contributors can be drawn in which negative charge is delocalized to three other atoms on the molecule a Circle these atoms b Draw the two most important resonance contributors for the molecule A word of advice Becoming adept at drawing resonance contributors using the curved arrow notation to show how one contributor can be converted to another and understanding the concepts of conjugation and resonance delocalization are some of the most challenging but also most important jobs that you will have as a beginning student of organic chemistry If you work hard now to gain a firm grasp of these ideas you will have come a long way toward understanding much of what follows in your organic chemistry course Conversely if you fail to come to grips with these concepts now a lot of what you see later in the course will seem like a bunch of mysterious and incomprehensible lines dots and arrows and it will be difficult to be successful in organic chemistry References Petrucci Ralph H et al General Chemistry Principles and Modern Applications New Jersey Pearson Prentice Hall Print Ahmad WanYaacob
