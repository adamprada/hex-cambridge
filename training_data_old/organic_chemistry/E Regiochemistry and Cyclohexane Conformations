Zaitsevs rule to predict major and minor products of elimination reactions including halocyclohexanes Cyclohexane Conformation Anticoplanar Orientation The concerted mechanism of the E reaction requires that the base and leaving group are orientated anticoplanar to each other When the betahydrogen and leaving group halide for this chapter are located on a membered ring then Zaitsevs Rule may not be followed The betahydrogen and leaving group must both be in the axial position for the E reaction to occur Consequently E reactions of certain cycloalkyl halides show unusual rates and regioselectivity that are not explained by the principles thus far discussed For example transmethylchlorocyclohexane reacts with alcoholic KOH at a much slower rate than does its cisisomer Furthermore the product from elimination of the transisomer is methylcyclohexene not predicted by the Zaitsev rule whereas the cisisomer gives the predicted methylcyclohexene as the chief product These differences are described by the first two equations in the following diagram Unlike open chain structures cyclic compounds generally restrict the spatial orientation of ring substituents to relatively few arrangements Consequently reactions conducted on such substrates often provide us with information about the preferred orientation of reactant species in the transition state Stereoisomers are particularly suitable in this respect so the results shown here contain important information about the E transition state The most sensible interpretation of the elimination reactions of and substituted halocyclohexanes is that this reaction prefers an anti orientation of the halogen and the betahydrogen which is attacked by the base These anti orientations are colored in red in the above equations The compounds used here all have sixmembered rings so the anti orientation of groups requires that they assume a diaxial conformation The observed differences in rate are the result of a steric preference for equatorial orientation of large substituents which reduces the effective concentration of conformers having an axial halogen In the case of the bromotertbutylcyclohexane isomers the tertbutyl group is so large that it will always assume an equatorial orientation leaving the bromine to be axial in the cisisomer and equatorial in the trans Because of symmetry the two axial betahydrogens in the cisisomer react equally with base resulting in rapid elimination to the same alkene actually a racemic mixture This reflects the fixed anti orientation of these hydrogens to the chlorine atom To assume a conformation having an axial bromine the transisomer must tolerate serious crowding distortions Such conformers are therefore present in extremely low concentration and the rate of elimination is very slow Indeed substitution by hydroxide anion predominates A similar analysis of the chloromethylcyclohexane isomers explains both the rate and regioselectivity differences Both the chlorine and methyl groups may assume an equatorial orientation in a chair conformation of the transisomer as shown in the top equation The axial chlorine needed for the E elimination is present only in the less stable alternative chair conformer but this structure has only one axial betahydrogen colored red and the resulting elimination gives methylcyclohexene In the cisisomer the smaller chlorine atom assumes an axial position in the more stable chair conformation and here there are two axial beta hydrogens The more stable methylcyclohexene is therefore the predominant product and the overall rate of elimination is relatively fast An orbital drawing of the antitransition state is shown on the right Note that the base attacks the alkyl halide from the side opposite the halogen just as in the SN mechanism In this drawing the α and β carbon atoms are undergoing a rehybridization from sp to sp and the developing πbond is drawn as dashed light blue lines The symbol R represents an alkyl group or hydrogen Since both the base and the alkyl halide are present in this transition state the reaction is bimolecular and should exhibit second order kinetics We should note in passing that a syntransition state would also provide good orbital overlap for elimination and in some cases where an antiorientation is prohibited by structural constraints synelimination has been observed Alkyl Halide Chains Instead in an E reaction stereochemistry of the double bond that is whether the E or Z isomer results is dictated by the stereochemistry of the starting material if it is diastereomeric In other words if the carbon with the hydrogen and the carbon with the halogen are both chiral then one diastereomer will lead to one product and the other diastereomer will lead to the other product The following reactions of potassium ethoxide with dibromostilbene dibromodiphenylethane both occurred via an E mechanism Two different diastereomers were used Two different stereoisomers E vs Z resulted Exercise Which of the following compounds will react faster in an E reaction transbromoisopropylcyclohexane or cisbromoisopropylcyclohexane Answer The cis isomer will react faster than the trans The cis isomer has two possible perpendicular hydrogen in which it can eliminate from Contributors and
