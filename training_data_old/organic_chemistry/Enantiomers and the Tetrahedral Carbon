Enantiomers and the Tetrahedral Carbon Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionSpatial ArrangementStereoisomersEnantiomersChiralityContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to use molecular models to show that only a tetrahedral carbon atom satisfactorily accounts for the lack of isomerism in molecules of the type CHXY and for the existence of optical isomerism in molecules of the type CHXYZ determine whether two differently oriented wedgeandbrokenline structures are identical or represent a pair of enantiomers Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below enantiomer Study Notes Stereoisomers are isomers that differ in spatial arrangement of atoms rather than order of atomic connectivity One of the most interesting types of isomer is the mirrorimage stereoisomer a nonsuperimposable set of two molecules that are mirror images of one another The existence of these molecules are determined by a a concept known as chirality The word chiral was derived from the Greek word for hand because our hands are a good example of chirality since they are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other Introduction The opposite of chiral is achiral Achiral objects are superimposable with their mirror images If the molecules are superimposable they are identical to each other For example two pieces of paper are achiral In contrast chiral objects like our hands are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other Try to line up your left hand perfectly with your right hand so that the palms are both facing in the same directions Spend about a minute doing this Do you see that they cannot line up exactly The same thing applies to some molecules A chiral molecule has a mirror image that cannot line up with it perfectly the mirror images are nonsuperimposable This pair of nonsuperimposable mirror image molecules are called enantiomers But why are chiral molecules so interesting Just like your left hand will not fit properly in your right glove one of the enantiomers of a molecule may not work the same way in your body as the other It turns out that many of the biological molecules such as our DNA amino acids and sugars are chiral molecules This must mean that enantiomers have properties that make them different from their mirror image molecule One of these properties is that chiral molecules do not have a plane of symmetry or an internal mirror plane So a chiral molecule cannot be divided into two identical halves Another property of chiral molecules is optical activity Organic compounds molecules created around a chain of carbon atoms more commonly known as the the carbon backbone play an essential role in the chemistry of life These molecules derive their importance from the energy they carry mainly in a form of potential energy Since potential energy can be widely affected due to changes in atomic placement it is important to understand the concept of an isomer a molecule sharing the same atomic connectivity as another but differing in structural arrangements This section is devoted to a specific type of isomer called stereoisomers and their property of chirality Figure Figure Two enantiomers of a tetrahedral complex from Wikipedia The concepts of steroisomerism and chirality command a great deal of importance in modern organic chemistry as these ideas help to explain the physical and theoretical reasons behind the formation and structures of numerous organic molecules the main reason behind the energy embedded in these essential chemicals In contrast to more wellknown constitutional isomerism which develops isotopic compounds simply by different atomic connectivity stereoisomerism generally maintains equal atomic connections and orders of building blocks as well as having same numbers of atoms and types of elements What then makes stereoisomers so unique To answer this question the learner must be able to think and imagine in not just twodimensional images but also threedimensional space This is due to the fact that stereoisomers are isomers because their atoms are different from others in terms of spatial arrangement Spatial Arrangement First and foremost one must understand the concept of spatial arrangement in order to understand stereoisomerism and chirality Spatial arrangement of atoms concern how different atomic particles and molecules are situated about in the space around the organic compound namely its carbon chain In this sense spatial arrangement of an organic molecule are different another if an atom is shifted in any threedimensional direction by even one degree This opens up a very broad possibility of different molecules each with their unique placement of atoms in threedimensional space Stereoisomers Stereoisomers are as mentioned above molecules that contain different types of isomers within itself each with distinct characteristics that further separate each other as different chemical entities having different properties Type called entaniomer are the previouslymentioned mirrorimage stereoisomers and will be explained in detail in this article Another type diastereomer has different properties and will be introduced afterwards Enantiomers This type of stereoisomer is the essential mirrorimage nonsuperimposable type of stereoisomer introduced in the beginning of the article Figure provides a perfect example note that the gray plane in the middle denotes the mirror plane between the two molecules Figure Note that even if one were to flip the left molecule over to the right the atomic spatial arrangement will not be equal This is equivalent to the left hand right hand relationship and is aptly referred to as handedness in molecules This can be somewhat counterintuitive so this article recommends the reader try the hand example Placeyour hands next to each other with the palms Now flip either side over to the other One hand should be showing the back of the hand while the other one is showing the palm They are not same and nonsuperimposable This is where the concept of chirality comes in as one of the most essential and defining idea of stereoisomerism Chirality Chirality essentially means mirrorimage nonsuperimposable molecules and to say that a molecule is chiral is to say that its mirror image it must have one is not the same as it self Whether a molecule is chiral or achiral depends upon a certain set of overlapping conditions Figure shows an example of two molecules chiral and achiral respectively Notice the distinct characteristic of the achiral molecule it possesses two atoms of same element In theory and reality if one were to create a plane that runs through the other two atoms they will be able to create what is known as bisecting plane The images on either side of the plan is the same as the other Figure Figure In this case the molecule is considered achiral In other words to distinguish chiral molecule from an achiral molecule one must search for the existence of the bisecting plane in a molecule All chiral molecules are deprive of bisecting plane whether simple or complex As a universal rule no molecule with different surrounding atoms are achiral Chirality is a simple but essential idea to support the concept of stereoisomerism being used to explain one type of its kind The chemical properties of the chiral molecule differs from its mirror image and in this lies the significance of chilarity in relation to modern organic chemistry It is pretty interesting that our hands seem to serve the same purpose but most people are only able to use one of their hands to write Similarly this is true with chiral biological molecules and interactions Contributors and Attributions Dr
