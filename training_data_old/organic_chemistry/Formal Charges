After completing this section you should be able to calculate the formal charge of an atom in an organic molecule or ion identify and recognize the bonding patterns for atoms of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and the halogens that have a formal charge of zero Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below valence electrons bonding and nonbonding electrons formal charge carbocations Study Notes It is more important that students learn to easily identify atoms that have formal charges of zero than it is to actually calculate the formal charge of every atom in an organic compound Students will benefit by memorizing the normal number of bonds and nonbonding electrons around atoms whose formal charge is equal to zero Determining the Formal Charge on an Atom A formal charge compares the number of electrons around a neutral atom an atom not in a molecule versus the number of electrons around an atom in a molecule Formal charge is assigned to an atom in a molecule by assuming that electrons in all chemical bonds are shared equally between atoms regardless of relative electronegativity To calculate formal charges we assign electrons in the molecule to individual atoms according to these rules Nonbonding electrons are assigned to the atom on which they are located Bonding electrons are divided equally between the two bonded atoms so one electron from each bond goes to each atom The formal charge of each atom in a molecule can be calculated using the following equation Formal Charge of valence electrons in free atom of lonepair electrons of bond pair electrons Eqn To illustrate this method lets calculate the formal charge on the atoms in ammonia NH whose Lewis structure is as follows A neutral nitrogen atom has five valence electrons it is in group From the Lewis structure the nitrogen atom in ammonia has one lone pair and three bonds with hydrogen atoms Substituting into Equation we obtain Formal Charge of N valence e lone pair e x bond pair e A neutral hydrogen atom has one valence electron Each hydrogen atom in the molecule has no nonbonding electrons and one bond Using Equation to calculate the formal charge on hydrogen we obtain Formal Charge of H valence e lone pair e x bond pair e The sum of the formal charges of each atom must be equal to the overall charge of the molecule or ion In this example the nitrogen and each hydrogen has a formal charge of zero When summed the overall charge is zero which is consistent with the overall neutral charge of the NH molecule Typically the structure with the most formal charges of zero on atoms is the more stable Lewis structure In cases where there MUST be positive or negative formal charges on various atoms the most stable structures generally have negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms and positive formal charges on the less electronegative atoms The next example further demonstrates how to calculate formal charges for polyatomic ions Example Calculate the formal charges on each atom in the NH ion Given chemical species Asked for formal charges Strategy Identify the number of valence electrons in each atom in the NH ion Use the Lewis electron structure of NH to identify the number of bonding and nonbonding electrons associated with each atom and then use Equation to calculate the formal charge on each atom Solution The Lewis electron structure for the NH ion is as follows The nitrogen atom in ammonium has zero nonbonding electrons and bonds Using Equation the formal charge on the nitrogen atom is therefore Formal Charge of N valence e lone pair e x bond pair e formalchargeN Each hydrogen atom in has one bond and zero nonbonding electrons The formal charge on each hydrogen atom is therefore Formal Charge of H valence e lone pair e x bond pair e formalchargeH The formal charges on the atoms in the NH ion are thus Adding together the formal charges on the atoms should give us the total charge on the molecule or ion In this case the sum of the formal charges is which is the same a s the overall charge of the ammonium polyatomic ion Exercise Write the formal charges on all atoms in BH Answer Determining the Charge of Atoms in Organic Structures The calculation method reviewed above for determining formal charges on atoms is an essential starting point for a novice organic chemist and works well when dealing with small structures But this method becomes unreasonably timeconsuming when dealing with larger structures It would be exceptionally tedious to determine the formal charges on each atom in deoxycytidine one of the four nucleoside building blocks that make up DNA using equation As you get more experience with organic structures you will be able to quickly look at this type of complicated structure and determine charges on each atom You need to develop the ability to quickly and efficiently draw large structures and determine formal charges Fortunately this only requires some practice with recognizing common bonding patterns Organic chemistry only deals with a small part of the periodic table so much so that it becomes convenient to be able to recognize the bonding forms of these atoms The figure below contains the most important bonding forms These will be discussed in detail below An important idea to note is most atoms in a molecule are neutral Pay close attention to the neutral forms of the elements below because that is how they will appear most of the time Figure Structures of common organic atoms and ions Carbon Carbon the most important element for organic chemists In the structures of methane methanol ethane ethene and ethyne there are four bonds to the carbon atom And each carbon atom has a formal charge of zero In other words carbon is tetravalent meaning that it commonly forms four bonds Carbon is tetravalent in most organic molecules but there are exceptions Later in this chapter and throughout this book are examples of organic ions called carbocations and carbanions in which a carbon atom has a positive or negative formal charge respectively Carbocations occur when a carbon has only three bonds and no lone pairs of electrons Carbocations have only valence electrons and a formal charge of Carbanions occur when the carbon atom has three bonds plus one lone pair of electrons Carbanions have valence electrons and a formal charge of Two other possibilities are carbon radicals and carbenes both of which have a formal charge of zero A carbon radical has three bonds and a single unpaired electron Carbon radicals have valence electrons and a formal charge of zero Carbenes are a highly reactive species in which a carbon atom has two bonds and one lone pair of electrons giving it a formal charge of zero Though carbenes are rare you will encounter them in section Addition of Carbenes to Alkenes You should certainly use the methods you have learned to check that these formal charges are correct for the examples given above More importantly you will need before you progress much further in your study of organic chemistry to simply recognize these patterns and the patterns described below for other atoms and be able to identify carbons that bear positive and negative formal charges by a quick inspection Hydrogen The common bonding pattern for hydrogen is easy hydrogen atoms in organic molecules typically have only one bond no unpaired electrons and a formal charge of zero The exceptions to this rule are the proton H the hydride ion H and the hydrogen radical H The proton is a hydrogen with no bonds and no lone pairs and a formal charge of The hydride ion is a is a hydrogen with no bonds a pair of electrons and a formal charge of The hydrogen radical is a hydrogen atom with no bonds a single unpaired electron and a formal charge of Because this book concentrates on organic chemistry as applied to living things however we will not be seeing naked protons and hydrides as such because they are too reactive to be present in that form in aqueous solution Nonetheless the idea of a proton will be very important when we discuss acidbase chemistry and the idea of a hydride ion will become very important much later in the book when we discuss organic oxidation and reduction reactions As a rule though all hydrogen atoms in organic molecules have one bond and no formal charge Oxygen The common arrangement of oxygen that has a formal charge of zero is when the oxygen atom has bonds and lone pairs Other arrangements are oxygen with bond and lone pairs that has a formal charge and oxygen with bonds and lone pair that has a formal charge of All three patterns of oxygen fulfill the octet rule If it has two bonds and two lone pairs as in water it will have a formal charge of zero If it has one bond and three lone pairs as in hydroxide ion it will have a formal charge of If it has three bonds and one lone pair as in hydronium ion it will have a formal charge of Oxygen can also exist as a radical such as where an oxygen atom has one bond two lone pairs and one unpaired free radical electron giving it a formal charge of zero For now however concentrate on the three main nonradical examples as these will account for most oxygen containing molecules you will encounter in organic chemistry Nitrogen Nitrogen has two major bonding patterns both of which fulfill the octet rule If a nitrogen has three bonds and a lone pair it has a formal charge of zero If it has four bonds and no lone pair it has a formal charge of In a fairly uncommon bonding pattern negatively charged nitrogen has two bonds and two lone pairs Phosphorus and Sulfur Two third row elements are commonly found in biological organic molecules phosphorus and sulfur Although both of these elements have other bonding patterns that are relevant in laboratory chemistry in a biological context sulfur almost always follows the same bondingformal charge pattern as oxygen while phosphorus is present in the form of phosphate ion PO where it has five bonds almost always to oxygen no lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Remember that elements in the third row of the periodic table have d orbitals in their valence shell as well as s and p orbitals and thus are not bound by the octet rule Halogens The halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are very important in laboratory and medicinal organic chemistry but less common in naturally occurring organic molecules Halogens in organic compounds usually are seen with one bond three lone pairs and a formal charge of zero Sometimes especially in the case of bromine we will encounter reactive species in which the halogen has two bonds usually in a threemembered ring two lone pairs and a formal charge of These rules if learned and internalized so that you dont even need to think about them will allow you to draw large organic structures complete with formal charges quite quickly Once you have gotten the hang of drawing Lewis structures it is not always necessary to draw lone pairs on heteroatoms as you can assume that the proper number of electrons are present around each atom to match the indicated formal charge or lack thereof Occasionally though lone pairs are drawn if doing so helps to make an explanation more clear Exercise Please identify an atom with a nonneutral charge in the following atom Answer Drawing the Lewis Structure of Ionic Molecular Compounds The hydroxide ion OH is drawn simply by showing the oxygen atom with its six valence electrons then adding one more electron to account for the negative charge By changing the number of valence electrons the bonding characteristic of oxygen are now changed Now the oxygen has three nonbonding lone pairs and can only form one bond to a hydrogen To draw a Lewis structure of the hydronium ion HO you again start with the oxygen atom with its six valence electrons then take one away to account for the positive charge to give oxygen five valence electrons The oxygen has one nonbonding lone pair and three unpaired electrons which can be used to form bonds to three hydrogen atoms Using Formal Charges to Distinguish between Lewis Structures As an example of how formal charges can be used to determine the most stable Lewis structure for a substance we can compare two possible structures for CO Both structures conform to the rules for Lewis electron structures CO C is less electronegative than O so it is the central atom C has valence electrons and each O has valence electrons for a total of valence electrons Placing one electron pair between the C and each O gives OCO with electrons left over Dividing the remaining electrons between the O atoms gives three lone pairs on each atom This structure has an octet of electrons around each O atom but only electrons around the C atom No electrons are left for the central atom To give the carbon atom an octet of electrons we can convert two of the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms to bonding electron pairs There are however two ways to do this We can either take one electron pair from each oxygen to form a symmetrical structure or take both electron pairs from a single oxygen atom to give an asymmetrical structure Both Lewis electron structures give all three atoms an octet How do we decide between these two possibilities The formal charges for the two Lewis electron structures of CO are as follows Both Lewis structures have a net formal charge of zero but the structure on the right has a charge on the more electronegative atom O Thus the symmetrical Lewis structure on the left is predicted to be more stable and it is in fact the structure observed experimentally Remember though that formal charges do not represent the actual charges on atoms in a molecule or ion They are used simply as a bookkeeping method for predicting the most stable Lewis structure for a compound Note The Lewis structure with the set of formal charges closest to zero is usually the most stable Example The thiocyanate ion SCN which is used in printing and as a corrosion inhibitor against acidic gases has at least two possible Lewis electron structures Draw two possible structures assign formal charges on all atoms in both and decide which is the preferred arrangement of electrons Given chemical species Asked for Lewis electron structures formal charges and preferred arrangement Strategy A Use the stepbystep procedure to write two plausible Lewis electron structures for SCN B Calculate the formal charge on each atom using Equation C Predict which structure is preferred based on the formal charge on each atom and its electronegativity relative to the other atoms present Solution A Possible Lewis structures for the SCN ion are as follows B We must calculate the formal charges on each atom to identify the more stable structure If we begin with carbon we notice that the carbon atom in each of these structures shares four bonding pairs the number of bonds typical for carbon so it has a formal charge of zero Continuing with sulfur we observe that in a the sulfur atom shares one bonding pair and has three lone pairs and has a total of six valence electrons The formal charge on the sulfur atom is therefore In b the sulfur atom has a formal charge of In c the sulfur atom has a formal charge of Continuing with the nitrogen we observe that in a the nitrogen atom shares three bonding pairs and has one lone pair and has a total of valence electrons The formal charge on the nitrogen atom is therefore In b the nitrogen atom has a formal charge of In c the nitrogen atom has a formal charge of C Which structure is preferred Structure b is preferred because the negative charge is on the more electronegative atom N and it has lower formal charges on each atom as compared to structure c versus Exercise Salts containing the fulminate ion CNO are used in explosive detonators Draw three Lewis electron structures for CNO and use formal charges to predict which is more stable Note N is the central atom Answer The second structure is predicted to be the most stable Exercises Draw the Lewis structure of each of the molecules listed below CH NH CH NH BF In each case use the method of calculating formal charge described to satisfy yourself that the structures you have drawn do in fact carry the charges shown Answer
