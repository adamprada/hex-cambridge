stepsSummaryReferencesProblemsExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to write the equation for the reaction of chlorine or bromine with a given alkene identify the conditions under which an addition reaction occurs between an alkene and chlorine or bromine draw the structure of the product formed when a given alkene undergoes an addition reaction with chlorine or bromine write the mechanism for the addition reaction that occurs between an alkene and chlorine or bromine and account for the stereochemistry of the product Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below anti stereochemistry bromonium ion Study Notes In the laboratory you will test a number of compounds for the presence of a carboncarbon double bond A common test is the decolourization of a reddishbrown bromine solution by an alkene The twostep mechanism shown in the LibreText pages gives you an idea of how the reaction between an alkene and a halogen occurs Note the formation of the bridged bromonium ion intermediate and the anti stereochemistry of the final product because the two bromine atoms come from opposite faces of the double bond Additional evidence in support of the bromonium ion mechanism comes from the results obtained when an alkene such as cyclopentene reacts with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride see Figure Reaction of an alkene with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride below Figure Reaction of an alkene with bromine in the presence of sodium chloride Once formed the bromonium ion is susceptible to attack by two nucleophileschloride ion and bromide ionand in fact a mixture of two products both produced by anti attack is formed Halogens can act as electrophiles to which can be attacked by a pi bond from an alkene Pi bonds represents a region of electron density and therefore function as a nucleophiles How is it possible for a halogen to obtain positive charge to be an electrophile Introduction A halogen molecule for example Br approaches a double bond of the alkene electrons in the double bond repel electrons in the bromine molecule causing polarization of the halogenhalogen bond This creates a dipole moment in the halogenhalogen bond Heterolytic bond cleavage occurs and one of the halogens obtains a positive charge and reacts as an electrophile The reaction of the addition is not regioselective but is stereoselective Stereochemistry of this addition can be explained by the mechanism of the reaction In the first step the electrophilic halogen with the positive charge approaches the pi bond and p orbitals of the halogen bond with two carbon atoms creating a cyclic ion with a halogen as the intermediate In the second step the remaining halide ion halogen with the negative charge attacks either of the two carbons in the cyclic ion from the back side of the cycle as in the SN reaction Therefore stereochemistry of the product is anti addition of vicinal dihalides Step In the first step of the addition the BrBr bond polarizes heterolytic cleavage occurs and Br with the positive charge forms a cyclic intermediate with the two carbons from the alkene Step In the second step bromide anion attacks either carbon of the bridged bromonium ion from the back side of the ring The ring opens up and two halogens are have anti stereochemistry Halogens that are commonly used in this type of the reaction are and In thermodynamical terms is too slow for this reaction because of the size of its atom and is too vigorous and explosive Because the halide ionh can attack any carbon from the opposite side of the ring it creates a mixture of steric products Optically inactive starting material produce optically inactive achiral products meso or a racemic mixture Electrophilic addition mechanism consists of two steps Before constructing the mechanism let us summarize conditions for this reaction We will use Br in our example for halogenation of ethylene Nucleophile Double bond in alkene Electrophile Br Cl Regiochemistry not relevant Stereochemistry ANTI Summary Hallogens can act as electrophiles due to polarizability of their covalent bondAddition of halogens is stereospecific and produces vicinial dihalides with anti additionCis starting material will give mixture of enantiomers and trans produces
