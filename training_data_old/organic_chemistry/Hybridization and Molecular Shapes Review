the H molecule The simplest case to consider is the hydrogen molecule H When we say that the two electrons from each of the hydrogen atoms are shared to form a covalent bond between the two atoms what we mean in valence bond theory terms is that the two spherical s orbitals overlap allowing the two electrons to form a pair within the two overlapping orbitals These two electrons are now attracted to the positive charge of both of the hydrogen nuclei with the result that they serve as a sort of chemical glue holding the two nuclei together Bonding in Methane Now lets turn to methane the simplest organic molecule Recall the valence electron configuration of the central carbon This picture however is problematic How does the carbon form four bonds if it has only two halffilled p orbitals available for bonding A hint comes from the experimental observation that the four CH bonds in methane are arranged with tetrahedral geometry about the central carbon and that each bond has the same length and strength In order to explain this observation valence bond theory relies on a concept called orbital hybridization In this picture the four valence orbitals of the carbon one s and three p orbitals combine mathematically remember orbitals are described by equations to form four equivalent hybrid orbitals which are named sp orbitals because they are formed from mixing one s and three p orbitals In the new electron configuration each of the four valence electrons on the carbon occupies a single sp orbital The sp hybrid orbitals like the p orbitals of which they are partially composed are oblong in shape and have two lobes of opposite sign Unlike the p orbitals however the two lobes are of very different size The larger lobes of the sp hybrids are directed towards the four corners of a tetrahedron meaning that the angle between any two orbitals is o This geometric arrangement makes perfect sense if you consider that it is precisely this angle that allows the four orbitals and the electrons in them to be as far apart from each other as possibleThis is simply a restatement of the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion VSEPR theory that you learned in General Chemistry electron pairs in orbitals will arrange themselves in such a way as to remain as far apart as possible due to negativenegative electrostatic repulsion Each CH bond in methane then can be described as an overlap between a halffilled s orbital in a hydrogen atom and the larger lobe of one of the four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals in the central carbon The length of the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane is Å x m While previously we drew a Lewis structure of methane in two dimensions using lines to denote each covalent bond we can now draw a more accurate structure in three dimensions showing the tetrahedral bonding geometry To do this on a twodimensional page though we need to introduce a new drawing convention the solid dashed wedge system In this convention a solid wedge simply represents a bond that is meant to be pictured emerging from the plane of the page A dashed wedge represents a bond that is meant to be pictured pointing into or behind the plane of the page Normal lines imply bonds that lie in the plane of the page This system takes a little bit of getting used to but with practice your eye will learn to immediately see the third dimension being depicted Example Imagine that you could distinguish between the four hydrogens in a methane molecule and labeled them Ha through Hd In the images below the exact same methane molecule is rotated and flipped in various positions Draw the missing hydrogen atom labels It will be much easier to do this if you make a model Exercise Describe with a picture and with words the bonding in chloroform CHCl Solutions The bonding arrangement here is also tetrahedral the three NH bonds of ammonia can be pictured as forming the base of a trigonal pyramid with the fourth orbital containing the lone pair forming the top of the pyramid Recall from your study of VSEPR theory in General Chemistry that the lone pair with its slightly greater repulsive effect pushes the three NH sbonds away from the top of the pyramid meaning that the HNH bond angles are slightly less than tetrahedral at rather than VSEPR theory also predicts accurately that a water molecule is bent at an angle of approximately It would seem logical then to describe the bonding in water as occurring through the overlap of sphybrid orbitals on oxygen with sorbitals on the two hydrogen atoms In this model the two nonbonding lone pairs on oxygen would be located in sp orbitals Some experimental evidence however suggests that the bonding orbitals on the oxygen are actually unhybridized p orbitals rather than sp hybrids Although this would seem to imply that the HOH bond angle should be remember that p orbitals are oriented perpendicular to one another it appears that electrostatic repulsion has the effect of distorting this porbital angle to Both the hybrid orbital and the nonhybrid orbital models present reasonable explanations for the observed bonding arrangement in water so we will not concern ourselves any further with the distinction Exercise Draw in the same style as the figures above an orbital picture for the bonding in methylamine Solution Formation of bonds and hybridization The valence bond theory along with the hybrid orbital concept does a very good job of describing doublebonded compounds such as ethene Three experimentally observable characteristics of the ethene molecule need to be accounted for by a bonding model Ethene is a planar flat molecule Bond angles in ethene are approximately o and the carboncarbon bond length is Å significantly shorter than the Å single carboncarbon bond in ethane There is a significant barrier to rotation about the carboncarbon double bond Clearly these characteristics are not consistent with an sp hybrid bonding picture for the two carbon atoms Instead the bonding in ethene is described by a model involving the participation of a different kind of hybrid orbital Three atomic orbitals on each carbon the s px and py orbitals combine to form three sp hybrids leaving the pz orbital unhybridized The three sp hybrids are arranged with trigonal planar geometry pointing to the three corners of an equilateral triangle with angles of between them The unhybridized pz orbital is perpendicular to this plane in the next several figures sp orbitals and the sigma bonds to which they contribute are represented by lines and wedges only the pz orbitals are shown in the spacefilling mode The carboncarbon double bond in ethene consists of one sbond formed by the overlap of two sp orbitals and a second bond calleda π pi bond which is formed by the sidebyside overlap of the two unhybridized pz orbitals from each carbon spacefilling image of bonding in ethene The pi bond does not have symmetrical symmetry Because they are the result of sidebyside overlap rather then endtoend overlap like a sigma bond pi bonds are not free to rotate If rotation about this bond were to occur it would involve disrupting the sidebyside overlap between the two pz orbitals that make up the pi bond The presence of the pi bond thus locks the six atoms of ethene into the same plane This argument extends to larger alkene groups in each case the six atoms of the group form a single plane Conversely sbonds such as the carboncarbon single bond in ethane CHCH exhibit free rotation and can assume many different conformations or shapes this is one of the main subjects of Chapter Exercise Circle the six atoms in the molecule below that are locked into the same plane Exercise What kinds of orbitals are overlapping in bonds ad indicated below Exercise What is wrong with the way the following structure is drawn Solutions A similar picture can be drawn for the bonding in carbonyl groups such as formaldehyde In this molecule the carbon is sphybridized and we will assume that the oxygen atom is also sp hybridized The carbon has three sigma bonds two are formed by overlap between two of its sp orbitals with the sorbital from each of the hydrogens and the third sigma bond is formed by overlap between the remaining carbon sp orbital and an sp orbital on the oxygen The two lone pairs on oxygen occupy its other two sp orbitals The pi bond is formed by sidebyside overlap of the unhybridized pz orbitals on the carbon and the oxygen Just like in alkenes the pz orbitals that form the pi bond are perpendicular to the plane formed by the sigma bonds
