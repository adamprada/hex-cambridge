P and S to explain the structures of simple species containing these atoms Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below lone pair electrons Study Notes Nitrogen is frequently found in organic compounds As with carbon atoms nitrogen atoms can be sp sp or sphybridized Note that in this course the term lone pair is used to describe an unshared pair of electrons The valencebond concept of orbital hybridization can be extrapolated to other atoms including nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur In other compounds covalent bonds that are formed can be described using hybrid orbitals Nitrogen Bonding in NH The nitrogen in NH has five valence electrons After hybridization these five electrons are placed in the four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals The electron configuration of nitrogen now has one sp hybrid orbital completely filled with two electrons and three sp hybrid orbitals with one unpaired electron each The two electrons in the filled sp hybrid orbital are considered nonbonding because they are already paired These electrons will be represented as a lone pair on the structure of NH The three unpaired electrons in the hybrid orbitals are considered bonding and will overlap with the s orbitals in hydrogen to form NH sigma bonds Note This bonding configuration was predicted by the Lewis structure of NH The four sp hybrid orbitals of nitrogen orientate themselves to form a tetrahedral geometry The three NH sigma bonds of NH are formed by spNsH orbital overlap The fourth sp hybrid orbital contains the two electrons of the lone pair and is not directly involved in bonding Methyl amine The nitrogen is sp hybridized which means that it has four sp hybrid orbitals Two of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with s orbitals from hydrogens to form the two NH sigma bonds One of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with an sp hybridized orbital from carbon to form the CN sigma bond The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen are contained in the last sp hybridized orbital Due to the sp hybridization the nitrogen has a tetrahedral geometry However the HNH and HNC bonds angles are less than the typical o due to compression by the lone pair electrons Oxygen Bonding in HO The oxygen in HO has six valence electrons After hybridization these six electrons are placed in the four equivalent sp hybrid orbitals The electron configuration of oxygen now has two sp hybrid orbitals completely filled with two electrons and two sp hybrid orbitals with one unpaired electron each The filled sp hybrid orbitals are considered nonbonding because they are already paired These electrons will be represented as a two sets of lone pair on the structure of HO The two unpaired electrons in the hybrid orbitals are considered bonding and will overlap with the s orbitals in hydrogen to form OH sigma bonds Note This bonding configuration was predicted by the Lewis structure of HO The four sp hybrid orbitals of oxygen orientate themselves to form a tetrahedral geometry The two OH sigma bonds of HO are formed by spOsH orbital overlap The two remaining sp hybrid orbitals each contain two electrons in the form of a lone pair Methanol The oxygen is sp hybridized which means that it has four sp hybrid orbitals One of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with s orbitals from a hydrogen to form the OH sigma bonds One of the sp hybridized orbitals overlap with an sp hybridized orbital from carbon to form the CO sigma bond Both the sets of lone pair electrons on the oxygen are contained in the remaining sp hybridized orbital Due to the sp hybridization the oxygen has a tetrahedral geometry However the HOC bond angles are less than the typical o due to compression by the lone pair electrons Phosphorus Methyl phosphate The bond pattern of phosphorus is analogous to nitrogen because they are both in period However phosphorus can have have expanded octets because it is in the n row Typically phosphorus forms five covalent bonds In biological molecules phosphorus is usually found in organophosphates Organophosphates are made up of a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygens with one of the oxygens also bonded to a carbon In methyl phosphate the phosphorus is sp hybridized and the OPO bond angle varies from to o Methyl Phosphate An Organophosphate Sulfur Methanethiol Dimethyl Sulfide Sulfur has a bonding pattern similar to oxygen because they are both in period of the periodic table Because sulfur is positioned in the third row of the periodic table it has the ability to form an expanded octet and the ability to form more than the typical number of covalent bonds In biological system sulfur is typically found in molecules called thiols or sulfides In a thiol the sulfur atom is bonded to one hydrogen and one carbon and is analogous to an alcohol OH bond In a sulfide the sulfur is bonded to two carbons The simplest example of a thiol is methane thiol CHSH and the simplest example of a sulfide is dimethyl sulfide CHS In both cases the sulfur is sp hybridized however the sulfur bond angles are much less than the typical tetrahedral o being o and o respectively
