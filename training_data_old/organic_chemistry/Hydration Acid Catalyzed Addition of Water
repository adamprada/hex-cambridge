hydroborationoxidation What Is Electrophilic Hydration Electrophilic hydration is the addition of hydrogen and a hydroxyl group across the two carbons of a double bond Electrophilic hydration is the reverse of dehydration of alcohols and so begins the circular nature of organic chemistry Alcohols can be dehydrated to form alkenes and alkenes can undergo electrophilic addition reactions to form alcohols Electrophilic hydrogen is essentially a proton a hydrogen atom stripped of its electrons Electrophilic hydrogen is commonly used to help break double bonds or restore catalysts Electrophilic hydration of alkenes has practical applications in making alcohols for fuels and reagents for other reactions The basic reaction under certain temperatures given below is the following In later sections we will learn that mercury II sulfate and borane are also electrophiles that can react with alkenes to form hydration products Each reaction pathway has its own regio and stereochemical considerations In the example below we see that the same alkene produces different hydration products depending on the hydration pathway Mechanism for Acidcatalyzed Hydration of Alkenes Temperatures for Types of Alcohol Synthesis Heat is used to catalyze electrophilic hydration because the reaction is in equilibrium with the dehydration of an alcohol which requires higher temperatures to form an alkene lower temperatures are required to form an alcohol The exact temperatures used are highly variable and depend on the product being formed Primary Alcohol Less than ºC Secondary Alcohol Less than ºC Tertiary Alcohol Less than ºC ButWhy Does Electrophilic Hydration Work An alkene placed in an aqueous nonnucleophilic strong acid immediately reaches out with its double bond and attacks one of the acids hydrogen atoms meanwhile the bond between oxygen and hydrogen performs heterolytic cleavage toward the oxygenin other words both electrons from the oxygenhydrogen single bond move onto the oxygen atom A carbocation is formed on the original alkene now alkane in the moresubstituted position where the oxygen end of water attacks with its nonbonded valence electrons oxygen has total valence electrons because it is found in Group on the periodic table and the second row down two electrons in a sorbital and four in porbitals Oxygen donates one valence electron to each bond it forms leaving four nonbonded valence electrons After the blue oxygen atom forms its third bond with the moresubstituted carbon it develops a positive charge bonds and valence electrons give the blue oxygen atom a formal charge of The bond between the green hydrogen and the blue oxygen undergoes heterolytic cleavage and both the electrons from the bond move onto the blue oxygen The now negativelycharged strong acid picks up the green electrophilic hydrogen Now that the reaction is complete the nonnucleophilic strong acid is regenerated as a catalyst and an alcohol forms on the most substituted carbon of the current alkane At lower temperatures more alcohol product can be formed What is Regiochemistry and How Does It Apply Regiochemistry deals with where the substituent bonds on the product Zaitsevs and Markovnikovs rules address regiochemistry but Zaitsevs rule applies when synthesizing an alkene while Markovnikovs rule describes where the substituent bonds onto the product In the case of electrophilic hydration Markovnikovs rule is the only rule that directly applies See the following for an indepth explanation of regiochemistry Markovnikov explanation Radical AdditionsAntiMarkovnikov Product Formation In the mechanism for a º alcohol shown above the red H is added to the leastsubstituted carbon connected to the nucleophilic double bonds it has less carbons attached to it This means that the carbocation forms on the º carbon causing it to be highly stabilized by hyperconjugationelectrons in nearby sigma single bonds help fill the empty porbital of the carbocation which lessens the positive charge More substitution on a carbon means more sigma bonds are available to help out by using overlap with the positive charge which creates greater carbocation stability In other words carbocations form on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond Carbocations are also stabilized by resonance but resonance is not a large factor in this case because any carboncarbon double bonds are used to initiate the reaction and other double bonded molecules can cause a completely different reaction If the carbocation does originally form on the less substituted part of the alkene carbocation rearrangements occur to form more substituted products Carbocation Rearrangements a review Hydride shifts a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom next to the carbocation leaves that carbon to bond with the carbocation after the hydrogen has taken both electrons from the single bond it is known as a hydride This changes the once neighboring carbon to a carbocation and the former carbocation becomes a neighboring carbon atom In a more complex case when alkenes undergo hydration we also observe hydride shift Below is the reaction of methylbutene with HO that furnishes to make methylbutanol Once again we see multiple products In this case however we see two minor products and one major product We observe the major product because the OH substitutent is attached to the more substituted carbon When the reactant undergoes hydration the proton attaches to carbon The carbocation is therefore on carbon Hydride shift now occurs when the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon formally switch places with the carbocation The carbocation is now ready to be attacked by HO to furnish an alkyloxonium ion because of stability and hyperconjugation The final step can be observed by another water molecule attacking the proton on the alkyloxonium ion to furnish an alcohol We see this mechanism below Alkyl shifts if no hydrogen atoms are available for a hydride shift an entire methyl group performs the same shift The nucleophile attacks the positive charge formed on the most substituted carbon connected to the double bond because the nucleophile is seeking that positive charge In the mechanism for a º alcohol shown above water is the nucleophile When the green H is removed from the water molecule the alcohol attached to the most substituted carbon Hence electrophilic hydration follows Markovnikovs rule Stereochemistry of Acidcatalyzed Hydration Stereochemistry deals with how the substituent bonds on the product directionally Dashes and wedges denote stereochemistry by showing whether the molecule or atom is going into or out of the plane of the board Whenever the bond is a simple single straight line the molecule that is bonded is equally likely to be found going into the plane of the board as it is out of the plane of the board This indicates that the product is a racemic mixture There is no stereochemical control in acidcatalyzed hydration reactions The carbocation intermediate has the trigonal planar geometry of sp hybridization which allows the subsequent reaction with water from either orientation Electrophilic hydration adopts a stereochemistry wherein the substituent is equally likely to bond pointing into the plane of the board as it is pointing out of the plane of the board The º alcohol product could look like either of the following products Note Whenever a straight line is used along with dashes and wedges on the same molecule it could be denoting that the straight line bond is in the same plane as the board Practice with a molecular model kit and attempting the practice problems at the end can help eliminate any ambiguity Is this a Reversible Synthesis Electrophilic hydration is reversible because an alkene in water is in equilibrium with the alcohol product To sway the equilibrium one way or another the temperature or the concentration of the nonnucleophilic strong acid can be changed For example Less sulfuric or phosphoric acid and an excess of water help synthesize more alcohol product Lower temperatures help synthesize more alcohol product Is There a Better Way to Add Water to Synthesize an Alcohol From an Alkene A more efficient pathway does exist see Oxymercuration Demercuration A Special Electrophilic Addition Oxymercuration does not allow for rearrangements but it does require the use of mercury which is highly toxic Detractions for using electrophilic hydration to make alcohols include Allowing for carbocation rearrangements Poor yields due to the reactants and products being in equilibrium Allowing for product mixtures such as an Renantiomer and an Senantiomer Using sulfuric or phosphoric acid Exercise Draw the bondline structure for the major product of each reaction Answer Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Lance Peery UCD Duyen DaoTran UCD Organic Chemistry With a
