hydroborationoxidation HydroborationOxidation is a two step pathway used to produce alcohols The reaction proceeds in an antiMarkovnikov manner where the hydrogen from or attaches to the more substituted carbon and the boron attaches to the least substituted carbon in the alkene double bond Furthermore the borane acts as the electrophile by accepting two electrons in its empty p orbital from an alkene that is electron rich This process allows boron to have an electron octet A very interesting characteristic of this process is that it does not require any activation by a catalyst The hydroboration mechanism has the elements of both hydrogenation and electrophilic addition and it is a stereospecific syn addition meaning that the hydroboration takes place on the same face of the double bond this leads cis stereochemistry The Borane Complex It is very important to understand the structure and properties of the borane molecule Borane exists naturally as a very toxic gas and it exists as dimer of the general formula diborane Since diborane dimer ignites spontaneously in air it commercially distributed in ether or tetrahydrofuran THF solutions In these solutions the borane can exist as a Lewis acidbase complex which allows boron to have an octet of electrons The Mechanism Step Hydroboration of the alkene The addition of the borane to the alkene is initiated and proceeds as a concerted reaction because bond breaking and bond formation occur at the same time The vacant p orbital of the boron takes the role of electrophile and accepts the pi electrons from the nucleophilic alkene The boron adds to the less substituted carbon of the alkene which then places the hydrogen on the more substituted carbon Both the boron and the hydrogen add simultaneously on the same face of the double bond syn addition With a concerted mechanism there is no carbocation formation Transition state Note that a carbocation is not formed Therefore no rearrangement takes place It is important to note that reaction continues two more times until all three hydrogens on the borane have reacted with alkenes to create the trialkylborane intermediate RB Step Oxidation of the Trialkylborane by Hydrogen Peroxide The hydrogen peroxide is the nucleophile in this reaction because it is the electron donor to the newly formed trialkylborane that resulted from the previous hydroboration In this second part of the mechanism a rearrangement of an R group with its pair of bonding electrons to an adjacent oxygen results in the loss of a hydroxide ion Two more of these reactions with hydroperoxide will occur in order give a trialkylborate In the final step of the oxidation process the trialkylborate reacts with aqueous to give the alcohol and sodium borate ceNaBO If you need additional visuals to aid you in understanding the mechanism click on the outside links provided at the end of this section Stereochemistry of the Hydroboration Step The hydroboration reaction is among the few simple addition reactions that proceed cleanly in a syn fashion As noted above this is a singlestep reaction Since the bonding of the double bond carbons to boron and hydrogen is concerted it follows that the geometry of this addition must be syn Furthermore rearrangements are unlikely inasmuch as a discrete carbocation intermediate is never formed These features are illustrated for the hydroboration of αpinene Since the hydroboration procedure is most commonly used to hydrate alkenes in an antiMarkovnikov fashion we also need to know the stereoselectivity of the second oxidation reaction which substitutes a hydroxyl group for the boron atom Independent study has shown this reaction takes place with retention of configuration so the overall addition of water is also syn The hydroboration of αpinene also provides a nice example of steric hindrance control in a chemical reaction In the less complex alkenes used in earlier examples the plane of the double bond was often a plane of symmetry and addition reagents could approach with equal ease from either side In this case one of the methyl groups bonded to C colored blue in the equation covers one face of the double bond blocking any approach from that side All reagents that add to this double bond must therefore approach from the side opposite this methyl Exercises Draw the bondline
