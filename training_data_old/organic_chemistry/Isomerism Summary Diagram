Isomerism Summary Diagram Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Conformational IsomersStructural Constitutional IsomersStereoisomersContributors and Attributions Learning Objective distinguish and discern the structural and chemical relationships between isomeric compounds The various types of isomers have been introduced and explored over several chapters It can be helpful to review compare and contrast all of the forms of isomerism to build our skills of discernment A brief review of each type of isomerism follows the summary diagram See the respective chapter for a complete explanation Conformational Isomers The rotation of CC single bonds both carbon chains creates conformers the same compound shown in different rotations Consequently many different arrangements of the atoms are possible each corresponding to different degrees of rotation Differences in threedimensional structure resulting from rotation about a Ïƒ bond are called differences in conformation and each different arrangement is called a conformational isomer or conformer While complete rotation of CC single bonds is not possible in rings The freedom of bond movement does allow the rings to assume different conformations such as the chair and boat for membered rings Structural Constitutional Isomers Unlike conformational isomers structural isomers differ in connectivity as illustrated below for propanol and propanol Although these two alcohols have the same molecular formula CHO the position of the OH group differs creating a unique compounds with differences in their physical and chemical properties Consider for example the following five structures represented by the formula CH In the conversion of one structural isomer to another at least one bond must be broken and reformed at a different position in the molecule Structures a and d above represent the same compound npentane Structures b and c represent the same compound methylbutane No bonds need to be broken and reformed to convert between a and d or between b and c The molecules are simply rotated about a vertical axis Structure e is named dimethylpropane There are only three structural isomers possible with the chemical formula CH npentane methylbutane and dimethylpropane Structural isomers have distinct physical and chemical properties Stereoisomers Enantiomers are pairs of compounds that are nonsuperimposable images When there are two or more chiral centers in a compounds the diatereomers can exist Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are NOT enantiomers Enatiomers share all physical properties except for their interaction with plane polarized light Diastereomers have different physical properties melting points and boiling points and densities Exercise What kind of isomers are the following pairs Note It can be difficult to answer this question directly from the names It can be helpful to draw the structures Rchlorohexene and chlorohexene RRdibromohexane and RSdibromohexane Answer a Structural Isomers b Diastereomers Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry
