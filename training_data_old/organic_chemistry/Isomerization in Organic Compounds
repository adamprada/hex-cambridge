Isomerization in Organic Compounds Last updated Save as PDF Page ID A Position IsomersContributors and Attributions More than one stable substance can correspond to a given molecular formula Examples are butane and methylpropane isobutane each of which has the molecular formula Similarly methoxymethane dimethyl ether and ethanol have the same formula Compounds having the same number and kinds of atoms are called isomers Whereas only one stable substance is known corresponding to the formula thirtyfive stable isomers have been prepared of the formula From this one may begin to sense the rich variety of organic chemistry which leads to many problems in telling one compound from another in determining structures and also in finding suitable names for compounds In the rest of this chapter we will describe one type of isomer the position isomer and in later chapters we will discuss another type of isomer the stereoisomer and the experimental approaches that are used to establish the purity identity structure and stereochemistry of organic compounds A Position Isomers Compounds having the same number and kind of atoms but having different bonding arrangements between the atoms are called position isomers Butane and methylpropane are examples of position isomers The atoms are connected differently in the two structures because the carbon chain in butane is a straight or continuous chain whereas in methylpropane it is branched Therefore these two molecules are structurally different and accordingly do not have the same chemical and physical properties They cannot be converted one into the other without breaking and remaking and bonds Methoxymethane and ethanol are also position isomers because the oxygen clearly is connected differently in the two molecules The term position isomer means the same as constitutional isomer The designation structural isomer also is used but this term is taken by some to include both position isomers and stereoisomers that is structure can mean both the way in which atoms are connected and their different arrangements in space The number of position isomers possible for a given formula rapidly increases with the increasing number of carbon atoms as can be seen from the number of theoretically possible structures of formula up to given in Table In it was reported that all of the compounds with values of to had been prepared in the laboratory Before we can begin to discuss the chemistry of these compounds it is necessary to know how to name them without convenient and systematic rules for nomenclature that are adopted universally catastrophic confusion would result We shall tackle this problem in the next chapter The prefix iso is from the Greek word meaning the same or alike Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
