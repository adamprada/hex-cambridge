chemistry in sections is integrated into the above Learning Objective for organic chemistry in sections and Lewis Structures Lewis structures also known as Lewisdot diagrams show the bonding relationship between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons in the molecule While it can be helpful initially to write the individual shared electrons this approach quickly becomes awkward A single line is used to represent one pair of shared electrons Line representations are only used for shared electrons Lone pair unshared electrons are still shown as individual electrons Double and triple bonds can also be communicated with lines as shown below shared electrons form a single bond shown as or shared electrons form a double bond shown as or shared electrons form at triple bond shown as or Unshared electrons are also called Lone Pairs and are shown as Seeing the Lone Pairs Since the lone pair electrons are often NOT shown in chemical structures it is important to see mentally add the lone pairs In the beginning it can be helpful to physically add the lone pair electrons Bonding Patterns For organic chemistry the common bonding patterns of carbon oxygen and nitrogen have useful applications when evaluating chemical structures and reactivity Formal charges Organic molecules can also have positive or negative charges associated with them During chemical reactions it is common to have charge reactant intermediates andor products Recognizing and distinguishing between neutral and charged bonding patterns will be helpful in learning reaction mechanisms Consider the Lewis structure of methanol CHOH methanol is the socalled wood alcohol that unscrupulous bootleggers sometimes sold during the prohibition days in the s often causing the people who drank it to go blind Methanol itself is a neutral molecule but can lose a proton to become a molecular anion CHO or gain a proton to become a molecular cation CHOH The molecular anion and cation have overall charges of and respectively But we can be more specific than that we can also state for each molecular ion that a formal charge is located specifically on the oxygen atom rather than on the carbon or any of the hydrogen atoms Figuring out the formal charge on different atoms of a molecule is a straightforward process its simply a matter of adding up valence electrons A unbound oxygen atom has valence electrons When it is bound as part of a methanol molecule however an oxygen atom is surrounded by valence electrons nonbonding electrons two lone pairs and electrons in each of its two covalent bonds one to carbon one to hydrogen In the formal charge convention we say that the oxygen owns all nonbonding electrons However it only owns one electron from each of the two covalent bonds because covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms Therefore the oxygen atom in methanol owns ½ x valence electrons The formal charge on an atom is calculated as the number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom minus the number of valence electrons owned by the bound atom in the molecule Determining formal charge on an atom formal charge number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom number of valence electrons owned by the bound atom or formal charge number of valence electrons owned by the isolated atom number of nonbonding electrons on the bound atom ½ the number of bonding electrons on the bound atom Using this formula for the oxygen atom of methanol we have formal charge on oxygen valence electrons on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons Thus oxygen in methanol has a formal charge of zero in other words it has no formal charge How about the carbon atom in methanol An isolated carbon owns valence electrons The bound carbon in methanol owns ½ x valence electrons formal charge on carbon valence electron on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons So the formal charge on carbon is zero For each of the hydrogens in methanol we also get a formal charge of zero formal charge on hydrogen valence electron on isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons Now lets look at the cationic form of methanol CHOH The bonding picture has not changed for carbon or for any of the hydrogen atoms so we will focus on the oxygen atom The oxygen owns nonbonding electrons and bonding elections so the formal charge calculations becomes formal charge on oxygen valence electrons in isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons A formal charge of is located on the oxygen atom For methoxide the anionic form of methanol the calculation for the oxygen atom is formal charge on oxygen valence electrons in isolated atom nonbonding electrons ½ x bonding electrons A formal charge of is located on the oxygen atom A very important rule to keep in mind is that the sum of the formal charges on all atoms of a molecule must equal the net charge on the whole molecule When drawing the structures of organic molecules it is very important to show all nonzero formal charges being clear about where the charges are located A structure that is missing nonzero formal charges is not correctly drawn and will probably be marked as such on an exam At this point thinking back to what you learned in general chemistry you are probably asking What about dipoles Doesnt an oxygen atom in an OH bond own more of the electron density than the hydrogen because of its greater electronegativity This is absolutely correct and we will be reviewing the concept of bond dipoles later on For the purpose of calculating formal charges however bond dipoles dont matter we always consider the two electrons in a bond to be shared equally even if that is not an accurate reflection of chemical reality Formal charges are just that a formality a method of electron bookkeeping that is tied into the Lewis system for drawing the structures of organic compounds and ions Later we will see how the concept of formal charge can help us to visualize how organic molecules react Finally dont be lured into thinking that just because the net charge on a structure is zero there are no atoms with formal charges one atom could have a positive formal charge and another a negative formal charge and the net charge would still be zero Zwitterions such as amino acids have both positive and negative formal charges on different atoms Even though the net charge on glycine is zero it is still neccessary to show the location of the positive and negative formal charges Exercise Fill in all missing lone pair electrons and formal charges in the structures below Assume that all atoms have a complete valence shell of electrons Net charges are shown outside the brackets Solutions to
