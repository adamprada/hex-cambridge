Lone Pair Electrons and Bonding Theories Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Orbitals of Lone Pair Electrons Learning Objective identify the orbitals occupied by lone pair electrons Valence Bond and Molecular Orbital Theories The table below summarizes the main points of the two complementary bonding theories Both theories provide different useful ways of describing molecular structure We will use both theories and often blend them to analyze and predict chemical structure and reactivity The bonding theories are reviewed in greater detail in the next two sections Comparison of Bonding Theories Valence Bond Theory Molecular Orbital Theory considers bonds as localized between one pair of atoms considers electrons delocalized throughout the entire molecule creates bonds from overlap of atomic orbitals s p d and hybrid orbitals sp sp sp combines atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals σ σ π π forms σ or π bonds creates bonding and antibonding interactions based on which orbitals are filled predicts molecular shape based on the number of regions of electron density predicts the arrangement of electrons in molecules needs multiple structures to describe resonance Orbitals of Lone Pair Electrons There are situations in which we will want to integrate molecular orbital and valence bond theories Identifying the orbitals of lone pair electrons is one situation Hybridized orbitals create sigma bonds and hold lone pairs The sigma bonds create the framework that holds all the atoms together as a molecule or ion Unhybridized p orbitals create pi bonds perpendicular to this sigma framework In the future we will learn that some lone pair electrons on heteroatoms of rings can occupy p orbitals to create aromaticity Stay tuned for upcoming attractions For the first ten chapters of this text we will only focus on nonaromatic compounds To identify the orbitals of the lone pair electrons in nonaromatic compounds we can follow a twostep approach Step Add any missing lone pair electrons to the heteroatoms atoms other than carbon and hydrogen Step Determine the hybridization of any atoms with lone pairs heteroatoms Lone pairs occupy the hybridized orbitals Example To identify the orbitals of the lone pair electrons in the compound below we will follow the approach above Step Add lone pairs Step Determine the hybridization of any atom with lone pairs The lone pairs on each heteroatom occupy the indicated hybridized orbital NOTE These guidelines only apply for nonaromatic compounds There can be exceptions to these guidelines for some heterocyclic aromatic compounds These exceptions are fully explained in a later chapter of this text Exercise For the compound below a add the lone pair electrons b label the hybridization and electron geometry for all nonhydrogen atoms c specify the hybridization of the orbital for each lone pair d What is the chemical formula of this compound Answer
