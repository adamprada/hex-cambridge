Mechanisms of Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID A Kinetics of Substitution MechanismsB SolvolysisContributors and Attributions Two simple mechanisms can be written for the reaction of chloromethane with hydroxide ion in aqueous solution that differ in the timing of bond breaking relative to bond making In the first mechanism the overall reaction is the result of two steps the first of which involves a slow dissociation of chloromethane to solvated methyl carbocation and solvated chloride ion The second step involves a fast reaction between the carbocation and hydroxide ion or water to yield methanol Mechanism or In the second mechanism the reaction proceeds in a single step Attack of hydroxide ion at carbon occurs simultaneously with the loss of chloride ion that is the carbonoxygen bond is formed as the carbonchlorine bond is broken Mechanism Both of these mechanisms are important in the displacement reactions of alkyl compounds although chloromethane appears to react only by Mechanism Now we will discuss the criteria for distinguishing between the concerted and stepwise mechanisms A Kinetics of Substitution Mechanisms Of the two mechanisms requires that the reaction rate be determined solely by the rate of the first step cf earlier discussion in Section C This means that the rate at which methanol is formed measured in moles per unit volume per unit time will depend on the chloromethane concentration but not on the hydroxide ion concentration because hydroxide ion is not utilized except in a fast secondary reaction In contrast Mechanism requires the rate to depend on the concentrations of both reagents because the slow step involves collisions between hydroxide ions and chloromethane molecules More precisely the reaction rate may be expressed in terms of Equation for Mechanism and Equation for Mechanism Customarily is expressed in moles of product formed per liter of solution per unit of time most frequently in seconds The concentration terms and are then in units of moles per liter and the proportionality constant called the specific rate constant has the units of for Mechanism and for Mechanism It is important to recognize the difference between the order of a reaction with respect to a specific reactant and the overall order of a reaction The order of a reaction with respect to a particular reactant is the power to which the concentration of that reactant must be raised to have direct proportionality between concentration and reaction rate According to Equation the rate of the chloromethanehydroxide ion reaction is first order with respect to chloromethane and first order with respect to hydroxide ion In Equation the rate is first order with respect to chloromethane and zero order with respect to hydroxide ion because The overall order of reaction is the sum of the orders of the respective reactants Thus Equations and express the rates of overall firstorder and secondorder reactions respectively We can use the overall reaction order to distinguish between the two possible mechanisms and Experimentally the rate of formation of methanol is found to be proportional to the concentrations both of chloromethane and of hydroxide ion Therefore the reaction rate is second order overall and is expressed correctly by Equation This means that the mechanism of the reaction is the singlestep process Such reactions generally are classified as bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions often designated for substitution for nucleophilic and for bimolecular because there are two reactant molecules in the transition state To summarize For an reaction rate mechanism The stepwise Mechanism is a unimolecular nucleophilic substitution and accordingly is designated The numeral or used in these designations does not refer to the kinetic order of the reaction but refers to the number of molecules not including solvent molecules that make up the transition state Thus for rate mechanism or B Solvolysis Many reactions are carried out using the solvent as the nucleophilic agent They are called solvolysis reactions and involve solvents such as water ethanol ethanoic acid and methanoic acid Two examples are In these examples solvolysis is necessarily a firstorder reaction because normally the solvent is in such great excess that its concentration does not change appreciably during reaction and hence its contribution to the rate does not change However that the overall rate is first order does not mean the reaction necessarily proceeds by an mechanism particularly in solvents such as water alcohols or amines which are reasonably good nucleophilic agents The solvent can act as the displacing agent in an reaction To distinguish between and mechanisms of solvolysis requires other criteria notably stereochemistry Sections and and the effect of added nucleophiles on the rate and nature of the reaction products For example it often is possible to distinguish between and solvolysis by adding to the reaction mixture a relatively small concentration of a substance that is expected to be a more powerful nucleophile than the solvent If the reaction is strictly the rate at which disappears should remain essentially unchanged because it reacts only as fast as forms and the rate of this step is not changed by addition of the nucleophile even if the nucleophile reacts with However if the reaction is the rate of disappearance of should increase because reacts with the nucleophile in an reaction and now the rate depends on both the nature and the concentration of the nucleophile Many organic chemists and indeed the previous versions of this book use the term carbonium ion for species of this kind However there is wellestablished usage of the onium suffix for ammonium oxonium chloronium and so on to denote positively charged atoms with filled valence shells In the interest of greater uniformity of nomenclature we shall use carbocation for carbon positive ions that have unfilled valence shells electrons Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of
