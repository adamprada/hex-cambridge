Learning objective Determine the empirical and molecular formulas from combustion data Molecular formulas tell you how many atoms of each element are in a compound and empirical formulas tell you the simplest or most reduced ratio of elements in a compound If a compounds molecular formula cannot be reduced any more then the empirical formula is the same as the molecular formula Combustion analysis can determine the empirical formula of a compound but cannot determine the molecular formula other techniques can though Once known the molecular formula can be calculated from the empirical formula Empirical Formulas An empirical formula tells us the relative ratios of different atoms in a compound The ratios hold true on the molar level as well Thus HO is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and atom of oxygen Likewise mole of HO is composed of moles of hydrogen and mole of oxygen We can also work backwards from molar ratios since if we know the molar amounts of each element in a compound we can determine the empirical formula Example Mercury Chloride Mercury forms a compound with chlorine that is mercury and chlorine by mass What is the empirical formula Lets say we had a gram sample of this compound The sample would therefore contain grams of mercury and grams of chlorine How many moles of each atom do the individual masses represent For Mercury For Chlorine What is the molar ratio between the two elements Thus we have twice as many moles ie atoms of Cl as Hg The empirical formula would thus be remember to list cation first anion last Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula The chemical formula for a compound obtained by composition analysis is always the empirical formula We can obtain the chemical formula from the empirical formula if we know the molecular weight of the compound The chemical formula will always be some integer multiple of the empirical formula ie integer multiples of the subscripts of the empirical formula The general flow for this approach is shown in Figure and demonstrated in Example Figure The general flow chart for solving empirical formulas from known mass percentages Example Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C ascorbic acid contains C H and O by mass The experimentally determined molecular mass is amu What is the empirical and chemical formula for ascorbic acid Solution Consider an arbitrary amount of grams of ascorbic acid so we would have grams C grams H grams O This would give us how many moles of each element Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen Determine the simplest whole number ratio by dividing by the smallest molar amount moles in this case see oxygen Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen The relative molar amounts of carbon and oxygen appear to be equal but the relative molar amount of hydrogen is higher Since we cannot have fractional atoms in a compound we need to normalize the relative amount of hydrogen to be equal to an integer would appear to be and so if we multiply the relative amounts of each atom by we should be able to get integer values for each atom C H O or CHO This is our empirical formula for ascorbic acid What about the chemical formula We are told that the experimentally determined molecular mass is amu What is the molecular mass of our empirical formula amu The molecular mass from our empirical formula is significantly lower than the experimentally determined value What is the ratio between the two values amu amu Thus it would appear that our empirical formula is essentially one half the mass of the actual molecular mass If we multiplied our empirical formula by then the molecular mass would be correct Thus the actual molecular formula is CHO CHO Combustion Analysis When a compound containing carbon and hydrogen is subject to combustion with oxygen in a special combustion apparatus all the carbon is converted to CO and the hydrogen to HO Figure The amount of carbon produced can be determined by measuring the amount of CO produced This is trapped by the sodium hydroxide and thus we can monitor the mass of CO produced by determining the increase in mass of the CO trap Likewise we can determine the amount of H produced by the amount of HO trapped by the magnesium perchlorate Figure Combustion analysis apparatus One of the most common ways to determine the elemental composition of an unknown hydrocarbon is an analytical procedure called combustion analysis A small carefully weighed sample of an unknown compound that may contain carbon hydrogen nitrogen andor sulfur is burned in an oxygen atmosphereOther elements such as metals can be determined by other methods and the quantities of the resulting gaseous products CO HO N and SO respectively are determined by one of several possible methods One procedure used in combustion analysis is outlined schematically in Figure and a typical combustion analysis is illustrated in Examples and Figure Steps for Obtaining an Empirical Formula from Combustion Analysis Example Combustion of Isopropyl Alcohol What is the empirical formulate for isopropyl alcohol which contains only C H and O if the combustion of a grams isopropyl alcohol sample produces grams of CO and grams of HO Solution From this information quantitate the amount of C and H in the sample Since one mole of CO is made up of one mole of C and two moles of O if we have moles of CO in our sample then we know we have moles of C in the sample How many grams of C is this How about the hydrogen Since one mole of HO is made up of one mole of oxygen and two moles of hydrogen if we have moles of HO then we have moles of hydrogen Since hydrogen is about grammole we must have grams of hydrogen in our original sample When we add our carbon and hydrogen together we get grams C grams H grams But we know we combusted grams of isopropyl alcohol The missing mass must be from the oxygen atoms in the isopropyl alcohol grams grams grams oxygen This much oxygen is how many moles Overall therefore we have moles Carbon moles Hydrogen moles Oxygen Divide by the smallest molar amount to normalize C atoms H atoms O atom Within experimental error the most likely empirical formula for propanol would be Example Combustion of Naphalene Naphthalene the active ingredient in one variety of mothballs is an organic compound that contains carbon and hydrogen only Complete combustion of a mg sample of naphthalene in oxygen yielded mg of CO and mg of HO Determine the empirical formula of naphthalene Given mass of sample and mass of combustion products Asked for empirical formula Strategy Use the masses and molar masses of the combustion products CO and HO to calculate the masses of carbon and hydrogen present in the original sample of naphthalene Use those masses and the molar masses of the elements to calculate the empirical formula of naphthalene Solution A Upon combustion mol of is produced for each mole of carbon atoms in the original sample Similarly mol of HO is produced for every mol of hydrogen atoms present in the sample The masses of carbon and hydrogen in the original sample can be calculated from these ratios the masses of CO and HO and their molar masses Because the units of molar mass are grams per mole we must first convert the masses from milligrams to grams B To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of both elements present we need to calculate the number of moles of each and divide by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount Dividing each number by the number of moles of the element present in the smaller amount gives Thus naphthalene contains a ratio of moles of carbon to moles of hydrogen CH Because the ratios of the elements in the empirical formula must be expressed as small whole numbers multiply both subscripts by which gives CH as the empirical formula of naphthalene In fact the molecular formula of naphthalene is CH which is consistent with our results Exercise Xylene an organic compound that is a major component of many gasoline blends contains carbon and hydrogen only Complete combustion of a mg sample of xylene in oxygen yielded mg of CO and mg of HO Determine the empirical formula of xylene The empirical formula of benzene is CH its molecular formula is CH If mg of benzene is subjected
