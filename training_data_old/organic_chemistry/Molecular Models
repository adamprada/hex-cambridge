Molecular Models Last updated Save as PDF Page ID ExercisesAnswersContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to use ballandstick molecular models to make models of simple organic compounds eg ethane ethylene acetylene ethanol formaldehyde acetone acetic acid given their Kekul√© structures or molecular formulas Study Notes You will have noticed that we have given two names for most of the compounds discussed up to this point In general we shall be using systematic ie IUPACInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry names throughout the course However simple compounds are often known by their common names which may be more familiar than their IUPAC counterparts We shall address the subject of nomenclature naming in Chapter ethanol formaldehyde methanal acetone propanone acetic ethanoic acid If your instructor is having you work with molecular models in class they may use this section for you to practice creating specific structures Exercises Construct a molecular model of each of the compounds listed below cesfCHCN cesfCHNCO cesfCHCHOCH Hint Use the curved sticks to form the multiple bonds and the straight sticks for single bonds Answers Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University
