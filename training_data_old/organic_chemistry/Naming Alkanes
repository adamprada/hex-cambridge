Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to provide the correct IUPAC name for any given alkane structure Kekulé condensed or shorthand draw the Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure of an alkane given its IUPAC name Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below IUPAC system Study Notes The IUPAC system of nomenclature aims to ensure that every organic compound has a unique unambiguous name that the IUPAC name of any compound conveys the structure of that compound to a person familiar with the system One way of checking whether the name you have given to an alkane is reasonable is to count the number of carbon atoms implied by the chosen name For example if you named a compound ethylmethylheptane you have indicated that the compound contains a total of carbon atomsseven carbon atoms in the main chain two carbon atoms in an ethyl group and one carbon atom in a methyl group If you were to check the given structure and find carbon atoms you would know that you had made a mistake Perhaps the name you should have written was ethyldimethylheptane When naming alkanes a common error of beginning students is a failure to pick out the longest carbon chain For example the correct name for the compound shown below is methylheptane not ethylhexane Remember that every substituent must have a number and do not forget the prefixes di tri tetra etc You must use commas to separate numbers and hyphens to separate numbers and substituents Notice that methylhexane is one word Hydrocarbons having no double or triple bond functional groups are classified as alkanes or cycloalkanes depending on whether the carbon atoms of the molecule are arranged only in chains or also in rings Although these hydrocarbons have no functional groups they constitute the framework on which functional groups are located in other classes of compounds and provide an ideal starting point for studying and naming organic compounds The alkanes and cycloalkanes are also members of a larger class of compounds referred to as aliphatic Simply put aliphatic compounds are compounds that do not incorporate any aromatic rings in their molecular structure The following table lists the IUPAC names assigned to simple continuouschain alkanes from C to C A common ane suffix identifies these compounds as alkanes Longer chain alkanes are well known and their names may be found in many reference and text books The names methane through decane should be memorized since they constitute the root of many IUPAC names Fortunately common numerical prefixes are used in naming chains of five or more carbon atoms Table Simple Unbranched Alkanes Name Molecular Formula Structural Formula Isomers Name Molecular Formula Structural Formula Isomers methane CH CH hexane CH CHCHCH ethane CH CHCH heptane CH CHCHCH propane CH CHCHCH octane CH CHCHCH butane CH CHCHCHCH nonane CH CHCHCH pentane CH CHCHCH decane CH CHCHCH Some important behavior trends and terminologies The formulas and structures of these alkanes increase uniformly by a CH increment A uniform variation of this kind in a series of compounds is called homologous These formulas all fit the CnHn rule This is also the highest possible HC ratio for a stable hydrocarbon Since the HC ratio in these compounds is at a maximum we call them saturated with hydrogen Beginning with butane CH and becoming more numerous with larger alkanes we note the existence of alkane isomers For example there are five CH isomers shown below as abbreviated line formulas A through E Although these distinct compounds all have the same molecular formula only one A can be called hexane How then are we to name the others The IUPAC system requires first that we have names for simple unbranched chains as noted above and second that we have names for simple alkyl groups that may be attached to the chains Examples of some common alkyl groups are given in the following table Note that the ane suffix is replaced by yl in naming groups The symbol R is used to designate a generic unspecified alkyl group Table Alkyl Groups Names Group CH CH CHCHCH CHCH CHCHCHCH CHCHCH CHCHCHCH CHC R Name Methyl Ethyl Propyl Isopropyl Butyl Isobutyl secButyl tertButyl Alkyl IUPAC Rules for Alkane Nomenclature Find and name the longest continuous carbon chain Identify and name groups attached to this chain Number the chain consecutively starting at the end nearest a substituent group Designate the location of each substituent group by an appropriate number and name Assemble the name listing groups in alphabetical order The prefixes di tri tetra etc used to designate several groups of the same kind are not considered when alphabetizing Example Alkanes The IUPAC names of the isomers of hexane are A hexane B methylpentane C methylpentane D dimethylbutane E dimethylbutane Alkyl Groups Halogen substituents are easily accommodated using the names fluoro F chloro Cl bromo Br and iodo I Example Halogen Substitution For example CHCHCHCHBr would be named bromomethylbutane If the halogen is bonded to a simple alkyl group an alternative alkyl halide name may be used Thus CHCl may be named chloroethane no locator number is needed for a two carbon chain or ethyl chloride Alkyl Groups Alkanes can be described by the general formula CnHn An alkyl group is formed by removing one hydrogen from the alkane chain and is described by the formula CnHn The removal of this hydrogen results in a stem change from ane to yl Take a look at the following examples The same concept can be applied to any of the straight chain alkane names provided in the table above Name Molecular Formula Condensed Structural Formula Methane CH CH Ethane CH CHCH Propane CH CHCHCH Butane CH CHCHCH Pentane CH CHCHCH Hexane CH CHCHCH Heptane CH CHCHCH Octane CH CHCHCH Nonane CH CHCHCH Decane CH CHCHCH Undecane CH CHCHCH Dodecane CH CHCHCH Tridecane CH CHCHCH Tetradecane CH CHCHCH Pentadecane CH

containing a functional group A carbon bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number If there are no functional groups then any substituent present must have the lowest possible number Take the alphabetical order into consideration that is after applying the first two rules given above make sure that your substituents andor functional groups are written in alphabetical order Example What is the name of the follow molecule Solution Rule Choose the longest most substituted carbon chain containing a functional group This example does not contain any functional groups so we only need to be concerned with choosing the longest most substituted carbon chain The longest carbon chain has been highlighted in red and consists of eight carbons Rule Carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number If there are no functional groups then any substitute present must have the lowest possible number Because this example does not contain any functional groups we only need to be concerned with the two substitutes present that is the two methyl groups If we begin numbering the chain from the left the methyls would be assigned the numbers and respectively If we begin numbering the chain from the right the methyls would be assigned the numbers and Therefore to satisfy the second rule numbering begins on the right side of the carbon chain as shown below This gives the methyl groups the lowest possible numbering Rule In this example there is no need to utilize the third rule Because the two substitutes are identical neither takes alphabetical precedence with respect to numbering the carbons This concept will become clearer in the following examples The name of this molecule is dimethyloctane Example What is the name of the follow molecule Solution Rule Choose the longest most substituted carbon chain containing a functional group This example contains two functional groups bromine and chlorine The longest carbon chain has been highlighted in red and consists of seven carbons Rule Carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number If there are no functional groups then any substituent present must have the lowest possible number In this example numbering the chain from either the left or the right would satisfy this rule If we number the chain from the left bromine and chlorine would be assigned the second and sixth carbon positions respectively If we number the chain from the right chlorine would be assigned the second position and bromine would be assigned the sixth position In other words whether we choose to number from the left or right the functional groups occupy the second and sixth positions in the chain To select the correct numbering scheme we need to utilize the third rule Rule After applying the first two rules take the alphabetical order into consideration Alphabetically bromine comes before chlorine Therefore bromine is assigned the second carbon position and chlorine is assigned the sixth carbon position The name of this molecule is bromochloroheptane Example What is the name of the follow molecule Solution Rule Choose the longest most substituted carbon chain containing a functional group This example contains two functional groups bromine and chlorine and one substitute the methyl group The longest carbon chain has been highlighted in red and consists of seven carbons Rule Carbons bonded to a functional group must have the lowest possible carbon number After taking functional groups into consideration any substitutes present must have the lowest possible carbon number This particular example illustrates the point of difference principle If we number the chain from the left bromine the methyl group and chlorine would occupy the second fifth and sixth positions respectively This concept is illustrated in the second drawing below If we number the chain from the right chlorine the methyl group and bromine would occupy the second third and sixth positions respectively which is illustrated in the first drawing below The position of the methyl therefore becomes a point of difference In the first drawing the methyl occupies the third position In the second drawing the methyl occupies the fifth position To satisfy the second rule we want to choose the numbering scheme that provides the lowest possible numbering of this substitute Therefore the first of the two carbon chains shown below is correct Therefore the first numbering scheme is the appropriate one to use Once you have determined the correct numbering of the carbons it is often useful to make a list including the functional groups substitutes and the name of the parent chain Rule After applying the first two rules take the alphabetical order into consideration Alphabetically bromine comes before chlorine Therefore bromine is assigned the second carbon position and chlorine is assigned the sixth carbon position Parent chain heptane Substitutents chloro methyl bromo The name of this molecule is bromochloromethylheptane Exercises Exercises Questions Q Are the following structures properly named and if they are not
