linksReferencesProblemsAnswersContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to provide the correct IUPAC name for an acyclic or cyclic alkene given its Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure draw the Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure of an alkene cyclic or acyclic given its IUPAC name give the IUPAC equivalent of the following trivial names ethylene propylene isobutylene and isoprene draw the structure of a vinyl ethenyl and allyl propenyl group and use these names in alkene nomenclature Study Notes This course uses IUPAC nomenclature therefore you need not usually memorize a large number of trivial names However you will encounter some trivial names so frequently in books and articles that they soon become familiar An alkene that can exhibit geometric isomerism has not been properly named unless its name specifies whether the double bond or bonds is or are cis or trans The most effective way of giving this information is discussed and more details of cis and trans follow in Section Alkenes contain carboncarbon double bonds and are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the molecular formula is CnHn this is also the same molecular formula as cycloalkanes Alkenes are named by dropping the ane ending of the parent and adding ene Introduction The parent structure is the longest chain containing both carbon atoms of the double bond The two carbon atoms of a double bond and the four atoms attached to them lie in a plane with bond angles of approximately A double bond consists of one sigma bond formed by overlap of sp hybrid orbitals and one pi bond formed by overlap of parallel p atomic orbitals The Basic Rules For straight chain alkenes it is the same basic rules as nomenclature of alkanes except change the suffix to ene Find the Longest Carbon Chain that Contains the Carbon Carbon double bond If you have two ties for longest Carbon chain and both chains contain a Carbon Carbon double bond then identify the most substituted chain Give the lowest possible number to the Carbon Carbon double bond Do not need to number cycloalkenes because it is understood that the double bond is in the one position Alkenes that have the same molecular formula but the location of the doble bonds are different means they are constitutional isomers Functional Groups with higher priority Add substituents and their position to the alkene as prefixes Of course remember to give the lowest numbers possible Remember to name them in alphabetical order when writting them Next is identifying stereoisomers when there are only two non hydrogen attachments to the alkene then use cis and trans to name the molecule In this diagram this is a cis conformation It has both the substituents going upward This molecule would be called cis chloroheptene Trans would look like this v On the other hand if there are or nonhydrogen different atoms attached to the alkene then use the E Z system E entgegen means the higher priority groups are opposite one another relative to the double bond Z zusammen means the higher priority groups are on the same side relative to the double bond You could think of Z as Zame Zide to help memorize it In this example it is Echloroheptene It is E because the Chlorine and the CHCH are the two higher priorities and they are on opposite sides vi A hydroxyl group gets precedence over th double bond Therefore alkenes containing alchol groups are called alkenols And the prefix becomes enol And this means that now the alcohol gets lowest priority over the alkene vii Lastly remember that alkene substituents are called alkenyl Suffix enyl Here is a chart containing the systemic name for the first twenty straight chain alkenes Table Systemic Names for the First Twenty Straight Chain Alkenes Name Molecular formula Ethene CH Propene CH Butene CH Pentene CH Hexene CH Heptene CH Octene CH Nonene CH Decene CH Undecene CH Dodecene CH Tridecene CH Tetradecene CH Pentadecene CH Hexadecene CH Heptadecene CH Octadecene CH Nonadecene CH Eicosene CH Did you notice how there is no methene Because it is impossible for a Carbon to have a double bond with nothing Geometric Isomers Double bonds can exist as geometric isomers and these isomers are designated by using either the cis trans designation or the modern E Z designation cis Isomers The two largest groups are on the same side of the double bond trans Isomers The two largest groups are on opposite sides of the double bond EZ nomenclature E entgegan trans Z zusamen cis Priority of groups is based on the atomic mass of attached atoms not the size of the group An atom attached by a multiple bond is counted once for each bond fluorine atom isopropyl group nhexyl group deuterium atom hydrogen atom CHCHCH CHCHCH Example Try to name the following compounds using both conventions Answer Structure trans pentene or E pentene Structure cis and trans convention cannot be used there are more than two non hydrogen attachments to the alkene E isopropylhexene or E methylethylhexene Common Names Remove the ane suffix and add ylene There are a couple of unique ones like ethenyls common name is vinyl and propenyls common name is allyl That you should know are vinyl substituent HCCH allyl substituent HCCHCH allene molecule HCCCH isoprene Endocyclic Alkenes Endocyclic double bonds have both carbons in the ring and exocyclic double bonds have only one carbon as part of the ring Cyclopentene is an example of an endocyclic double bond Methylenecylopentane is an example of an exocyclic double bond Name the following compounds methylcyclobutene The methyl group places the double bond It is correct to also name this compound as methylcyclobutene ethenylcyclohexene the methyl group places the double bond It is correct to also name this compound as ethenylcyclohexene A common name would be vinylcyclohexene Try to draw structures for the following compounds vinylcyclohexadiene Examples Both these compounds have double bonds making them alkenes In example the longest chain consists of six carbons so the root name of this compound will be hexene Three methyl substituents colored red are present Numbering the sixcarbon chain begins at the end nearest the double bond the left end so the methyl groups are located on carbons The IUPAC name is therefore trimethylhexene In example the longest chain incorporating both carbon atoms of the double bond has a length of five There is a sevencarbon chain but it contains only one of the double bond carbon atoms Consequently the root name of this compound will be pentene There is a propyl substituent on the inside double bond carbon atom so the IUPAC name is propylpentene The double bond in example is located in the center of a sixcarbon chain The double bond would therefore have a locator number of regardless of the end chosen to begin numbering The right hand end is selected because it gives the lowest firstsubstituent number for the methyl as compared with for the ethyl if numbering were started from the left The IUPAC name is assigned as shown Example is a diene two double bonds Both double bonds must be contained in the longest chain which is therefore five rather than sixcarbons in length The second and fourth carbons of this pentadiene are both substituted so the numbering begins at the end nearest the alphabetically firstcited substituent the ethyl group These examples include rings of carbon atoms as well as some carboncarbon triple bonds Example is best named as an alkyne bearing a cyclobutyl substituent Example is simply a tenmembered ring containing both a double and a triple bond The double bond is cited first in the IUPAC name so numbering begins with those two carbons in the direction that gives the triple bond carbons the lowest locator numbers Because of the linear geometry of a triple bond aten membered ring is the smallest ring in which this functional group is easily accommodated Example is a cyclooctatriene three double bonds in an eightmembered ring The numbering must begin with one of the end carbons of the conjugated diene moiety adjacent double bonds because in this way the double bond carbon atoms are assigned the smallest possible locator numbers Of the two ways in which this can be done we choose the one that gives the vinyl substituent the lower number Outside links
