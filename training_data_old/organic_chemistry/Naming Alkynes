Naming Alkynes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionNaming AlkynesRule Rule Rule Rule Rule ReferenceExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to provide the correct IUPAC name of an alkyne given its Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure provide the correct IUPAC name of a compound containing both double and triple bonds given its Kekulé condensed or shorthand structure draw the structure of a compound containing one or more triple bonds and possibly one or more double bonds given its IUPAC name name and draw the structure of simple alkynyl groups and where appropriate use these names as part of the IUPAC system of nomenclature Study Notes Simple alkynes are named by the same rules that are used for alkenes see Section except that the ending is yne instead of ene Alkynes cannot exhibit EZ cistrans isomerism hence in this sense their nomenclature is simpler than that of alkenes Alkynes are organic molecules made of the functional group carboncarbon triple bonds and are written in the empirical formula of They are unsaturated hydrocarbons Like alkenes have the suffix ene alkynes use the ending yne this suffix is used when there is only one alkyne in the molecule Introduction Here are the molecular formulas and names of the first ten carbon straight chain alkynes Name Molecular Formula Ethyne CH Propyne CH Butyne CH Pentyne CH Hexyne CH Heptyne CH Octyne CH Nonyne CH Decyne CH The more commonly used name for ethyne is acetylene which used industrially Naming Alkynes Like previously mentioned the IUPAC rules are used for the naming of alkynes Rule Find the longest carbon chain that includes both carbons of the triple bond Rule Number the longest chain starting at the end closest to the triple bond A alkyne is referred to as a terminal alkyne and alkynes at any other position are called internal alkynes For example chlorodiiodomethylnonyne Rule After numbering the longest chain with the lowest number assigned to the alkyne label each of the substituents at its corresponding carbon While writing out the name of the molecule arrange the substituents in alphabetical order If there are more than one of the same substituent use the prefixes di tri and tetra for two three and four substituents respectively These prefixes are not taken into account in the alphabetical order For example triiododimethylnonyne If there is an alcohol present in the molecule number the longest chain starting at the end closest to it and follow the same rules However the suffix would be ynol because the alcohol group takes priority over the triple bond methyloctynol When there are two triple bonds in the molecule find the longest carbon chain including both the triple bonds Number the longest chain starting at the end closest to the triple bond that appears first The suffix that would be used to name this molecule would be diyne For example methyloctadiyne Rule Substituents containing a triple bond are called alkynyl For example chloroethynylbromocyclohexane Here is a table with a few of the alkynyl substituents Name Molecule Ethynyl CCH Propynyl CHCCH Butynyl CHCCHCH Rule A molecule that contains both double and triple bonds is called an alkenyne The chain can be numbered starting with the end closest to the functional group that appears first For example ethylmethylnonenyne NB If both functional groups are the exact same distance from the end the alkene takes precedence Reference Vollhardt Peter and Neil E Schore Organic Chemistry Structure and Function th Edition New York W H Freeman Company Exercises Questions Q Name the following compounds Q How many isomers are possible for CH Draw them Q Draw the following compounds A dimethylpentyne B octyne C methylhexyne D trans heptenyne Q Do alkynes show cistrans isomerism Explain Solutions S A diethyloctyne B methylbutyne C ethylheptyne D cyclodecyne S possible isomers S S No A triply bonded carbon atom can form only one other bond and has linear electron geometry so there are no sides Allkenes have two groups attached to each inyl carbon with a trigonal planar electron geometry that creates the possibility of cistrans isomerism Contributors and Attributions A Sheth and S Sujit UCD Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University
