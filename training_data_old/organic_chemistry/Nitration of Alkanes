Nitration of Alkanes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions Another reaction of commercial importance is the nitration of alkanes to give nitroparaffins Such reactions usually are carried out in the vapor phase at elevated temperatures using nitric acid or nitrogen tetroxide as the nitrating agent All available evidence points to a radical mechanism for nitration but many aspects of the reaction are not fully understood Mixtures are obtained nitration of propane gives not only and nitropropanes but nitroethane and nitromethane In commercial practice the yield and product distribution in nitration of alkanes is controlled as far as possible by the judicious addition of catalysts eg oxygen and halogens which are believed to raise the concentration of alkyl radicals The products are separated from the mixtures by fractional distillation Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
