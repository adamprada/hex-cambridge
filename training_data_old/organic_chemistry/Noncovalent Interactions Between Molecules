forces influence the physical properties dimensional shape and structure of compounds Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below dipoledipole forces London dispersion forces hydrogen bond intermolecular forces noncovalent interaction van der Waals forces Study Notes Much of the material in this section should be familiar to you from your prerequisite general chemistry course Nonetheless this section is important as it covers some of the fundamental factors that influence many physical and chemical properties Introduction The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids In contrast to intramolecular forces such as the covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules and polyatomic ions intermolecular forces hold molecules together in a liquid or solid Intermolecular forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds For example it requires kJ to overcome the intramolecular forces and break both OH bonds in mol of water but it takes only about kJ to overcome the intermolecular attractions and convert mol of liquid water to water vapor at C Despite this seemingly low value the intermolecular forces in liquid water are among the strongest such forces known Given the large difference in the strengths of intra and intermolecular forces changes between the solid liquid and gaseous states almost invariably occur for molecular substances without breaking covalent bonds Note The properties of liquids are intermediate between those of gases and solids but are more similar to solids Intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the boiling points of liquids Liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid Similarly solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature that is they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species Like covalent and ionic bonds intermolecular interactions are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components Because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids where the molecules are close together These interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law In this section we explicitly consider three kinds of intermolecular interactions dipoledipole forces dispersion forces and hydrogen bonds These intermolecular interactions are also called van der Waals forces or noncovalent interactions There are two additional types of electrostatic interaction that you are already familiar with the ionion interactions that are responsible for ionic bonding and the iondipole interactions that occur when ionic substances dissolve in a polar substance such as water These are less common with organic molecules so will not be described further in this section DipoleDipole Interactions Polar covalent bonds behave as if the bonded atoms have localized fractional charges that are equal but opposite ie the two bonded atoms generate a dipole If the structure of a molecule is such that the individual bond dipoles do not cancel one another then the molecule has a net dipole moment Molecules with net dipole moments tend to align themselves so that the positive end of one dipole is near the negative end of another and vice versa as shown in Figure parts a and b Arrangements in which two positive or two negative ends are adjacent parts c and d in Figure are higher energy as the similar charges would repel one another Hence dipoledipole interactions such as those in parts a and b in Figure are attractive intermolecular interactions whereas those in part c and d are repulsive intermolecular interactions Figure Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions a and b Molecular orientations in which the positive end of one dipole δ is near the negative end of another δ and vice versa produce attractive interactions c and d Molecular orientations that juxtapose the positive or negative ends of the dipoles on adjacent molecules produce repulsive interactions Because molecules in a liquid move freely and continuously molecules always experience both attractive and repulsive dipoledipole interactions simultaneously as shown in Figure On average however the attractive interactions dominate Figure Both Attractive and Repulsive DipoleDipole Interactions Occur in a Liquid Sample with Many Molecules Chloromethane is an example of a polar molecule An electrostatic potential map shows a high electron density seen in red around the electronegative chlorine giving it a partial negative charge The other end of the molecule has electron density pulled away from it giving it a partial positive charge seen in blue The positive and negative ends of different chloromethane molecules are attracted to one another through this electrostatic interaction Because each end of a dipole possesses only a fraction of the charge of an electron dipoledipole interactions are substantially weaker than the interactions between two ions each of which has a charge of at least or between a dipole and an ion in which one of the species has at least a full positive or negative charge In addition the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do ionion interactions Recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r where r is the distance between the ions Doubling the distance r r decreases the attractive energy by onehalf In contrast the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to r so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction by or fold Thus a substance such as HCl which is partially held together by dipoledipole interactions is a gas at room temperature and atm pressure whereas NaCl which is held together by ionic interactions is a highmeltingpoint solid Within a series of compounds of similar molar mass the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases as shown in Table Using what we learned about predicting relative bond polarities from the electronegativities of the bonded atoms we can make educated guesses about the relative boiling points of similar molecules Table Relationships between the Dipole Moment and the Boiling Point for Organic Compounds of Similar Molar Mass Compound Molar Mass gmol Dipole Moment D Boiling Point K CH cyclopropane CHOCH dimethyl ether CHCN acetonitrile Note The attractive energy between two ions is proportional to r whereas the attractive energy between two dipoles is proportional to r Example Arrange ethyl methyl ether CHOCHCH methylpropane isobutane CHCHCH and acetone CHCOCH in order of increasing boiling points Their structures are as follows Strategy Compare the molar masses and the polarities of the compounds Compounds with higher molar masses and that are polar will have the highest boiling points Solution The three compounds have essentially the same molar mass gmol so we must look at differences in polarity to predict the strength of the intermolecular dipoledipole interactions and thus the boiling points of the compounds The first compound methylpropane contains only CH bonds which are not very polar because C and H have similar electronegativity values It should therefore have a very small but nonzero dipole moment and a very low boiling point Ethyl methyl ether has a structure similar to HO it contains two polar CO single bonds oriented at about a angle to each other in addition to relatively nonpolar CH bonds As a result the CO bond dipoles partially reinforce one another and generate a significant dipole moment that should give a moderately high boiling point Acetone contains a polar CO double bond oriented at about to two methyl groups with nonpolar CH bonds The CO bond dipole therefore corresponds to the molecular dipole which should result in both a rather large dipole moment and a high boiling point Thus we predict the following order of boiling points methylpropane ethyl methyl ether acetone This result is in good agreement with the actual data methylpropane boiling point C and the dipole moment μ D methyl ethyl ether boiling point C and μ D acetone boiling point C and μ D Exercise Arrange carbon tetrafluoride CF ethyl methyl sulfide CHSCH dimethyl sulfoxide CHSO and methylbutane isopentane CHCHCHCH in order of decreasing boiling points Answer dimethyl sulfoxide boiling point C ethyl methyl sulfide boiling point C methylbutane boiling point C carbon tetrafluoride boiling point C London Dispersion Forces Thus far we have considered only interactions between polar molecules but other factors must be considered to explain why many nonpolar molecules such as bromine benzene and hexane are liquids at room temperature and others such as iodine and naphthalene are solids Even the noble gases can be liquefied or solidified at low temperatures high pressures or both What kind of attractive forces can exist between nonpolar molecules or atoms This question was answered by Fritz London a German physicist who later worked in the United States In London proposed that temporary fluctuations in the electron distributions within atoms and nonpolar molecules could result in the formation of shortlived instantaneous dipole moments which produce attractive forces called London dispersion forces between otherwise nonpolar substances Table Normal Melting and Boiling Points of Some Elements and Nonpolar Compounds Substance Molar Mass gmol Melting Point C Boiling Point C Ar Xe N O F I CH Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms for example On average the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed around the nucleus Because the electrons are in constant motion however their distribution in one atom is likely to be asymmetrical at any given instant resulting in an instantaneous dipole moment As shown in part a in Figure the instantaneous dipole moment on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom pulling them toward the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end The net effect is that the first atom causes the temporary formation of a dipole called an induced dipole in the second Interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another These attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance London was able to show with quantum mechanics that the attractive energy between molecules due to temporary dipoleinduced dipole interactions falls off as r Doubling the distance therefore decreases the attractive energy by or fold Figure Instantaneous Dipole Moments The formation of an instantaneous dipole moment on one He atom a or an H molecule b results in the formation of an induced dipole on an adjacent atom or molecule Instantaneous dipoleinduced dipole interactions between nonpolar molecules can produce intermolecular attractions just as they produce interatomic attractions in monatomic substances like Xe This effect illustrated for two H molecules in part b in Figure tends to become more pronounced as atomic and molecular masses increase Table For example Xe boils at C whereas He boils at C The reason for this trend is that the strength of London dispersion forces is related to the ease with which the electron distribution in a given atom can be perturbed In small atoms such as He the two s electrons are held close to the nucleus in a very small volume and electronelectron repulsions are strong enough to prevent significant asymmetry in their distribution In larger atoms such as Xe however the outer electrons are much less strongly attracted to the nucleus because of filled intervening shells As a result it is relatively easy to temporarily deform the electron distribution to generate an instantaneous or induced dipole The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule is called its polarizability Because the electron distribution is more easily perturbed in large heavy species than in small light species we say that heavier substances tend to be much more polarizable than lighter ones Note For similar substances London dispersion forces get stronger with increasing molecular size The polarizability of a substance also determines how it interacts with ions and species that possess permanent dipoles Thus London dispersion forces are responsible for the general trend toward higher boiling points with increased molecular mass and greater surface area in a homologous series of compounds such as the alkanes part a in Figure The strengths of London dispersion forces also depend significantly on molecular shape because shape determines how much of one molecule can interact with its neighboring molecules at any given time For example part b in Figure shows dimethylpropane neopentane and npentane both of which have the empirical formula CH Neopentane is almost spherical with a small surface area for intermolecular interactions whereas npentane has an extended conformation that enables it to come into close contact with other npentane molecules As a result the boiling point of neopentane C is more than C lower than the boiling point of npentane C Figure Mass and Surface Area Affect the Strength of London Dispersion Forces a In this series of four simple alkanes larger molecules have stronger London forces between them than smaller molecules and consequently higher boiling points b Linear npentane molecules have a larger surface area and stronger intermolecular forces than spherical neopentane molecules As a result neopentane is a gas at room temperature whereas npentane is a volatile liquid All molecules whether polar or nonpolar are attracted to one another by London dispersion forces in addition to any other attractive forces that may be present In general however dipoledipole interactions in small polar molecules are significantly stronger than London dispersion forces so the former predominate Example Arrange nbutane propane methylpropane isobutane and npentane in order of increasing boiling points Strategy Determine the intermolecular forces in the compounds and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution The four compounds are alkanes and nonpolar so London dispersion forces are the only important intermolecular forces These forces are generally stronger with increasing molecular mass so propane should have the lowest boiling point and npentane should have the highest with the two butane isomers falling in between Of the two butane isomers methylpropane is more compact and nbutane has the more extended shape Consequently we expect intermolecular interactions for nbutane to be stronger due to its larger surface area resulting in a higher boiling point The overall order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses propane C methylpropane C nbutane C npentane C Exercise Arrange GeH SiCl SiH CH and GeCl in order of decreasing boiling points Answer GeCl C SiCl C GeH C SiH C CH C Hydrogen Bonds Molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms such as O N and F and to a much lesser extent Cl and S tend to exhibit unusually strong intermolecular interactions These result in much higher boiling points than are observed for substances in which London dispersion forces dominate as illustrated for the covalent hydrides of elements of groups in Figure Methane and its heavier congeners in group form a series whose boiling points increase smoothly with increasing molar mass This is the expected trend in nonpolar molecules for which London dispersion forces are the exclusive intermolecular forces In contrast the hydrides of the lightest members of groups have boiling points that are more than C greater than predicted on the basis of their molar masses The effect is most dramatic for water if we extend the straight line connecting the points for HTe and HSe to the line for period we obtain an estimated boiling point of C for water Imagine the implications for life on Earth if water boiled at C rather than C Figure The Effects of Hydrogen Bonding on Boiling Points These plots of the boiling points of the covalent hydrides of the elements of groups show that the boiling points of the lightest members of each series for which hydrogen bonding is possible HF NH and HO are anomalously high for compounds with such low molecular masses Why do strong intermolecular forces produce such anomalously high boiling points and other unusual properties such as high enthalpies of vaporization and high melting points The answer lies in the highly polar nature of the bonds between hydrogen and very electronegative elements such as O N and F The large difference in electronegativity results in a large partial positive charge on hydrogen and a correspondingly large partial negative charge on the O N or F atom Consequently HO HN and HF bonds have very large bond dipoles that can interact strongly with one another Because a hydrogen atom is so small these dipoles can also approach one another more closely than most other dipoles The combination of large bond dipoles and short dipoledipole distances results in very strong dipoledipole interactions called hydrogen bonds as shown for ice in Figure A hydrogen bond is usually indicated by a dotted line between the hydrogen atom attached to O N or F the hydrogen bond donor and the atom that has the lone pair of electrons the hydrogen bond acceptor Because each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs a tetrahedral arrangement maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed In the structure of ice each oxygen atom is surrounded by a distorted tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms that form bridges to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules The bridging hydrogen atoms are not equidistant from the two oxygen atoms they connect however Instead each hydrogen atom is pm from one oxygen and pm from the other In contrast each oxygen atom is bonded to two H atoms at the shorter distance and two at the longer distance corresponding to two OH covalent bonds and two OH hydrogen bonds from adjacent water molecules respectively The resulting open cagelike structure of ice means that the solid is actually slightly less dense than the liquid which explains why ice floats on water rather than sinks Figure The HydrogenBonded Structure of Ice Each water molecule accepts two hydrogen bonds from two other water molecules and donates two hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bonds with two more water molecules producing an open cagelike structure The structure of liquid water is very similar but in the liquid the hydrogen bonds are continually broken and formed because of rapid molecular motion Note Hydrogen bond formation requires both a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor Because ice is less dense than liquid water rivers lakes and oceans freeze from the top down In fact the ice forms a protective surface layer that insulates the rest of the water allowing fish and other organisms to survive in the lower levels of a frozen lake or sea If ice were denser than the liquid the ice formed at the surface in cold weather would sink as fast as it formed Bodies of water would freeze from the bottom up which would be lethal for most aquatic creatures The expansion of water when freezing also explains why automobile or boat engines must be protected by antifreeze and why unprotected pipes in houses break if they are allowed to freeze Although hydrogen bonds are significantly weaker than covalent bonds with typical dissociation energies of only kJmol they have a significant influence on the physical properties of a compound Compounds such as HF can form only two hydrogen bonds at a time as can on average pure liquid NH Consequently even though their molecular masses are similar to that of water their boiling points are significantly lower than the boiling point of water which forms four hydrogen bonds at a time Example Considering CHOH CH Xe and CHN which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Strategy Identify the compounds with a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F These are likely to be able to act as hydrogen bond donors Of the compounds that can act as hydrogen bond donors identify those that also contain lone pairs of electrons which allow them to be hydrogen bond acceptors If a substance is both a hydrogen donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor draw a structure showing the hydrogen bonding Solution A Of the species listed xenon Xe ethane CH and trimethylamine CHN do not contain a hydrogen atom attached to O N or F hence they cannot act as hydrogen bond donors B The one compound that can act as a hydrogen bond donor methanol CHOH contains both a hydrogen atom attached to O making it a hydrogen bond donor and two lone pairs of electrons on O making it a hydrogen bond acceptor methanol can thus form hydrogen bonds by acting as either a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor The hydrogenbonded structure of methanol is as follows Exercise Considering CHCOH CHN NH and CHF which can form hydrogen bonds with themselves Draw the hydrogenbonded structures Answer CHCOH and NH Example Arrange C buckminsterfullerene which has a cage structure NaCl He Ar and NO in order of increasing boiling points Given compounds Asked for order of increasing boiling points Strategy Identify the intermolecular forces in each compound and then arrange the compounds according to the strength of those forces The substance with the weakest forces will have the lowest boiling point Solution Electrostatic interactions are strongest for an ionic compound so we expect NaCl to have the highest boiling point To predict the relative boiling points of the other compounds we must consider their polarity for dipoledipole interactions their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their molar mass for London dispersion forces Helium is nonpolar and by far the lightest so it should have the lowest boiling point Argon and NO have very similar molar masses and gmol respectively but NO is polar while Ar is not Consequently NO should have a higher boiling point A C molecule is nonpolar but its molar mass is gmol much greater than that of Ar or NO Because the boiling points of nonpolar substances increase rapidly with molecular mass C should boil at a higher temperature than the other nonionic substances The predicted order is thus as follows with actual boiling points in parentheses He C Ar C NO C C C NaCl C Exercise Arrange dimethylheptane Ne CS Cl and KBr in order of decreasing boiling points Answer KBr C dimethylheptane C CS C Cl C Ne C Summary Molecules in liquids are held to other molecules by intermolecular interactions which are weaker than the intramolecular interactions that hold the atoms together within molecules and polyatomic ions Transitions between the solid and liquid or the liquid and gas phases are due to changes in intermolecular interactions but do not affect intramolecular interactions The three major types of intermolecular interactions are dipoledipole interactions London dispersion forces these two are often referred to collectively as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds Dipoledipole interactions arise from the electrostatic interactions of the positive and negative ends of molecules with permanent dipole moments their strength is proportional to the magnitude of the dipole moment and to r where r is the distance between dipoles London dispersion forces are due to the formation of instantaneous dipole moments in polar or nonpolar molecules as a result of shortlived fluctuations of electron charge distribution which in turn cause the temporary formation of an induced dipole in adjacent molecules Like dipoledipole interactions their energy falls off as r Larger atoms tend to be more polarizable than smaller ones because their outer electrons are less tightly bound and are therefore more easily perturbed Hydrogen bonds are especially strong dipoledipole interactions between molecules that have hydrogen bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as O N or F The resulting partially positively charged H atom on one molecule the hydrogen bond donor can interact strongly with a lone pair of electrons of a partially negatively charged O N or F atom on adjacent molecules the hydrogen bond acceptor Because of strong OHhydrogen bonding between water molecules water has an unusually high boiling point and ice has an open cagelike structure that is less dense than liquid water Key Takeaway Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature and include van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds Problems Which are strongerdipoledipole interactions or London dispersion forces Which are likely to be more important in a molecule with heavy atoms Explain your answers Liquid water is essential for life as we know it but based on its molecular mass water should be a gas under standard conditions Why is water a liquid rather than a gas under standard conditions Why are intermolecular interactions more important for liquids and solids than for gases Under what conditions must these interactions be considered for gases In group elemental fluorine and chlorine are gases whereas bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid Why Identify the most important intermolecular interaction in each of the following a SO b HF c CO d CCl e CHCl Both water and methanol have anomalously high boiling points due to hydrogen bonding but the boiling point of water is greater than that of methanol despite its lower molecular mass Why Draw the structures of these two compounds including any lone pairs and indicate potential hydrogen bonds Do you expect the boiling point of HS to be higher or lower than that of HO Justify your answer Some recipes call for vigorous boiling while others call for gentle simmering What is the difference in the temperature of the cooking liquid between boiling and simmering What is the difference in energy input Solutions DipoleDiple interactions are stronger because molecules polarity is permanent Molecules involved in London dispersion forces are only temporarily polar Water is a liquid under standard conditions because of its unique ability to form four strong hydrogen bonds per molecule In solids and liquids the molecules are in direct contact In gases the molecules only contact during collisions Intermolecules forces become inmportant when gases are cooled to the point where they form a liquid As the atomic mass of the halogens increases so does the number of electrons and the average distance of those electrons from the nucleus Larger atoms with more electrons are more easily polarized than smaller atoms and the increase in polarizability with atomic number increases the strength of London dispersion forces These intermolecular interactions are strong enough to favor the condensed states for bromine and iodine under normal conditions of temperature and pressure a The Vshaped SO molecule has a large dipole moment due to the polar SO bonds so dipoledipole interactions will be most important b The HF bond is highly polar and the fluorine atom has three lone pairs of electrons to act as hydrogen bond acceptors hydrogen bonding will be most important c Although the CO bonds are polar this linear molecule has no net dipole moment hence London dispersion forces are most important d This is a symmetrical molecule that has no net dipole moment and the Cl atoms are relatively polarizable thus London dispersion forces will dominate e This molecule has a small dipole moment as well as polarizable Cl atoms In such a case dipoledipole interactions and London dispersion forces are often comparable in magnitude Water has two polar OH bonds with H atoms that can act as hydrogen bond donors plus two lone pairs of electrons that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors giving a net of four hydrogen bonds per HO molecule Although methanol also has two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors it only has one OH bond with an H atom that can act as a hydrogen bond donor Consequently methanol can only form two hydrogen bonds per molecule on average versus four for water Hydrogen bonding therefore has a much greater effect on the boiling point of water HO would have the higher boiling point because it can form the stronger hydrogen bonding intermolecular force Vigorous boiling causes more water molecule to escape into the vapor phase but does not affect the temperature of the liquid Vigorous boiling requires a higher energy input than does gentle simmering Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma
