ringopening reactions of epoxides provides an oppourtunity to review the nucelophilic substitution mechansims Ringopening reactions can proceed by either SN or SN mechanisms depending on the nature of the epoxide and on the reaction conditions If the epoxide is asymmetric the structure of the product will vary according to which mechanism dominates When an asymmetric epoxide undergoes solvolysis in basic methanol ringopening occurs by an SN mechanism and the less substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under steric considerations and produces product B in the example below Conversely when solvolysis occurs in acidic methanol the reaction occurs by a mechanism with substantial SN character and the more substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under electrostatic considerations and produces product A in the example below These are both good examples of regioselective reactions In a regioselective reaction two or more different constitutional isomers are possible as products but one is formed preferentially or sometimes exclusively Let us examine the basic SN case first The leaving group is an alkoxide anion because there is no acid available to protonate the oxygen prior to ring opening An alkoxide is a poor leaving group and thus the ring is unlikely to open without a push from the nucleophile The nucleophile itself is potent a deprotonated negatively charged methoxide ion When a nucleophilic substitution reaction involves a poor leaving group and a powerful nucleophile it is very likely to proceed by an SN mechanism What about the electrophile There are two electrophilic carbons in the epoxide but the best target for the nucleophile in an SN reaction is the carbon that is least hindered This accounts for the observed regiochemical outcome Like in other SN reactions nucleophilic reactions take place with backside orientation relative to the leaving group resulting in inversion at the electrophilic carbon Probably the best way to depict the acidcatalyzed epoxide ringopening reaction is as a hybrid or cross between an SN and SN mechanism First the oxygen is protonated creating a good leaving group step below Electrostatic considerations have greater importance with a protonated intermediate As the carbonoxygen bond begins to break step positive charge builds on the more substituted carbon with greater carbocation stability Unlike in an SN reaction the nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic carbon step before a complete carbocation intermediate has a chance to form Reaction takes place preferentially from the backside like in an SN reaction because the carbonoxygen bond is still to some degree in place and the oxygen blocks reaction from the front side Notice however the regiochemical outcome is different from the basecatalyzed reaction In the acidcatalyzed process the nucleophile reacts with the more substituted carbon because it is this carbon that holds a greater degree of positive charge and electrostatics carbocation stability take a dominant role in determining the mechanism Example Predict the major products of the ring opening reaction that occurs when the epoxide shown below is treated with ethanol and a small amount of sodium hydroxide ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid Hint be sure to consider both regiochemistry and stereochemistry Solution Addition of HX Epoxides can also be opened by other anhydrous acids HX to form a trans halohydrin When both the epoxide carbons are either primary or secondary the halogen anion will attack the less substituted carbon and an SN like reaction However if one of the epoxide carbons is tertiary the halogen anion will primarily attack the tertialy cabon in a SN like reaction Example Exercise Given the following predict the product assuming only the epoxide is affected Remember stereochemistry Predict the product of the following similar to above but a different nucleophile is used and not in acidic conditions Remember stereochemistry Epoxides are often very useful reagents to use in synthesis when the desired product is a single stereoisomer If the following alkene were reacted with an oxyacid to form an epoxide would the result be a enantiomerically pure If not what would it be Answer Note that the stereochemistry has been inverted First look at the symmetry of the alkene There is a mirror plane shown here Then think about the mechanism of epoxidation with an oxyacid take for example mCPBA The mechanism is concerted so the original cis stereochemistry is not changed This leads to two epoxides However these two mirror images are actually identical due to the mirror plane of the cis geometry It is a meso compound so the final result is a single stereoisomer but not a single enantiomer Contributors and Attributions
