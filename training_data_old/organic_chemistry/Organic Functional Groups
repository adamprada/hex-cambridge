Organic Functional Groups Last updated Save as PDF Page ID No headers Learning Objective recognize and classify the common functional groups of organic chemistry alkanes alkenes alkynes alkyl halides alcohols amines ethers aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids esters and amides Functional groups in organic compounds Functional groups are structural units within organic compounds that are defined by specific bonding arrangements between specific atoms The structure of capsaicin the compound responsible for the heat in peppers incorporates several functional groups labeled in the figure below and explained throughout this section As we progress in our study of organic chemistry it will become extremely important to be able to quickly recognize the most common functional groups because they are the key structural elements that define how organic molecules react For now we will only worry about drawing and recognizing each functional group as depicted by Lewis and line structures Much of the remainder of your study of organic chemistry will be taken up with learning about how the different functional groups behave in organic reactions The default in organic chemistry essentially the lack of any functional groups is given the term alkane characterized by single bonds between carbon and carbon or between carbon and hydrogen Methane CH is the natural gas you may burn in your furnace Octane CH is a component of gasoline Alkanes Alkenes sometimes called olefins have carboncarbon double bonds and alkynes have carboncarbon triple bonds Ethene the simplest alkene example is a gas that serves as a cellular signal in fruits to stimulate ripening If you want bananas to ripen quickly put them in a paper bag along with an apple the apple emits ethene gas setting off the ripening process in the bananas Ethyne commonly called acetylene is used as a fuel in welding blow torches Alkenes and alkynes Alkenes have trigonal planar electron geometry while alkynes have linear geometry Furthermore many alkenes can take two geometric forms cis or trans The cis and trans forms of a given alkene are different molecules with different physical properties there is a very high energy barrier to rotation about a double bond In the example below the difference between cis and trans alkenes is readily apparent Alkanes alkenes and alkynes are all classified as hydrocarbons because they are composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms Alkanes are said to be saturated hydrocarbons because the carbons are bonded to the maximum possible number of hydrogens in other words they are saturated with hydrogen atoms The double and triplebonded carbons in alkenes and alkynes have fewer hydrogen atoms bonded to them they are thus referred to as unsaturated hydrocarbons As we will see in chapter hydrogen can be added to double and triple bonds in a type of reaction called hydrogenation The aromatic group is exemplified by benzene which used to be a commonly used solvent on the organic lab but which was shown to be carcinogenic and naphthalene a compound with a distinctive mothball smell Aromatic groups are planar flat ring structures and are widespread in nature We will learn more about the structure and reactions of aromatic groups in chapters and Aromatics When the carbon of an alkane is bonded to one or more halogens the group is referred to as a alkyl halide or haloalkane Chloroform is a useful solvent in the laboratory and was one of the earlier anesthetic drugs used in surgery Chlorodifluoromethane was used as a refrigerant and in aerosol sprays until the late twentieth century but its use was discontinued after it was found to have harmful effects on the ozone layer Bromoethane is a simple alkyl halide often used in organic synthesis Alkyl halides groups are quite rare in biomolecules Haloalkanes In the alcohol functional group a carbon is singlebonded to an OH group the OH group by itself is referred to as a hydroxyl Except for methanol all alcohols can be classified as primary secondary or tertiary In a primary alcohol the carbon bonded to the OH group is also bonded to only one other carbon In a secondary alcohol and tertiary alcohol the carbon is bonded to two or three other carbons respectively When the hydroxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring the resulting group is called a phenol The sulfur analog of an alcohol is called a thiol from the Greek thio for sulfur Alcohols phenols and thiols Note that the definition of a phenol states that the hydroxyl oxygen must be directly attached to one of the carbons of the aromatic ring The compound below therefore is not a phenol it is a primary alcohol The distinction is important because as we will see later there is a significant difference in the reactivity of alcohols and phenols The deprotonated forms of alcohols phenols and thiols are called alkoxides phenolates and thiolates respectively A protonated alcohol is an oxonium ion In an ether functional group a central oxygen is bonded to two carbons Below is the structure of diethyl ether a common laboratory solvent and also one of the first compounds to be used as an anesthetic during operations The sulfur analog of an ether is called a thioether or sulfide Ethers and sulfides Phosphate and its derivative functional groups are ubiquitous in biomolecules Phosphate linked to a single organic group is called a phosphate ester when it has two links to organic groups it is called a phosphate diester A linkage between two phosphates creates a phosphate anhydride Organic phosphates There are a number of functional groups that contain a carbonoxygen double bond which is commonly referred to as a carbonyl Ketones and aldehydes are two closely related carbonylbased functional groups that react in very similar ways In a ketone the carbon atom of a carbonyl is bonded to two other carbons In an aldehyde the carbonyl carbon is bonded on one side to a hydrogen and on the other side to a carbon The exception to this definition is formaldehyde in which the carbonyl carbon has bonds to two hydrogens A group with a carbonnitrogen double bond is called an imine or sometimes a Schiff base in this book we will use the term imine The chemistry of aldehydes ketones and imines will be covered in chapter Aldehydes ketones and imines When a carbonyl carbon is bonded on one side to a carbon or hydrogen and on the other side to an oxygen nitrogen or sulfur the functional group is considered to be one of the carboxylic acid derivatives a designation that describes a set of related functional groups The eponymous member of this family is the carboxylic acid functional group in which the carbonyl is bonded to a hydroxyl group The conjugate base of a carboxylic acid is a carboxylate Other derivatives are carboxylic esters usually just called esters thioesters amides acyl phosphates acid chlorides and acid anhydrides With the exception of acid chlorides and acid anhydrides the carboxylic acid derivatives are very common in biological molecules andor metabolic pathways and their structure and reactivity will be discussed in detail in chapter Carboxylic acid derivatives A single compound often contains several functional groups particularly in biological organic chemistry The sixcarbon sugar molecules glucose and fructose for example contain aldehyde and ketone groups respectively and both contain five alcohol groups a compound with several alcohol groups is often referred to as a polyol The hormone testosterone the amino acid phenylalanine and the glycolysis metabolite dihydroxyacetone phosphate all contain multiple functional groups as labeled below While not in any way a complete list this section has covered most of the important functional groups that we will encounter in biological organic chemistry Exercise Identify the functional groups other than alkanes in the following organic compounds State whether alcohols and amines are primary secondary or tertiary Solution Amines are characterized by nitrogen atoms with single bonds to hydrogen and carbon Just as there are primary secondary and tertiary alcohols there are primary secondary and tertiary amines Ammonia is a special case with no carbon atoms One of the most important properties of amines is that they are basic and are readily protonated to form ammonium cations In the case where a nitrogen has four bonds to carbon which is somewhat unusual in biomolecules it is called a quaternary ammonium ion Amines Note Do not be confused by how the terms primary secondary and tertiary are applied to alcohols and amines the definitions are different In alcohols what matters is how many other carbons the alcohol carbon is bonded to while in amines what matters is how many carbons the nitrogen is bonded to Finally a nitrile group is characterized by a carbon triplebonded to a nitrogen Nitriles Exercise Draw one example of each compound that includes the specified structural features Be sure to designate the location of all nonzero formal charges All atoms should have complete octets phosphorus may exceed the octet rule There are many possible correct answers
