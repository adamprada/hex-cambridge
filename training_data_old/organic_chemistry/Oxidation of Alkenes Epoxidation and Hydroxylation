Oxacyclopropane rings also called epoxide rings are useful reagents that may be opened by further reaction to form anti vicinal diols One way to synthesize oxacyclopropane rings is through the reaction of an alkene with peroxycarboxylic acid Oxacyclopropane Synthesis by Peroxycarboxylic Acid Oxacyclopropane synthesis by peroxycarboxylic acid requires an alkene and a peroxycarboxylic acid as well as an appropriate solvent The peroxycarboxylic acid has the unique property of having an electropositive oxygen atom on the COOH group The reaction is initiated by the electrophilic oxygen atom reacting with the nucleophilic carboncarbon double bond The mechanism involves a concerted reaction with a fourpart circular transition state The result is that the originally electropositive oxygen atom ends up in the oxacyclopropane ring and the COOH group becomes COH Mechanism Peroxycarboxylic acids are generally unstable An exception is metachloroperoxybenzoic acid shown in the mechanism above Often abbreviated MCPBA it is a stable crystalline solid Consequently MCPBA is popular for laboratory use However MCPBA can be explosive under some conditions Peroxycarboxylic acids are sometimes replaced in industrial applications by monoperphthalic acid or the monoperoxyphthalate ion bound to magnesium which gives magnesium monoperoxyphthalate MMPP In either case a nonaqueous solvent such as chloroform ether acetone or dioxane is used This is because in an aqueous medium with any acid or base catalyst present the epoxide ring is hydrolyzed to form a vicinal diol a molecule with two OH groups on neighboring carbons For more explanation of how this reaction leads to vicinal diols see below However in a nonaqueous solvent the hydrolysis is prevented and the epoxide ring can be isolated as the product Reaction yields from this reaction are usually about The reaction rate is affected by the nature of the alkene with more nucleophilic double bonds resulting in faster reactions Example Since the transfer of oxygen is to the same side of the double bond the resulting oxacyclopropane ring will have the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene A good way to think of this is that the alkene is rotated so that some constituents are coming forward and some are behind Then the oxygen is inserted on top See the product of the above reaction One way the epoxide ring can be opened is by an acid catalyzed oxidationhydrolysis Oxidationhydrolysis gives a vicinal diol a molecule with OH groups on neighboring carbons For this reaction the dihydroxylation is anti since due to steric hindrance the ring is attacked from the side opposite the existing oxygen atom Thus if the starting alkene is trans the resulting vicinal diol will have one S and one R stereocenter But if the starting alkene is cis the resulting vicinal diol will have a racemic mixture of S S and R R enantiomers Epoxidation exercises Predict the product of the reaction of cishexene with MCPBA

those prepared by the synhydroxylation reaction described above Proton transfer from the acid catalyst generates the conjugate acid of the epoxide which is attacked by nucleophiles such as water in the same way that the cyclic bromonium ion described above undergoes reaction The result is antihydroxylation of the double bond in contrast to the synstereoselectivity of the earlier method In the following equation this procedure is illustrated for a cisdisubstituted epoxide which of course could be prepared from the corresponding cisalkene This hydration of an epoxide does not change the oxidation state of any atoms or groups Syn Dihydroxylation Osmium tetroxide oxidizes alkenes to give glycols through syn addition A glycol also known as a vicinal diol is a compound with two OH groups on adjacent carbons Introduction The reaction with is a concerted process that has a cyclic intermediate and no rearrangements Vicinal syn dihydroxylation complements the epoxidehydrolysis sequence which constitutes an anti dihydroxylation of an alkene When an alkene reacts with osmium tetroxide stereocenters can form in the glycol product Cis alkenes give meso products and trans alkenes give racemic mixtures is formed slowly when osmium powder reacts with gasoues at ambient temperature Reaction of bulk solid requires heating to C Since Osmium tetroxide is expensive and highly toxic the reaction with alkenes has been modified Catalytic amounts of OsO and stoichiometric amounts of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide are now used to eliminate some hazards Also an older reagent that was used instead of OsO was potassium permanganate Although syn diols will result from the reaction of KMnO and an alkene potassium permanganate is less useful since it gives poor yields of the product because of overoxidation Mechanism Electrophilic attack on the alkene Pi bond of the alkene acts as the nucleophile and reacts with osmium VIII tetroxide OsO electrons from the double bond flows toward the osmium metal In the process electron pairs move simultaneously Cyclic ester with Os VI is produced Reduction HS reduces the cyclic ester NaHSO with HO may be used Forms the syndiol glycol Example Dihydroxylation of ethylcycloheptene Hydroxylation of alkenes Dihydroxylated products glycols are obtained by reaction with aqueous potassium permanganate pH or osmium tetroxide in pyridine solution Both reactions appear to proceed by the same mechanism shown below the metallocyclic intermediate may be isolated in the osmium reaction In basic solution the purple permanganate anion is reduced to the green manganate ion providing a nice color test for the double bond functional group From the mechanism shown here we would expect synstereoselectivity in the bonding to oxygen and regioselectivity is not an issue When viewed in context with the previously discussed addition reactions the hydroxylation reaction might seem implausible Permanganate and osmium tetroxide have similar configurations in which the metal atom occupies the center of a tetrahedral grouping of negatively charged oxygen atoms How then would such a species interact with the nucleophilic pielectrons of a double bond A possible explanation is that an empty dorbital of the electrophilic metal atom extends well beyond the surrounding oxygen atoms and initiates electron transfer from the double bond to the metal in much the same fashion noted above for platinum Backbonding of the nucleophilic oxygens to the antibonding Ï€orbital completes this interaction The result is formation of a metallocyclic intermediate as shown above Chemical Highlight Antitumor drugs have been formed by using dihydroxylation This method has been applied to the enantioselective synthesis of ovalicin which is a class of fungalderived products called antiangiogenesis agents These antitumor products can cut off the blood supply to solid tumors A derivative of ovalicin TNP is chemically stable nontoxic and noninflammatory TNP has been used in research to determine its effectiveness in treating cancer of the breast brain cervix liver and prostate Outside links httpenWikipediaorgwikiOsmium_tetroxide
