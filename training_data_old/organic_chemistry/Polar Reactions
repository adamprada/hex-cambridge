Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below electrophile nucleophile polar reaction polarizability Study Notes You may wish to review Section before you begin this section The relative electronegativities of the elements shown in the periodic table should already be familiar Remember that it is the relative electronegativities that are important not the actual numerical values Make sure that you understand the polarity patterns of the common functional groups Do not try to memorize these polarities rather concentrate on why they arise You will encounter these group polarities so frequently that they will soon become second nature to you Halogens and the Character of the CarbonHalogen Bond With respect to electronegativity most halogens are more electronegative than carbon This results in a carbonhalogen bond that is polarized As shown in the image below the carbon atom has a partial positive charge while the halogen has a partial negative charge The following image shows the relationship between the halogens and electronegativity Notice as we move up the periodic table from iodine to fluorine electronegativity increases The following image shows the relationships between bond length bond strength and molecular size As we progress down the periodic table from fluorine to iodine molecular size increases As a result we also see an increase in bond length Conversely as molecular size increases and we get longer bonds the strength of those bonds decreases The influence of bond polarity Of the four halogens fluorine is the most electronegative and iodine the least That means that the electron pair in the carbonfluorine bond will be dragged most towards the halogen end Looking at the methyl halides as simple examples The electronegativities of carbon and iodine are equal and so there will be no separation of charge on the bond One of the important set of reactions of alkyl halides involves replacing the halogen by something else substitution reactions These reactions can involve the carbonhalogen bond breaking to give positive and negative ions The ion with the positively charged carbon atom then reacts with something either fully or slightly negatively charged Alternatively something either fully or negatively charged is attracted to the slightly positive carbon atom and pushes off the halogen atom You might have thought that either of these would be more effective in the case of the carbonfluorine bond with the quite large amounts of positive and negative charge already present But thats not so quite the opposite is true The thing that governs the reactivity is the strength of the bonds which have to be broken If is difficult to break a carbonfluorine bond but easy to break a carboniodine one The Carbonyl Group CO is prone to additions and nucleophillic attack because or carbons positive charge and oxygens negative charge The resonance of the carbon partial positive charge allows the negative charge on the nucleophile to attack the Carbonyl group and become a part of the structure and a positive charge usually a proton hydrogen attacks the oxygen Just a reminder the nucleophile is a good acid therefore likes protons so it will attack the side with a positive charge Before we consider in detail the reactivity of aldehydes and ketones we need to look back and remind ourselves of what the bonding picture looks like in a carbonyl Carbonyl carbons are sp hybridized with the three sp orbitals forming overlaps with orbitals on the oxygen and on the two carbon or hydrogen atoms These three bonds adopt trigonal planar geometry The remaining unhybridized p orbital on the central carbonyl carbon is perpendicular to this plane and forms a sidebyside pi bond with a p orbital on the oxygen The carbonoxygen double bond is polar oxygen is more electronegative than carbon so electron density is higher on the oxygen side of the bond and lower on the carbon side Recall that bond polarity can be depicted with a dipole arrow or by showing the oxygen as holding a partial negative charge and the carbonyl carbon a partial positive charge A third way to illustrate the carbonoxygen dipole is to consider the two main resonance contributors of a carbonyl group the major form which is what you typically see drawn in Lewis structures and a minor but very important contributor in which both electrons in the pbond are localized on the oxygen giving it a full negative charge The latter depiction shows the carbon with an empty p orbital and a full positive charge Some Carbonyl Compounds Nucleophilic Addition to Aldehydes and Ketones The result of carbonyl bond polarization however it is depicted is straightforward to predict The carbon because it is electronpoor is an electrophile it is a great target for attack by an electronrich nucleophilic group Because the oxygen end of the carbonyl double bond bears a partial negative charge anything that can help to stabilize this charge by accepting some of the electron density will increase the bonds polarity and make the carbon more electrophilic Very often a general acid group serves this purpose donating a proton to the carbonyl oxygen The same effect can also be achieved if a Lewis acid such as a magnesium ion is located near the carbonyl oxygen Unlike the situation in a nucleophilic substitution reaction when a nucleophile attacks an aldehyde or ketone carbon there is no leaving group the incoming nucleophile simply pushes the electrons in the pi bond up to the oxygen Alternatively if you start with the minor resonance contributor you can picture this as an attack by a nucleophile on a carbocation After the carbonyl is attacked by the nucleophile the negatively charged oxygen has the capacity to act as a nucleophile However most commonly the oxygen acts instead as a base abstracting a proton from a nearby acid group in the solvent or enzyme active site This very common type of reaction is called a nucleophilic addition In many biologically relevant examples of nucleophilic addition to carbonyls the nucleophile is an alcohol oxygen or an amine nitrogen or occasionally a thiol sulfur In one very important reaction type known as an aldol reaction the nucleophile attacking the carbonyl is a resonancestabilized carbanion In this chapter we will concentrate on reactions where the nucleophile is an oxygen or nitrogen Nucleophilic Addition to Aldehydes and Ketones Nucleophilic Substitution of RCOZ Z Leaving Group General reaction General mechanism Polarity Patterns in Other Common Functional Groups Nucleophile Nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond In both laboratory and biological organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates More specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide N anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles Of course carbons can also be nucleophiles otherwise how could new carboncarbon bonds be formed in the synthesis of large organic molecules like DNA or fatty acids Enolate ions section are the most common carbon nucleophiles in biochemical reactions while the cyanide ion CN is just one example of a carbon nucleophile commonly used in the laboratory Reactions with carbon nucleophiles will be dealt with in chapters and however in this chapter and the next we will concentrate on noncarbon nucleophiles When thinking about nucleophiles the first thing to recognize is that for the most part the same quality of electronrichness that makes a something nucleophilic also makes it basic nucleophiles can be bases and bases can be nucleophiles It should not be surprising then that most of the trends in basicity that we have already discussed also apply to nucleophilicity Electrophiles In the vast majority of the nucleophilic substitution reactions you will see in this and other organic chemistry texts the electrophilic atom is a carbon which is bonded to an electronegative atom usually oxygen nitrogen sulfur or a halogen The concept of electrophilicity is relatively simple an electronpoor atom is an attractive target for something that is electronrich ie a nucleophile However we must also consider the effect of steric hindrance on electrophilicity In addition we must discuss how the nature of the electrophilic carbon and more specifically the stability of a potential carbocationic intermediate influences the SN vs SN character of a nucleophilic substitution reaction Consider two hypothetical SN reactions one in which the electrophile is a methyl carbon and another in which it is tertiary carbon Because the three substituents on the methyl carbon electrophile are tiny hydrogens the nucleophile has a relatively clear path for backside attack However backside attack on the tertiary carbon is blocked by the bulkier methyl groups Once again steric hindrance this time caused by bulky groups attached to the electrophile rather than to the nucleophile hinders the progress of an associative nucleophilic SN displacement The factors discussed in the above paragraph however do not prevent a stericallyhindered carbon from being a good electrophile they only make it less likely to be attacked in a concerted SN reaction Nucleophilic substitution reactions in which the electrophilic carbon is sterically hindered are more likely to occur by a twostep dissociative SN mechanism This makes perfect sense from a geometric point of view the limitations imposed by sterics are significant mainly in an SN displacement when the electrophile being attacked is a sphybridized tetrahedral carbon with its relatively tight angles of o Remember that in an SN mechanism the nucleophile attacks an sphybridized carbocation intermediate which has trigonal planar geometry with open angles With this open geometry the empty p orbital of the electrophilic carbocation is no longer significantly shielded from the approaching nucleophile by the bulky alkyl groups A carbocation is a very potent electrophile and the nucleophilic step occurs very rapidly compared to the first ionization step Exercises Questions Q
