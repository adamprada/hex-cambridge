Prelude to Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions Substitution reactions involve the replacement of one atom or group by another We already have described one very important type of substitution reaction the halogenation of alkanes Section in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen atom halogen The chlorination of dimethylpropane is an example Reactions of this type proceed by radicalchain mechanisms in which the bonds are broken and formed by atoms or radicals as reactive intermediates This mode of bondbreaking in which one electron goes with and the other with is called homolytic bond cleavage There are a large number of reactions usually occurring in solution that do not involve atoms or radicals but rather involve ions They occur by heterolytic cleavage as opposed to homolytic cleavage of electronpair bonds In heterolytic bond cleavage the electron pair can be considered to go with one or the other of the groups and when the bond is broken As one example is a group such that it has an unshared electron pair and also is a negative ion A heterolytic substitution reaction in which the bonding pair goes with would lead to and A specific substitution reaction of this type is that of chloromethane with hydroxide ion to form methanol In this chapter we shall discuss substitution reactions that proceed by ionic or polar mechanisms in which the bonds cleave heterolytically We also will discuss the mechanistically related elimination reactions that result in the formation of carboncarbon multiple bonds These reactions often are influenced profoundly by seemingly minor variations in the structure of the reactants in the solvent or in the temperature It is our purpose to show how these reactions can be understood and how they can be used to prepare other useful organic compounds But first it will be helpful to introduce the concepts of nucleophilic and electrophilic reagents and to consider the values for heterolytic bond breaking Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
