Prelude to Stereoisomerism Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions By now you should be familiar with position isomers wherein compounds of the same molecular formula differ because substituents chain branches and so on are not at the same positions in the molecules Chloropropane and chloropropane are straightforward examples of position isomers A much more subtle form of isomerism is present when two different compounds have the same molecular formulas the same substituent and chainbranching positions and indeed even have the same names by all of the nomenclature rules we have given you so far Such isomers are different because their molecules have different arrangements of the atoms in space These are stereoisomers and this type of isomerism called stereoisomerism is of enormous importance to all areas of organic chemistry and biochemistry To understand stereoisomerism of carbon compounds we must understand the ways in which the bonds to carbon atoms are arranged in space As shown in Section A this depends on whether the carbon atoms form single double or triple bonds to another atom Thus four single bonds to a carbon form a tetrahedral arrangement two single bonds and one double bond to a carbon give a planar array with bond angles near while one single bond and one triple bond or two double bonds to a carbon are arranged linearly Finally if you have not studied the material already you may wish to return to the last part of Chapter and become acquainted with the nomenclature of cycloalkanes alkenes cycloalkenes and alkynes Sections to Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
