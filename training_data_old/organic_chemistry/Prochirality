be able to identify a compound as being prochiral identify the Re and Si faces of prochiral sp centre identify atoms or groups of atoms as proR or proS on a prochiral sp centre Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below prochiral proR proS Re Si Prochiral substituents on tetrahedral carbons When a tetrahedral carbon can be converted to a chiral center by changing only one of its attached groups it is referred to as a prochiral center The actual example shown below is the reduced form of a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH an important participant in many biochemical oxidationreduction reactions section A Note that if in a thought experiment we changed either one of the indicated hydrogens on NADH to a deuterium the H isotope of hydrogen the carbon would become a chiral center Prochirality is an important concept in biological chemistry because enzymes can distinguish between the two identical groups bound to a prochiral carbon center due to the fact that they occupy different regions in threedimensional space For example in the following reaction which is a key step in the oxidation of fatty acids it is specifically HA and HD that are lost while HB and HC remain in the resulting conjugated alkene The prochiral hydrogens on Cand C of the fatty acid can be designated according to a variation on the RS system For the sake of clarity well look at a much simpler molecule ethanol to explain this system To name the two prochiral hydrogens on ethanol we again need to engage in a thought experiment If we in our imagination were to arbitrarily change HB to a deuterium the molecule would now be chiral and the stereocenter would have the S configuration D has a higher priority than H For this reason we can refer to HB as the proS hydrogen of ethanol and label it HS Conversely if we change HA to D and leave HB as a hydrogen the configuration of the molecule becomes R so we can refer to HA as the proR hydrogen of ethanol and label it HR Looking back at our fatty acid example we see that it is specifically the proR hydrogens on carbons and that are lost in the reaction Prochiral hydrogens can be designated either enantiotopic or diastereotopic If either HR or HS on ethanol were replaced by a deuterium the two resulting molecules would be enantiomers because there are no other stereocenters Thus these two hydrogens are referred to as enantiotopic In glyceraldehydephosphate GAP however we see something different If either HR or HS is replaced by a deuterium the two resulting molecules will be diastereomers thus in this molecule HR and HS are referred to as diastereotopic hydrogens The importance of the distinction between enantiotopic and diastereotopic groups will become apparent when we learn about the analytical technique called nuclear magnetic resonance Two hydrogens on the same carbon of a substituted ring structure can be diastereotopic we determine this by carrying out the same thought experiment as discussed above In the example below the diastereotopic hydrogens indicated are either on the same side or on the opposite side of the ring relative to the hydroxyl group Finally hydrogens that are completely identical and can be designated neither enantiotopic nor diastereotopic are called homotopic If a homotopic hydrogen is replaced by deuterium a chiral center is not created The three hydrogen atoms on the methyl CH group of ethanol and on any methyl group are homotopic Even to an enzyme all three of these hydrogens will look the same Example Identifying Prochiral hydrogens Identify in the molecules below all pairsgroups of hydrogens that are homotopic enantiotopic or diastereotopic When appropriate label prochiral hydrogens as HR or HS Answer Groups other than hydrogens can be considered prochiral The alcohol below has two prochiral methyl groups methyl A is the proR methyl and methyl B is proS How do we make these designations Simple just arbitrarily make methyl A higher priority than methyl B and the compound now has the R configuration Citrate provides a more complex example The central carbon is a prochiral center with two arms that are identical except that one can be designated proR and the other proS In a reaction of the citric acid cycle Krebs cycle a water molecule is specifically lost on the proR arm we will study this reaction in section B Notice also that it is specifically the proR hydrogen on the proR arm of citrate that is lost one more layer of stereoselectivity Example Leucine Assign proR andproS designations to all prochiral groups in the amino acid leucine Hint there are two pairs of prochiral groups Are these prochiral groups diastereotopic or enantiotopic Answer Although an alkene carbon bonded to two identical groups is not considered a prochiral center these two groups can be diastereotopic Ha and Hb on the alkene below for example are diastereotopic if we change one and then the other of these hydrogens to deuterium the resulting compounds are E and Z diastereomers Carbonyl and imine carbons as prochiral centers Trigonal planar sphybridized carbons are not as we well know chiral centers but they are referred to as prochiral centers if they are bonded to three different substitutuents As you might expect we and the enzymes that catalyze their reactions can distinguish between the two planar faces of a prochiral sp hybridized group These faces are designated by the terms re and si To determine which is the re and which is the si face of a planar organic group we simply use the same priority rankings that we are familiar with from the RS system and trace a circle re is clockwise and si is counterclockwise Below for example we are looking down on the re face of the ketone group in pyruvate If we flipped the molecule over we would be looking at the si face of the ketone group Note that the carboxylate group does not have re and si faces because two of the three substituents on that carbon are identical when the two resonance forms of carboxylate are taken into account As we will see beginning in chapter enzymes which catalyze reactions at carbonyl carbons act specifically from one side or the other Notice that the hydrogenation reaction above is specific not only in terms of which face of the carbonyl group is affected but also in terms of which of the two diastereotopic hydrogens on NADH is transferred we will study this type of reaction in more detail in section Example Uracil For each of the carbonyl groups in uracil state whether we are looking at the re or the si face in the structural drawing below Answer Exercises Q State which of the following hydrogen atoms are proR or proS Q Identify which side is Re or Si Answer S Left
