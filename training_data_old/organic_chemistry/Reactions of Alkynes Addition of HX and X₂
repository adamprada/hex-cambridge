BrContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to describe the bonding and geometry of the carboncarbon triple bond in terms of the sphybridization of the carbon atoms involved explain the reactivity of alkynes based on the known strengths of carboncarbon single double and triple bonds write equations for the reaction of an alkyne with one or two equivalents of halogen chlorine or bromine or halogen acid HCl HBr or HI draw the structure of the product formed when an alkyne reacts with one equivalent of the halogens and halogen acids listed in Objective identify the alkyne which must have been used in an addition reaction with a halogen or halogen acid given the product of such a reaction Study Notes You might find it useful to review Section before you begin work on this chapter If necessary construct a molecular model of a simple alkyne Notice the similarity between the behaviour of alkenes and that of alkynes In the laboratory you will observe that alkynes readily decolourize a solution of bromine in dichloromethane Section describes a test that allows you to distinguish between a terminal alkyne ie one in which the triple bond occurs between the last two carbons in the chain and nonterminal alkynes and alkenes Addition by Electrophilic Reagents A carboncarbon triple bond may be located at any unbranched site within a carbon chain or at the end of a chain in which case it is called terminal Because of its linear configuration the bond angle of a sphybridized carbon is º a tenmembered carbon ring is the smallest that can accommodate this function without excessive strain Since the most common chemical transformation of a carboncarbon double bond is an addition reaction we might expect the same to be true for carboncarbon triple bonds Indeed most of the alkene addition reactions also take place with alkynes and with similar regio and stereoselectivity When the addition reactions of electrophilic reagents such as strong Brønsted acids and halogens to alkynes are studied we find a curious paradox The reactions are even more exothermic than the additions to alkenes and yet the rate of addition to alkynes is slower by a factor of to than addition to equivalently substituted alkenes The reaction of one equivalent of bromine with pentenyne for example gave dibromopentyne as the chief product HCCCHCHCH Br HCCCHCHBrCHBr Although these electrophilic additions to alkynes are sluggish they do take place and generally display Markovnikov Rule regioselectivity and antistereoselectivity One problem of course is that the products of these additions are themselves substituted alkenes and can therefore undergo further addition Because of their high electronegativity halogen substituents on a double bond act to reduce its nucleophilicity and thereby decrease the rate of electrophilic addition reactions Consequently there is a delicate balance as to whether the product of an initial addition to an alkyne will suffer further addition to a saturated product Although the initial alkene products can often be isolated and identified they are commonly present in mixtures of products and may not be obtained in high yield The following reactions illustrate many of these features In the last example diodoethene does not suffer further addition inasmuch as vicinaldiiodoalkanes are relatively unstable As a rule electrophilic addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes proceed by initial formation of a picomplex in which the electrophile accepts electrons from and becomes weakly bonded to the multiple bond Such complexes are formed reversibly and may then reorganize to a reactive intermediate in a slower ratedetermining step Reactions with alkynes are more sensitive to solvent changes and catalytic influences than are equivalent alkenes For examples and a discussion of mechanisms click here Why are the reactions of alkynes with electrophilic reagents more sluggish than the corresponding reactions of alkenes After all addition reactions to alkynes are generally more exothermic than additions to alkenes and there would seem to be a higher πelectron density about the triple bond two πbonds versus one Two factors are significant in explaining this apparent paradox First although there are more πelectrons associated with the triple bond the sphybridized carbons exert a strong attraction for these πelectrons which are consequently bound more tightly to the functional group than are the πelectrons of a double bond This is seen in the ionization potentials of ethylene and acetylene Acetylene HCCH Energy HCCH e ΔH kcalmole Ethylene HCCH Energy HCCH e ΔH kcalmole Ethane HCCH Energy HCCH e ΔH kcalmole As defined by the preceding equations an ionization potential is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a molecule of a compound Since pielectrons are less tightly held than sigmaelectrons we expect the ionization potentials of ethylene and acetylene to be lower than that of ethane as is the case Gasphase proton affinities show the same order with ethylene being more basic than acetylene and ethane being less basic than either Since the initial interaction between an electrophile and an alkene or alkyne is the formation of a picomplex in which the electrophile accepts electrons from and becomes weakly bonded to the multiple bond the relatively slower reactions of alkynes becomes understandable A second factor is presumed to be the stability of the carbocation intermediate generated by sigmabonding of a proton or other electrophile to one of the triple bond carbon atoms This intermediate has its positive charge localized on an unsaturated carbon and such vinyl cations are less stable than their saturated analogs Indeed we can modify our earlier ordering of carbocation stability to include these vinyl cations in the manner shown below It is possible that vinyl cations stabilized by conjugation with an aryl substituent are intermediates in HX addition to alkynes of the type ArCCR but such intermediates are not formed in all alkyne addition reactions Carbocation Stability CH RCHCH RCH RCHCR RCH CHCHCH CHCH RC Methyl Vinyl Vinyl Allyl Benzyl Application of the Hammond postulate indicates that the activation energy for the generation of a vinyl cation intermediate would be higher than that for a lower energy intermediate This is illustrated for alkenes versus alkynes by the following energy diagrams Despite these differences electrophilic additions to alkynes have emerged as exceptionally useful synthetic transforms Addition of Hydrogen Halide to an Alkyne Summary Reactivity order of hydrogen halides HI HB r HCl HF Follows Markovnikovs rule Hydrogen adds to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogens the halogen adds to the carbon with fewest hydrogens Protination occurs on the more stable carbocation With the addition of HX haloalkenes form With the addition of excess HX you get anti addition forming a geminal dihaloalkane Addition of a HX to an Internal Alkyne As described in Figure the electrons will attack the hydrogen of the HBr and because this is a symmetric molecule it does not matter which carbon it adds to but in an asymmetric molecule the hydrogen will covalently bond to the carbon with the most hydrogens Once the hydrogen is covalently bonded to one of the carbons you will get a carbocation intermediate not shown but will look the same as depicted in Figure on the other carbon Again this is a symmetric molecule and if it were asymmetric which carbon would have the positive charge The final step is the addition of the Bromine which is a good nucleophile because it has electrons to donate or share Bromine therefore attacks the carbocation intermediate placing it on the highly substituted carbon As a result you get bromobutene from your butyne reactant as shown below Now what if you have excess HBr Addition due to excess HX yields a geminal dihaloalkane Here the electrophilic addition proceeds with the same steps used to achieve the product in Addition of a HX to an Internal Alkyne The electrons attacked the hydrogen adding it to the carbon on the left shown in blue Why was hydrogen added to the carbon on left and the one on the right bonded to the Bromine Now you will have your carbocation intermediate which is followed by the attack of the Bromine to the carbon on the right resulting in a haloalkane product Addition of HX to Terminal Alkyne Here is an addition of HBr to an asymmetric molecule First try to make sense of how the reactant went to product and then take a look at the mechanism The electrons are attacking the hydrogen depicted by the electron pushing arrows and the Bromine gains a negative charge The carbocation intermediate forms a positive charge on the left carbon after the hydrogen was added to the carbon with the most hydrogen substituents The Bromine which has a negative charge attacks the positively charged carbocation forming the final product with the nucleophile on the more substituted carbon Addition due to excess HBr present Most Hydrogen halide reactions with alkynes occur in a Markovnikovmanner in which the halide attaches to the most substituted carbon since it is the most positively polarized A more substituted carbon has more bonds attached to carbons or electrondonating groups such as Fluorine and other halides However there are two specific reactions among alkynes where antiMarkovnikov reactions take place the radical addition of HBr and Hydroboration Oxidation reactions For alkynes an antiMarkovnikov addition takes place on a terminal alkyne an alkyne on the end of a chain HBr Addition With Radical Yields bromoalkene The Br of the Hydrogen Bromide HBr attaches to the less substituted carbon of the terminal alkyne shown below in an antiMarkovnikov manner while the Hydrogen proton attaches to the second carbon As mentioned above the first carbon is the less substituted carbon since it has fewer bonds attached to carbons and other substituents The HBr reagent must also be reacted with heat or some other radicial initiator such as a peroxide in order for this reaction to proceed in this manner This presence of the radical or heat leads to the antiMarkovnikov addition since it produces the most stable reaction The product of a terminal alkyne that is reacted with a peroxide or light and HBr is a bromoalkene Regioselectivity The Bromine can attach in a syn or anti manner which means the resulting alkene can be both cis and trans Syn addition is when both Hydrogens attach to the same face or side of the double bond ie cis while the anti addition is when they attach on opposite sides of the bond trans Reaction Halogenation of Alkynes Summary Stereoslectivity anti addition Reaction proceeds via cyclic halonium ion Addition of Br The addition of Br to an alkyne is analogous to adding Br to an alkene Once Br approaches the nucleophilic alkyne it becomes polarized The electrons from the triple bond can now attack the polarized bromine forming a CBr bond and displacing the bromine ion Now you will get an intermediate electrophilic carbocation which will immediately react with the bromine ion giving you the dibromo product First you see the polarized Br being attacked by the electrons Once you form the CBr bond the other bromine is released as a bromine ion The intermediate here is a bromonium ion which is electrophilic and reacts with the bromine ion giving you the dibromo product Exercise Draw the structure
