Reactive Intermediates Carbanions and Carbon Acids Last updated Save as PDF Page ID CarbanionsCarbon acidsChiral carbanionsExternal linksReferences Carbanions A carbanion is an anion in which carbon has an unshared pair of electrons and bears a negative charge usually with three substituents for a total of eight valence electrons The carbanion exists in a trigonal pyramidal geometry Formally a carbanion is the conjugate base of a carbon acid ceR_CH B rightarrow R_C HB where B stands for the base A carbanion is one of several reactive intermediates in organic chemistry A carbanion is a nucleophile which stability and reactivity determined by several factors The inductive effect Electronegative atoms adjacent to the charge will stabilize the charge Hybridization of the chargebearing atom The greater the scharacter of the chargebearing atom the more stable the anion The extent of conjugation of the anion Resonance effects can stabilize the anion This is especially true when the anion is stabilized as a result of aromaticity A carbanion is a reactive intermediate and is encountered in organic chemistry for instance in the EcB elimination reaction and in organometallic chemistry in for instance a Grignard reaction or in alkyl lithium chemistry Stable carbanions do however exist In Olmstead presented the lithium crown ether salt of the triphenylmethyl carbanion from triphenylmethane nbutyllithium and crown at low temperatures Adding nbutyllithium to triphenylmethane in THF at low temperatures followed by crown results in a red solution and the salt complex precipitates at C The central CC bond lengths are pm with the phenyl ring propelled at an average angle of This propeller shape is less pronounced with a tetramethylammonium counterion One tool for the detection of carbanions in solution is proton NMR A spectrum of cyclopentadiene in DMSO shows four vinylic protons at ppm and two methylene bridge protons at ppm whereas the cyclopentadienyl anion has a single resonance at ppm Carbon acids Any molecule containing a CH can lose a proton forming the carbanion Hence any hydrocarbon containing CH bonds can be considered an acid with a corresponding pKa value Methane is certainly not an acid in its classical meaning yet its estimated pKa is Compare this to acetic acid with pKa The same factors that determine the stability of the carbanion also determine the order in pKa in carbon acids These values are determined for the compounds either in water in order to compare them to ordinary acids indimethyl sulfoxide in which the majority of carbon acids and their anions are soluble or in the gas phase With DMSO the acidity window for solutes is limited to its own pKa of Table Carbon acid acidities in pKa in DMSO Reference acids in bold name

Dimedone CHO Meldrums acid CHO Acetic acid CHCOOH Barbituric acid CHONH Trinitromethane HCNO Fulminic acid HCNO Carborane superacid HCHBCl Note that the anions formed by ionization of acetic acid ethanol or aniline are not carbanions Starting from methane in Table the acidity increases when the anion is aromatic either because the added electron causes the anion to become aromatic as in indene and cyclopentadiene or because the negative charge on carbon can be delocalized over several alreadyaromatic rings as in triphenylmethane or the carborane superacid when the carbanion is surrounded by strongly electronegative groups through the partial neutralisation of the negative charge as in malononitrile when the carbanion is immediately next to a carbonyl group The αprotons of carbonyl groups are acidic because the negative charge in the enolate can be partially distributed in the oxygen atom Meldrums acid and barbituric acid historically named acids are in fact a lactone and a lactam respectively but their acidic carbon protons make them acidic The acidity of carbonyl compounds is an important driving force in many organic reactions such as the aldol reaction Chiral carbanions With the molecular geometry for a carbanion described as a trigonal pyramid the question is whether or not carbanions can display chirality because if the activation barrier for inversion of this geometry is too low any attempt at introducing chirality will end inracemization similar to the nitrogen inversion However solid evidence exists that carbanions can indeed be chiral for example in research carried out with certain organolithium compounds The first ever evidence for the existence of chiral organolithium compounds was obtained in Reaction of chiral iodooctane with secbutyllithium in petroleum ether at C followed by reaction with dry ice yielded mostly racemic methylbutyric acid but also an amount of optically active methyloctanoic acid which could only have formed from likewise optical active methylheptyllithium with the carbon atom linked to lithium the carbanion On heating the reaction to C the optical activity is lost More evidence followed in the s A reaction of the cis isomer of methylcyclopropyl bromide with secbutyllithium again followed by carboxylation with dry ice yielded cismethylcyclopropylcarboxylic acid The formation of the trans isomer would have indicated that the intermediate carbanion was unstable In the same manner the reaction of Slbromolmethyldiphenylcyclopropane with nbutyllithium followed by quench with methanol resulted in product with retention of configuration Of recent date are chiral methyllithium compounds The phosphate contains a chiral group with a hydrogen and a deuterium substituent The stannyl group is replaced by lithium to intermediate which undergoes a phosphatephosphorane rearrangement to phosphorane which on reaction with acetic acid givesalcohol Once again in the range of C to C the chirality is preserved in this reaction sequence History A carbanionic structure first made an appearance in the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation as correctly proposed by Clarke and Lapworth in In Schlenk prepared PhCNMe in a quest for pentavalent nitrogen fromTetramethylammonium chloride and PhCNa and in he demonstrated how triarylmethyl radicals could be reduced to carbonions by alkali metals The phrase carbanion was introduced by Wallis and Adams in as the negatively charged counterpart of the carbonium ion External links Large database of Bordwell pKa values at wwwchemwiscedu Link Large
