Reactive Intermediates Carbocations Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Carbocations and their StabilityCarbocation RearrangementsHistoryReferencesContributors Learning Objective describe the structure relative stabilities of carbocations Carbocations and their Stability A carbocation is an ion with a positivelycharged carbon atom A carbocation is very electronpoor and thus anything which donates electron density to the center of electron poverty will help to stabilize it Conversely a carbocation will be destabilized by an electron withdrawing group Alkyl groups are electron donating and carbocationstabilizing because the electrons around the neighboring carbons are drawn towards the nearby positive charge thus slightly reducing the electron poverty of the positivelycharged carbon What this means is that in general more substituted carbocations are more stable a tertbutyl carbocation for example is more stable than an isopropyl carbocation Primary carbocations are highly unstable and not often observed as reaction intermediates methyl carbocations are even less stable It is not accurate to say however that carbocations with higher substitution are always more stable than those with less substitution Just as electrondonating groups can stabilize a carbocation electronwithdrawing groups act to destabilize carbocations Carbonyl groups are electronwithdrawing by inductive effects due to the polarity of the CO double bond It is possible to demonstrate in the laboratory see section D that carbocation A below is more stable than carbocation B even though A is a primary carbocation and B is secondary The difference in stability can be explained by considering the electronwithdrawing inductive effect of the ester carbonyl Recall that inductive effects whether electronwithdrawing or donating are relayed through covalent bonds and that the strength of the effect decreases rapidly as the number of intermediary bonds increases In other words the effect decreases with distance In species B the positive charge is closer to the carbonyl group thus the destabilizing electronwithdrawing effect is stronger than it is in species A Stabilization of a carbocation can also occur through resonance effects and as we have already discussed in the acidbase chapter resonance effects as a rule are more powerful than inductive effects Consider the simple case of a benzylic carbocation This carbocation is comparatively stable In this case electron donation is a resonance effect Three additional resonance structures can be drawn for this carbocation in which the positive charge is located on one of three aromatic carbons The positive charge is not isolated on the benzylic carbon rather it is delocalized around the aromatic structure this delocalization of charge results in significant stabilization As a result benzylic and allylic carbocations where the positively charged carbon is conjugated to one or more nonaromatic double bonds are significantly more stable than even tertiary alkyl carbocations Because heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen are more electronegative than carbon you might expect that they would by definition be electron withdrawing groups that destabilize carbocations In fact the opposite is often true if the oxygen or nitrogen atom is in the correct position the overall effect is carbocation stabilization This is due to the fact that although these heteroatoms are electron withdrawing groups by induction they are electron donating groups by resonance and it is this resonance effect which is more powerful We previously encountered this same idea when considering the relative acidity and basicity of phenols and aromatic amines in section Consider the two pairs of carbocation species below In the more stable carbocations the heteroatom acts as an electron donating group by resonance in effect the lone pair on the heteroatom is available to delocalize the positive charge In the less stable carbocations the positivelycharged carbon is more than one bond away from the heteroatom and thus no resonance effects are possible In fact in these carbocation species the heteroatoms actually destabilize the positive charge because they are electron withdrawing by induction Finally vinylic carbocations in which the positive charge resides on a doublebonded carbon are very unstable and thus unlikely to form as intermediates in any reaction Carbocation Rearrangements Carbocations typically undergo rearrangement reactions from less stable structures to equally stable or more stable ones with rate constants in excess of sec This fact complicates synthetic pathways to many compounds so it is important to look for carbocation rearrangements anytime they are formed It is possible for either a neighboring hydrogen atom or methyl group to shift to the carbocation to create a more stable intermediate In the hydride shift shown below the secondary carbocatin rearranges to a more stable tertiary carbocation The numbers refer to the vicinal location of the rearrangement not the nomenclature numbers In this next example the methyl group shifts to stabilize the carbocation Exercise In which of the structures below is the carbocation expected to be more stable Explain Draw a resonance structure of the crystal violet cation in which the positive charge is delocalized to one of the nitrogen atoms State which carbocation in each pair below is more stable or if they are expected to be approximately equal Explain your reasoning Answer In the carbocation on the left the positive charge is located in a position relative to the nitrogen such that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen can be donated to fill the empty orbital This is not possible for the carbocation species on the right a tertiary vs secondary carbocation b equal c tertiary vs secondary carbocation d positive charge is further from electronwithdrawing fluorine e lone pair on nitrogen can donate electrons by resonance f allylic carbocation positive charge can be delocalized to a second carbon History The history of carbocations dates back to when G Merling reported that he added bromine to tropylidene cycloheptatriene and then heated the product to obtain a crystalline watersoluble material He did not suggest a structure for it however Doering and Knox convincingly showed that it was tropylium cycloheptatrienylium bromide This ion is predicted to be aromatic by Hückels rule In Norris and Kehrman independently discovered that colorless triphenylmethanol gives deepyellow solutions in concentrated sulfuric acid Triphenylmethyl chloride similarly formed orange complexes with aluminium and tin chlorides In Adolf von Baeyer recognized the saltlike character of the compounds formed He dubbed the relationship between color and salt formation halochromy of which malachite green is a prime example Carbocations are reactive intermediates in many organic reactions This idea first proposed by Julius Stieglitz in was further developed by Hans Meerwein in his study of the WagnerMeerwein rearrangement Carbocations were also found to be involved in the reaction the E reaction and in rearrangement reactions such as the Whitmore shift The chemical establishment was reluctant to accept the notion of a carbocation and for a long time the Journal of the American Chemical Society refused articles that mentioned them The first NMR spectrum of a stable carbocation in solution was published by Doering et al in It was the heptamethylbenzenium ion made by treating hexamethylbenzene with methyl chloride and aluminium chloride The stable norbornadienyl cation was prepared by Story et al in by reacting norbornadienyl chloride with silver tetrafluoroborate in sulfur dioxide at C The NMR spectrum established that it was nonclassically bridged the first stable nonclassical ion observed In Olah directly observed the tertbutyl carbocation by nuclear magnetic resonance as a stable species on dissolving tertbutyl fluoride in magic acid The NMR of the norbornyl cation was first reported by Schleyer et al and it was shown to undergo protonscrambling over a barrier by Saunders et al References Hansjörg Grützmacher Christina M Marchand Heteroatom stabilized carbenium ions Coordination Chemistry Reviews volume pages doiSX Gold Book definition carbonium ion HTML George A Olah
