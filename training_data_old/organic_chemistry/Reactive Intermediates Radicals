free radicals Radicals In chemistry a radical more precisely a free radical is an atom molecule or ion that has unpaired valence electrons or an open electron shell and therefore may be seen as having one or more dangling covalent bonds With some exceptions these dangling bonds make free radicals highly chemically reactive towards other substances or even towards themselves their molecules will often spontaneously dimerize or polymerize if they come in contact with each other Most radicals are reasonably stable only at very low concentrations in inert media or in a vacuum A notable example of a free radical is the hydroxyl radical HO a molecule that is one hydrogen atom short of a water molecule and thus has one bond dangling from the oxygen Two other examples are the carbene molecule CH which has two dangling bonds and the superoxide anion O the oxygen molecule O with one extra electron which has one dangling bond In contrast the hydroxyl anion HO the oxide anion O and thecarbenium cation CH are not radicals since the bonds that may appear to be dangling are in fact resolved by the addition or removal of electrons Free radicals may be created in a number of ways including synthesis with very dilute or rarefied reagents reactions at very low temperatures or breakup of larger molecules The latter can be affected by any process that puts enough energy into the parent molecule such as ionizing radiation heat electrical discharges electrolysis and chemical reactions Indeed radicals are intermediate stages in many chemical reactions Free radicals play an important role in combustion atmospheric chemistry polymerization plasma chemistry biochemistry and many other chemical processes In living organisms the free radicals superoxide and nitric oxideand their reaction products regulate many processes such as control of vascular tone and thus blood pressure They also play a key role in the intermediary metabolism of various biological compounds Such radicals can even be messengers in a process dubbed redox signaling A radical may be trapped within a solvent cage or be otherwise bound Until late in the th century the word radical was used in chemistry to indicate any connected group of atoms such as a methyl group or a carboxyl whether it was part of a larger molecule or a molecule on its own The qualifier free was then needed to specify the unbound case Following recent nomenclature revisions a part of a larger molecule is now called a functional group or substituent and radical now implies free However the old nomenclature may still occur in the literature Formation The formation of radicals may involve breaking of covalent bonds homolytically a process that requires significant amounts of energy For example splitting H into H has a ΔH of kJmol and Cl into Cl has a ΔH of kJmol This is known as the homolytic bond dissociation energy and is usually abbreviated as the symbol ΔH The bond energy between two covalently bonded atoms is affected by the structure of the molecule as a whole not just the identity of the two atoms Likewise radicals requiring more energy to form are less stable than those requiring less energy Homolytic bond cleavage most often happens between two atoms of similar electronegativity In organic chemistry this is often the OO bond in peroxide species or ON bonds Sometimes radical formation is spinforbidden presenting an additional barrier However propagation is a very exothermic reaction Likewise although radical ions do exist most species are electrically neutral Radicals may also be formed by single electron oxidation or reduction of an atom or molecule An example is the production of superoxide by the electron transport chain Early studies of organometallic chemistry especially tetraalkyl lead species by FA Paneth and K Hahnfeld in the s supported heterolytic fission of bonds and a radical based mechanism Depiction in chemical reactions In chemical equations free radicals are frequently denoted by a dot placed immediately to the right of the atomic symbol or molecular formula as follows Chlorine gas can be broken down by ultraviolet light to form atomic chlorine radicals Radical reaction mechanisms use singleheaded arrows to depict the movement of single electrons The homolytic cleavage of the breaking bond is drawn with a fishhook arrow to distinguish from the usual movement of two electrons depicted by a standard curly arrow It should be noted that the second electron of the breaking bond also moves to pair up with the attacking radical electron this is not explicitly indicated in this case Relative Stability Radical alkyl intermediates are stabilized by similar physical processes to carbocations as a general rule the more substituted the radical center is the more stable it is This directs their reactions Thus formation of a tertiary radical RC is favored over secondary RHC which is favored over primary RHC Likewise radicals next to functional groups such as carbonyl nitrile and ether are more stable than tertiary alkyl radicals Exercise State which carbon radical free radical in each pair below is more stable or if they are expected to have comparable stability Explain your reasoning Answer a Cpd Tertiary radicals are more stable than secondary radicals b Cpds and are both secondary so they have comparable stability c

tertiary radicals
