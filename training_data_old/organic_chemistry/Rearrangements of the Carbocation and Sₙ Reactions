Learning Objective predict carbocation rearrangements in st order reactions Whenever reactants like alkyl halides form carbocations the carbocations are subject to a phenomenon known as carbocation rearrangement A carbocation is highly reactive and holds the positive charge on carbon with a sextet rather than an octet There are two types of rearrangements hydride shift and alkyl shift Rearrangements occur to create more stable carbocations Reviewing carbocation stability from chapter is helpful in identifying carbocations that can undergo rearrangement Once rearranged the molecules can also undergo further unimolecular substitution SN or unimolecular elimination E Nucleophilic reactions often produce two products a major product and a minor product The major product is typically the rearranged product that is more substituted aka more stable The minor product in contract is typically the normal product that is less substituted aka less stable Similarly we will see in subsequent sections of this chapter that for the unimolecular elimination reaction a more substituted alkene can form through carbocation rearrangements stay tuned for coming attractions Hydride Shift The hydride shift can also be called the Hydride Shift because rearrangements primarily occur between adjacent carbon atoms The are communicating that the carbons are vicinal adjacent These numbers have nothing to do with the nomenclature of the reactant We can see the phenomenon of hydride shift in solvolysis SN reactions like the example below As shown in the following mechanism the polarized carbonchlorine bonds is heterolytically broken to produce a chloride ion and carbocation The secondary carbocation undergoes a hydride shift to produce the more stable tertiary carbocation The oxygen of a water molecule acts as the nucleophile and reacts with the carbocation to form a protonated alcohol The intermediate is deprotonated to form the final product an alcohol The mechanism for hydride shift occurs in multiple steps that includes various intermediates and transition states Exercise Draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction Answer Alkyl Shift Not all carbocations have suitable hydrogen atoms either secondary or tertiary that are on adjacent carbon atoms available for rearrangement In this case the reaction can undergo a different mode of rearrangement known as alkyl shift or alkyl group migration Alkyl Shift acts very similarily to that of hydride shift Instead of the proton H that shifts with the nucleophile we see an alkyl group that shifts with the nucleophile instead The shifting group carries its electron pair with it to furnish a bond to the neighboring or adjacent carbocation The shifted alkyl group and the positive charge of the carbocation switch positions on the molecule Exercise Draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction Answer Alkyl Halide Classification and Carbocation Rearrangements Reactions of tertiary carbocations react much faster than that of secondary carbocations and will form the major product almost exclusively Alkyl shifts from a secondary carbocation to tertiary carbocation in SN reactions occur by independent steps When the alkyl halide is primary then slight variations and differences between the two reaction mechanisms In reaction we see that we have a secondary substrate This undergoes alkyl shift because it does not have a suitable hydrogen on the adjacent carbon Once again the reaction is similar to hydride shift The only difference is that we shift an alkyl group rather than shift a proton while still undergoing various intermediate steps to furnish its final product With reaction on the other hand we can say that it undergoes a concerted mechanism In short this means that everything happens in one step This is because primary carbocations cannot be an intermediate and they are relatively difficult processes since they require higher temperatures and longer reaction times After protonating the alcohol substrate to form the alkyloxonium ion the water must leave at the same time as the alkyl group shifts from the adjacent carbon to skip the formation of the unstable primary carbocation Exercise Draw the bondline structure for the major solvolysis product of each reaction Answer Hydride and Greater Shifts Typically hydride shifts can occur at low temperatures However by heating the solutionf of a cation it can easily and readily speed the process of rearrangement One way to account for a slight barrier is to propose a hydride shift interchanging the functionality of two different kinds of methyls Another possibility is hydride shift in which you could yield a secondary carbocation intermediate Then a further hydride shift would give the more stable rearranged tertiary cation More distant hydride shifts have been observed such as and hydride shifts but these arrangements are too fast to undergo secondary cation intermediates Analogy Carbocation rearrangements happen very readily and often occur in many organic chemistry reactions Yet we typically neglect this step Dr Sarah Lievens a Chemistry professor at the University of California Davis once said carbocation rearrangements can be observed with various analogies to help her students remember this phenomenon For hydride shifts The new friend nucleophile just joined a group the organic molecule Because he is new he only made two new friends However the popular kid the hydrogen glady gave up his friends to the new friend so that he could have even more friends Therefore everyone wont be as lonely and we can all be friends This analogy works for alkyl shifts in conjunction with hydride shift as well References Vogel
