hydrogenation reduction of alkenes Introduction Addition of hydrogen to a carboncarbon double bond to form an alkane is a reduction reaction that is also called catalytic hydrogenation Hydrogenation of a double bond is a thermodynamically favorable reaction because it forms a more stable lower energy product In other words the energy of the product is lower than the energy of the reactant thus it is exothermic heat is released The heat released is called the heat of hydrogenation which is an indicator of a molecules stability Regioselectivity is not an issue because the same group a hydrogen atom is bonded to each of the vinyl carbons The simplest source of two hydrogen atoms is molecular hydrogen H but mixing alkenes with hydrogen does not result in any discernible reaction Although the overall hydrogenation reaction is exothermic a high activation energy prevents it from taking place under normal conditions This restriction may be circumvented by the use of a catalyst as shown in the reactions below The Ochem View of Oxidation and Reduction For inorganic chemistry the flow of electrons is easily counted with the change in oxidation numbers of the metals and nonmetals The expressions LEO says GER for Loss of Electrons is Oxidation and Gain of Electrons is Reduction or OIL RIG for Oxidation Is Loss and Reduction Is Gain can be useful guides to recognizing oxidation and reduction reactions for inorganic chemistry However for organic chemistry most of the reactants and products are neutral so the electron flow is more difficult to track For organic compounds oxidation and reduction reactions can be recognized at least three different ways Oxidation is an increase in the number of carbon to oxygen bonds or a decrease in the number of carbon to hydrogen bonds Reduction is the opposite of oxidation so it is a decrease in the number of carbon to oxygen bonds or an increase in the number of carbon to hydrogen bonds For reactions that do not involve a change in the bonding of carbon with oxygen and hydrogen then we need to look at the differences in electronegativity The shared electrons are assigned to the more electronegative element to determine the oxidation numbers The Catalyst The reaction between hydrogen H gas and an alkene a carboncarbon double bond requires an active metal catalyst A catalyst increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy of the reaction Although the catalyst is not consumed in the reaction it is required to accelerate the reaction sufficiently to be observed in a reasonable amount of time Catalysts commonly used in alkene hydrogenation are platinum palladium and nickel The metal catalyst acts as a surface on which the reaction takes place This increases the rate by putting the reactants in close proximity to each other facilitating interactions between them With this catalyst present the sigma bond of H breaks and the two hydrogen atoms instead bind to the metal see in the figure below The bond of the alkene weakens as it also interacts with the metal as shown in step of the diagram below Since both the reactants are bound to the metal catalyst the hydrogen atoms can easily add one at a time to the previously doublebonded carbons as shown in steps and above The position of both of the reactants bound to the catalyst makes it so the hydrogen atoms are only exposed to one side of the alkene This explains why the hydrogen atoms add to same side of the molecule called synaddition Alkene Stability and Catalytic Hydrogenation As shown in the reaction energy diagram below the hydrogenation of alkenes is exothermic and heat is released corresponding to the ΔE colored green This heat of reaction can be used to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of alkenes having different numbers of alkyl substituents on the double bond For example the following table lists the heats of hydrogenation for three CH alkenes which give the same alkane product methylbutane Since a large heat of reaction indicates a high energy reactant these heats are inversely proportional to the stabilities of the alkene isomers To a rough approximation we see that each alkyl substituent on a double bond stabilizes this functional group by a bit more than kcalmole Alkene Isomer CHCHCHCH methylbutene CHCCHCHCH methylbutene CHCCHCH methylbutene Heat of Reaction ΔHº kcalmole kcalmole kcalmole Stereochemistry of Catalytic Hydrogenation From the mechanism shown below we expect the addition of hydrogen to occur with synstereoselectivity since both reactants approach the same side of the catalysts surface For example dimethylcyclopentene is reduced to dimethylcyclopentane during catalytic hydrogenation Exercises Use the catalytic hydrogenation of ethene with platinum oxide to answer
