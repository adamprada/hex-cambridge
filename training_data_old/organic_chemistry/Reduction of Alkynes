to alkanes and cis alkenes identify the reagent and catalyst required to produce a given alkane or cis alkene from a given alkyne identify the product formed from the reaction of a given alkyne with hydrogen and a specified catalyst identify the alkyne that must be used to produce a given alkane or cis alkene by catalytic hydrogenation write the equation for the reduction of an alkyne with an alkali metal and liquid ammonia predict the structure of the product formed when a given alkyne is reduced with an alkali metal and liquid ammonia identify the alkyne that must be used to produce a given alkene by reduction with an alkali metal and ammonia Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below anion radical Lindlar catalyst Study Notes The Lindlar catalyst allows a chemist to reduce a triple bond in the presence of a double bond Thus but Reactions between alkynes and catalysts are a common source of alkene formation Because alkynes differ from alkenes on account of their two procurable π bonds alkynes are more susceptible to additions Aside from turning them into alkenes these catalysts affect the arrangement of substituents on the newly formed alkene molecule Depending on which catalyst is used the catalysts cause anti or synaddition of hydrogens Alkynes can readily undergo additions because of their availability of two π bonds Hydrogenation of Alkynes Alkynes can be fully hydrogenated into alkanes with the help of a platinum catalyst However the use of two other catalysts can be used to hydrogenate alkynes to alkanes These catalysts are Palladium dispersed on carbon PdC and finely dispersed nickel RaneyNi Hydrogenation of an Alkyne to a ZAlkene cisalkene Because hydrogenation is an interruptible process involving a series of steps hydrogenation can be stopped using modified catalysts eg Lindlars Catalyst at the transitional alkene stage Lindars catalyst has three components PalladiumCalcium Carbonate lead acetate and quinoline The quinoline serves to prevent complete hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane Lindlars Catalyst transforms an alkyne to a cisalkene Lindlars Catalyst Like alkenes alkynes readily undergo catalytic hydrogenation either to cis or trans alkenes or to alkanes depending on the reaction employed The catalytic addition of hydrogen to butyne provides heat of reaction data that reflect the relative thermodynamic stabilities of these hydrocarbons as shown above From the heats of hydrogenation shown in blue in units of kcalmole it would appear that alkynes are thermodynamically less stable than alkenes to a greater degree than alkenes are less stable than alkanes The standard bond energies for carboncarbon bonds confirm this conclusion Thus a double bond is stronger than a single bond but not twice as strong The difference kcalmole may be regarded as the strength of the πbond component Similarly a triple bond is stronger than a double bond but not stronger Here the difference kcalmole may be taken as the strength of the second πbond The kcalmole weakening of this second πbond is reflected in the heat of hydrogenation numbers Since alkynes are thermodynamically less stable than alkenes we might expect addition reactions of the former to be more exothermic and relatively faster than equivalent reactions of the latter In the case of catalytic hydrogenation the usual Pt and Pd hydrogenation catalysts are so effective in promoting addition of hydrogen to both double and triple carboncarbon bonds that the alkene intermediate formed by hydrogen addition to an alkyne cannot be isolated A less efficient catalyst Lindlars catalyst prepared by deactivating or poisoning a conventional palladium catalyst by treating it with lead acetate and quinoline permits alkynes to be converted to alkenes without further reduction to an alkane Hydrogenation of an Alkyne to a EAlkene transalkene Alkynes can be reduced to transalkenes with the use of sodium dissolved in an ammonia solvent An Na radical donates an electron to one of the P bonds in a carboncarbon triple bond This forms an anion which can be protonated by a hydrogen in an ammonia solvent This prompts another Na radical to donate an electron to the second P orbital Soon after this anion is also protonated by a hydrogen from the ammonia solvent resulting in a transalkene RCCR Na
