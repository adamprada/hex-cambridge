you should be able to draw resonance forms for molecules and ions Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below resonance form delocalization Resonance Delocalization Sometimes even when formal charges are considered the bonding in some molecules or ions cannot be described by a single Lewis structure Resonance is a way of describing delocalized electrons within certain molecules or polyatomic ions where the bonding cannot be expressed by a single Lewis formula A molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures also called resonance contributors or canonical forms Resonance contributors involve the imaginary movement of pibonded electrons or of lonepair electrons that are adjacent to pi bonds Note sigma bonds cannot be broken during resonance if you show a sigma bond forming or breaking you are showing a chemical reaction taking place Likewise the positions of atoms in the molecule cannot change between resonance contributors When looking at the structure of the molecule formate we see that there are two equivalent structures possible Which one is correct There are two simple answers to this question both and neither one Both ways of drawing the molecule are equally acceptable approximations of the bonding picture for the molecule but neither one by itself is an accurate picture of the delocalized pi bonds The two alternative drawings however when considered together give a much more accurate picture than either one on its own This is because they imply together that the carboncarbon bonds are not double bonds not single bonds but about halfway in between When it is possible to draw more than one valid structure for a compound or ion we have identified resonance contributors two or more different Lewis structures depicting the same molecule or ion that when considered together do a better job of approximating delocalized pibonding than any single structure By convention resonance contributors are linked by a doubleheaded arrow and are sometimes enclosed by brackets The depiction of formate using the two resonance contributors A and B in the figure above does not imply that the molecule at one moment looks like structure A then at the next moment shifts to look like structure B Rather at all moments the molecule is a combination or resonance hybrid of both A and B Each individual resonance contributor of the formate ion is drawn with one carbonoxygen double bond pm and one carbonoxygen single bond pm with a negative formal charge located on the singlebonded oxygen However the two carbonoxygen bonds in formate are actually the same length pm which implies that neither resonance contributor is correct Although there is an overall negative formal charge on the formate ion it is shared equally between the two oxygens Therefore the formate ion can be more accurately depicted by a pair of resonance contributors Alternatively a single structure can be used with a dashed line depicting the resonancedelocalized pi bond and the negative charge located in between the two oxygens The electrostatic potential map of formate shows that there is an equal amount of electron density shown in red around each oxygen Valence bond theory can be used to develop a picture of the bonding in a carboxylate group We know that the carbon must be sphybridized the bond angles are close to and the molecule is planar and we will treat both oxygens as being sphybridized as well Both carbonoxygen sigma bonds then are formed from the overlap of carbon sp orbitals and oxygen sp orbitals In addition the carbon and both oxygens each have an unhybridized pz orbital situated perpendicular to the plane of the sigma bonds These three pz orbitals are parallel to each other and can overlap in a sidebyside fashion to form a delocalized pi bond Overall the situation is one of three parallel overlapping pz orbitals sharing four delocalized pi electrons Because there is one more electron than there are pz orbitals the system has an overall charge of Resonance contributors are used to approximate overlapping pz orbitals and delocalized pi electrons Molecules with resonance are usually drawn showing only one resonance contributor for the sake of simplicity However identifying molecules with resonance is an important skill in organic chemistry This example shows an important exception to the general rules for determining the hybridization of an atom The oxygen with the negative charge appears to be sp hybridized because it is surrounded by four electron groups However this representation of the oxygen atom is not correct because it is actually part of a resonance hybrid A pair of lone pair of electrons on the negatively charged oxygen are not localized in an sp orbital rather they are delocalized as part of a conjugated pi system The stability gained though resonance is enough to cause the expected sp to become sp The sp hybridization gives the oxygen a p orbital allowing it to participate in conjugation As a general rule sp hybridized atoms with lone pair electrons tend to become sp hybridized when adjacent to a conjugated system Example Carbonate CO Like formate the electronic structure of the carbonate ion cannot be described by a single Lewis electron structure Unlike O though the Lewis structures describing CO has three equivalent representations Because carbon is the least electronegative element we place it in the central position Carbon has valence electrons each oxygen has valence electrons and there are more for the charge This gives valence electrons Six electrons are used to form three bonding pairs between the oxygen atoms and the carbon We divide the remaining electrons equally among the three oxygen atoms by placing three lone pairs on each and indicating the charge There are no electrons left for the central atom At this point the carbon atom has only valence electrons so we must take one lone pair from an oxygen and use it to form a carbonoxygen double bond In this case however there are three possible choices As with formate none of these structures describes the bonding exactly Each predicts one carbonoxygen double bond and two carbonoxygen single bonds but experimentally all CO bond lengths are identical We can write resonance structures in this case three of them for the carbonate ion As the case for formate the actual structure involves the formation of a molecular orbital from pz orbitals centered on each atom and sitting above and below the plane of the CO ion Example Benzene is a common organic solvent that was previously used in gasoline it is no longer used for this purpose however because it is now known to be a carcinogen The benzene molecule CH consists of a regular hexagon of carbon atoms each of which is also bonded to a hydrogen atom Use resonance structures to describe the bonding in benzene Given molecular formula and molecular geometry Asked for resonance structures Strategy A Draw a structure for benzene illustrating the bonded atoms Then calculate the number of valence electrons used in this drawing B Subtract this number from the total number of valence electrons in benzene and then locate the remaining electrons such that each atom in the structure reaches an octet C Draw the resonance structures for benzene Solution A Each hydrogen atom contributes valence electron and each carbon atom contributes valence electrons for a total of valence electrons If we place a single bonding electron pair between each pair of carbon atoms and between each carbon and a hydrogen atom we obtain the following Each carbon atom in this structure has only electrons and has a formal charge of but we have used only of the valence electrons B If the remaining electrons are uniformly distributed pairwise on alternate carbon atoms we obtain the following Three carbon atoms now have an octet configuration and a formal charge of while three carbon atoms have only electrons and a formal charge of We can convert each lone pair to a bonding electron pair which gives each atom an octet of electrons and a formal charge of by making three CC double bonds C There are however two ways to do this Each structure has alternating double and single bonds but experimentation shows that each carboncarbon bond in benzene is identical with bond lengths pm intermediate between those typically found for a CC single bond pm and a CC double bond pm We can describe the bonding in benzene using the two resonance structures but the actual electronic structure is an average of the two The existence of multiple resonance structures for aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene is often indicated by drawing either a circle or dashed lines inside the hexagon This combination of p orbitals for benzene can be visualized as a ring with a node in the plane of the carbon atoms As can be seen in an electrostatic potential map of benzene the electrons are distributed symmetrically around the ring Exercise The sodium salt of nitrite is used to relieve muscle spasms Draw two resonance structures

Springfield Extra example A molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures also called resonance structures or canonical forms Such is the case for ozone O an allotrope of oxygen with a Vshaped structure and an OOO angle of O We know that ozone has a Vshaped structure so one O atom is central Each O atom has valence electrons for a total of valence electrons Assigning one bonding pair of electrons to each oxygenoxygen bond gives with electrons left over If we place three lone pairs of electrons on each terminal oxygen we obtain and have electrons left over At this point both terminal oxygen atoms have octets of electrons We therefore place the last electrons on the central atom The central oxygen has only electrons We must convert one lone pair on a terminal oxygen atom to a bonding pair of electronsbut which one Depending on which one we choose we obtain either Which is correct In fact neither is correct Both predict one OO single bond and one OO double bond If the bonds were of different types one single and one double for example they would have different lengths It turns out however that both OO bond distances are identical pm which is shorter than a typical OO single bond pm and longer than the OO double bond in O pm Equivalent Lewis dot structures such as those of ozone are called resonance structures The position of the atoms is the same in the various resonance structures of a compound but the position of the electrons is different Doubleheaded arrows link the different resonance structures of a compound Before the development of quantum chemistry it was thought that the doubleheaded arrow indicates that the actual electronic structure is an average of those shown or that the molecule oscillates between the two structures Today we know that the electrons involved in the double bonds occupy an orbital that extends over all three oxygen molecules combining p orbitals on all three

centered pz orbitals Similar molecular orbitals are found in every resonance structure
