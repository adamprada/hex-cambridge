means of a suitable example the limitations of the terms cis and trans in naming isomeric alkenes use the EZ designation to describe the geometry of a given alkene structure incorporate the EZ designation into the IUPAC name of a given alkene draw the correct Kekul√© condensed or shorthand structure of an alkene given its EZ designation plus other necessary information eg molecular formula IUPAC name Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below sequence rules CahnIngoldPrelog rules Study Notes The limitations of the cistrans system are illustrated in the examples given below From your study of the IUPAC system you should be able to identify this compound as ethylmethylheptene but is it cis or trans At first you might say cis because it appears that two ethyl groups appear on the same side of the double bond However the correct answer is trans The rule is that the designation cis or trans must correspond to the configuration of the longest carbon chain Tracing out the sevencarbon chain in the compound shown above you change sides as you pass through the double bond So the full name for this compound is ethylmethyltransheptene The cistrans system breaks down completely in a compound such as that shown below The EZ system which is the subject of this section is designed to accommodate such situations In cases where two or more double bonds are present you must be prepared to assign an E or Z designation to each of the double bonds For example Another use for these sequence rules will be part of the discussion of optical isomerism in Section EZ nomenclature The traditional system for naming the geometric isomers of an alkene in which the same groups are arranged differently is to name them as cis or trans However it is easy to find examples where the cistrans system is not easily applied IUPAC has a more complete system for naming alkene isomers The RS system is based on a set of priority rules which allow you to rank any groups The rigorous IUPAC system for naming alkene isomers called the EZ system is based on the same priority rules Note The priority rules are often called the CahnIngoldPrelog CIP rules after the chemists who developed the system The general strategy of the EZ system is to analyze the two groups at each end of the double bond At each end rank the two groups using the CIP priority rules discussed in Ch Then see whether the higher priority group at one end of the double bond and the higher priority group at the other end of the double bond are on the same side Z from German zusammen together or on opposite sides E from German entgegen opposite of the double bond Example Butene The Figure above shows the two isomers of butene You should recognize them as cis and trans Lets analyze them to see whether they are E or Z Start with the left hand structure the cis isomer On C the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are C and H By the CIP priority rules C is higher priority than H higher atomic number Now look at C the right end of the double bond Similarly the atoms are C and H with C being higher priority We see that the higher priority group is down at C and down at C Since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together Therefore this is Zbutene Now look at the right hand structure the trans isomer In this case the priority group is down on the left end of the double bond and up on the right end of the double bond Since the two priority groups are on opposite sides of the double bond they are entgegen opposite Therefore this is Ebutene EZ will work even when cistrans fails In simple cases such as butene Z corresponds to cis and E to trans However that is not a rule This section and the following one illustrate some idiosyncrasies that happen when you try to compare the two systems The real advantage of the EZ system is that it will always work In contrast the cistrans system breaks down with many ambiguous cases Example The following figure shows two isomers of an alkene with four different groups on the double bond bromochlorofluoroiodoethene It should be apparent that the two structures shown are distinct chemicals However it is impossible to name them as cis or trans On the other hand the EZ system works fine Consider the left hand structure On C the left end of the double bond the two atoms attached to the double bond are Br and I By the CIP priority rules I is higher priority than Br higher atomic number Now look at C The atoms are Cl and F with Cl being higher priority We see that the higher priority group is down at C and down at C Since the two priority groups are both on the same side of the double bond down in this case they are zusammen together Therefore this is the Z isomer Similarly the right hand structure is E EZ will work but may not agree with cistrans Consider the molecule shown at the left This is bromobutene ignoring the geometric isomerism for now Cis or trans This molecule is clearly cis The two methyl groups are on the same side More rigorously the parent chain is cis E or Z There is a methyl at each end of the double bond On the left the methyl is the high priority group because the other group is H On the right the methyl is the low priority group because the other group is Br That is the high priority groups are CH left and Br right Thus the two priority groups are on opposite sides entgegen E Note This example should convince you that cis and Z are not synonyms Cistrans and EZ are determined by distinct criteria There may seem to be a simple correspondence but it is not a rule Be sure to determine cistrans or EZ separately as needed Multiple double bonds If the compound contains more than one double bond then each one is analyzed and declared to be E or Z Example The configuration at the left hand double bond is E at the right hand double bond it is Z Thus this compound is EZdichlorohexadiene The doublebond rule in determining priorities Example Consider the compound below This is chloroethylbutadiene ignoring for the moment the geometric isomerism There is no geometric isomerism at the second double bond at because it has H at its far end What about the first double bond at On the left hand end there is H and Cl Cl is higher priority by atomic number On the right hand end there is CHCH an ethyl group and CHCH a vinyl or ethenyl group Both of these groups have C as the first atom so we have a tie so far and must look further What is attached to this first C For the ethyl group the first C is attached to C H and H For the ethenyl group the first C is attached to a C twice so we count it twice therefore that C is attached to C C H CCH is higher than CHH therefore the ethenyl group is higher priority Since the priority groups Cl and ethenyl are on the same side of the double bond this is the Zisomer the compound is Zchloroethylbutadiene The first point of difference rule Which is higher priority by the CIP rules a C with an O and H attached to it or a C with three C The first C has one atom of high priority but also two atoms of low priority How do these balance out Answering this requires a clear understanding of how the ranking is done The simple answer is that the first point of difference is what matters the O wins To illustrate this consider the molecule at the left Is the double bond here E or Z At the left end of the double bond Br C But the right end of the double bond requires a careful analysis At the right hand end the first atom attached to the double bond is a C at each position A tie so we look at what is attached to this first C For the upper C it is CCC since the triple bond counts three times For the lower C it is OHH listed in order from high priority atom to low OHH is higher priority than CCC because of the first atom in the list That is the O of the lower group beats the C of the upper group In other words the O is the highest priority atom of any in this comparison thus the O wins Therefore the high priority groups are up on the left end the Br and down on the right end the CHOCH This means that the isomer shown is opposite entgegen E And what is the name The name feature of ChemSketch says it is Ebromoethylidenepentynyl methyl ether Example The configuration about double bonds is undoubtedly best specified by the cistrans notation when there is no ambiguity involved Unfortunately many compounds cannot be described adequately by the cistrans system Consider for example configurational isomers of fluoro chloro bromoiodoethene and There is no obvious way in which the cistrans system can be used A system that is easy to use and which is based on the sequence rules already described for the RS system works as follows An order of precedence is established for the two atoms or groups attached to each end of the double bond according to the sequence rules of Section When these rules are applied to fluoro chlorobromo iodoethene the priority sequence is at carbon atom C F at carbon atom I Br Examination of the two configurations shows that the two priority groups one on each end are either on the same side of the double bond or on opposite sides The Z isomer is designated as the isomer in which the top priority groups are on the same side Z is taken from the German word zusammen together The E isomer has these groups on opposite sides E German for entgegen across Two further examples show how the nomenclature is used Exercises
