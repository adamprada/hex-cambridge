ProblemsSolutionsOutside linksReferencesExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objectives After completing this section you should be able to assign CahnIngoldPrelog priorities to a given set of substituents determine whether a given wedgeandbrokenline structure corresponds to an R or an S configuration with or without the aid of molecular models draw the wedgeandbrokenline structure for a compound given its IUPAC name complete with R or S designation construct a stereochemically accurate model of a given enantiomer from either a wedgeandbrokenline structure or the IUPAC name of the compound complete with R or S designation Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below absolute configuration R configuration S configuration Study Notes When designating a structure as R or S you must ensure that the atom or group with the lowest priority is pointing away from you the observer The easiest way to show this is to use the wedgeandbrokenline representation You can then immediately determine whether you are observing an R configuration or an S configuration To name the enantiomers of a compound unambiguously their names must include the handedness of the molecule The method for this is formally known as RS nomenclature Introduction The method of unambiguously assigning the handedness of molecules was originated by three chemists RS Cahn C Ingold and V Prelog and as such is also often called the CahnIngoldPrelog rules In addition to the CahnIngold system there are two ways of experimentally determining the absolute configuration of an enantiomer Xray diffraction analysis Note that there is no correlation between the sign of rotation and the structure of a particular enantiomer Chemical correlation with a molecule whose structure has already been determined via Xray diffraction However for nonlaboratory purposes it is beneficial to focus on the RS system The sign of optical rotation although different for the two enantiomers of a chiral moleculeat the same temperature cannot be used to establish the absolute configuration of an enantiomer this is because the sign of optical rotation for a particular enantiomer may change when the temperature changes Stereocenters are labeled R or S The right hand and left hand nomenclature is used to name the enantiomers of a chiral compound The stereocenters are labeled as R or S Consider the first picture a curved arrow is drawn from the highest priority substituent to the lowest priority substituent If the arrow points in a counterclockwise direction left when leaving the o clock position the configuration at stereocenter is considered S Sinister Latin left If however the arrow points clockwiseRight when leaving the o clock position then the stereocenter is labeled R Rectus Latin right The R or S is then added as a prefix in parenthesis to the name of the enantiomer of interest Example RBromobutane S Dihydroxypropanal Sequence rules to assign priorities to substituents Before applying the R and S nomenclature to a stereocenter the substituents must be prioritized according to the following rules Rule First examine at the atoms directly attached to the stereocenter of the compound A substituent with a higher atomic number takes precedence over a substituent with a lower atomic number Hydrogen is the lowest possible priority substituent because it has the lowest atomic number When dealing with isotopes the atom with the higher atomic mass receives higher priority When visualizing the molecule the lowest priority substituent should always point away from the viewer a dashed line indicates this To understand how this works or looks imagine that a clock and a pole Attach the pole to the back of the clock so that when when looking at the face of the clock the pole points away from the viewer in the same way the lowest priority substituent should point away Then draw an arrow from the highest priority atom to the nd highest priority atom to the rd highest priority atom Because the th highest priority atom is placed in the back the arrow should appear like it is going across the face of a clock If it is going clockwise then it is an Renantiomer If it is going counterclockwise it is an Senantiomer When looking at a problem with wedges and dashes if the lowest priority atom is not on the dashed line pointing away the molecule must be rotated Remember that Wedges indicate coming towards the viewer Dashes indicate pointing away from the viewer Rule If there are two substituents with equal rank proceed along the two substituent chains until there is a point of difference First determine which of the chains has the first connection to an atom with the highest priority the highest atomic number That chain has the higher priority If the chains are similar proceed down the chain until a point of difference For example an ethyl substituent takes priority over a methyl substituent At the connectivity of the stereocenter both have a carbon atom which are equal in rank Going down the chains a methyl has only has hydrogen atoms attached to it whereas the ethyl has another carbon atom The carbon atom on the ethyl is the first point of difference and has a higher atomic number than hydrogen therefore the ethyl takes priority over the methyl Rule If a chain is connected to the same kind of atom twice or three times check to see if the atom it is connected to has a greater atomic number than any of the atoms that the competing chain is connected to If none of the atoms connected to the competing chains at the same point has a greater atomic number the chain bonded to the same atom multiple times has the greater priority If however one of the atoms connected to the competing chain has a higher atomic number that chain has the higher priority Example A methylethyl substituent takes precedence over an ethyl substituent Connected to the first carbon atom ethyl only has one other carbon whereas the methylethyl has two carbon atoms attached to the first this is the first point of difference Therefore methylethyl ranks higher in priority than ethyl as shown below However Remember that being double or triple bonded to an atom means that the atom is connected to the same atom twice In such a case follow the same method as above Caution Keep in mind that priority is determined by the first point of difference along the two similar substituent chains After the first point of difference the rest of the chain is irrelevant When looking for the first point of difference on similar substituent chains one may encounter branching If there is branching choose the branch that is higher in priority If the two substituents have similar branches rank the elements within the branches until a point of difference After all your substituents have been prioritized in the correct manner you can now namelabel the molecule R or S Put the lowest priority substituent in the back dashed line Proceed from to to it is helpful to draw or imagine an arcing arrow that goes from Determine if the direction from to to clockwise or counterclockwise i If it is clockwise it is R ii if it is counterclockwise it is S USE YOUR MODELING KIT Models assist in visualizing the structure When using a model make sure the lowest priority is pointing away from you Then determine the direction from the highest priority substituent to the lowest clockwise R or counterclockwise S IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MODELING KIT remember that the dashes mean the bond is going into the screen and the wedges means that bond is coming out of the screen If the lowest priority bond is not pointing to the back mentally rotate it so that it is However it is very useful when learning organic chemistry to use models Problems Are the following R or S Solutions S I Br F H The lowest priority substituent H is already going towards the back It turns left going from I to Br to F so its a S R Br Cl CH H You have to switch the H and Br in order to place the H the lowest priority in the back Then going from Br to Cl CH is turning to the right giving you a R Neither R or S This molecule is achiral Only chiral molecules can be named R or S R OH CN CHNH H The H the lowest priority has to be switched to the back Then going from OH to CN to CHNH you are turning right giving you a R S Then going from to to you are turning left giving you a S configuration Outside links httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvEphUiPiQiCo httpenWikipediaorgwikiAbsolute_configuration References Schore and
