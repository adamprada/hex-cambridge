Single or MultipleWord Names Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions A troublesome point in naming chemical compounds concerns the rules governing when a compound is to be written as a single word as methylamine or as two or more words as methyl chloride To solve this problem you must determine whether the principle or parent function is an element or a compounds in its own right if it is either one then the name is written as a single word The following examples should help to clarify the system In each name the part of the name that denotes the parent compound is italicized However if the parent function cannot be constructed as being a real compound the name is correctly written as two or more words For example could be named as a chloride in which case we use two words methyl chloride to describe it A chloride or any halide is a class of compound not a specific compound To identify a specific halide the adjective that describes the halide is written as a separate word preceding the class name Examples follow in which the class name is italicized The parent compounds designated here as amine carbaldehyde and sulfonic acid are properly ammonia methanal and sulfurous acid when no substituent groups are attached These wordseparated names sometimes are called radicofunctional names Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
