Stereochemistry of Reactions Addition of Hâ‚‚O to a Chiral Alkene Last updated Save as PDF Page ID ExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to explain why the addition of HO to a chiral alkene leads to unequal amounts of diastereomeric products Study Notes In the previous section the addition of water to the achiral alkene produced a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric alcohols They are produced in equal amounts so the mixture is optically inactive What would occur if we carried out a similar reaction on a chiral alkene Consider Smethylpentene reacting with water acid catalyzed Proton addition produces a carbocation intermediate that is chiral denotes stereogenic centre That intermediate does not have a plane of symmetry and therefore attack by water is not equal from the top and bottom This ultimately produces R and S products in a non ratio Exercises Questions Q Predict the products of the following reaction showing stereochemistry Solutions S The products Markovnikov are diastereomers of one another Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University
