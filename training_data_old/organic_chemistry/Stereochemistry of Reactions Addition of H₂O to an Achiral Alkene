Stereochemistry of Reactions Addition of Hâ‚‚O to an Achiral Alkene Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to account for the stereochemistry of the product of the addition of water to an alkene in terms of the formation of a planar carbocation Study Notes Organic reactions in the laboratory or in living systems can produce chiral centres Consider reaction of butene with water acid catalyzed Markovnikov regiochemistry occurs and the OH adds to the second carbon However both R and S products occur giving a racemic mixture of butanol How does this occur The proton addition to butene results in a planar carbocation intermediate A molecule of water is then equally likely to attack from the top or the bottom of this cation to produce either Sbutanol or Rbutanol respectively Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University
