Stereochemistry of Reactions Hydration of Achiral Alkenes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Stereochemistry and the Subtle DetailsContributors and Attributions Learning Objective discern the stereochemical differences between the EAR of chiral and achiral alkenes Stereochemistry and the Subtle Details Organic reactions in the laboratory or in living systems can produce chiral centres Consider reaction of pentene with water acid catalyzed Markovnikov regiochemistry occurs and the OH adds to the second carbon However both R and S products occur giving a racemic mixture of butanol How does this occur The proton addition to pentene results in a planar carbocation intermediate A molecule of water is then equally likely to react from the top or the bottom of this cation to produce either Spentanol or Rpentanol respectively as shown in the mechanism below Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University
