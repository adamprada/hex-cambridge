Stereochemistry of Reactions Hydration of Chiral Alkenes Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Stereochemistry the Subtle DetailsContributors and Attributions Learning Objective discern the stereochemical differences between the EAR of chiral and achiral alkenes Stereochemistry the Subtle Details In the previous section the addition of water to the achiral alkene produced a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric alcohols They are produced in equal amounts so the mixture is optically inactive What would occur if we carried out a similar reaction on a chiral alkene Consider Smethylpentene reacting with water acid catalyzed Proton addition produces a carbocation intermediate that is chiral denotes stereogenic centre That intermediate does not have a plane of symmetry and therefore attack by water is not equal from the top and bottom This ultimately produces R and S products in a non ratio as shown in the mechanism below Exercise Predict the products of the following reaction showing stereochemistry Answer The products are diastereomers of one another Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University
