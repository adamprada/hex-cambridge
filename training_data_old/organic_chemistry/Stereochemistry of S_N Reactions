Stereochemistry of Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions When an reaction is carried out starting with a single pure enantiomer such as chlorobutane the product usually is a mixture of the enantiomeric substitution products with a slight predominance of that isomer which corresponds to inversion Theoretically a carbocation is expected to be most stable in the planar configuration Section E and hence should lead to exactly equal amounts of the two enantiomers regardless of the chiral configuration of the starting material Figure However the extent of configuration change that actually results in an reaction depends upon the degree of shielding of the front side of the reacting carbon by the leaving group and its associated solvent molecules If the leaving group does not get away from the carbocation before the productdetermining step takes place there will be some preference for nucleophilic attack at the back side of the carbon which results in a predominance of the product of inverted configuration Figure Representation of a planar carbocation with no leaving group closeby with a ballandstick model having and as different alkyl groups to show why the cation should react equally probably with or to give the right and lefthanded substitution products Other things being equal the amount of inversion decreases as the stability of the carbocation intermediate increases because the more stable the ion the longer is its lifetime and the more chance it has of getting away from the leaving anion and becoming a relatively free ion The solvent usually has a large influence on the stereochemical results of reactions because the stability and lifetime of the carbocations depend upon the nature of the solvent Section F An orbital picture of ionization leading to a racemic product may be drawn as follows It should be clear that complete racemization is unlikely to be observed if stays in close proximity to the side of the positive carbon that it originally departed from We can say that shields the front side thereby favoring a predominance of inversion If gets far away before comes in then there should be no favoritism for one or the other of the possible substitutions If and the carbocation stay in close proximity as is likely to be the case in a solvent that does not promote ionic dissociation then a more or less tight ion pair is formed Such ion pairs often play an important role in ionic reactions in solvents of low dielectric constant Section F Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
