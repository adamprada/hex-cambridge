Structural Formulas Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions The building block of structural organic chemistry is the tetravalent carbon atom With few exceptions carbon compounds can be formulated with four covalent bonds to each carbon regardless of whether the combination is with carbon or some other element The twoelectron bond which is illustrated by the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane or ethane and the carboncarbon bond in ethane is called a single bond In these and many related substances each carbon is attached to four other atoms There exist however compounds such as ethene ethylene in which two electrons from each of the carbon atoms are mutually shared thereby producing two twoelectron bonds an arrangement which is called a double bond Each carbon in ethene is attached to only three other atoms Similarly in ethyne acetylene three electrons from each carbon atom are mutually shared producing three twoelectron bonds called a triple bond in which each carbon is attached to only two other atoms Of course in all cases each carbon has a full octet of electrons Carbon also forms double and triple bonds with several other elements that can exhibit a covalence of two or three The carbonoxygen or carbonyl double bond appears in carbon dioxide and many important organic compounds such as methanal formaldehyde and ethanoic acid acetic acid Similarly a carbonnitrogen triple bond appears in methanenitrile hydrogen cyanide and ethanenitrile acetonitrile By convention a single straight line connecting the atomic symbols is used to represent a single twoelectron bond two such lines to represent a double fourelectron bond and three lines a triple sixelectron bond Representations of compounds by these symbols are called structural formulas some examples are A point worth noting is that structural formulas usually do not indicate the nonbonding electron pairs This is perhaps unfortunate because they play as much a part in the chemistry of organic molecules as do the bonding electrons and their omission may lead the unwary reader to overlook them However when it is important to represent them this can be done best with pairs of dots although a few authors use lines To save space and time in the representation of organic structures it is common practice to use condensed formulas in which the bonds are not shown explicitly In using condensed formulas normal atomic valences are understood throughout Examples of condensed formulas are Another type of abbreviation that often is used particularly for ring compounds dispenses with the symbols for carbon and hydrogen atoms and leaves only the lines in a structural formula For instance cyclopentane often is represented as a regular pentagon in which it is understood that each apex represents a carbon atom with the requisite number of hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of carbon Likewise cyclopropane cyclobutane and cyclohexane are drawn as regular polygons Although this type of line drawing is employed most commonly for cyclic structures its use for open chain acyclic structures is becoming increasingly widespread There is no special merit to this abbreviation for simple structures such as butane butene or butadiene but it is of value in representing more complex molecules such as carotene Line structures also can be modified to represent the threedimensional shapes of molecules and the way that this is done will be discussed in detail in Chapter At the onset of you study of organic chemistry you should write out the formulas rather completely until you are thoroughly familiar with what these abbreviations stand for Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
