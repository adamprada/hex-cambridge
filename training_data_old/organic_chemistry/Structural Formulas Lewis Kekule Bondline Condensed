Objective for organic chemistry in sections and Shorthand notations to represent organic molecules rely on our knowledge of common neutral bonding patterns Knowing these patterns we can fill in the missing structural information Some of these shorthand ways of drawing molecules give us insight into the bond angles and relative positions of atoms in the molecule while some notations eliminate the carbon and hydrogen atoms and only indicate the heteroatoms the atoms that are NOT carbon or hydrogen There are three primary methods to communicate chemical structure of organic molecules Kekule Lewis structures using lines to represent covalent bonds and showing all atoms and lone pair electrons Bondline Skeletlline shows bonds between carbon atoms and heteroatoms with lone pair electrons when requested Condensed all atoms are written to communicate structure without drawing any chemical bonds based on the carbon backbone Introduction Observe the following drawings of the structure of Retinol the most common form of vitamin A The first drawing follows the straightline aka Kekulé structure which is helpful when you want to look at every single atom however showing all of the hydrogen atoms makes it difficult to compare the overall structure with other similar molecules and makes it difficult to focus in on the double bonds and OH group Retinol Kekulé straightline drawing The following is a bondline aka zigzag formula for retinol With this simiplified representation one can easily see the carboncarbon bonds double bonds OH group and CH groups sticking off of the the main ring and chain Also it is much quicker to draw this than the one above You will learn to appreciate this type of formula writing after drawing a countless number of organic molecules Retinol Bondline or zigzag formula Importance of Structure Learning and practicing the basics of Organic Chemistry will help you immensely in the long run as you learn new concepts and reactions Some people say that Organic Chemistry is like another language and in some aspects it is At first it may seem difficult or overwhelming but the more you practice looking at and drawing organic molecules the more familiar you will become with the structures and formulas Another good idea is to get a model kit and physically make the molecules that you have trouble picturing in your head Through general chemistry you may have already experienced looking at molecular structure The different ways to draw organic molecules include Kekulé straightline Condensed Formulas and BondLine Formulas zigzag It will be more helpful if you become comfortable going from one style of drawing to another and look at drawings and understanding what they mean than knowing which kind of drawing is named what An example of a drawing that incorporates all three ways to draw organic molecules would be the following additional drawing of Retinol The majority of the drawing is Bondline zigzag formula but the CH are written as condensed formulas and the OH group is written in Kekulé form A widely used way of showing the D structure of molecules is the use of dashes wedges and straight lines This drawing method is essential because the placement of different atoms could yield different molecules even if the molecular formulas were exactly the same Below are two drawings of a carbon molecule with two chlorines and two bromines attached carbon molecule with chlorines and bromines carbon molecule with chlorines and bromines Both drawings look like they represent the same molecule however if we add dashes and wedged we will see that two different molecules could be depicted The two molecules above are different prove this to yourself by building a model An easier way to compare the two molecules is to rotate one of the bonds here it is the bond on the right Notice how the molecule on the right has both bromines on the same side and chlorines on the same side whereas the first molecule is different Read about DashedWedged Line structures bottom of page to understand what has been introduced above You will learn more about the importance of atomic connectivity in molecules as you continue on to learn about Stereochemistry Drawing the Structure of Organic Molecules Although larger molecules may look complicated they can be easily understood by breaking them down and looking at their smaller components All atoms want to have their valence shell full a closed shell Hydrogen wants to have e whereas carbon oxygen and nitrogen want to have e When looking at the different representations of molecules keep in mind the Octet Rule Also remember that hydrogen can bond one time oxygen can bond up to two times nitrogen can bond up to three times and carbon can bond up to four times Kekulé aka Lewis Structures Kekulé structures are similar to Lewis Structures but instead of covalent bonds being represented by electron dots the two shared electrons are shown by a line A BC Lone pairs remain as two electron dots or are sometimes left out even though they are still there Notice how the three lone pairs of electrons were not draw in around chlorine in example B Condensed Formulas A condensed formula is made up of the elemental symbols The order of the atoms suggests the connectivity Condensed formulas can be read from either direction and HC is the same as CH although the latter is more common because Look at the examples below and match them with their identical molecule under Kekulé structures and bondline formulas A CHCHOH B ClCHCHCHOCHCH C HCNHCHCOOH Lets look closely at example B As you go through a condensed formula you want to focus on the carbons and other elements that arent hydrogen The hydrogens are important but are usually there to complete octets Also notice the OCH is in written in parentheses which tell you that it not part of the main chain of carbons As you read through a a condensed formula if you reach an atom that doesnt have a complete octet by the time you reach the next hydrogen then its possible that there are double or triple bonds In example C the carbon is double bonded to oxygen and single bonded to another oxygen Notice how COOH means COOH instead of CHCOOH because carbon does not have a complete octet and oxygens BondLine aka zigzag Formulas The name gives away how this formula works This formula is full of bonds and lines and because of the typical more stable bonds that atoms tend to make in molecules they often end up looking like zigzag lines If you work with a molecular model kit you will find it difficult to make stick straight molecules unless they contain sp triple bonds whereas zigzag molecules and bonds are much more feasible A B C These molecules correspond to the exact same molecules depicted for Kekulé structures and condensed formulas Notice how the carbons are no longer drawn in and are replaced by the ends and bends of a lines In addition the hydrogens have been omitted but could be easily drawn in see practice problems Although we do not usually draw in the Hs that are bonded to carbon we do draw them in if they are connected to other atoms besides carbon example is the OH group above in example A This is done because it is not always clear if the noncarbon atom is surrounded by lone pairs or hydrogens Also in example A notice how the OH is drawn with a bond to the second carbon but it does not mean that there is a third carbon at the end of that bond line DashedWedged Line Structure As you may have guessed the DashedWedged Line structure is all about lines dashes and wedges At first it may seem confusing but with practice understanding dashwedged line structures will become like second nature The following are examples of each and how they can be used together Above are carbon chains with attached OH groups or Cl and Br atoms Remember that each line represents a bond and that the carbons and hydrogens have been omitted When you look at or draw these structures the straight lines illustrate atoms and bonds that are in the same plane the plane of the paper in this case computer screen Dashed lines show atoms and bonds that go into the page behind the plane away from you In the above example the OH group is going into the plane while at the same time a hydrogen comes out wedged Blue bead OH group White beadH Wedged lines illustrate bonds and atoms that come out of the page in front of the plane toward you In the D diagram above the OH group is coming out of the plane of the paper while a hydrogen goes in dashed Blue bead OH group White beadH As stated before straight lines illustrate atoms and bonds that are in the same plane as the paper but in the D example the straight line bond for OH means that it it unsure or irrelevant whether OH is going away or toward you It is also assumed that hydrogen is also connected to the same carbon that OH is on Blue bead OH group H is not shown Try using your model kit to see that the OH group cannot lie in the same plane at the carbon chain dont forget your hydrogens In the final Dexample both dashed and wedged lines are used because the attached atoms are not hydrogens although dashed and wedged lines can be used for hydrogensThe chlorine is coming out the page while bromine is going into the page Blue beadCl Red beadBr Example Converting between Structural Formulas Throughout the course it will be helpful to convert compounds into different structural formulas Kekule Lewis Structures Bondline and Condensed depending on the type of question that is asked Standardized exams frequently include a high percentage of condensed formulas because it is easier and cheaper to type letters and numbers than to import figures Initially it can be tricky writing a bondline structure directly from a condensed formula First write the Kekule structure from the condensed formula and then draw the bondline structure from the Kekule Practice will quickly allow you to convert directly between condensed and bondline structures The condensed formula for propanal is CHCHCHO Can you visualize the bondline structure of propanal If yes excellent If no the following practice will help The Kekule structure for propanal is shown below The bondline structure for propanal is shown below All three structures represent the same compound propanal Exercises How many

Attributions Choo Ezen UCD The building block of structural organic chemistry is the tetravalent carbon atom With few exceptions carbon compounds can be formulated with four covalent bonds to each carbon regardless of whether the combination is with carbon or some other element The twoelectron bond which is illustrated by the carbonhydrogen bonds in methane or ethane and the carboncarbon bond in ethane is called a single bond In these and many related substances each carbon is attached to four other atoms There exist however compounds such as ethene ethylene in which two electrons from each of the carbon atoms are mutually shared thereby producing two twoelectron bonds an arrangement which is called a double bond Each carbon in ethene is attached to only three other atoms Similarly in ethyne acetylene three electrons from each carbon atom are mutually shared producing three twoelectron bonds called a triple bond in which each carbon is attached to only two other atoms Of course in all cases each carbon has a full octet of electrons Carbon also forms double and triple bonds with several other elements that can exhibit a covalence of two or three The carbonoxygen or carbonyl double bond appears in carbon dioxide and many important organic compounds such as methanal formaldehyde and ethanoic acid acetic acid Similarly a carbonnitrogen triple bond appears in methanenitrile hydrogen cyanide and ethanenitrile acetonitrile By convention a single straight line connecting the atomic symbols is used to represent a single twoelectron bond two such lines to represent a double fourelectron bond and three lines a triple sixelectron bond Representations of compounds by these symbols are called structural formulas some examples are A point worth noting is that structural formulas usually do not indicate the nonbonding electron pairs This is perhaps unfortunate because they play as much a part in the chemistry of organic molecules as do the bonding electrons and their omission may lead the unwary reader to overlook them However when it is important to represent them this can be done best with pairs of dots although a few authors use lines To save space and time in the representation of organic structures it is common practice to use condensed formulas in which the bonds are not shown explicitly In using condensed formulas normal atomic valences are understood throughout Examples of condensed formulas are Another type of abbreviation that often is used particularly for ring compounds dispenses with the symbols for carbon and hydrogen atoms and leaves only the lines in a structural formula For instance cyclopentane often is represented as a regular pentagon in which it is understood that each apex represents a carbon atom with the requisite number of hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of carbon Likewise cyclopropane cyclobutane and cyclohexane are drawn as regular polygons Although this type of line drawing is employed most commonly for cyclic structures its use for open chain acyclic structures is becoming increasingly widespread There is no special merit to this abbreviation for simple structures such as butane butene or butadiene but it is of value in representing more complex molecules such as carotene Line structures also can be modified to represent the threedimensional shapes of molecules and the way that this is done will be discussed in detail in Chapter At the onset of you study of organic chemistry you should write out the formulas rather completely until you are thoroughly familiar with what these abbreviations stand
