The D L Convention for Designating Stereochemical Configurations Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions We pointed out in Chapter the importance of using systematic names for compounds such that the name uniquely describes the structure It is equally important to be able to unambiguously describe the configuration of a compound The convention that is used to designate the configurations of chiral carbons of naturally occurring compounds is called the system To use it we view the molecule of interest according to the following rules The main carbon chain is oriented vertically with the lowest numbered carbon at the top The numbering used for this purpose must follow the IUPAC rules Next the structure must be arranged at the particular chiral carbon whose configuration is to be assigned so the horizontal bonds to that carbon extend toward you and the vertical bonds extend away from you This arrangement will be seen to be precisely the same as the convention of projection formulas such as and Section C Now the relative positions of the substituents on the horizontal bonds at the chiral centers are examined If the main substituent is the left of the main chain the configuration is assigned if this substituent is on the right the configuration is assigned For example the two configurations of the amino acid alanine would be represented in perspective or projection as and The carboxyl carbon is and is placed at the top The substituents at the chiral carbon connected to the horizontal bonds are amino and hydrogen The amino substituent is taken to be the main substituent when this is on the left the acid has the configuration and when it is on the right the configuration All of the amino acids that occur in natural proteins have been shown to have the configuration Glyceraldehyde which has one chiral carbon bonded to an aldehyde function hydrogen hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl is of special interest as the simplest chiral prototype of sugars carbohydrates Perspective views and Fischer projections of the and forms correspond to and respectively where the carbon of the aldehyde function is The system of designating configuration only can be applied when there is a main chain and when we can make an unambiguous choice of the main substituent groups Try for instance to assign and configurations to enantiomers of bromochlorofluoromethane An excellent set of rules has been worked out for such cases that leads to unambiguous configurational assignments by what is called the convention We discuss the system in detail in Chapter and if you wish you can turn to it now However for the next several chapters assigning configurations is much less important to us than knowing what kinds of stereoisomers are possible Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
