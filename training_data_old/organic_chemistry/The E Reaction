Kinetics and Mechanism The conditions used for substitution reactions by the mechanism very often lead to elimination The reaction of bromopropane with sodium ethoxide in ethanol provides a good example Elimination to give propene competes with substitution to give ethyl isopropyl ether Furthermore the rate of elimination like the rate of substitution is proportional to the concentrations of bromopropane and ethoxide ion Thus elimination here is a secondorder reaction it may be helpful to review Section at this point rate of substitution rate of elimination As to the mechanism of this kind of elimination the attacking base removes a proton from the carbon more or less simultaneously with the formation of the double bond and the loss of bromide ion from the neighboring carbon The abbreviation for this mechanism is for elimination and for bimolecular there being two reactants involved in the transition state B Structural Effects Structural influences on reactions have been studied in some detail Like the competing process a good leaving group is necessary and of these the most commonly used are the halides and sulfonate esters and onium ions such as ammonium and sulfonium Rather strong bases generally are required to bring about the reaction The effectiveness of a series of bases generally parallels their base strengths and the order is observed for reactions This fact is important in planning practical syntheses because the reaction tends to predominate with strongly basic slightly polarizable reagents such as amide ion or ethoxide ion In contrast reactions tend to be favored with weakly basic nucleophiles such as iodide ion or ethanoate ion unless dipolar aprotic solvents are used which may markedly change the reactivity of anionic nucleophiles As for the alkyl group there are two important structural effects to notice First at least one bond adjacent to the leaving group is required Second the ease of elimination follows the order tertiary secondary primary Unlike reactions which are not observed for tertiary alkyl compounds because of steric hindrance to the approach of the nucleophile to carbon the related reaction usually occurs readily with tertiary compounds The reason is that little or no steric hindrance is likely for the approach of a base to a hydrogen unless the base is exceptionally bulky The reactivity order also appears to correlate with the bond energy inasmuch as the tertiary alkyl halides both are more reactive and have weaker carbonhalogen bonds than either primary or secondary halides see Table In fact elimination of from haloalkenes or haloarenes with relatively strong bonds such as chloroethene or chlorobenzene is much less facile than for haloalkanes Nonetheless elimination does occur under the right conditions and constitutes one of the most useful general methods for the synthesis of alkynes For example The conditions and reagents used for and reactions are similar enough that it is difficult to have one occur without the other However elimination is favored over substitution by a strongly basic nucleophiles b bulky nucleophiles and c increasing alkyl substitution at the carbon It also is observed that increasing the reaction temperature generally leads to an increase in elimination at the expense of substitution In fact surprisingly good yields of alkene or alkyne can be obtained by adding a halogen compound directly to molten or very hot with no solvent present whereupon the product is formed rapidly and distills immediately from the hot reaction mixture C Orientation Effects in Elimination Reactions With halides having unsymmetrical groups such as chloromethylbutane it is possible to form two or more different alkenes the proportion depending on the relative rates at which the different hydrogens are removed Most eliminations of alkyl halides with common bases such as and tend to give mixtures of alkenes with a preference for the most stable alkene which usually is the one with the fewest hydrogens or most alkyl groups attached to the carbons of the double bond Thus However the precise distribution of alkenes formed is found to vary enough with the nature of the leaving group or the base used so either product will predominated with some combination of reagents or conditions For example a change in the base alone can be decisive D Stereochemistry of Reactions The reaction occurs most easily if the molecule undergoing reaction can assume a conformation in which the leaving groups and are trans to each other and the atoms lie in one plane Elimination then proceeds from opposite sides of the incipient double bond to give an alkene of structure We shall call this mode of elimination antarafacial to distinguish Figure Schematic representation of antarafacial literally oppositeface and suprafacial literally aboveface elimination or addition of a reagent to ethene it from another possible mode of elimination that is called suprafacial See Figure The transition state for conversion of to is particularly reasonable because it combines some of the geometry of both the reactants and the products and therefore gives the best overlap of the reacting orbitals necessary for the formation of the bond This is shown more explicitly below As an illustration of the stereospecificity of eliminations the meso compound gives the cisalkene whereas the isomers give the transalkene with ethoxide Both reactions clearly proceed by antarafacial elimination When antarafacial elimination is rendered difficult by the inability of the reacting groups to acquire the desired trans arrangement then suprafacial elimination can occur although less readily An example is chlorocyclopentane in which and cannot assume a trans configuration without very considerable strain but which does undergo suprafacial elimination at a reasonable rate Endless confusion is caused by the very prevalent use of the term cis elimination or cis addition and trans elimination or trans addition to denote the processes shown in Figure At the risk of annoying those who often rightly dislike complicated names for simple processes we have chosen to adopt the proposal of R B Woodward and R Hoffman that elimination or addition which involves a sameside cleavage or formation of bonds be called suprafacial and the oppositeside cleavage or formation of bonds be called antarafacial The alternative of using syn for suprafacial and anti for antarafacial would be simpler and easier to remember but the terms syn and anti already are used for configurations which is exactly what we want to avoid The problem with the terms cis elimination or addition and trans elimination or addition is that they do not necessarily lead to products that by other conventions are understood to be cis and trans products respectively For example to say that trans elimination leads to cis product is a needless confusion It is much clearer to say that antarafacial elimination gives the cis product and now there is no confusion of the mode of elimination with whatever stereochemical convention identifies the product Persuasive arguments have been made that many reactions proceed by the sequence If this is so antarafacial elimination still is predicted to be favored Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C
