The Hammond Postulate Last updated Save as PDF Page ID The Hammond Postulate and the SN ReactionExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to use the Hammond postulate to explain the formation of the most stable carbocation during the addition of a protic acid HX to an alkene Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key term below Hammond postulate Now back to transition states Chemists are often very interested in trying to learn about what the transition state for a given reaction looks like but addressing this question requires an indirect approach because the transition state itself cannot be observed In order to gain some insight into what a particular transition state looks like chemists often invoke the Hammond postulate which states that a transition state resembles the structure of the nearest stable species For an exergonic reaction therefore the transition state resembles the reactants more than it does the products If we consider a hypothetical exergonic reaction between compounds A and B to form AB the distance between A and B would be relatively large at the transition state resembling the starting state where A and B are two isolated species In the hypothetical endergonic reaction between C and D to form CD however the bond formation process would be much further along at the TS point resembling the product The Hammond Postulate is a very simplistic idea which relies on an assumption that potential energy surfaces are parabolic Although such an assumption is not rigorously true it is fairly reliable and allows chemists to make energetic arguments about transition states by employing arguments about the stability of a related species Since the formation of a reactive intermediate is very reliably endergonic arguments about the stability of reactive intermediates can serve as proxy arguments about transition state stability The Hammond Postulate and the SN Reaction the Hammond postulate suggests that the activation energy of the ratedetermining first step will be inversely proportional to the stability of the carbocation intermediate The stability of carbocations was discussed earlier and a qualitative relationship is given below Carbocation Stability CH CHCH CHCH CHCHCH CHCH CHC Consequently we expect that ºalkyl halides will be more reactive than their º and ºcounterparts in reactions that follow an SN mechanism This is opposite to the reactivity order observed for the SN mechanism Allylic and benzylic halides are exceptionally reactive by either mechanism Exercises Questions Q Consider the second step in the electrophilic addition of HBr to an alkene Is this step exergonic or endergonic and does the transition state represent the product or the reactant cation Draw out an energy diagram of this step reaction Solutions S Exergonic and the transition state second step represents the reactant cation As shown to go from intermediate cation to final product the step is exergonic Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
