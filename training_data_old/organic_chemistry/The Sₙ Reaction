Reaction Energy Diagrams for SN reactions Introduction In many ways the proton transfer process of a BrønstedLowry acidbase reaction can be thought of as simply a special kind of nucleophilic substitution reaction one in which the electrophile is a hydrogen rather than a carbon In both reaction types we are looking at very similar players an electronrich species the nucleophilebase reacts with an electronpoor species the electrophileproton driving off the leaving groupconjugate base In the next few sections we are going to be discussing some general aspects of nucleophilic substitution reactions and in doing so it will simplify things greatly if we can use some abbreviations and generalizations before we dive into real examples What is a nucleophile Nu Instead of showing a specific nucleophile like hydroxide we will simply refer to the nucleophilic reactant as Nu Nucleophilic functional groups are those which have electronrich atoms able to donate a pair of electrons to form a new covalent bond Nucleophiles can be negatively charged and some that are neutral with lone pair electrons In both laboratory and biological organic chemistry the most relevant nucleophilic atoms are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and the most common nucleophilic functional groups are water alcohols phenols amines thiols and occasionally carboxylates More specifically in laboratory reactions halide and azide N anions are commonly seen acting as nucleophiles When thinking about nucleophiles the first thing to recognize is that for the most part the same quality of electronrichness that makes a something nucleophilic also makes it basic nucleophiles can be bases and bases can be nucleophiles It should not be surprising then that most of the trends in basicity that we have already discussed also apply to nucleophilicity Some confusion in distinguishing basicity base strength and nucleophilicity nucleophile strength is inevitable Since basicity is a less troublesome concept it is convenient to start with it Basicity refers to the ability of a base to accept a proton Basicity may be related to the pKa of the corresponding conjugate acid as shown below The strongest bases have the weakest conjugate acids and vice versa The range of basicities included in the following table is remarkable covering over fifty powers of ten In an acidbase equilibrium the weakest acid and the weakest base will predominate they will necessarily be on the same side of the equilibrium Learning the pKa values for common compounds provides a useful foundation on which to build an understanding of acidbase factors in reaction mechanisms Base I Cl HO CHCO RS CN RO NH CH Conj Acid HI HCl HO CHCOH RSH HCN ROH NH CH pKa Nucleophilicity is a more complex property It commonly refers to the rate of substitution reactions at the halogenbearing carbon atom of a reference alkyl halide such as CHBr Thus the nucleophilicity of the Nu reactant in the following substitution reaction varies as shown in the chart below Nucleophilicity CHCO Cl Br N CHO CN I CHS What is a Leaving Group X or LG In a similar fashion we will call the leaving group X for halogens as is customary For other reactions it will be more accurate to abbreviate the leaving group as LG The context of the reaction will dictate the abbreviation Leaving groups are sometimes negatively charged sometimes neutral and sometimes positively charged Therefore in this general picture we will not include a charge designation on the X or LG species In referring to the comparison between acidbase chemistry and substitution reactions the stability of the leaving group is evaluated the same way we evaluate the stability of conjugate bases When comparing the reactivity of electrophiles that vary only in their leaving groups then leaving group stability plays a dominant role The electrophile with the more stable leaving group will be favored The lower the electron density of the leaving group the more stable it is Neutral leaving groups are favoring over charged leaving groups When comparing charged leaving groups apply the concepts used to determine the relative stability of conjugate bases identity or identities of the atoms holding the charge delocalization of the charge via resonance inductive effects orbital hybridization What is an Electrophile E An electrophile accepts electrons analogous to a Lewis acid Electrophiles E are sometimes protonated and sometimes neutral Electrophiles can also be called Substrates Since nucleophiles leaving groups and electrons may be charged or neutral we will not include charges on Nu or X or LG or E We will generalize the three other groups bonded on the electrophilic alphacarbon as R R and R these symbols could represent hydrogens as well as alkyl groups Finally in order to keep figures from becoming too crowded we will use in most cases the line structure convention in which the central electrophilic carbon is not drawn out as a C Here then is the generalized picture of a concerted singlestep nucleophilic substitution reaction To recognize neutral electrophiles we will need to identify polarity andor resonance with compounds to create a partial positive charge to attract the nucleophile The electrophilicity of alkyl halides comes from the polar carbonhalogen bond The common halogens being fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine With the exception of iodine these halogens have electronegativities significantly greater than carbon Consequently this functional group is polarized so that the carbon is electrophilic and the halogen is nucleophilic as shown in the drawing on the right Two characteristics other than electronegativity also have an important influence on the chemical behavior of these compounds The first of these is covalent bond strength The strongest of the carbonhalogen covalent bonds is that to fluorine Remarkably this is the strongest common single bond to carbon being roughly kcalmole stronger than a carboncarbon bond and about kcalmole stronger than a carbonhydrogen bond Because of this alkyl fluorides and fluorocarbons in general are chemically and thermodynamically quite stable and do not share any of the reactivity patterns shown by the other alkyl halides The carbonchlorine covalent bond is slightly weaker than a carboncarbon bond and the bonds to the other halogens are weaker still the bond to iodine being about weaker The second factor to be considered is the relative stability of the corresponding halide anions which is likely the form in which these electronegative atoms will be replaced This stability may be estimated from the relative acidities of the HX acids assuming that the strongest acid releases the most stable conjugate base halide anion With the exception of HF pKa all the hydrohalic acids are very strong small differences being in the direction HCl HBr HI Exercise Since everything is relative in chemistry one reactions nucleophile can be another reactions leaving group Some functional groups can only react as a nuclephile or electrophile while other functional groups can react as either a nuclephile or electrophile depending on the reaction conditions Classify the following compounds as nucleophiles electrophiles or leaving groups More than one answer may be possible a bromoethane b hydroxide c water d chlorocyclohexane e ethanol f bromide Answer a electrophile Alkyl halides are always electrophiles one reason they are an ochem students best friend b strong nucleophile c weak nucleophile and good leaving group d electrophile Alkyl halides are always electrophiles one reason they are an ochem students best friend e weak nucleophile a poor electrophile without clever chemistry stay tuned for future chapters good leaving group f good nucleophile and a good leaving group The SN mechanism There are two mechanistic models for how an alkyl halide can undergo nucleophilic substitution SN and SN The SN reaction takes place in a single step with bondforming and bondbreaking occurring simultaneously In all figures in this section X indicates a halogen substituent This is called an SN mechanism In the term SN S stands for substitution the subscript N stands for nucleophilic and the number refers to the fact that it is a bimolecular reaction the overall rate depends on a step in which two separate molecules the nucleophile and the electrophile collide A potential energy diagram for this reaction shows the transition state TS as the highest point on the pathway from reactants to products If you look carefully at the progress of the SN reaction you will realize something very important about the outcome The nucleophile being an electronrich species must react with the electrophilic carbon from the back side relative to the location of the leaving group Approach from the front side simply doesnt work the electron rich leaving group blocks the way with electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance The result of this backside penetration is that the stereochemical configuration at the central carbon inverts as the reaction proceeds In a sense the molecule is turned inside out At the transition state the electrophilic carbon and the three R substituents all lie on the same plane What this means is that SN reactions whether enzyme catalyzed or not are inherently stereoselective when the substitution takes place at a stereocenter we can confidently predict the stereochemical configuration of the product Below is an animation illustrating the principles we have just learned showing the SN reaction between hydroxide ion and methyl iodide Notice how backside attack by the hydroxide nucleophile results in inversion at the tetrahedral carbon electrophile Exercise Predict the structure of the product in this SN reaction Be sure to specify stereochemistry Solution SN Reactions Occur at sp Carbons with a Leaving Group One more important point must be made before continuing nucleophilic substitutions as a rule occur at sphybridized carbons bonded to a leaving group SN reactions cannot occur where the leaving group is attached to an sphybridized carbon Bonds on sphybridized carbons are inherently shorter and stronger than bonds on sphybridized carbons meaning that it is harder to break the CX bond in these substrates SN reactions of this type are unlikely also because the hypothetical electrophilic carbon is protected from nucleophilic attack by electron density in the p bond SN reactions are highly unlikely because the resulting carbocation intermediate which would be sphybridized would be very unstable well discuss the relative stability of carbocation intermediates in a later section of this module For future reference when discerning between substitution and elimination reactions evaluating the structure of the electrophile can eliminate possible products If the electrophilic carbon has no betahydrogens then only substitution reactions can occur and elimination reactions are not possible of course carbocation rearrangements may need to be considered The first four halides shown on the left below do not give elimination reactions on treatment with base because they have no βhydrogens The two halides on the right do not normally undergo such reactions because the potential elimination products have highly strained double or triple bonds It is also worth noting that sp hybridized CX compounds such as the three on the right do not normally undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions unless other functional groups perturb the double bonds

halide SN Reaction Kinetics In the term SN the S stands for substitution the N stands for nucleophilic and the number two stands for bimolecular meaning there are two molecules involved in the rate determining step The rate of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions depends on the concentration of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile To understand how the rate depends on the concentrations of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile let us look at the following example The hydroxide ion is the nucleophile and methyl iodide is the haloalkane If we were to double the concentration of either the haloalkane or the nucleophile we can see that the rate of the reaction would proceed twice as fast as the initial rate If we were to double the concentration of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile we can see that the rate of the reaction would proceed four times as fast as the initial rate The bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction follows secondorder kinetics that is the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of two firstorder reactants In the case of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution these two reactants are the haloalkane and the nucleophile For further clarification on reaction kinetics the following links may facilitate your understanding of rate laws rate constants and secondorder kinetics Exercise The reaction below
