Thermochemistry of Substitution Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributors and Attributions Ionic or polar reactions of alkyl halides rarely are observed in the vapor phase because the energy required to dissociate a carbonhalogen bond heterolytically is almost prohibitively high For example while the heat of dissociation of chloromethane to a methyl radical and a chlorine atom is Table dissociation to a methyl cation and a chloride ion requires about However the heat of ionic dissociation of methyl chloride in aqueous solution is estimated to be and while this reaction is still substantially endothermic it requires about less energy than in the gas phase The reason is that ions are much more stable in water than in the gas phase for example the transfer of a chloride ion from the gas to water is exothermic by The value for the corresponding transfer of a methyl cation is not known with certainty but is about These ionic solvation energies are clearly large In contrast the for solution of methyl chloride in water is small about We can use these data to calculate the heat of ionic dissociation of chloromethane in water Thermochemical data for the solvation of ions as used in the preceding calculations are difficult to measure and even to estimate Therefore this kind of calculation of for ionic reactions involving organic molecules in solution usually cannot be made As a result we have considerably fewer possibilities to assess the thermodynamic feasibility of the individual steps of polar reactions in solution than we do of vaporphase radical processes Bond energies are not of much use in predicting or explaining reactivity in ionic reactions unless we have some information that can be used to translate gasphase values to solution values Calculated from the following data Contributors and Attributions John D Robert and Marjorie C Caserio Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry second edition W A Benjamin Inc Menlo Park CA ISBN This content is copyrighted under the following conditions You are granted permission for individual educational research and noncommercial reproduction distribution display and performance of this work in any format
