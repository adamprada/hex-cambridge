Types of Organic Reactions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID IntroductionContributors and Attributions Learning Objective recognize and distinguish between the four major types of organic reactions additions eliminations substitutions and rearrangements Introduction If you scan any organic textbook you will encounter what appears to be a very large often intimidating number of reactions These are the tools of a chemist and to use these tools effectively we must organize them in a sensible manner and look for patterns of reactivity that permit us make plausible predictions Most of these reactions occur at special sites of reactivity known as functional groups and these constitute one organizational scheme that helps us catalog and remember reactions Ultimately the best way to achieve proficiency in organic chemistry is to understand how reactions take place and to recognize the various factors that influence their course First we identify four broad classes of reactions based solely on the structural change occurring in the reactant molecules This classification does not require knowledge or speculation concerning reaction paths or mechanisms The four main reaction classes are additions eliminations substitutions and rearrangements Addition Reaction Elimination Reaction Substitution Reaction Rearrangement Reaction In an addition reaction the number of σbonds in the substrate molecule increases usually at the expense of one or more πbonds The reverse is true of elimination reactions iethe number of σbonds in the substrate decreases and new πbonds are often formed Substitution reactions as the name implies are characterized by replacement of an atom or group Y by another atom or group Z Aside from these groups the number of bonds does not change A rearrangement reaction generates an isomer and again the number of bonds normally does not change The examples illustrated above involve simple alkyl and alkene systems but these reaction types are general for most functional groups including those incorporating carbonoxygen double bonds and carbonnitrogen double and triple bonds Some common reactions may actually be a combination of reaction types Example substitution Reaction The reaction of an ester with ammonia to give an amide as shown below appears to be a substitution reaction Y CHO Z NH however it is actually two reactions an addition followed by an elimination Example Addition reaction The addition of water to a nitrile does not seem to fit any of the above reaction types but it is simply a slow addition reaction followed by a rapid rearrangement as shown in the following equation Rapid rearrangements of this kind are called tautomerizations Exercise Classify each reaction as addition elimination substitution or rearrangement Answer A Substitution B Elimination C Addition Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry
