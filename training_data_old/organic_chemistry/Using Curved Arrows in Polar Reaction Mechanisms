Using Curved Arrows in Polar Reaction Mechanisms Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Pushing Electrons and Curly ArrowsLesson Curly Arrow Summary ExercisesQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to use curved curly arrows in conjunction with a chemical equation to show the movement of electron pairs in a simple polar reaction such as electrophilic addition Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below electrophlic nucleophlic Pushing Electrons and Curly Arrows Understanding the location of electrons and being able to draw the curly arrows that depict the mechanisms by which the reactions occur is one of the most critical tools for learning organic chemistry since they allow you to understand what controls reactions and how reactions proceed Before you can do this you need to understand that a bond is due to a pair of electrons between atoms When asked to draw a MECHANISM curly arrows should be used to show ALL the BONDING changes that occur A few simple lessons Lesson Lesson Lesson Lesson Curly Arrow Summary Curly arrows flow from electron rich to electron poor Therefore they start from lone pairs or bonds The charges in any particular step should always be balanced Remember to obey the rules of valence eg octet rule for CNOF etc If electrons are taken out of a bond then that bond is broken If electrons are placed between two atoms then it implies a bond is being made Exercises Questions Q Draw curved arrows to indicate mechanisms for the following reactions Solutions S Contributors and Attributions Dr Ian Hunt Department of Chemistry University of Calgary Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University
