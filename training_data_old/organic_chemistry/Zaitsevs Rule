Zaitsevs Rule Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Zaisevs Rule and RegioselectivityContributors and Attributions Learning Objective use Zaitsevs rule to predict major and minor products of elimination reactions Zaisevs Rule and Regioselectivity The prefix regio indicates the interaction of reactants during bond making andor bond breaking occurs preferentially by one orientation Because the betacarbons of an alkyl halide may not be equivalent there can be more than one possible elimination product Zaitsevs Rule can be used to predict the regiochemistry of elimination reactions Zaitsevs or Saytzevs anglicized spelling rule is an empirical rule used to predict regioselectivity of betaelimination reactions occurring via the E or E mechanisms It states that in a regioselective E or E reaction the major product is the more stable alkene with the more highly substituted double bond as shown in the example below If two or more structurally distinct groups of betahydrogens are present in a given reactant then several constitutionally isomeric alkenes may be formed by an E elimination This situation is illustrated by the bromobutane and bromodimethylbutane elimination examples given below By using the strongly basic hydroxide nucleophile we direct these reactions toward elimination In both cases there are two different sets of betahydrogens available to the elimination reaction these are colored red and magenta and the alpha carbon is blue If the rate of each possible elimination was the same we might expect the amounts of the isomeric elimination products to reflect the number of hydrogens that could participate in that reaction For example since there are three ºhydrogens red and two ºhydrogens magenta on betacarbons in bromobutane statistics would suggest a ratio of butene and butene in the products This is not observed and the latter predominates by This departure from statistical expectation is even more pronounced in the second example where there are six ºbetahydrogens compared with one ºhydrogen These results point to a strong regioselectivity favoring the more highly substituted product double bond an empirical statement generally called the Zaitsev Rule Exercise Ignoring the alkene stereochemistry show the elimination products of the following compounds Answer Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
