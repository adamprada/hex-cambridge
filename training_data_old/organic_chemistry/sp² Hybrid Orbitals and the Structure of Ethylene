After completing this section you should be able to account for the formation of carboncarbon double bonds using the concept of sp hybridization describe a carboncarbon double bond as consisting of one σ bond and one π bond explain the difference between a σ bond and a π bond in terms of the way in which p orbitals overlap Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below pi π bond sp hybrid Bonding in Ethylene Thus far valence bond theory has been able to describe the bonding in molecules containing only single bonds However when molecules contain double or triple bonds the model requires more details Ethylene commonly knows as ethene CHCH is the simplest molecule which contains a carbon carbon double bond The Lewis structure of ethylene indicates that there are one carboncarbon double bond and four carbonhydrogen single bonds Experimentally the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the ethylene molecule have been shown to be identical Because each carbon is surrounded by three electron groups VSEPR theory says the molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry Although each carbon has fulfilled its tetravalent requirement one bond appears different Clearly a different type of orbital overlap is involved The sigma bonds formed in ethene is by the participation of a different kind of hybrid orbital Three atomic orbitals on each carbon the s px and py combine to form three sp hybrids leaving the pz orbital unhybridized Three of the four valence electrons on each carbon are distributed to the three sp hybrid orbitals while the remaining electron goes into the unhybridized pz orbital Each carbon in ethene is said to be a sphybridized carbon The electron configuration of the sp hybridized carbon shows that there are four unpaired electrons to form bonds However the unpaired electrons are contained in two different types of orbitals so it is to be expected that two different types of bonds will form The shape of the sphybridized orbital has be mathematically shown to to be roughly the same as that of the sphybridized orbital To minimize the repulsion between electrons the three sphybridized orbitals are arranged with a trigonal planar geometry Each orbital lobe is pointing to the three corners of an equilateral triangle with angles of between them Again geometry and hybrization can be tied together Atoms surrounded by three electron groups can be said to have a trigonal planar geometry and sp hybridization The unhybridized pz orbital is perpendicular to the plane of the trigonal planar sp hybrid orbtals In the ethylene molecule each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms Thus overlap two sphybridized orbitals with the s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms for the CH sigma bonds in ethylene spCsH Consequently consistent with the observations the four carbonhydrogen bonds in ethylene are identical The CC sigma bond in ethylene is formed by the overlap of an sp hybrid orbital from each carbon The overlap of hybrid orbitals or a hybrid orbital and a s orbtial from hydrogen creates the sigma bond framework of the ethylene molecule However the unhybridized pz orbital on each carbon remains The unhybridized pz orbitals on each carbon overlap to a π bond pi The orbital overlap is commonly written as pzCpzC In general multiple bonds in molecular compound are formed by the overlap of unhybridized p orbitals It should be noted that the carboncarbon double bond in ethlene is made up of two different types of bond a sigma and a pi Overall ethylene is said to contain five sigma bonds and one pi bond Pi bonds tend to be weaker than sigma bonds because the sidebyside overlap the p orbitals give a less effective orbital overlap when compared to the endtoend orbital overlap of a sigma bond This makes the pi much easier to break which is one of the most important ideas in organic chemistry reactions as we will see in Chapter and subsequent chapters An ethylene molecule is said to be made up of five sigma bonds and one pi bond The three sp hybrid orbitals on each carbon orient to create the basic trigonal planer geometry The HCC bond angle in ethylene is o which is very close to the o predicted by VSEPR The four CH sigma bonds in ethylene The carboncarbon double bond in ethylene is both shorter pm and almost twice as strong kJmol than the carbon carbon single bond in ethylene pm kJmol Each of the four carbonhydrogen bond in ethylene are equivalent has have a length of pm Rigidity in Ethene Because they are the result of sidebyside overlap rather then endtoend overlap like a sigma bond pi bonds are not free to rotate If rotation about this bond were to occur it would involve disrupting the sidebyside overlap between the two pz orbitals that make up the pi bond If free rotation were to occur the porbitals would have to go through a phase where they are from each other which would break the pi bond because there would be no overlap Since the pi bond is essential to the structure of ethene it must not break so there can be not free rotation about the carboncarbon sigma bond The presence of the pi bond thus locks the six atoms of ethene into the same plane Exercise Consider the following molecule At each atom what is the hybridization and the bond angle and the bond angle predicted by VSPER Please identify the types of orbitals shown in the
