sp³ Hybrid Orbitals and the Structure of Ethane Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Bonding in EthaneExerciseQuestionsSolutionsContributors and Attributions Objective After completing this section you should be able to describe the structure of ethane in terms of the sp hybridization of the two carbon atoms present in the molecule ethane Bonding in Ethane The simplest molecule with a carboncarbon bond is ethane CH In ethane CHCH both carbons are sphybridized meaning that both have four bonds with tetrahedral geometry An sp orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an sp orbital of the second carbon atom to form a carboncarbon σ bond This orbital overlap is often described using the notation spCspC Each of the remaining sp hybrid orbitals overlaps with the s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen σ bonds The σ carboncarbon bond has a bond length of pm and a bond strength of kJmol The carbonhydrogen σ bonds are slightly weaker kJmol than those of methane The CCH bond angles in ethane are o which is close to the what is expected for tetrahedral molecules The orientation of the two CH groups is not fixed relative to each other Because they are formed from the endonend overlap of two orbitals sigma bonds are free to rotate This means in the case of ethane molecule that the two methyl CH groups can be pictured as two wheels on a hub each one able to rotate freely with respect to the other In Section we will learn more about the implications of rotational freedom in sigma bonds when we discuss the conformation of organic molecules How did they know The tetrahedral geometry of carbon was predicted as far back as But how did they know A question came up when looking at ethane with a bromine substituent CHBr When looking at the possible structures of the compound CHBr there are several possible structural formulashere was a serious problem as to whether these formulas represent the same or different compounds All that was known in the early days was that every purified sample of CHBr no matter how prepared had a boiling point of oC and density of gml Furthermore all looked the same all smelled the same and all underwent the same chemical reactions There was no evidence that CHBr was a mixture or that more than one compound of this formula could be prepared One might conclude therefore that all of the structural formulas above represent a single substance but how A brilliant solution to the problem came when J H vant Hoff proposed that all four bonds of carbon are equivalent and directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron If we redraw the structures for CHBr with both carbons having tetrahedral geometry we see that there is only one possible arrangement This theory hints at the idea of free rotation around sigma bonds which will be discussed later There was a serious problem as to whether these formulas represent the same or different compounds All that was known in the early days was that every purified sample of CHBr no matter how prepared had a boiling point of oC and density of gml Furthermore all looked the same all smelled the same and all underwent the same chemical reactions There was no evidence that CHBr was a mixture or that more than one compound of this formula could be prepared One might conclude therefore that all of the structural formulas above represent a single substance but how A brilliant solution to the problem came when J H vant Hoff proposed that all four bonds of carbon are equivalent and directed to the corners of a regular tetrahedron If we redraw the structures for CHBr with both carbons having tetrahedral geometry we see that there is only one possible arrangement This theory hints at the idea of free rotation around sigma bonds which will be discussed later Exercise Questions Q Draw pentane CHCHCHCHCH predict the bond angles within this molecule Solutions S All the bond angles will be the same size Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State University William Reusch Professor Emeritus Michigan State U Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis by Tim Soderberg University of Minnesota Morris
