this section you should be able to describe the structure of methane in terms of the sp hybridization of the central carbon atom Key Terms Make certain that you can define and use in context the key terms below bond angle hybridization sp hybrid Study Notes The tetrahedral shape is a very important one in organic chemistry as it is the basic shape of all compounds in which a carbon atom is bonded to four other atoms Note that the tetrahedral bond angle of cesfHCH is Valence bond theorys use of overlapping atomic orbitals to explain how chemical bonds form works well in simple diatomic molecules such as H However when molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds we require a more detailed model A good example is methane CH According to valence bond theory the structure of a covalent species can be depicted using a Lewis structure Experimentally it has been shown that the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the methane molecule are identical meaning they have the same bond energy and the same bond length Also VSEPR theory suggests that the geometry at the carbon atom in the methane molecule is tetrahedral and there exists a large body of both theoretical and experimental evidence supporting this prediction According to valence bond theory to form a covalent bond forms when an unpaired electron in one atom overlaps with an unpaired electron in a different atom Now consider the the electron configuration of the four valence electrons in carbon There is a serious mismatch between the electron configuration of carbon ssp and the predicted structure of methane The modern structure shows that there are only unpaired electrons to share with hydrogens instead of the needed to create methane Also the px and py orbitals are at o to each other They would form perpendicular bonds instead of the tetrahedral o bond angle predicted by VSEPR and experimental data Lastly there are two different orbitals s and p which would create different types of CH bonds As noted earlier experimentally the four carbonhydrogen bonds in the methane molecule are identical Hybrid Orbitals An answer to the problems posed above was offered in by Linus Pauling He showed mathematically that an s orbital and three p orbitals on an atom can combine to form four equivalent hybrid atomic orbitals The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms Hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated atoms A set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set All orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom create the molecular geometry as predicted by the VSEPR theory Hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds Lone pair electrons are often contained in hybrid orbitals sp Hybridization in Methane In order to explain this observation valence bond theory relies on a concept called orbital hybridization In this picture the four valence orbitals of the carbon one s and three p orbitals combine mathematically remember orbitals are described by equations to form four equivalent hybrid orbitals which are named sp orbitals because they are formed from mixing one s and three p orbitals In the new electron configuration each of the four valence electrons on the carbon occupies a single sp orbital creating four unpaired electrons The shape of an sp hybridized orbital is a combination of s and p atomic orbitals Each sphybridized orbital bears an electron and electrons repel each other To minimize the repulsion between electrons the four sphybridized orbitals arrange themselves around the carbon nucleus so that they are as far away as possible from each other resulting in the tetrahedral arrangement predicted by VSPER The carbon atom in methane is called an sphybridized carbon atom The larger lobes of the sp hybrids are directed towards the four corners of a tetrahedron meaning that the angle between any two orbitals is o Bonding in Methane Each CH bond in methane then can be described as an overlap between a halffilled s orbital in four hydrogen atoms and the larger lobe of one of the four halffilled sp hybrid orbitals form a four equivalent sigma σ bond This orbital overlap is often described using the notation spCsH The formation of sp hybrid orbitals successfully explains the tetrahedral structure of methane and the equivalency of the the four CH bonds What remains is an explanation of why the sp hybrid orbitals form When the s and p orbitals in carbon hybridize the resulting sp hybrid orbital is unsymmetrical with one lobe larger than the other This means the larger lobe can overlap more effectively with orbitals from other bonds making them stronger Hybridizing allows for the carbon to form stronger bonds than it would with unhybridized s or p orbitals The four carbonhydrogen bonds in methane are equivalent and all have a bond length of pm x m bond strength of of kJmol All of the HCH bond angles are o Looking Closer Linus Pauling Arguably the most influential chemist of the th century Linus Pauling is the only person to have won two individual that is unshared Nobel Prizes In the s Pauling used new mathematical theories to enunciate some fundamental principles of the chemical bond His book The Nature of the Chemical Bond is one of the most significant books ever published in chemistry Paulings big contribution to chemistry was valence bond theory which combined his knowledge of quantum mechanical theory with his knowledge of basic chemical facts like bond lengths and and bond strengths and shapes of molecules Valence bond theory like Lewiss bonding theory provides a simple model that is useful for predicting and understanding the structures of molecules especially for organic chemistry By Paulings interest turned to biological molecules and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on protein structure He was very close to discovering the double helix structure of DNA when James Watson and James Crick announced their own discovery of its structure in He was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to ban the testing of nuclear weapons Linus Pauling was one of the most influential chemists of the th century In his later years Pauling became convinced that large doses of vitamin C would prevent disease including the common cold Most clinical research failed to show a connection but Pauling continued to take large doses daily He died in having spent a lifetime establishing a scientific legacy that few will ever equal Contributors and Attributions Dr Dietmar Kennepohl FCIC Professor of Chemistry Athabasca University Prof Steven Farmer Sonoma State
