A Few Ideas from the Philosophy of Science Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers The goal of science is to create theories that accurately describe physical reality In this book we explore some of the most useful scientific theories that exist They have been tested extensively We know that there are limits to their applicability We expect that further thought and experimentation will expand their scope We expect that some elements of these theories will need to be modified in ways that we cannot anticipate but we do not expect that the core concepts will be invalidated We love theories because they rationalize our environment This is true not only of scientific theories but also of the panoply of conceptual frameworks that we use to organize our views aboutand responses to all of lifes issues We are addicted to theories We find nothing more disconcerting than information that we cannot put into a coherent context Indeed the term cognitive dissonance has entered the language to describe the feeling of disorientation that we experience when things just dont add up Logically confronted with a fact that contradicts one of our theories we are compelled to give up the theory We are not always logical A fact that contradicts a pet theory is unlikely to be accepted at face value We challenge it as indeed we should We scrutinize the offending fact and try to convince ourselves that it is no fact at all merely a spurious artifact Often of course this proves to be the case Sometimes we conclude that the offending fact is spurious when it is not We get stuffy about our theories When we find one that suits us we resist giving it up It has been observed that a revolutionary scientific theory often achieves universal acceptance only after all those who grew up with the predecessor theory have died Science is ultimately a social enterprise To develop and test theories about physical reality participants in this enterprise must be in general agreement about the criteria that are to be applied These criteria are frequently called the philosophy of science To summarize the philosophy of science we begin by observing that the goal of science is to explain the world that we experience through our sensory perceptions It is easy to generate putative explanations that have little or no real value Unfortunate experiences with past explanations have led to a broad consensus that scientific theories must have the following properties operational definitions logical structure predictive capability and testability internal consistency and consistency with any and all experimental observations The theory must be about the properties of some set of things By operational definitions we mean that the subjects of the theory must measurable and the theory must specify a set of operations for making each of these measurements By logical structure we mean that a satisfactory theory must include welldefined rules to specify how the subjects of the theory relate to one another By predictive capability we mean that a satisfactory theory must be capable of predicting the results of experiments that have not been performed By internal consistency we mean that a satisfactory theory must not allow us to logically derive contradictory conclusions which also means that it must not predict more than one outcome for any particular experiment Because a satisfactory theory makes predictions it is also testable It is possible to check whether the predictions correspond to reality We require that the theorys predictions be consistent with the results that we observe when we do the experiment The first four of these requirements really detail the characteristics that a theory must have in order to be considered a proper subject for scientific investigation Only the last requirement speaks to the allimportant issue of whether the theory accurately mirrors physical reality We can never prove that any theory is true What we can prove is that a theory fails to meet one of our criteria Science progresses when we discover a fatal flaw in a currently accepted theory Let us think further about what we mean when we say that a theory must be a logical structure Consider a simple classical syllogism Major premise All dogs are cats Minor premise All cats are white Conclusion All dogs are white As a logical structure this seems to be satisfactory We can represent the whole of its content in a simple diagram See Figure so if we want to view this syllogism as a theory about nature its internal consistency is more or less selfevident Moreover viewed as a theory it makes a prediction All dogs are white If we have operational definitions for dog cat and white that conform to customary usage we can say that this syllogism meets our criteria for a proper subject for scientific investigation Of course as a mirror of reality it fails Figure Venn diagram of a classical syllogism To see the issue of logical structure from another perspective let us consider the theory of evolution Some people summarize the theory of evolution as teaching that the fittest individuals survive and defining survivors as those individuals who are most fit They then point out that these are circular statements and proceed from this observation to the conclusion that the theory of evolution is devoid of real content So it can be dismissed Now if we are not closedminded about evolution this analysis looks like a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water Even so we are likely to be troubled because the circularity is undeniable Does this circularity mean that the theory of evolution is bad science A tautology is a statement that must be true Our analysis attempts to recast the entire content of the theory of evolution as one tautologous statement If the whole of a theory is a single statement and that statement must be true then the theory cannot be tested Our rules require that we reject it However our tautologous summary fails to capture the whole of the theory of evolution If a theory that contains tautologous statements also makes predictions that are not tautologous then it can be tested In the present example we can predict from the theory of evolution that selection of a particular trait through any process will cause increased expression of that trait in succeeding generations Evolution is based on natural selection but it postulates a mechanism that must be valid for any consistent selection process It predicts that a farmer who selects for cows that produce more milk will eventually get cows that produce more milk Thus attempts to apply selective breeding are tests of the central element of the theory of evolution and the success of selective breeding in every aspect of agriculture verifies a prediction of the theory There is no reason to object to a theory that has tautological elements so long as the content of the theory has real substance What we require is that a theorys predictions be nontrivial We object when substantially all of a theorys purported predictions are merely restatements of its premises so that the whole of the theory is an exercise in verbiage We require scientific theories to be internally consistent Normally we do not expect to be able to prove internal consistency What we really mean is that we will discard any theory that we can show to be internally inconsistent The presence of tautologous statements cannot make a theory internally inconsistent Indeed we can expect any internally consistent theory to have tautological elements After all if we try to define all of the subjects of a theory at least some of our definitions will inevitably be circular Another way to describe the logical structure of a physical theory is to say that a theory is a model for some observable part of the world We want the model to include things and rules The rules should specify how the things of the model change When we talk about comparing predictions of the theory to the results of experiment we mean that the changes that occur in the model when we apply the rules of the theory should parallel the changes that occur in the real world when we do the corresponding experiment The idea is analogous to the mathematical concept of a homomorphism A dictionary definition of a homomorphism is a mapping of a mathematical group ring or vector space onto another in such a way that the result obtained by applying an operation to elements of the domain is mapped onto the result of applying the same or a corresponding operation to their images in the range Stated more picturesquely the idea of a homomorphism is that two mathematical structures have the same form If one is laid on top of the other there is a perfect correspondence between them See Figure Figure A homomorphism The idea of a onetoone correspondence between two structures can be extended to the case where one structure is a logical structure and the other is a physical structure Consider the logical structure usually called a truth table associated with the truth of the proposition sentence A is true and sentence B is true The proposition is false unless both A and B are true Now consider the performance of an electrical circuit that consists of a battery switches A and B and a light bulb all connected in series The light is off unless both A and B are on There is a perfect correspondence between the elements of the logical structure and the performance of the circuit See Figure In fact this is a special case of a much more extensive parallelism For any sentence in propositional logic there is a corresponding circuitinvolving batteries switches and a light bulbsuch that the bulb is on if the corresponding sentence is true and off if the sentence is false Moreover there is a mathematical structure called Boolean algebra which is homomorphic to propositional logic and exhibits the same parallelism to circuits Digital computers carry this parallelism to structures of great complexity If we stretch our definition of a homomorphism to include comparisons of logical constructs with physical things we can view a scientific theory as a logical construct that we are trying to make homomorphic with physical reality We want our theory to map onto reality in such a way that changes in the logical construct map onto changes in physical reality Of course what we mean by this is the same thing we meant previously when we said that the predictions of our theory should agree with the results of experiment Figure Mapping a physical system onto a logical construct It is implicit in this view that any scientific theory describes an abstraction from reality If for example we say that a physical system is at a particular temperature this statement represents an approximation in at least two respects First we believe that we can measure temperature in continually more refined ways If we know the temperature to six significant figures this represents a very good approximation but we believe that the true temperature can only be expressed using indeterminably many significant figures To say that the temperature of the system has some value expressed to six significant figures is an approximation albeit a very good one Second it is unlikely that all parts of any real system are actually at the same temperature When we say that a physical system has a particular temperature we mean that any differences in temperature between different parts of the system are too small to affect the behavior in which we are currently interested In our discussions and deliberations about the physical system we replace its actual properties by our best measurement In doing so we abstract something that we believe to be an essential feature from the reality we actually observe Implicit also is the idea that our theories about reality are subject to inevitable limitations In the example above any theory that however accurately predicts the single temperature that we use to describe the real system is inadequate to describe whatever small variations there may be from point to point within it If we expand our theory to encompass variations over say distances of millimeters then the expanded theory will be inadequate to describe variations over some smaller distance Any perfect theory must exactly describe the motions of all of the systems constituent particles This is impossible not only because it conflicts with the basis premises of quantum mechanics but also because it requires the theory to contain information at a level of detail equal to that in the physical system itself One way to express all of the same information at exactly the same level of detail is to have an exact replica of the system This idea has been expressed by saying that an absolutely accurate map of Oklahoma City would have to be as large as Oklahoma City itself For use as a map such a thing would be useless Similarly a theory that predicts temperature is useful only if it predicts the temperature we measure measurement being a part of the process by which we effect abstraction experimentally We can make use of multiple theories of the same phenomenon if each of them has advantages and limitations that we recognize and respect We see however that in the end there can be no single allencompassing theory Any theory must model an approximation to reality In the final analysis reality is reality
