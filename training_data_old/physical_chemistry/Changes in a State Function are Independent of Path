Changes in a State Function are Independent of Path Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers We can specify an equilibrium state of a physical system by giving the values of a sufficient number of the systems measurable properties We call any measurable property that can be used in this way a state function or a state variable If a system undergoes a series of changes that return it to its original state any state function must have the same value at the end as it had at the beginning The relationship between our definition of a physical state and our definition of a state function is tautological A system can return to its initial state only if every state variable returns to its original value Figure Paths between states I and II It is evident that the change in a state function when the system goes from an initial state to some other state must always be the same Consider the state functions and Suppose that functions and are sufficient to specify the state of a particular system Let their values in state be and We can express their interdependence by saying that is a function of the other state functions and In state this relationship becomes The difference depends only on the states and In particular is independent of the values of and in any intermediate states that the system passes through as it undergoes the change from state to state We say that the change in the value of a state function depends only on the initial and final states of the system the change in the value of a state function does not depend on the path along which the change is effected We can also develop this conclusion by a more explicit argument about the path Suppose that the system goes from state to state by path and then returns to state by path as sketched in Figure Let be some state function If the change in as the system traverses path is and the change in as the system traverses is we must have so that For some second path comprising followed by the same must be true and The same is true for any other path In particular in must be true for the path followed by so that and hence But this means that Since the paths and are arbitrary the change in in going from state to state must have the same value for any path Notes Since the temperature of the water increases and the process is to be reversible we must keep the temperature of the thermal reservoir just greater than that of the water throughout the process We can accomplish this by using a quantity of ideal gas as the heat reservoir By reversibly compressing the ideal gas we can reversibly deliver the required heat while maintaining the required temperature We consider this operation further in
