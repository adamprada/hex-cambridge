of the solvent will change as solute or solutes is are added Before discussing these important properties let us first review some definitions Solution a homogeneous mixture Solvent The component of a solution with the largest mole fraction Solute Any component of a solution that is not the solvent Solutions can exist in solid alloys of metals are an example of solidphase solutions liquid or gaseous aerosols are examples of gasphase solutions forms For the most part this discussion will focus on liquidphase solutions Freezing Point Depression In general and as will be discussed in Chapter in more detail a liquid will freeze when As such the freezing point of the solvent in a solution will be affected by anything that changes the chemical potential of the solvent As it turns out the chemical potential of the solvent is reduced by the presence of a solute In a mixture the chemical potential of component can be calculated by And because is always less than or equal to the chemical potential is always reduced by the addition of another component The condition under which the solvent will freeze is where the chemical potential of the liquid is given by Equation refchemp which rearrangement to To evaluate the temperature dependence of the chemical potential it is useful to consider the temperature derivative at constant pressure Recalling that and Equation refbigeq becomes And noting that in the case of the solvent freezing is the enthalpy of the pure solvent in solid form and is the enthalpy of the solvent in the liquid solution So Equation refbigeq then becomes or Separating the variables puts the equation into an integrable form int_ToT dfracDelta H_fusRT dT int d ln chi_A labelint where is the freezing point of the pure solvent and is the temperature at which the solvent will begin to solidify in the solution After integration of Equation refint dfracDelta H_fusR left dfracT dfracTo right ln chi_A labelint This can be simplified further by noting that where is the difference between the freezing temperature of the pure solvent and that of the solvent in the solution Also for small deviations from the pure freezing point can be replaced by the approximate value So the Equation refint becomes dfracDelta H_fusRTo Delta T ln chi_A labelint Further for dilute solutions for which the mole fraction of the solvent is very nearly then where is the mole fraction of the solute After a small bit of rearrangement this results in an expression for freezing point depression of The first factor can be replaced by which is the cryoscopic constant for the solvent gives the magnitude of the reduction of freezing point for the solution Since and are properties of the solvent the freezing point depression property is independent of the solute and is a property based solely on the nature of the solvent Further since was introduced as it represents the sum of the mole fractions of all solutes present in the solution It is important to keep in mind that for a real solution freezing of the solvent changes the composition of the solution by decreasing the mole fraction of the solvent and increasing that of the solute As such the magnitude of will change as the freezing process continually removes solvent from the liquid phase of the solution Boiling Point Elevation The derivation of an expression describing boiling point elevation is similar to that for freezing point depression In short the introduction of a solute into a liquid solvent lowers the chemical potential of the solvent cause it to favor the liquid phase over the vapor phase As sch the temperature must be increased to increase the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid solution until it is equal to that of the vaporphase solvent The increase in the boiling point can be expressed as where is called the ebullioscopic constant and like the cryoscopic constant is a property of the solvent that is independent of the solute or solutes A very elegant derivation of the form of the models for freezing point depression and boiling point elevation has been shared by F E Schubert Schubert Cryoscopic and ebullioscopic constants are generally tabulated using molality as the unit of solute concentration rather than mole fraction In this form the equation for calculating the magnitude of the freezing point decrease or the boiling point increase is or where is the concentration of the solute in moles per kg of solvent Some values of and are shown in the table below Substance C kg mol C C kg mol C Water Benzene Ethanol CCl Example The boiling point of a solution of g of an unknown compound in g of CCl raises the boiling point to C What is the molar mass of the compound Solution The approach here is to find the number of moles of solute in the solution First find the concentration of the solution Using the number of kg of solvent one finds the number for moles of solute The ratio of mass to moles yields the final answer Vapor Pressure Lowering For much the same reason as the lowering of freezing points and the elevation of boiling points for solvents into which a solute has been introduced the vapor pressure of a volatile solvent will be decreased due to the introduction of a solute The magnitude of this decrease can be quantified by examining the effect the solute has on the chemical potential of the solvent In order to establish equilibrium between the solvent in the solution and the solvent in the vapor phase above the solution the chemical potentials of the two phases must be equal If the solute is not volatile the vapor will be pure so assuming ideal behavior Where is the vapor pressure of the solvent over the solution Similarly for the pure solvent in equilibrium with its vapor where is the standard pressure of atm and is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent Substituting Equation refeq into Equation refeq yields The terms for cancel leaving Subtracting from both side produces which rearranges to Dividing both sides by and then exponentiating yields or This last result is Raoults Law A more formal derivation would use the fugacities of the vapor phases but would look essentially the same Also as in the case of freezing point depression and boiling point elevations this derivation did not rely on the nature of the solute However unlike freezing point depression and boiling point elevation this derivation did not rely on the solute being dilute so the result should apply the entire range of concentrations of the solution Example Consider a mixture of two volatile liquids A and B The vapor pressure of pure A is Torr at some temperature and that of pure B is Torr at the same temperature What is the total vapor pressure above a mixture of these compounds with the mole fraction of B of What is the mole fraction of B in the vapor that is in equilibrium with the liquid mixture Solution Using Raoults Law Equation refRL To get the mole fractions in the gas phase one can use Daltons Law of partial pressures And of course it is also useful to note that the sum of the mole fractions is as it must be Osmotic Pressure Osmosis is a process by which solvent can pass through a semipermeable membrane a membrane through which solvent can pass but not solute from an area of low solute concentration to a region of high solute concentration The osmotic pressure is the pressure that when exerted on the region of high solute concentration will halt the process of osmosis The nature of osmosis and the magnitude of the osmotic pressure can be understood by examining the chemical potential of a pure solvent and that of the solvent in a solution The chemical potential of the solvent in the solution before any extra pressure is applied is given by And since xA the chemical potential is of the solvent in a solution is always lower than that of the pure solvent So to prevent osmosis from occurring something needs to be done to raise the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution This can be accomplished by applying pressure to the solution Specifically the process of osmosis will stop when the chemical potential solvent in the solution is increased to the point of being equal to that of the pure solvent The criterion therefore for osmosis to cease is To solve the problem to determine the magnitude of p the pressure dependence of the chemical potential is needed in addition to understanding the effect the solute has on lowering the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution The magnitude therefore of the increase in chemical potential due to the application of excess pressure p must be equal to the magnitude of the reduction of chemical potential by the reduced mole fraction of the solvent in the solution We already know that the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution is reduced by an amount given by And the increase in chemical potential due to the application of excess pressure is given by The integrals on the right can be evaluated by recognizing where is the molar volume of the substance Combining these expressions results in If the molar volume of the solvent is independent of pressure has a very small value of which is the case for most liquids the term on the right becomes Also for values of very close to So for dilute solutions Or after rearrangement pi dfracchi_B RTV again where is the molar volume of the solvent And finally since is the concentration of the solute for cases where This allows one to write a simplified version of the expression which can be used in the case of very dilute solutions When a pressure exceeding the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution can be made to exceed that of the pure solvent on the other side of the membrane causing reverse osmosis to occur This is a very effective method for example for recovering pure water from a mixture such as a saltwater solution Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of
