Combining the Onedimensional Probability Density Functions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In Section we derive the probability density function for one Cartesian component of the velocity of a gas molecule The probability density functions for the other two Cartesian components are the same function For we have and We now want to derive the threedimensional probability density function from these relationships Given these probability density functions for the Cartesian components of we can find the probability density function in spherical coordinates Since the differential volume element in spherical coordinates is the probability that a molecule has a a velocity vector whose magnitude lies between and while its component lies between and and its component lies between and becomes We found the same result in Section of course We can find the probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity by eliminating the dependence on the angular components To do this we need only sum up at a given value of the contributions from all possible values of and recalling that and This sum is just Since and we again obtain the MaxwellBoltzmann probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity Unlike the distribution function for the Cartesian components of velocity the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution for scalar velocities is not a normal distribution Possible speeds lie in the interval Because of the term the MaxwellBoltzmann equation is asymmetric it has a pronounced tail at high velocities
