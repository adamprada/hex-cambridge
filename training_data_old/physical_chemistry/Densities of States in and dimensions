Densities of States in and dimensions Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Jack SimonsProfessor Emeritus and Henry Eyring Scientist Chemistry at University of Utah Contributors and Attributions When a large number of neighboring orbitals overlap bands are formed However the natures of these bands their energy patterns and their densities of states are very different in different dimensions Before leaving our discussion of bands of orbitals and orbital energies in solids I want to address a bit more the issue of the density of electronic states and what determines the energy range into which orbitals of a given band will split First lets recall the energy expression for the and dimensional electron in a box case and lets generalize it to three dimensions The general result is E sum_j dfracn_j pihbarmL_jtag where the sum over runs over the number of dimensions or and is the length of the box along the jth direction For one dimension one observes a pattern of energy levels that grows with increasing and whose spacing between neighboring energy levels also grows as a result of which the state density decreases with increasing However in and dimensions the pattern of energy level spacing displays a qualitatively different character especially at high quantum number Consider first the dimensional case and for simplicity lets use a box that has equal length sides In this case the total energy is times n_x n_y n_z The latter quantity can be thought of as the square of the length of a vector having three components Now think of three Cartesian axes labeled and and view a sphere of radius in this space The volume of the th sphere having positive values of and and having radius is Because each cube having unit length along the and axes corresponds to a single quantum wave function and its energy the total number of quantum states with positive and and with energy between zero and is N_tot frac frac pi R frac biggfrac pi leftfracmELhbarpirightbiggtag The number of quantum states with energies between and is which gives the density of states near energy OmegaE fracdN_totdE frac biggfrac pi leftfracmELhbarpiright frac sqrtEbigg tag Notice that this state density increases as increases This means that in the dimensional case the number of quantum states per unit energy grows in other words the spacing between neighboring state energies decreases very unlike the dimensioal case where the spacing between neighboring states grows as and thus grows This growth in state density in the dimensional case is a result of the degeneracies and neardegeneracies that occur For example the states with and and are degenerate and those with or or or or or are degenerate and nearly degenerate to those having quantum numbers or or In the dimensional case degeneracies also occur and cause the density of states to possess an dependence that differs from the or dimensional case In this situation we think of states having energy but with The total number of states having energy between zero and is So the density of states between and is That is in this dimensional case the number of states per unit energy is constant for high values where the analysis above applies best This kind of analysis for the dimensional case gives N_rm total R sqrtfracmELhbarpi tag so the state density between and is which clearly shows the widening spacing and thus lower state density as one goes to higher energies These findings about densities of states in and dimensions are important because in various problems one encounters in studying electronic states of extended systems such as solids chains and surfaces one needs to know how the number of states available at a given total energy varies with A similar situation occurs when describing the translational states of an electron or a photo ejected from an atom or molecule into the vacuum here the dimensional density of states applies Clearly the state density depends upon the dimensionality of the problem and this fact is what I want the students reading this text to keep in mind Before closing this Section it is useful to overview how the various particleinbox models can be used as qualitative descriptions for various chemical systems a The onedimensional box model is most commonly used to model electronic orbitals in delocalized linear polyenes b The electrononacircle model is used to describe orbitals in a conjugated cyclic ring such as in benzene a The rectangular box model can be used to model electrons moving within thin layers of metal deposited on a substrate or to model electrons in aromatic sheets such as graphene shown below in Figure a Figure a Depiction of the aromatic rings of graphene extending in two dimensions b The particlewithinacircle model can describe states of electrons or other light particles requiring quantum treatment constrained within a circular corral c The particleonaspheres surface model can describe states of electrons delocalized over the surface of fullerenetype species such as shown in the upper right of Figure b Figure b Fullerene upper right and tubes of rolled up graphenes lower three a The particleinasphere model as discussed earlier is often used to treat electronic orbitals of quasispherical nanoclusters composed of metallic atoms b The particleinacube model is often used to describe the bands of electronic orbitals that arise in threedimensional crystals constructed from metallic atoms In all of these models the potential which is constant in the region where the electron is confined controls the energies of all the quantum states relative to that of a free electron ie an electron in vacuum with no kinetic energy For some dimensionalities and geometries it may be necessary to invoke more than one of these models to qualitatively describe the quantum states of systems for which the valence electrons are highly delocalized eg metallic clusters and conjugated organics For example for electrons residing on the surface of any of the three graphene tubes shown in Figure b one expects quantum states i labeled with an angular momentum quantum number and characterizing the electrons angular motions about the long axis of the tube but also ii labeled by a longaxis quantum number characterizing the electrons energy component along the tubes long axis For a threedimensional tubeshaped nanoparticle composed of metallic atoms one expects the quantum states to be i labeled with an angular momentum quantum number and a radial quantum number characterizing the electrons angular motions about the long axis of the tube and its radial Bessel function character but again also ii labeled by a longaxis quantum number characterizing the electrons energy component along the tubes long axis Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride Schools on Theoretical Chemistry
