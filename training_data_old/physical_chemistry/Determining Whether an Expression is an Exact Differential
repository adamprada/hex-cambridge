Determining Whether an Expression is an Exact Differential Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers Since exact differentials have these important characteristics it is valuable to know whether a given differential expression is exact or not That is given a differential expression of the form we would like to be able to determine whether is exact or inexact It turns out that there is a simple test for exactness test for exactness The differential in the form of Equation refeq is exact if and only if That is this condition is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a function for which and In we demonstrate that the condition is necessary Now we want to show that it is sufficient That is we want to demonstrate If Equation refeq hold then there exists a such that and To do this we show how to find a function that satisfies the given differential relationship If we integrate with respect to we have where is a function only of it is the arbitrary constant in the integration with respect to which we carry out with held constant To complete the proof we must find a function such that this satisfies the conditions The validity of condition in Equation refGrindEQ_ follows immediately from the facts that the order of differentiation and integration can be interchanged for a continuous function and that is a function only of so that To find such that condition in Equation refGrindEQ_ is satisfied we observe that But since this becomes Hence condition in Equation refGrindEQ_ is satisfied if and only if so that is simply an arbitrary constant
