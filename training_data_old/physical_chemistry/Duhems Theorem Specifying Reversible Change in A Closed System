We view a chemical system as a collection of substances that occupies some volume Let us consider a closed system whose volume is variable and in which no work other than pressurevolume work is possible If this system is undergoing a reversible change it is at equilibrium and it is in contact with its surroundings Because the system is at equilibrium all points inside the system have the same pressure and the same temperature Since the change is reversible the interior pressure is arbitrarily close to the pressure applied to the system by the surroundings If the reversibly changing system can exchange heat with its surroundings the temperature of the surroundings is arbitrarily close to the temperature of the system If a process takes place in a system that cannot exchange heat with its surroundings we say that the process is adiabatic We can measure the pressure temperature and volume of such a system without knowing anything about its composition For a system composed of a known amount of a single phase of a pure substance we know from experience that any cyclic change in pressure or temperature restores the initial volume That is for a pure phase there is an equation of state that we can rearrange as meaning that specifying and is sufficient to specify uniquely For other reversible systems the function may not exist For example consider a system that consists of a known amount of water at liquidvapor equilibrium and whose pressure and temperature are known For this system the volume can have any value between that of the pure liquid and that of the pure gas Specifying the pressure and temperature of this system is not sufficient to specify its state However if we specify the temperature of this system the pressure is fixed by the equilibrium condition and if we specify the volume of the system we can find how much water is in each phase from the known molar volumes of the pure substances at the system pressure and temperature For the waterwatervapor equilibrium system we can write In each of these cases we can view one of the variables as a function of the other two and represent it as a surface in a three dimensional space The two independent variables define a plane Projecting the systems location in this independentvariable plane onto the surface establishes the value of the dependent variable The two independentvariable values determine the point on the surface that specifies the state of the system In the liquidvapor equilibrium system the pressure is a surface above the volumetemperature plane A complete description of the state of the system must also include the number of moles of liquid and the number of mole of vapor present Each of these quantities can also be described as a surface in a three dimensional space in which the other two dimensions are volume and temperature Duhems theorem asserts that these observations are special cases of a more general truth Duhems theorem For a closed reversible system in which only pressurevolume work is possible specifying how some pair of state functions changes is sufficient to specify how the state of the system changes Duhems theorem asserts that two variables are sufficient to specify the state of the system in the following sense Given the values of the systems thermodynamic variables in some initial state say specifying the change in some pair of variables say and is sufficient to determine the change in the remaining variables so that the systems thermodynamic variables in the final state are where etc The theorem does not specify which pair of variables is sufficient In fact from the discussion above of the variables that can be used to specify the state of a system containing only water it is evident that a particular pair may not remain sufficient if there is a change in the number of phases present In Chapter we see that Duhems theorem follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics and we consider the particular pairs of variables that can be used For now let us consider a proof of Duhems theorem for a system in which the pressure temperature volume and composition can vary We consider systems in which only pressurevolume work is possible Let the number of chemical species present be and the number of phases be the number of component in the phase rule and differ by the number of stoichiometric constraints that apply to the system is less the number of stoichiometric constraints We want to know how many variables can be changed independently while the system remains at equilibrium This is similar to the question we answered when we developed Gibbs phase rule However there are important differences The phase rule is independent of the size of the system it specifies the number of intensive variables required to prescribe an equilibrium state in which specified phases are present The size of the system is not fixed we can add or remove matter to change the size of any phase without changing the number of degrees of freedom In the present problem the system cannot exchange matter with its surroundings Moreover the number of phases present can change We require only that any change be reversible and a reversible process can change the number of phases For example reversible vaporization can convert a twophase system to a gaseous onephase system We want to impose a change on an initial state of a closed system This initial state is an equilibrium state and we want to impose a change that produces a new Gibbsian equilibrium state of the same system This means that the change we impose can neither eliminate an existing chemical species nor introduce a new one A given phase can appear or disappear but a given chemical species cannot We can find the number of independent variables for this system by an argument similar to the one we used to find the phase rule To completely specify this system we must specify the pressure temperature and volume of each phase We must also specify the number of moles of each of chemical species in each phase This means that variables must be specified Every relationship that exists among these variables decreases by one the number that are independent The following relationships exist The pressure is the same in each phase There are pressure constraints The temperature is the same in each phase There are temperature constraints The volume of each phase is determined by the pressure the temperature and the number of moles of each species present in that phase In Chapter we find that the volume of a phase is given rigorously by the equation where and are the number of moles and the partial molar volume of the species in that phase The depend only on pressure temperature and composition For phases there are constraints one for the volume of each phase To completely specify the system the concentration of each species must be specified in each phase This condition creates constraints We can also reach this conclusion by a slightly different argument To specify the concentrations of species in some one phase requires constraints A distribution equilibrium relates the concentrations of each species in every pair of phases There are independent pairs of phases For chemical species there are such constraints This is equivalent to the requirement in our phase rule analysis that there are equilibrium relationships among components in P phases In the present problem the total number of concentration constraints is P Subtracting the number of constraints from the number of variables we find that there are independent variables for a reversible process in a closed system if all work is pressurevolume work The number of independent variables is constant it is independent of the species that are present and the number of phases It is important to appreciate that there is no conflict between Duhems theorem and the phaserule conclusion that degrees of freedom are required to specify an equilibrium state of a system containing specified phases When we say that specifying some pair of variables is sufficient to specify the state of a particular closed system undergoing reversible change we are describing a system that is continuously at equilibrium as it goes from a first equilibrium state to a second one Because it is closed and continuously in an equilibrium state the range of variation available to the system is circumscribed in such a way that specifying two variables is sufficient to specify its state On the other hand when we say that degrees of freedom are required to specify an equilibrium state of a system containing specified phases we mean that we must know the values of intensive variables in order to establish that the state of the system is an equilibrium state To illustrate the compatibility of these ideas and the distinction between them let us consider a closed system that contains nitrogen hydrogen and ammonia gasammonia gases In the presence of a catalyst the reaction occurs For simplicity let us assume that these gases behave ideally If the gases do not behave ideally the argument remains the same but more complex equations are required to express the equilibrium constant and the system pressure as functions of the molar composition This system has two components and three degrees of freedom When we say that the system is closed we mean that the total number of moles of the elements nitrogen and hydrogen are known and constant Let these be and respectively Letting the moles of ammonia present be the number of moles of dihydrogen and dinitrogen are and respectively If we know that this system is at equilibrium we know that the equilibrium constant relationship is satisfied We have where is the volume of the system The idealgas equilibrium constant is a function only of temperature We assume that we know this function therefore if we know the temperature we know the value of the equilibrium constant The pressure of the system can also be expressed as a function of and We have If we know the system pressure and we know that the system is at equilibrium we can solve the equations for and simultaneously to find the unknowns and From these we can calculate the molar composition of the system and the partial pressure of each of the gases We discuss idealgas equilibrium calculations in detail in Chapter Thus if we know that the system is at equilibrium knowledge of the pressure and temperature is sufficient to determine its composition and all of its other properties If we do not know that this system is at equilibrium but instead want to collect sufficient experimental data to prove that it is the phase rule asserts that we must find the values of some set of three intensive variables Two are not sufficient From the perspective provided by the equations developed above we can no longer use the equilibrium constant relationship to find and Instead our problem is to find the composition of the system by other means so that we can test for equilibrium by comparing the value of the quantity to the value of the equilibrium constant We could accomplish this goal by measuring the values of several different combinations of three intensive variables A convenient combination is pressure temperature and ammonia concentration When we rearrange the equation for the system pressure to it is easy to see that knowing P T and enables us to find the volume of the system Given the volume we can find the molar composition of the system and the partial pressure of each of the gases With these quantities in hand we can determine whether the equilibrium condition is satisfied
