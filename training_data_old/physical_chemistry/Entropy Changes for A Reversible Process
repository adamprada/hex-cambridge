Entropy Changes for A Reversible Process Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers Let us consider a closed system that undergoes a reversible change while in contact with its surroundings Since the change is reversible the portion of the surroundings that exchanges heat with the system is at the same temperature as the system From and the definition the entropy changes are and Evidently for any reversible process we have Note that these ideas are not sufficient to prove that the converse is true From only these ideas we cannot prove that for a process means that the process is reversible it remains possible that there could be a spontaneous process for which However our entropybased statement of the second law does assert that the converse is true that is necessary and sufficient for a process to be reversible In the next section we use the machinebased statement of the second law to show that for any spontaneous process in an isolated system We introduce heuristic arguments to infer that is not possible for a spontaneous process in an isolated system From this we show that for any spontaneous process and hence that is not possible for any spontaneous process We conclude that is sufficient to establish that the corresponding process is reversible
