Attributions The number of dimensions depends on the number of particles and the number of spatial and other dimensions needed to characterize the position and motion of each particle The number of dimensions also affects the number of quantum numbers that may be used to label eigenstates of the Hamiltonian The Schrödinger Equation Consider an electron of mass m and charge moving on a twodimensional surface that defines the plane eg perhaps an electron is constrained to the surface of a solid by a potential that binds it tightly to a narrow region in the direction but allows it to roam freely over a rectangular area in the plane and assume that the electron experiences a constant and not timevarying potential at all points in this plane For example if is negative it could reflect the binding energy of the electron relative to its energy in vacuum The pertinent time independent Schrödinger equation is The task at hand is to solve the above eigenvalue equation to determine the allowed energy states for this electron Because there are no terms in this equation that couple motion in the and directions eg no terms of the form or or separation of variables can be used to write as a product Substitution of this form into the Schrödinger equation followed by collecting together all dependent and all ydependent terms gives Since the first term contains no dependence and the second contains no dependence and because the right side of the equation is independent of both and both terms on the left must actually be constant these two constants are denoted and respectively realizing that they have units of energy This observation allows two separate Schrödinger equations to be written and The total energy can then be expressed in terms of these separate energies and from Solutions to the and Schrödinger equations are easily seen to be Two independent solutions are obtained for each equation because the and space Schrödinger equations are both second order differential equations ie a second order differential equation has two independent solutions Boundary Conditions The boundary conditions not the Schrödinger equation determine whether the eigenvalues will be discrete or continuous If the electron is entirely unconstrained within the plane the energies and can assume any values this means that the experimenter can inject the electron onto the plane with any total energy and any components and along the two axes as long as In such a situation one speaks of the energies along both coordinates as being in the continuum or not quantized In contrast if the electron is constrained to remain within a fixed area in the plane eg a rectangular or circular region then the situation is qualitatively different Constraining the electron to any such specified area gives rise to boundary conditions that impose additional requirements on the above and functions These constraints can arise for example if the potential becomes very large for values outside the region in which case the probability of finding the electron outside the region is very small Such a case might represent for example a situation in which the molecular structure of the solid surface changes outside the enclosed region in a way that is highly repulsive to the electron eg as in the case of molecular corrals on metal surfaces This case could then represent a simple model of socalled corrals in which the particle is constrained to a finite region of space For example if motion is constrained to take place within a rectangular region defined by then the continuity property that all wave functions must obey because of their interpretation as probability densities which must be continuous causes to vanish at and at That is because must vanish for and must vanish for and because is continuous it must vanish at and at Likewise must vanish at and at To implement these constraints for one must linearly combine the above two solutions and to achieve a function that vanishes at One is allowed to linearly combine solutions of the Schrödinger equation that have the same energy ie are degenerate because Schrödinger equations are linear differential equations An analogous process must be applied to to achieve a function that vanishes at Further requiring and to vanish respectively at and respectively gives equations that can be obeyed only if and assume particular values These equations are equivalent ie using to Knowing that vanishes at for although the function vanishes for this function vanishes for all or and is therefore unacceptable because it represents zero probability density at all points in space one concludes that the energies and can assume only values that obey or and and It is important to stress that it is the imposition of boundary conditions expressing the fact that the electron is spatially constrained that gives rise to quantized energies In the absence of spatial confinement or with confinement only at or or only at or quantized energies would not be realized In this example confinement of the electron to a finite interval along both the and coordinates yields energies that are quantized along both axes If the electron were confined along one coordinate eg between but not along the other ie is either restricted to vanish only at or at or at neither point then the total energy lies in the continuum its component is quantized but is not Analogs of such cases arise for example for a triatomic molecule containing one strong and one weak bond If the bond with the higher dissociation energy is excited to a level that is not enough to break it but that is in excess of the dissociation energy of the weaker bond one has a situation that is especially interesting In this case one has two degenerate states one with the strong bond having high internal energy and the weak bond having low energy and a second with the strong bond having little energy and the weak bond having more than enough energy to rupture it Although an experiment may prepare the molecule in a state that contains only the former component ie with coupling between the two degenerate functions induced by terms in the Hamiltonian H that have been ignored in defining and can cause the true wave function to acquire a component of the second function as time evolves In such a case one speaks of internal vibrational energy relaxation IVR giving rise to unimolecular decomposition of the molecule Energies and Wave Functions for Bound States For discrete energy levels the energies are specified functions that depend on quantum numbers one for each degree of freedom that is quantized Returning to the situation in which motion is constrained along both axes the resultant total energies and wave functions obtained by inserting the quantum energy levels into the expressions for and are as follows and with and The two factors are included to guarantee that is normalized Normalization allows to be properly identified as a probability density for finding the electron at a point Shown in Figure are plots of four such two dimensional wave functions for and values of and respectively Figure Plots of the and wave functions Note that the functions vanish on the boundaries of the box and notice how the number of nodes ie zeroes encountered as the wave function oscillates from positive to negative is related to the and quantum numbers and to the energy This pattern of more nodes signifying higher energy is one that we encounter again and again in quantum mechanics and is something the student should be able to use to guess the relative energies of wave functions when their plots are at hand Finally you should also notice that as in the onedimensional box case any attempt to classically interpret the probabilities corresponding to the above quantum wave functions will result in failure As in the onedimensional case the classical would be constant along slices of fixed and varying or slices of fixed and varying within the box because the speed is constant there However the quantum plots at least for small quantum numbers are not constant For large and ny values the quantum plots will again via the quantumclassical correspondence principle approach the constant classical form except near the classical turning points ie near the edges of the twodimensional box If instead of being confined to a rectangular corral the electron were constrained to lie within a circle of radius R the Schrödinger equation is more favorably expressed in polar coordinates Transforming the partial derivatives appearing in the Schrödinger equation into polar coordinates and realizing that the potential depends on but not on gives Again using separation of variables to substitute into the Schrödinger equation and dividing by we obtain where is the value of the potential inside the circular region The first two terms on the left and the on the right side contain no reference to so the quantity must be independent of Moreover because the coordinates and describe the same point in space must obey The solutions to the above differential equation for subject to the periodicity condition are This means that the equation for the radial part of the wave function is or This differential equation is probably not familiar to you but it turns out this is the equation obeyed by socalled Bessel functions The Bessel functions labeled obey so our function is The full wave functions are then where is a normalization constant The energy eigenvalues cannot be expressed analytically as in the particleina box system where we used knowledge of the zeros of the sin function to determine However knowing that must vanish at we can use tables for example see Kreyszig E Advanced Engineering Mathematics th ed John Wiley and Sons Inc New York that give the values of at which vanishes to determine the set of eigenvalues associated with each value of the angular momentum quantum number In the table shown below we list the first five values at which and vanish Values of at which vanish for and If we call the values at which vanishes then the energies are given as From the ordering of the values shown in the table above we can see that the ordering of the energy levels will be and so forth regardless of the size of the circle or the mass of the particle The state with has the same energy as that with likewise has the same energy as So all but the states are doubly degenerate the only difference between such pairs of states is the sense of the angular momentum terms These energy levels depend on both the angular momentum quantum number as well as the radial quantum number and they depend upon much like the particleinabox energies depend on the box length In Figure a we show plots of the probability densities for and and for and to illustrate how the number of radial nodes increases as increases Figure a Plots of for top middle and bottom Taken from Ellison M D J Chem Educ The character of also changes with For there is high amplitude for the particle being in the center of the circle but for there is no amplitude in the center This is analogous to what one finds for atomic orbitals orbitals have nonzero amplitude at the nucleus but p d and higher orbitals do not Lets examine a few more easy problems that can be solved analytically to some degree This will help illustrate how boundary conditions generate quantization and how the number of quantum numbers depends on the dimensionality of the problem When considering a particle of mass moving in three dimensions but constrained to remain within a sphere of radius R we replace the three Cartesian coordinates and by the spherical coordinates and Doing so changes the Schrödinger equations kinetic energy terms into what we show below Taking the potential to be a constant for and infinite for we can again use separation of variables to progress in solving this three dimensional differential equation We substitute into the Schrödinger equation and taking into account that the socalled spherical harmonic functions obey the following This reduces the Schrödinger equation to an equation for the radial function Again this equation is probably not familiar to you but it can be recast in a way that makes it equivalent to the equation obeyed by socalled spherical Bessel functions by taking The result is that the wave functions for this problem reduce to where is a normalization constant The energies are determined by requiring to vanish at which is analogous to insisting that the spherical Bessel function vanish at in the earlier problem we studied The values of at which vanish again can be found in various tabulations including that cited earlier Several of these values are tabulated below for illustration Values of at which vanish for and n n n n L L L L L From the values of one finds the energies from Again we see how the energy depends on the size of the constraining region characterized by very much in the same way as in the earlier systems We also see that depends on the angular momentum quantum number much as it did in the preceding example and on the mass of the particle However the energy ordering of these levels is different from what we have seen earlier as reflected in the ordering of the values shown in the above table The energies appear in the order and so on and this is true for any size sphere and any particle mass m If instead of being constrained to move within a spherical volume the particle is constrained to move on the surface of a sphere or radius the variable is fixed at and the Schrödinger equation becomes Using we can see that the wave functions are the spherical harmonics and the energies are given by Note that the energies depend on but not on the quantum number So each state belonging to level is fold degenerate because ranges from to Finally if instead of being constrained to move within a circle of radius R the particle were constrained to move on the surface of the circle the twodimensional Schrödinger equation treated earlier would reduce to The solutions are the familiar functions with and the energies are Note that the quantization of energy arises because the angular momentum is quantized to be this condition arose in turn by the condition that As with the case of a particle moving within the circular region the states with are doubly degenerate the difference between pairs of such states reflecting the sense of their angular momentum These model problems will be seen in Chapter to be very useful representations of situations that arise when an electron is constrained within or on the surface of various nanoscopic particles For now they were discussed to illustrate how separations of variables can sometimes be used to decompose the Schrödinger equation into onedimensional ordinary differential equations and to show how it is the boundary conditions either constraining to vanish at certain distances or insisting that be periodic when appropriate that produce the quantization It is important to note that it is when a particle is spatially constrained eg when its wave function was forced to vanish at two locations and that quantized energy levels result When the particle is not so spatially trapped its energy will not be quantized You will see this behavior over and over as we explore other models for electronic vibrational and rotational motions in molecules Quantized Action Can Also be Used to Derive Energy Levels There is another approach that can be used to find energy levels and is especially straightforward to use for systems whose Schrödinger equations are separable The socalled classical action denoted of a particle moving with momentum p along a path leading from initial coordinate at initial time to a final coordinate at time is defined by Here the momentum vector p contains the momenta along all coordinates of the system and the coordinate vector likewise contains the coordinates along all such degrees of freedom For example in the twodimensional particleinabox problem considered above has two components as does and the action integral is In computing such actions it is essential to keep in mind the sign of the momentum as the particle moves from its initial to its final positions The examples given below will help clarify these matters and will show how to apply the idea For systems for which the Hamiltonian is separable the action integral decomposes into a sum of such integrals one for each degree of freedom In the twodimensional example the additivity of H means that and can be independently solved for in terms of the potentials and as well as the energies and associated with each separate degree of freedom the signs on and must be chosen to properly reflect the motion that the particle is actually undergoing at any instant of time Substituting these expressions into the action integral yields The relationship between these classical action integrals and the existence of quantized energy levels has been shown to involve equating the classical action for motion that is periodic between a left and right turning point as for a classical particle undergoing periodic vibrational motion to the following multiple of Plancks constant where the quantization index ranges from to in steps of unity Alternatively for motion in a closed angular path as for a particle moving on a circular or elliptical path the action quantization condition reads where again ranges from to in steps of unity When actionquantization as described above is applied to the socalled harmonic oscillator problem this serves as the simplest reasonable model for vibration of a diatomic molecule AB that we will study in quantum form later one expresses the total energy as the sum of kinetic and potential energies where is the reduced mass of the AB diatomic molecule is the force constant describing the bond between A and B is the bondlength displacement and p is the momentum associated with the bond length The quantized action requirement then reads This integral is carried out between and the left and right turning points of the oscillatory motion and back again to form a closed path Carrying out this integral and equating it to gives the following expression for the energy If the quantum number is allowed to assume integer values ranging from to infinity these energy levels agree with the full quantum treatments results that we will obtain later For an example of applying this approach to a problem involving motion along a closed loop lets consider the free ie with no potential affecting its angular motion rotation of a diatomic molecule AB having fixed bond length R The rotational energy can be written as where is the momentum associated with rotation and is the reduced mass of the AB molecule Solving for and inserting this into the actionquantization equation appropriate for motion along a closed loop gives Solving for the energy then gives which is exactly the same result as we obtained earlier when solving the Schrödinger equation for the motion of a particle moving on a circle Now lets apply action quantization to each of the independent coordinates of the twodimensional particle in a box problem The two separate action quantization conditions read Notice that the sign of the momenta are positive in each of the first integrals appearing above because the particle is moving from to and analogously for motion and thus has positive momentum and negative in each of the second integrals because the motion is from to and analogously for motion and thus the particle has negative momentum Within the region bounded by the potential is constant and can be taken as zero this just gives our reference point for total energy Using this fact and reversing the upper and lower limits and thus the sign in the second integrals above one obtains Solving for and one finds These are not the same quantized energy levels that arose when the wave function boundary conditions were matched at and In the Schrödinger equation approach the energy expressions did not have the factor that appears in the above actionbased result It turns out that for potentials that are defined in a piecewise manner as the particleinabox potential is ie the potential undergoes an infinite jump at and the action quantization condition has to be modified An example of how and why one has to make this modification is given in a paper from Prof Bill Millers group J E Adams and W H Miller J Chem Phys but I will not discuss it further here because its details are beyond the level of this text Suffice it to say that for periodic motion between two turning points on a smooth ie nonpiecewise potential is the correct action quantization value For angular motion on a closed loop nh is the proper value But for periodic motion between turning points on a piecewise potential the modifications discussed in the above reference must be applied to cause action quantization to reproduce the correct quantum result The use of action quantization as illustrated above has become a very important tool It has allowed scientists to make great progress toward bridging the gap between classical and quantum descriptions of molecular dynamics In particular by using classical concepts such as trajectories and then imposing quantizedaction conditions people have been able to develop socalled semiclassical models of molecular dynamics In such models one is able to retain a great deal of classical understanding while building in quantum effects such as energy quantization zeropoint energies and interferences Both at my Theory Page web site and from papers accessed on the web site of Professor William H Miller one of the pioneers of semiclassical theory as applied to chemistry you can learn more about this subject Before leaving this section it is worth discussing a bit more the energy and angular momentum quantization that occurs when treating free onedimensional rotational motion of a particle on a circle or a linear rigid molecule constrained to lie on a plane When we used action quantization to address this kind of problem we obtained quantized energies which through the energy expression given in terms of angular momentum implies that the angular momentum itself is quantized This is the same result we obtain when we seek eigenfunctions and eigenvalues the quantum mechanics angular momentum operator As we showed earlier this operator when computed as the component of can be written in polar coordinates as The eigenfunctions of this operator have the form and the eigenvalues are a h Because geometries with azimuthal angles equal to or equal to are exactly the same geometries the function should be exactly the same as This can only be the case if a is an integer Thus one concludes that only integral multiples of h can be allowed values of the component of angular momentum Experimentally one measures the component of an angular momentum by placing the system possessing the angular momentum in a magnetic field of strength B and observing how many component energy states arise This splitting in energy levels is termed the Zeeman effect For example a boron atom with one unpaired electron its orbital has one unit of orbital angular momentum so one finds three separate component values which are usually denoted and Another example is offered by the scandium atom with one unpaired electron in a d orbital this atoms states split into five component states In each case one finds values of the quantum number and because L is an integer is an odd integer Both of these observations are consistent with the expectation that only integer values can occur for eigenvalues as obtained from action quantization and from the boundary condition However it has been observed that some species do not possess or or or component states but an even number of such states In particular electrons protons or neutrons are observed to have only two component eigenvalues This also is observed in for example the Boron atom mentioned above if one examines the further splittings of the m and levels caused by the magnetic fields action on the unpaired electrons spin Because as we discuss later in this text all angular momenta have component eigenvalues that are separated from one another by unit multiples of h one is forced to conclude that these three fundamental buildingblock particles electrons protons and neutrons have component eigenvalues of and The appearance of halfintegral angular momenta is not consistent with the actionquantization result or the observation made earlier that and correspond to exactly the same physical point in coordinate space which in turn implies that only fullinteger angular momenta are possible The resolution of the above paradox ie how can halfinteger angular momenta exist involves realizing that some angular momenta correspond not to the angular momenta of a physical mass rotating but instead are intrinsic properties of certain particles That is the intrinsic angular momenta of electrons protons and neutrons can not be viewed as arising from rotation of some mass that comprises these particles Instead such intrinsic angular momenta are fundamental built in characteristics of these particles For example the two and angular momentum states of an electron usually denoted a and b respectively are two internal states of the electron that are degenerate in the absence of a magnetic field but which represent two distinct states of the electron Analogously a proton has and states as do neutrons All such halfintegral angular momentum states cannot be accounted for using classical mechanics but are known to arise in quantum mechanics This means that when we teach introductory chemistry to young students it is not correct to say that the up and down a and b spin states of an electron can be viewed in terms of the electrons mass spinning clockwise or counterclockwise around some axis Such spinningmass angular momenta can only possess integer values halfinteger angular momenta cannot and should not be described in terms of spinning masses Action Can Also be Used to Generate Wave Functions Action integrals computed from classical descriptions of motion on potential energy surfaces can also be used to generate approximate quantum wave functions So doing offers yet another avenue for making connection between the classical and quantum worlds To see how such a connection can arise directly from the Schrödinger equation we begin with the timeindependent Schrödinger equation for a single particle of mass moving on a potential that depends on the particles position coordinates Then we express the complex wave function as a constant real amplitude A multiplied by a complex phase which we write as Substituting this expression for into the Schrödinger equation gives an equation for This equation contains both real and imaginary components nb itself is complex It is usually solved by assuming can be expanded in a power series in the variable This expansion is motivated by noting that if the factor in the above equation is neglected the resulting equation would make sense if were equal to the classical momentum of the particle So taking the limit of the equation for appears to reduce this quantum mechanics equation to a classical result in which So substituting into the above equation for and gathering together all terms of a given power in produces equations for the various the first two of which read and To simplify further discussion of this socalled semiclassical wave function theory let us restrict attention to the case in which there is only one spatial coordinate For the two or threedimensional cases and are vector quantities and the solution of these equations is considerably more complicated especially if the potential can not be separated into additive contributions from each of the variables When there is only one spatial coordinate and are scalar quantities The first equation can be solved for and gives two independent solutions ie those corresponding to the sign each of which will be real when ie in classically allowed regions of space and imaginary when ie in classically forbidden regions Notice that contains an integrand equal to the classical momentum The equation for can also be solved So through firstorder in the semiclassical wave functions are These pairs of wave functions are often expressed as in regions of space where and in the classically forbidden regions where Notice that the wave functions in the classically allowed regions have probability densities given by which is exactly the classical probability density we discussed earlier in this Chapter The probability is inversely proportional to the speed of the particle at location r and has the same singularity as the classical probability at turning points where In contrast the probability densities in regions where either grow or decay exponentially within these classically forbidden regions Lets see how these semiclassical wave functions can be applied to some of the model problems we discussed earlier For the one dimensional particleinabox problem the two exponentially growing and decaying functions are not needed because in the regions and the wave function can be taken to vanish Within the region there are two independent wave functions and the potential is constant lets call the potential in this region So the integration appearing in these two wave functions can be carried out to give We can combine these two functions to generate a function that will vanish at as it must for this particleinabox problem We can then use the condition that must also vanish at to obtain an equation that specifies the energies that are allowed which means that These energies are exactly the same as we found when we solved the Schrödinger equation for this model problem It is informative to note that these semiclassical wave functions which are not exact because they were obtained by retaining only terms up to the first power of were able to generate quantum nodal patterns ie interferences and quantized energy levels even though they contained classical concepts such as the momentum at various positions in space It was by superimposing two functions having the same energy that nodal patterns were obtained Lets now consider what happens when we apply the semiclassical wave function to the harmonic oscillator problem also discussed earlier In this case there are two classical turning points and at which The semiclassical wave functions appropriate to the three regions two classically forbidden and one classically allowed are The first two decay exponentially within the two classically forbidden regions The third is a combination of the two independent solutions within the classically allowed region with the amplitudes of the two solutions defined by the coefficients and The amplitudes and multiply the wave functions in the two classically forbidden regions and all four amplitudes as well as the energy must be determined by i normalizing the total wave function to obey and by matching the wave functions and and their first derivatives at and the wave functions and and their first derivatives at Before addressing how this wave function matching might be accomplished let me point out an interesting property of the factor entering into the exponential of the semiclassical wave function We first use the two expressions and given above for the first two components of and then make use of the harmonic form of Next we evaluate the integral of for a closed classical path in which the system moves from the left turning point to the right turning point and back again to the left turning point The contribution from integrating along this closed path is nb the sign is used for the first part of the path because the particle has positive momentum and the sign applies to the return part of the path when the particle has negative momentum which is exactly the action integral we treated earlier in this Chapter when we computed for the classical harmonic oscillator The contribution from integrating along this closed path can be evaluated by first writing The integral from to of this quantity can be carried out using the substitution as The evaluation of the integral remaining on the righthand side can be done using contour integration undergraduate students may not have encountered this subject within complex variable theory I refer them to pp Methods of Theoretical Physics P M Morse and H Feshabach McGrawHill New York or p Applied Complex Variables J W Dettman Macmillan Co New York The basic equation from contour integration says that an integral of the form where is a singularity is equal to Our integral has singularities at and at so there are two such contributions The net result is that our integral reduces to So the contribution to the integral of arising from to is equal to The integral from back to gives another factor or Combining the integral of and the integral of multiplied by because gives the following final result If the original Bohr quantization is applied to the integral of along a closed classical path our result above then says that which is the same as This means that the factor that arises in the action quantization condition for periodic motions between two turning points can be viewed as arising from the first quantum correction ie the term first order in to the semiclassical wave function Recall that equating this classical action integral to gave the correct ie quantum energies for this harmonic oscillator problem We have seen how a semiclassical wave function can be defined what its spatial probability density is how it can build in interference to achieve proper nodal patterns and how quantizing its action can give the correct allowed energy levels However there is one issue we have not fully addressed To solve for the coefficients multiplying the semiclassical wave functions in the classically allowed and forbidden regions the wave functions and and their first derivatives must be matched at and the wave functions and and their first derivatives must be matched at Unfortunately the details of this matching process are rather complicated and require examining in more detail the nature of the wave functions near the classical turning points where each of and contain factors of the form in their denominators It should be clear that matching functions and their derivatives that contain such singularities pose special challenges I will not go further into this matter here rather I refer the interested reader to pp of Quantum Mechanics rd Ed L I Schiff McGrawHill New York for a good treatment of this socalled WKB approach to the matching issue
