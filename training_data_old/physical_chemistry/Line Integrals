and inexact differential expressions comes into focus when we use the differential to find how the quantity changes when the system passes from the state defined by to the state defined by We suppose that the system undergoes this change along some continuous path in the plane We can specify such a path as a function where is a constant or as Whether the differential is exact or inexact we can sum up increments of change along short segments of the path to find the change in between and Let and be two neighboring points on the curve As the system traverses between these points the change in is If we sum up such increments of along the curve from to the sum approximates the change in along this path In the limit that all of the incremental and become arbitrarily small the approximation becomes exact The limit of this sum is called the line integral of along the path between and Whether is exact or inexact the line integral of is defined along any continuous path in the plane If the path is and it connects the points and in the plane we designate the value of the line integral as any differential expression However if is exact we know that In this case the line integral of along curve between these points has the value for exact differential Because the value of the line integral depends only on the values of at the end points of the integration path the line integral of the total differential is independent of the path It follows that the line integral of an exact differential around any closed path must be zero A circle in the middle of the integral sign is often used to indicate that the line integral is being taken around a closed path In this notation writing indicates that is exact and is a state function In concept the evaluation of line integrals is straightforward Since the path of integration is a line the integrand involves only one dimension A line integral can always be expressed using a single variable of integration Three approaches to the evaluation of line integrals are noteworthy If we are free to choose an arbitrary path we can choose the twosegment path Along the first segment is constant at so we can evaluate the change in as Along the second segment is constant at so we can evaluate the change in as Then If the path is readily solved for as a function of say substitution converts the differential expression into a function of only Integration of this expression from to gives The path can always be expressed as a parametric function of a dummy variable That is we can always find functions and such that and Then substitution converts the differential expression into a function of Integration of this expression from to gives While the line integral of an exact differential between two points is independent of the path of integration this not the case for an inexact differential For an inexact differential the integral between two points depends on the path of integration To illustrate these ideas let us consider some examples These examples illustrate methods for finding the integral of a differential along a particular path They illustrate also the pathindependence of the integral of an exact differential and the pathdependence of the integral of an inexact differential Example An exact Differential We begin by considering the function for which Since exists must be exact Let us integrate between the points and along four different paths sketched in Figure that we denote as paths a b c and d Figure Paths a b c and d Path a has two linear segments The first segment is the portion of the line from to Along this segment The second segment is portion of the line from to Along the second segment Path b has two linear segments also The first segment is the portion of the line from to Along the first segment The second segment is portion of the line from to Along the second segment Path c is the line from to and for which Path d is the line which we can express in parametric form as and At At Also and The integrals along these paths are Path a Path b Path c Path d beginalign int_d dfintt_t leftt t t t right dt pt intt_t leftt t t t rightdt pt lefttttttright_ endalign The integrals along all four paths are the same The value is which as required is the difference Example An inexact Differential Now let us consider the differential expression This expression has the form of a total differential but we will see that there is no function for which this expression is the total differential That is is an inexact differential If we integrate over the same four paths we find Path a beginalign int_adhintx_x leftrightdxinty_y y dy pt leftxright_leftyright_ pt endalign Path b beginalign int_bdhintx_xleftrightdxinty_yleftrightleftrighty dy pt leftxright_leftyright_ pt

frac endalign For the value of the integral depends on the path of integration confirming that is an inexact differential Since the value of the integral depends on path there can be no for which That is cannot have four different values
