Maxwells Derivation of the Gasvelocity Probabilitydensity Function Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers To this point we have been developing our ability to characterize the gasvelocity distribution functions We now want to use Maxwells argument to find them We have already introduced the first step which is the recognition that threedimensional probabilitydensity functions can be expressed as products of independent onedimensional functions and that and are the constants and Now because the probability density associated with any given velocity is just a number that is independent of the coordinate system we can equate the threedimensional probabilitydensity functions for Cartesian and spherical coordinates so that We take the partial derivative of this last equation with respect to The probability densities and are independent of However is a function of because We find Since and Making this substitution and dividing by the original equation gives Cancellation and rearrangement of the result leads to an equation in which the independent variables and are separated This means that each term must be equal to a constant which we take to be We find so that and From the first of these equations we obtain the probability density function for the distributions of onedimensional velocities See Section The threedimensional probability density function can be deduced from the onedimensional function See Section From the second equation we obtain the threedimensional probabilitydensity function directly Integrating from where has a fixed value to an arbitrary scalar velocity where the scalarvelocity function is we have or The probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity becomes This is the result we want except that it contains the unknown parameters and The value of must be such as to make the integral over all velocities equal to unity We require so that where we use the definite integral See Appendix D The scalarvelocity function in the threedimensional probabilitydensity function becomes The probabilitydensity function for the scalar velocity becomes The threedimensional probability density in spherical coordinates becomes The probability that an arbitrarily selected molecule has a velocity vector whose magnitude lies between and while its component lies between and and its component lies between and becomes In Section we again derive Boyles law and use the ideal gas equation to show that
