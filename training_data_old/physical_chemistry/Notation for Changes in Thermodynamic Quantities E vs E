Notation for Changes in Thermodynamic Quantities E vs E Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers From the outset of our study of energy we recognize that we are always dealing with energy changes Even when we write to indicate that energy is a function of and we recognize that represents the energy difference between the state of the system characterized by and and the state of the system when the independent variables correspond to a reference state in which by definition As we observe in we can sort thermodynamic variables into two classes Some like and can be measured only for a system Others like and can be measured only for a process To say that the volume of a system is one cubic meter has absolute significance To say that the energy of a system is one joule means nothing unless we know the reference state When we intend to specify that the reference state for energy is the particular state specified by and we write Otherwise when we write we could equally well write We intend either of these formulations to mean the same thing as and Whether we write or the quantity represented is the difference in energy between some initial and some final state When we focus on very small changes we can write or If our perspective is that we are describing a process we may prefer to write if our perspective is that we are describing a change in the system we may prefer to write In practice our choice depends primarily on what we have grown accustomed to in the context at hand In the discussion above we write We could equally well write The meaning is the same We can make similar statements about most thermodynamic functions Often there is no particular reason to prefer over or vice versa However there are circumstances in which the delta notation serves particular purposes If a system undergoes a change in which some thermodynamic variables remain constant the delta notation provides a convenient way to indicate that a particular variable is not constant For example if the volume of a system changes while the applied pressure remains constant we write Similarly we often want to describe processes in which some state functions are different in the final state than they are in the initial state while other state functions are the same in both states but not necessarily constant throughout the process In the next few chapters we develop properties of the state functions entropy enthalpy and Gibbs free energy We define the Gibbs free energy by the relationship To specify the relationship among the changes in these state functions when the final temperature is the same as the initial temperature we write Here too we often say that this relationship relates the changes in and when the temperature is constant This is another useful but potentially misleading figure of speech It is important to remember that the equation is valid for any path between the same two states even if the temperature varies wildly along that path so long as the initial and final states are at the same temperature Finally we find it convenient to use subscripted versions of the delta notation to specify particular kinds of processes For a process in which one mole of a pure substance vaporizes to its gas at a particular temperature we write and to denote the changes in enthalpy and Gibbs free energy respectively We can write to denote the change in the energy however is not a quantity that we find useful very often Similarly for the fusion and sublimation of one mole of a pure substance at a particular temperature we write and We also find it convenient to write and to denote the changes in these quantities when a chemical reaction occurs When we do so it is essential that we specify the corresponding stoichiometric equation
