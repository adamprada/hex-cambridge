Outcomes Events and Probability Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers We also need to introduce the idea that a function that successfully models the results of past experiments can be used to predict some of the characteristics of future results We reason as follows We have results from drawing many samples of a random variable from some distribution We suppose that a mathematical representation has been found that adequately summarizes the results of these experiences If the underlying distributionthe physical system in scientific applicationsremains the same we expect that a long series of future results would give rise to essentially the same mathematical representation If of many previous results have had a particular characteristic we expect that of a large number of future trials will have the same characteristic We also say that there is one chance in four that the next individual result will have this characteristic when we say this we mean that of a large number of future trials will have this characteristic and the next trial has as good a chance as any other to be among those that do The probability that an outcome will occur in the future is equal to the frequency with which that outcome has occurred in the past Given a distribution the possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive in any given trial the random variable can have only one of its possible values Consequently a discrete distribution is completely described when the probability of each of its outcomes is specified Many distributions are comprised of a finite set of N mutually exclusive possible outcomes If each of these outcomes is equally likely the probability that we will observe any particular outcome in the next trial is We often find it convenient to group the set of possible outcomes into subsets in such a way that each outcome is in one and only one of the subsets We say that such assignments of outcomes to subsets are exhaustive because every possible outcome is assigned to some subset we say that such assignments are mutually exclusive because no outcome belongs to more than one subset We call each such subset an event When we partition the possible outcomes into exhaustive and mutually exclusive events we can say the same things about the probabilities of events that we can say about the probabilities of outcomes In our discussions the term events will always refer to an exhaustive and mutually exclusive partitioning of the possible outcomes Distinguishing between outcomes and events just gives us some language conventions that enable us to create alternative groupings of the same set of real world observations Suppose that we define a particular event to be a subset of outcomes that we denote as U If in a large number of trials the fraction of outcomes that belong to this subset is F we say that the probability is F that the outcome of the next trial will belong to this event To express this in more mathematical notation we write When we do so we mean that the fraction of a large number of future trials that belong to this subset will be F and the next trial has as good a chance as any other to be among those that do In a sample comprising M observations the best forecast we can make of the number of occurrences of U is and we call this the expected number of occurrences of U in a sample of size M The idea of grouping real world observations into either outcomes or events is easy to remember if we keep in mind the example of tossing a die The die has six faces which are labeled with or dots The dots distinguish one face from another On any given toss one face of the die must land on top Therefore there are six possible outcomes Since each face has as good a chance as any other of landing on top the six possible outcomes are equally probable The probability of any given outcome is If we ask about the probability that the next toss will result in one of the evennumbered faces landing on top we are asking about the probability of an eventthe event that the next toss will have the characteristic that an evennumbered face lands on top Let us call this event That is event occurs if the outcome is a a or a These are three of the six equally likely outcomes Evidently the probability of this event is Having defined event as the probability of an evennumber outcome we still have several alternative ways to assign the oddnumber outcomes to events One assignment would be to say that all of the oddnumber outcomes belong to a second eventthe event that the outcome is odd The events even outcome and odd outcome are exhaustive and mutually exclusive We could create another set of events by assigning the outcomes and to event and the outcome to event Events and are also exhaustive and mutually exclusive We have a great deal of latitude in the way we assign the possible outcomes to events If it suits our purposes we can create many different exhaustive and mutually exclusive partitionings of the outcomes of a given distribution We require that each partitioning of outcomes into events be exhaustive and mutually exclusive because we want to apply the laws of probability to events
